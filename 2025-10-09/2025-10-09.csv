            After months of delays and disappointments, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his plan for peace in Gaza.
    


            Although Trump's short post on Truth Social represented a major diplomatic breakthrough, it leaves much to be decided.
    


            A ceasefire could come into effect as soon as Friday, and Israeli hostages could be released early next week, but it is not clear whether Israel and Hamas will agree to other conditions proposed by Trump relating to thornier questions of what Gaza will look like after the war.
    


            Here's what we know about the deal so far.
    


            The US president broke news of an agreement on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying it would lead to the swift release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed line.
    


            “This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen,” Trump wrote. “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a meeting of his security cabinet on Thursday to vote on the agreement. That decision is expected later in the day. Netanyahu is then set to chair a full government meeting to approve the deal. Once approved, a ceasefire in Gaza will begin, two Israeli officials told CNN.
    


            With a ceasefire in place, Israeli forces will begin their partial withdrawal from Gaza, expected to take less than 24 hours. There will also be a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli High Court. Once this objection window closes, Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the officials added.
    


            An Israeli source said the assumption is that hostages will be released before these 72 hours pass. Trump said Thursday that they should be released on Monday or Tuesday.
    


            Under the plan, all the living hostages are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period.
    


            Twenty hostages are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. A further 28 hostages are deceased. CNN previously reported Hamas may not be able to find them all.
    


            Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said that 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences will also be released, along with 1,700 others held in Israeli jails.
    


            But an Israeli source familiar with the matter said negotiating teams are still working on the list of prisoners to be released and that the issue “has not yet been resolved.” The source said that any prisoner convicted of murder would not be released to the occupied West Bank and that their transfer to a third country had not yet been determined.
    


Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian political leader who has been imprisoned by Israel since 2002, will not be released, the Israeli government spokesperson said.
    


            Even if the ceasefire takes effect and Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners are released, the warring parties have not agreed to major sticking points tackled in Trump's more comprehensive 20-point plan released last month.
    


• Disarmament: Trump's plan called for Hamas to “commit to peaceful co-existence” with Israel and lay down its arms. Hamas members who comply will be given amnesty under the plan. Disarmament has long been a red line for the militant group.
    


•  Post-war governance: The plan also called for a temporary transitional government to be established in Gaza, comprising a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts” and supervised by “a new international transitional body” called the Board of Peace.
    


            Trump appeared to reference this board during an interview with Fox News, saying that his administration was “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict in the region.
    


            But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza.
    


•  ﻿Israeli withdrawal: Trump's plan also called for the creation of an “International Stabilization Force (ISF)” to be deployed to Gaza and train “vetted Palestinian police forces” in Gaza. With this force in place, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would then be expected to withdraw from Gaza. Israel has not yet agreed to these provisions.
    


• Security guarantees: Hamas has long sought concrete assurances that Israel will not resume the war once it ends, pointing to how Israel shattered the last ceasefire agreement in March. If Hamas agrees to disarm, it is likely to demand even more robust security guarantees, but it is not clear whether Israel will agree to them.
    


            If the ceasefire holds and Israel withdraws to the agreed-upon line in Gaza, the hostages could be released Monday. That timeline is uncertain, however, and the release could happen sooner.
    


            Whereas small groups of hostages have been released each week under previous ceasefires, Trump has insisted that all hostages be released at once.
    


            Netanyahu's cabinet meeting will only discuss the first phase of the ceasefire deal and not Trump's full framework, according to an Israeli source.
    


            Implementing the full framework of Trump's plan would likely spark a revolt among the hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition. Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, two far-right ministers, say Trump's plan represents a defeat for Israel and could threaten government stability if the peace plan progresses.
    


            Meanwhile, Trump told Axios reporter and CNN analyst Barak Ravid that he plans to travel to Israel in the coming days. “They want me to give a speech at the Knesset,” he said.

            • Israel's security cabinet is meeting to vote on the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire plan, to be followed by a full cabinet vote. The deal between Israel and Hamas would allow for the release of all hostages in Gaza, Israeli withdrawal to an agreed point and the release of some Palestinian prisoners.
    


            • A ceasefire will take effect immediately following the Israeli government's approval, according to officials. A senior Hamas official said a “formal declaration” ending the war in Gaza must be made before hostages are released.
    


            • US President Donald Trump said the hostages are likely to be released early next week, and he is still aiming to travel to the region soon.
    


            • The plan has been met with both celebration and cautious optimism in Gaza and Israel. Potential sticking points remain, including Hamas disarmament and the governance of Gaza.
    


            President Donald Trump projected optimism that outstanding issues not covered by phase one of his Gaza ceasefire agreement will be sorted out, even as he declined to take a position on an eventual Palestinian state and acknowledged Hamas may not be able to produce all the bodies of deceased hostages.
    


            “There will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there will be a lot of things happening,” he said, referring to arrangements that would force Hamas to give up its weapons and Israel's military to pull back further inside Gaza.
    


            “I think it will take place, and I think you can end up with peace in the Middle East, but we have to get our hostages back. And we weren't going to do it at the end. We're going to do it at the beginning,” he went on, explaining the sequencing of the plan.
    


            Trump stopped short of saying Palestinians would be allowed to remain inside Gaza, suggesting instead his plans included rebuilding the enclave into a livable area.
    


            “We're going to create something where people can live. You can't live right now in Gaza,” he said.
    


            And he said he would go along with whatever is agreed to on a Palestinian state, declining to endorse an eventual two-state solution.
    


            When asked about Hamas's ability to locate all bodies of the deceased hostages, Trump conceded that some “are going to be a little bit hard to find.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's presentation to Arab leaders at the United Nations General Assembly last month was a key turning point in efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
    


            Rubio credited Trump's “close relationships” with the regional leaders that were “forged” during his trip to the Middle East earlier this year, but said the UN meeting turned the tide.
    


                    “You convened a historic meeting, not simply of Arab countries, but of Muslim-majority countries from around the world — including Indonesia was there, Pakistan was there — and created this coalition behind this plan,” Rubio said in highly laudatory remarks at a Cabinet meeting today.
                





            “Then on that following Monday, you met with the Prime Minister of Israel here, and that plan was presented. And then, of course, our great negotiating team followed up on it,” he said.
    


            Rubio said Trump “had some extraordinary phone calls and meetings that required a high degree of intensity and commitment, and made this happen.” He did not say with whom the phone calls and meetings were held.
    


            Rubio also commended Special Envoy Steve Wiktoff and Jared Kushner.
    


            “They're an incredible team working together, facing some substantial impediments to even being there this weekend and doing it,” he said.
    


            Nepal is calling for the release of the hostages held in Gaza, including Nepali national Bipin Joshi, under the first phase of a ceasefire plan.
    


            “We call for the immediate release of all hostages, including Nepali national Bipin Joshi, who has been held by Hamas since 7 October 2023,” Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.
    


            Joshi's father, Mahananda Joshi, told CNN that he was “hopeful” for his son following news of the plan.
    


            Joshi was a student working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped on October 7.
    


            Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs voiced appreciation for mediators in negotiating a plan to release the hostages and called for its implementation.
    


            “We urge all parties concerned to implement the plan in its true spirit, to ensure the smooth flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza, and to pave the way for lasting peace in the region and beyond,” the ministry said on X.
    


            We are hearing more from Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who congratulated President Donald Trump on his “tireless efforts” to bring an end to the war in Gaza, after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire plan drafted by US officials.
    


            The Egyptian president expressed “deep appreciation” for his US counterpart in a statement today, complimenting Trump's “keenness, endeavors, and sincere efforts towards peace.”
    


            El-Sisi reiterated that Trump “therefore deserves to receive the Nobel Peace Prize,” echoing the US president's open ambition to win the highly coveted award.
    


                    “The President stressed the need to proceed with implementing the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip in all its stages, emphasizing the importance of President Trump's support and sponsorship of its implementation,” the statement from el-Sisi's office said.
                





            El-Sisi hosted three days of talks between Israel and Hamas — brokered by US, Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish officials — in a diplomatic squeeze that saw all parties make a promising step toward a permanent end to two years of hostilities.
    


            Substantive discussions have not yet begun over what comes next for the war-torn Gaza Strip, with all eyes on the implementation of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, an Israeli official and another regional source told CNN.
    


            The negotiators in Egypt this week set up committees on multiple tracks to tackle the next steps in the overall plan, the regional source said. But active discussions on those topics — including the complicated issues of disarming Hamas and putting a governing body into place in Gaza — will begin after the first phase of the deal, with the hostage release taking place in the coming days, the source added.
    


Remember: The 20-point proposal for a comprehensive end to the Gaza conflict, which President Donald Trump laid out in recent weeks, includes a specific reference to a Palestinian committee, overseen by an international body and dubbed the “Board of Peace.” It will run Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is ready to take over, according to the plan. The proposal recognizes the aspiration for a Palestinian state and tries to present a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza.
    


            The plan also says that the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip will “proceed without interference from the two parties.” Humanitarian officials who have been involved in overseeing the distribution of such aid say that they have been preparing for a potential surge into Gaza, given the plan that Trump laid out, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. But they do not know when that surge will begin, they said.
    


            The head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom said the emerging Gaza ceasefire deal is a welcome “first step” for Palestinians but questioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to fully end the war.
    


                    “Netanyahu is simply maneuvering and he's just waiting for another opportunity for a loophole somewhere to come back to this. I don't see him taking a decision to end the entire war and to withdraw his forces,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot told CNN's Becky Anderson.
                





            “And that's why we want to make sure that while we take that deep sigh of relief, we also keep that pressure, that work to make sure that we keep going in the direction of ending the whole war,” he added, arguing that the driver of that pressure must be US President Donald Trump.
    


            Zomlot is a senior member of Fatah, the main Palestinian political movement rivalling Hamas, and a strategic adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
    


            Pressed repeatedly on whether he believes Hamas will fully disarm and have no role in Gaza, a key stipulation of Trump's 20-point plan for a comprehensive peace, Zomlot signaled Hamas accepted those terms.
    


            “My understanding is that Hamas accepted long ago and confirmed in that agreement that they will have no role in the governance in Gaza,” he said.
    


            Zomlot voiced support for reforming the Palestinian Authority, as laid out in Trump's plan, describing it as a grassroots Palestinian demand.
    


            Palestinians in Gaza were pictured celebrating a potential ceasefire in the enclave on Thursday, while others spoke to CNN about the bittersweet prospect of peace after two y﻿ears of brutal war.
    


            A small group of Palestinians in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp danced and sang on Thursday, while waving Palestinian flags. One man held aloft a cardboard key, a common symbol for Palestinian refugees, many of whom still hold the keys to the homes their ancestors left behind when Israel expelled them in 1948.
    


                    “I feel joy,” Nour al-Din Toutah told CNN. Originally from Zeitoun, he was displaced to Deir al-Balah over the course of the war. “Two years of torment and repression, displacement and lack of food and water. Now, I am happy that the war will stop.”
                





            “True, there are no houses left,” Toutah continued. “but we will put up new tents and continue our lives.”
    


            Humam al-Hattab said that the joy in Gaza at the news that the killing may finally end is “indescribable,” but compared the looming task Palestinians face in rebuilding their lives to another war.
    


                    “My feeling is joy mixed with great pain,” al-Hattab said, “As a Palestinian I will certainly be happy at the end of the war – but the end of the war is the start of other wars: the war of reconstruction and the attempt to return to their areas, repairing homes and restoring them to what they were before the war, the war of reopening schools and the war of restoring hospitals that the occupation destroyed.”
                





            President Donald Trump pointed to the importance of strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as he praised how countries came together to work on a ceasefire deal in Gaza.
    


            “I think the attack was very important on Iran, because let's say that didn't happen, they'd probably, by now, have a nuclear weapon, numerous nuclear weapons, and therefore, even if we signed a deal, there'd be a big dark cloud over it, and it wouldn't be the same thing,” Trump said, during his Cabinet meeting on Thursday.
    


            Israel first struck Iran's nuclear facilities on June 13. That same month, the US attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, leaving them “severely damaged.”



                    “So Iran is different, but Iran wants to work on peace,” Trump continued. “Now they've informed us, and they've acknowledged that they are totally in favor of this deal. They think it's a great thing, so we appreciate that, and we'll work with Iran,” Trump said.
                





            He added that he'd like to see Iran rebuild its country, but that it can't have nuclear power.
    


            The son of Amiram Cooper, an 85-year-old Israeli hostage who the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said was killed in captivity, said he is “extremely encouraged” by the potential release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza under the terms of a ceasefire deal.
    


            Cooper was abducted with his wife Nurit from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Nurit was released in October 2023. In June 2024, the IDF informed the families of Cooper and three other hostages that they had died.
    


            His son Rotem Cooper said today that he is appreciative of the “tremendous effort” to release the hostages who remain in Gaza, including his father's body.
    


            He told CNN's Becky Anderson that he has “mixed feelings.”
    


                    “I felt that the Israeli government failed to bring about his release when it was still relevant for him,” Rotem Cooper said. “But we try to put that aside today because really it was even hard to imagine this day, just a week or two ago.”
                





            “We're going to get all our loved ones, and we got our soldiers back, and we're looking forward for a better future,” he said in a video released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
    


            US President Donald Trump has indicated that the hostages still held in Gaza are likely to be released Monday or Tuesday.
    


            A detailed plan of how the deal should unfold has not been released, but as things stand, here is what we know about the timing:
    


Israeli cabinet approval: A ceasefire will begin immediately if the Israeli government approves the first phase of the plan to end the war in Gaza. That decision is expected later today.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN that the security cabinet has begun meeting to vote on the ceasefire agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is then expected to chair a full government meeting to approve it.
    


What happens next: When the ceasefire begins, Israeli troops will pull back to the agreed lines. The clock will also start ticking on a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli high court.
    


            This window is mandated by Israeli law — although it was shortened during the last ceasefire in January.
    


Hostage release: Once this objection window closes, a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release the hostages will begin. According to an official Israeli source, the assumption is that hostages will be released before the 72 hours pass.
    


            Under the plan, all the living hostages — believed to number at least 20 — are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period.
    


            This means that if the Israeli government indeed approves the plan on Thursday, the hostages should be back in Israel by Sunday evening or on Monday.
    


            US President Donald Trump said the remaining hostages held by Hamas will be released from Gaza on Monday or Tuesday next week, and that he is still aiming to travel to the region to mark the occasion.
    


            “I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace. Peace in the Middle East,” he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday.
    


                    “We secured the release of all of the remaining hostages, and they should be released on Monday or Tuesday,” he added. “Getting them is a complicated process. I'd rather not tell you what they have to do to get them. There are places you don't want to be. But we are getting the hostages back on Tuesday — Monday or Tuesday — and that'll be a day of joy.”
                





            Trump said he would “try and make a trip over” to mark the moment, including a stop in Egypt for an “official signing” to mark the agreement.
    


            US President Donald Trump announced Israel and Hamas have resolved the first phase of a 20-point peace plan, in a propulsive step toward a permanent end to two years of hostilities.
    


            Murmurs of cautious celebration permeated through Gaza and Israel overnight. Dark gray smoke cascaded over parts of the enclave and Israeli tanks opened fire earlier today, according to Palestinian officials, despite Trump's demands for an end to the bombing.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            As Palestinians begin to imagine life after war, the reality of the destruction left in its wake is difficult to shake. We heard from displaced residents in Gaza who told us what they anticipate for the coming days and weeks:
    


Abu Mohammad Abu Yassin from Jabalia camp:



                    “We are happy about the truce, but I will not return to the north. I returned before and saw what happened. The ruler and the executioner are the same side. They bomb us and they rule us.”
                





                    “My son was nine years old sitting in the street when a shard struck his eye and he lost his eye.”
                





                    “We will feel the effects of the war after the ceasefire. We will sit in a tent and lament our homes that were destroyed. We will remember our friends and relatives who were martyred, our brothers and neighbors who died.”
                





Ali Aref Abu Ouda from Beit Hanoun:



                    “I could fly with joy. I will go to my home and put up a tent.”
                





                    “If we return, what will we find? No house, nothing. We do not know what we will do after the war.”
                





                    “There are no houses, no schools, no universities, nothing remains.”
                





Abu Musa Yassin from Beit Lahia:



                    “I am neither happy nor sad. Our house was destroyed. It does not matter whether the war stops.”
                





                    “We will be the last to return to our area. Transportation is very expensive. People are merciless with prices.”
                





                    “What did these small children do wrong? This girl is an orphan; her father died. She is now like a daughter to me.”
                





Tareq al-Helou, Eyad Kourdi and Abeer Salman contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump's negotiating delegation of special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have arrived in Israel after participating in negotiations Wednesday in Egypt, two sources familiar with the matter said.
    


            Earlier Thursday they met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
    


            Trump has discussed visiting Israel and Egypt as soon as this weekend as the ceasefire-for-hostages deal comes into effect.
    


            Iran said it supports any effort to end the “genocidal war” in Gaza following the announcement of a US-brokered ceasefire, while calling on the international community to ensure that Israel fulfils its obligations in the agreement.
    


                    “The Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently supported every measure and initiative aimed at halting the genocidal war, ensuring the withdrawal of occupying forces, enabling the entry of humanitarian assistance, securing the release of Palestinian prisoners, and realizing the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people,” Iran's foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X today.
                





            The ministry added that it “underscores the responsibility of the international community” to ensure Israel does not breach its obligations.
    


            The longstanding enmity between Iran and Israel deepened following Hamas' attacks of October 7, 2023, and Israel's subsequent war on Gaza.
    


            Earlier this year, the two countries fought in a 12-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire announced by US President Donald Trump.
    


            Hamas and Israeli delegates were positioned in two different rooms during the ceasefire talks in Sharm El-Sheikh yesterday, a senior Hamas official said.
    


            The official told CNN the militant group did not directly meet with the Israeli delegation during the negotiations.
    


            United States special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo today after an agreement was reached for the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire.
    


            El-Sisi called for a ceasefire to begin immediately in Gaza, according to a statement by the spokesperson for the Egyptian presidency.
    


            Egypt told the American officials that it will continue working with the US and mediators to “implement what has been agreed upon sincerely and responsibly, including a ceasefire, the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages and prisoners.”
    


            The agreement reached with Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza “marks the beginning of a complete end to the brutal war against the Gaza Strip,” according to Hamas' spokesperson in the enclave.
    


            “There are certainly guarantees for Hamas that the war will not return after the exchange process is completed, and we also heard the American president speak directly, publicly, and clearly on this matter,” Hazem Qassem told CNN today.
    


                    Qassem said Hamas appreciated the efforts of the US administration and President Donald Trump, “and Hamas will implement all that is included in the agreement to ensure a full and lasting ceasefire.”
                





            “We as Hamas expressed our thanks to President Trump for helping reach this agreement. President Trump was keen to end the war on the Gaza Strip, and we call on him once again to continue pressuring the occupation to fully implement all terms of the agreement,” Qassem said.
    


            There had been adjustments to a map on the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops “to enable the resistance to carry out a full exchange operation for all prisoners, whether the bodies of the dead or those who are alive,” he added.
    


            It's unclear whether Israel has accepted those adjustments.
    


            Qassem also claimed that Israel was disputing the list of 250 Palestinian prisoners scheduled to be released as part of the first phase of the deal.
    


            “The occupation is attempting to manipulate the list of (Palestinian) prisoners that the resistance handed over for release,” Qassem said.
    


            “Pressure is needed to ensure full implementation of the agreement so that a comprehensive exchange process can be achieved,” he added.
    


            An Israeli security cabinet meeting has begun to vote on the first phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, an Israeli official told CNN.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to chair a full government meeting to approve the plan later, CNN has reported.

A CNN commentator and New York Times reporters are mentoring in a journalism fellowship launched to help Israel win the “information war,” according to investigative outlet Drop Site.

Founded in 2025 by Jacki Karsh and her husband, the program bills itself as “the world's only journalism fellowship solely dedicated to Jewish topics” and is “resolutely nonpartisan.”

Karsh said she started it to “shift the narrative” in Israel's favor, citing the need to fight “on the battlegrounds of academia, law, business, [and] media.”

Drop Site described her as an “open and die-hard” supporter of Israel, citing a March interview in which she framed Israel as “on the facts side,” and called the IDF “the most moral army in the world.”

The fellowship has recruited 16 mentors from outlets including The Atlantic, Spectrum News, The Spectator, Ynet, and Times of Israel. Among them are New York Times journalists Jodi Rudoren and Sharon Otterman, according to Drop Site.

Other mentors include CNN's Van Jones, who apologized after backlash over comments on HBO's ‘Real Time With Bill Maher' linking images of dead Palestinian children to an Iranian and Qatari disinformation campaign; and Atlantic writer Michael Powell, who has criticized rights groups like Amnesty International for being “stridently critical of Israel.”

When Drop Site asked how the program could be “resolutely nonpartisan” given its stated aim, fellowship director Rob Eshmen said it aims to foster “fairness and accuracy on Israel and Jewish issues.” He added that “the best response to misinformation is journalism grounded in evidence, integrity, and independence.”

Karsh has described Hamas as “real life monsters” and compared them to Nazis. She also challenged Gaza casualty figures – which the UN and IDF say are broadly accurate – telling eJewishPhilanthropy that figures “influence how people perceive the story.”

Over 65,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian authorities, since Israel launched its military operation in response to the Hamas surprise attack that killed around 1,200 people and resulted in more than 250 taken hostage. The war has also led to unprecedented destruction and a humanitarian disaster in the enclave.

US President Donald Trump is pressuring the Norwegian government and the Nobel Committee in an unprecedented push for the Nobel Peace Prize, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. Experts reportedly remain skeptical that the campaign will succeed, however. 

Trump has pointed to his recent Middle East peace plan as evidence that he deserves the award, claiming it marks the eighth conflict he has helped resolve since taking office in January. The US president has claimed he ended disputes involving Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, Congo and Rwanda, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as Pakistan and India.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is set to announce the Peace Prize winner on Friday. Analysts are doubtful that Trump will be selected, citing his domestic and international record, as well as the fact that the prize honors actions taken in 2024, when he had not yet taken office.

“Putting pressure on the committee, going on talking about ‘I need the prize, I'm the worthy candidate' — it's not a very peaceful approach,” Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, told FT.

Halvard Leira of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs added that while lobbying for the prize is not unusual, previous efforts, such as South Korea's 2000 campaign for Kim Dae-jung, have tended to be more discreet.

According to Norwegian officials, as cited by FT, Trump raised the issue in a call with Norwegian Finance Minister and former NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.

There is also concern in Oslo about potential retaliation, including tariffs or other punitive measures, if Trump is not selected, the newspaper noted. The controversy has reportedly been exacerbated in recent weeks after Norway's sovereign wealth fund divested from US company Caterpillar due to its equipment being used by Israel in Gaza.

Trump's Nobel push has so far received support from several international figures, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, and Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar. He has also been backed by the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, a group of Republican lawmakers, and Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te.

US President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan entails Israeli forces withdrawing from large swathes of the Palestinian enclave and Hamas releasing the remaining hostages within several days, according to media reports.

An Egyptian source involved in the talks told Sky News Arabia that negotiators agreed to a “complete ceasefire” and a “gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army from 70% of Gaza.”

Ynet meanwhile reported that Israeli forces would be required to withdraw to a pre-set line within 24 hours, leaving Israel in control of around 53% of the Palestinian enclave. This would include an IDF withdrawal from Gaza City and several other central areas, the report said.

According to Reuters, Hamas would release all living hostages within 72 hours of Israeli government approval. In return, Israel would free 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained since 2023, including all women and minors. Hamas still holds around 48 hostages; Israel believes that around 20 are still alive.

After announcing the breakthrough in the negotiations, Trump told Fox News that the hostages will probably be released on Monday, while promising that Gaza “will be rebuilt.”

“Gaza… is going to be a much safer place… other countries in the area will help it reconstruct because they have tremendous amounts of wealth, and they want to see that happen,” Trump said, without revealing the nations to be involved.

Despite the reported breakthrough, several questions remain unanswered – including Gaza's post-war administration and the fate of Hamas, which Israel has vowed to completely destroy. Trump's original peace plan envisioned a limited administrative role for the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, but only after major reforms.

The Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters attacked the Jewish state, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent military operation in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to local officials. It also led to unprecedented destruction and a humanitarian disaster in the enclave.

Exclusive: Republicans Against Perry are relaunching their campaign to oust Trump ally Scott Perry in 2026

A group of Republicans in Pennsylvania are relaunching their efforts to unseat Congressman Scott Perry, the fervent Trump ally who represents the state's 10th congressional district, according to plans first provided to the Guardian.

The “Republicans Against Perry” (Rap) group began in late 2023, backing the congressman's Democratic opponent, Janelle Stelson, who ended up losing by less than two points in the 2024 election. Now, Rap is restarting their grassroots campaign on Thursday, which includes a slew of electronic billboards throughout the district.

With Republicans' razor-thin margin in the House, the seat will be one to watch closely in the midterm elections. Politics PA called Perry's seat the most vulnerable of the 2026 congressional races they are watching.

While Rap is backed by the WelcomePac, which focuses its support for Democratic candidates, the group is not throwing its weight behind any candidate challenging Perry just yet. “It's premature to make a sort of final determination,” said Craig Snyder, a Pennsylvania-based Republican organizer who is running the campaign. “Our reason for being is to defeat Scott Perry, and if that does not happen in the primary, then we are very, very likely to support the Democratic nominee.”

Stelson, a former local news anchor, has announced her bid to run for office again. While Karen Dalton, a former Republican staff attorney in the Pennsylvania state house, has launched a primary challenge against Perry.

Perry, the four-term incumbent, is a member, and former chairman, of the House's ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. Following Joe Biden's presidential victory in 2020, he maintained that the election was stolen, and in the lead-up to the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Perry introduced Donald Trump to fellow election denier Jeffrey Clark, who was then a justice department official. Perry pushed for Clark's appointment as acting attorney general to continue an effort to undermine the 2020 election results.

In December 2023, the congressman was ordered to turn over more than 1,700 text messages, emails and other communications to federal prosecutors investigating his role in Trump's attempt to block the peaceful transfer of power.

The congressman's district, which sits in the south-central corner of the state, includes the capital, Harrisburg, and is home to one of the largest shares of federal employees throughout Pennsylvania. The advertising campaign to oust Perry will use the ongoing government shutdown to appeal to furloughed government workers. “The government has shut down. Perry still gets paid, you don't,” one billboard reads.

Snyder, who also had a leading role in the Republicans for Harris group during the last presidential election, says Perry is representative of the “ascendancy of the Maga movement” within the GOP. (Scott Perry's campaign has not responded to the Guardian's request for comment.)

“We believe we can successfully finish the job that we started in 2024,” Snyder added. “To have this mismatch between the sort of centrist, moderate, all-American aspect of the district, versus the extremism of the congressman, may be one of the most pronounced misrepresentations in the whole country.”

But for Vince Galko, a Pennsylvania strategist who served as the executive director of the state's Republican party, the Rap effort “rings hollow” and doesn't “hit home” with local voters.

“The name itself hurts its credibility. They're against Scott Perry, OK, then what do you support? What policies do you agree with Scott Perry's opponent?” Galko said, adding that the incumbent lawmaker was aware that the district's demographic is changing and is ready for the challenge. “I do think that the Perry campaign will learn from last time, keeping in mind that it was a presidential year, and turnout this time around will be much lower.”

For his part, Snyder is confident that Perry's time in office is ultimately on shaky ground, given that he will be on the ballot without Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in 2026. Snyder believes that if Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who won the 2022 Pennsylvania gubernatorial race by a landslide, seeks a likely re-election run, it could impact the race down ballot.

“Even if the primary challenge is not successful, it's going to really help us mobilize for November,” Snyder added. “We're going to be able to see geographically where the anti-Perry Republicans are because Pennsylvania is a closed primary state. We will know where those folks are, and we'll be able to target them even more accurately than I think we already did in the last cycle.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump says federal cuts made while government is shut down will ‘only' target his opponents's priorities; Democratic measure fails again on ninth day of shutdown

Trumps says that “we will be making cuts that are permanent and we're only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you”.

“We're only cutting Democrat programs,” he repeats. “We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, that's the way it works.”

Today's cabinet meeting was dramatically shorter than the president's last one, which he held in August. That went on for more than three hours, whereas today's came in just over an hour.

During the president's cabinet meeting, Brooke Rollins, Trump's agriculture secretary, said that “we've got to get the government reopened” so that the administration can begin to help America's farmers. She insisted, however, that they aren't just struggling because of the steep retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, amid the ongoing trade war that kicked off when Trump returned to the White House this year.

Instead, Rollins blamed the previous administration. “We inherited a slew of issues,” the agriculture secretary said, listing the increase in labor and goods that farmers need under Joe Biden. “We have to change this hamster wheel of government. We've got to ensure that the farmers have the market to sell.”

The president has said that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netenyahu, is “much more popular today” than he was five days ago, when asked about his ability to stay in power following the first phase of the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.

Trump had “some extraordinary phone calls and meetings”, Rubio adds, that made the deal possible.

A turning point was Trump's meeting with Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN summit a few weeks ago, Rubio adds, to get those countries behind his plan.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio credits Trump's “forging of relationships” on previous trips to the Middle East with laying the foundation for the Israel-Hamas deal announced yesterday.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem says the department is “doubling down” by buying buildings in Chicago and Portland for immigration enforcement to operate out of.

“We're purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of. We're going to not back off,” she says. “In fact, we're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

“I was there a few days ago and looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of,” she says.

Noem adds that they're also purchasing facilities in Portland.

Trump again says he'll be leaving “fairly soon” for the Middle East.

Trump says they're going to Chicago and other cities “to restore law and order”.

Trumps says that “we will be making cuts that are permanent and we're only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you”.

“We're only cutting Democrat programs,” he repeats. “We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, that's the way it works.”

A quick break from the cabinet meeting to say that the Senate has once again rejected the Democratic stopgap funding bill on day nine of the government shutdown.

The upper chamber will now vote again on the GOP's stopgap funding bill that would fund the government until late November.

A reminder that it needs 60 votes to advance, meaning Democrats would have to sign on.

He says the attack on Iran was important to reaching a Gaza deal for its role in Tehran not having a nuclear weapon.

He adds that Iran wants to work on peace and the US will work with them.

Trump says that October 7th was “terrible” but also Hamas (read: Gaza) lost 70,000 people.

“That's big retribution,” he says. “But at some point that whole thing has to stop. And we're going to see to it.”

He adds that Gaza will slowly be “redone” and says many countries will be stepping up to get it done.

Trump says the hostages still held in Gaza “should be released on Monday or Tuesday”.

He adds that securing them is a complicated process.

He reiterates that he's going to “try and make a trip over there” to Egypt and that there will be an official signing, though he doesn't give further details.

He says once again hat he believes the agreement will lead to “lasting peace”.

Donald Trump's cabinet meeting has kicked off with the signing of a “Columbus Day” proclamation.

Monday marks the day that is now also observed as Indigenous People's Day, a counter-event to acknowledge the genocide, land theft and brutal treatment of indigenous people that followed Christopher Columbus's arrival in the so-called New World.

But Trump's proclamation casts the holiday squarely in its more traditional – and much contested – sense as a marker of “the innovation and explorer's zeal that [Columbus] represented”.

Trump adds:

In other words, we're calling it Columbus Day.

Many in the room break out into applause and somebody off camera says: “Yes, no more Indigineous People's Day.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President attacks Chicago mayor and Illinois governor as extra troops at army training site south-west of city

Hundreds of national guard troops remained in the Chicago area as city and Illinois officials awaited a judge's decision to stop Donald Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation's third-largest city.

It was still unclear where specifically the Trump administration would send the troops who reported to an army training site south-west of Chicago, which was laden with extra fencing and tarps put up to block the public's view of the facility late on Wednesday evening.

As they arrived this week, trucks marked Emergency Disaster Services pulled in and out, dropping off portable toilets and other supplies. Trailers were set up in rows.

“The federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, told reporters. “I can't believe I have to say ‘troop movements' in an American city, but that is what we're talking about here.”

Roughly 500 soldiers – 200 from the Texas national guard and 300 from the Illinois national guard – were mobilized to the city for an “initial period of 60 days”, according to statement issued from US Northern Command, part of the defense department, which called the operation a “federal protection mission”.

The guard members are in the city to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) buildings and other federal facilities and law enforcement personnel, according to Northern Command.

A small number of troops have started protecting federal property in the Chicago area, officials told the Associated Press.

Local television broadcast footage of uniformed troops arriving early on Thursday morning at an Ice processing facility in the suburban community of Broadview, which has become a focal point of protests. They carried shields and what appeared to be luggage.

In a statement the Village of Broadview said three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas national guard had arrived at the federal building.

“During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave and all of the guards were sleeping. We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night's sleep, too,” the statement said.

While the deployment came as part of a crackdown threatened by Trump, in response to unsubstantiated claims that big cities run by Democrats are overwhelmed with crime, the stated mission says military will be “performing ground activities to protect federal functions, personnel, and property”.

It marks Trump's fourth deployment of national guard troops on to the streets of a major US city in as many months, following deployments in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Memphis. In all cases except Memphis, it happened against the wishes of state and city leaders.

Trump repeatedly has described Chicago in hostile terms, calling it a “hellhole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides.

A judge will also have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: a court hearing was being held on Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the guard deployment illegal.

The state of Illinois urged April Perry, a federal judge, to order the National Guard to stand down in the Chicago area, calling the deployment a constitutional crisis. The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.”
 Wells' arguments opened an extraordinary hearing where heavy public turnout at the downtown Chicago courthouse caused officials to open an overflow room with a video feed of the hearing.
 Eric Hamilton, a Department of Justice lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”. He noted an incident last weekend in which a Border Patrol vehicle was boxed in and an agent shot a woman in response.

But in a court filing, the city and state lawyers say protests at the Ice building in Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement”.
 “The president is using the Broadview protests as a pretext,” they wrote. “The impending federal troop deployment in Illinois is the latest episode in a broader campaign by the president's administration to target jurisdictions the president dislikes.”

Elsewhere, an appeals court has scheduled a hearing the same day over the government's desire to send the guard to Portland, Oregon. A judge blocked that effort over the weekend.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“This is about authoritarianism. It's about stoking fear,” Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, said. “It's about breaking the constitution that would give him that much more control over our American cities.”

Trump, meanwhile, sent barbs from Washington, saying on social media that Pritzker and Johnson, both Democrats, “should be in jail” for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Asked about Trump's wish to jail him, Pritzker in downtown Chicago extended his arms and told MSNBC: “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.”

Meanwhile, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said the department was “doubling down” by buying buildings in Chicago – and also Portland – for Ice personnel to operate from.

“We're purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of. We're going to not back off,” she said. “In fact, we're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

At the same time in Memphis, Tennessee, a small group of troops were helping on Wednesday with the Memphis Safe Task Force, said a state military department spokesperson who did not specify the exact role or number of the guard members. The taskforce is a collection of about a dozen federal law enforcement agencies ordered by Donald Trump to fight crime.

Tennessee's Republican governor, Bill Lee, who has welcomed the guard, has said previously that he would not expect more than 150 guard members to be sent to the city.

“Piranhas” may make great material for horror and adventure stories, but in reality, they rarely attack humans. While people fear piranhas, it is often humans who pose a greater threat to them through overfishing, pollution, and habitat disruption.

If Russian President Vladimir Putin launches a new mobilization in Russia, it could pose a grave threat to Europe and spark a world war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 8.

The president's warning comes as Russia steps up provocations against NATO countries, including a surge of mysterious drone sightings across Europe that have raised fears of hybrid warfare.

""Wherever there is quick success, that is where (Putin) will go if there is mobilization,"" Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. ""There is a significant risk that Putin will actually go to a world war.""

According to the Ukrainian president, the danger stems from Putin's political need to demonstrate ""success"" after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

""Mobilization means a definite loss of popularity for the Russian leader. That is the only reason he has not done it,"" he said. ""If there is mobilization, it will be a challenge to Europe. He will start a major war.""

Russia's mobilization in 2022 — the first since World War II — followed military setbacks on the front lines and triggered mass protests and emigration, with more than 261,000 Russians fleeing.

While the Kremlin later declared mobilization ""completed,"" no presidential decree officially ended it.

Instead of launching another draft campaign, Moscow has depended on financial incentives and recruitment campaigns, offering lucrative contracts to volunteers willing to serve in the army. 

""Believe me, they definitely didn't want to pay big money for contracts. Such big money as they have been paying all these years. Imagine the price of protecting his personal rating,"" Zelensky said.

The Ukrainian president has repeatedly warned that unchecked Russian aggression in Ukraine could eventually spill beyond Ukraine's borders and into NATO territory.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest chose not to engage.

Three Russian MiG-31 fighters also entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes on Sept. 19, prompting the Baltic country to invoke consultations under NATO's Article 4.

European leaders have echoed Zelensky's concerns. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned in July that Russia could be ready for a military confrontation with Europe within the next two years.

Tensions between Russia and NATO have escalated since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with growing fears among Western officials that the Kremlin may be preparing for a broader confrontation.

Ukraine is ready to nominate U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he helps secure a ceasefire with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 8.

Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and end the full-scale Russian invasion, ongoing for more than three and a half years.

This effort has largely stalled as Russia continues to reject a ceasefire and demands territorial concessions from Ukraine.

The U.S. president, who has boasted about ending ""seven wars"" since returning to office, has actively campaigned for receiving the prestigious award. 

Some officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have already put forward Trump's name for nomination.

The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Oct. 10. As nominations for this year closed in January, any nominations Trump has received since then will not count toward this week's prize.

Despite initially saying he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, Trump later acknowledged that resolving it ""turned out to be a little harder"" than he thought.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov recently said that the ""strong momentum"" for ending the war has waned since Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15.

While Trump pledged to arrange direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, no agreement was reached.

Zelensky rejected Putin's invitation to meet in Moscow, calling it impossible while Russia bombs Ukraine, but repeatedly said he is ready to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground.

The Alaska summit, initially expected to include sessions on bilateral cooperation, ended abruptly after those segments were canceled. Two months later, no tangible progress has been made toward peace.

 

Trump has also sought to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, announcing on Oct. 8 that the two parties agreed to the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

Carbon-removal startup Deep Sky Corp. plans to build a $500-million direct-air-capture plant in southwestern Manitoba, one of the world's largest facilities designed to counteract the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Montreal-based Deep Sky said Thursday that it is developing a project that will absorb 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, dwarfing its newly operational demonstration plant in central Alberta.

It is announcing the venture as Canada becomes a focus for decarbonization with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration canceling billions of dollars in incentives for green technology.

Deep Sky will start with a $200-million phase that will remove 30,000 tonnes of CO2 per year for injection underground in the region. Construction will start in 2026, the company said. It will add the rest of the facilities in stages.

The company is in talks with municipal and Indigenous leaders, as well as other stakeholders, to determine where it will locate the plant. It is focusing on the Pipestone and Two Borders areas southwest of Brandon, Man. 

“We've looked at a number of sites in that area and what is really going to drive our decision is the geology underneath all of those sites that we're considering, as well as securing the power,” Alex Petre, the company's chief executive officer, said in an interview.

Canada could lead in CO2 removal if Ottawa supports market, coalition says

Deep Sky expects to finalize the site this autumn so it can drill a CO2 storage well by the end of this year, it said. 

Ms. Petre said Manitoba offers several advantages, including geology suited to gas injection, carbon-free hydro power, a trained work force and a favourable regulatory regime. The provincial government passed legislation in 2024 allowing for CO2 storage.

Deep Sky, started two years ago by Fred Lalonde, founder of the online travel agency Hopper Inc., plans to line up its own financing for the project, and it has been marketing credits for the offtake. There is interest among prospective buyers for offsets, Ms. Petre said.

“There is a lot of space in the market for any project developer or company that actually takes execution seriously and is able to deliver credits quickly. So, with Alpha, we've demonstrated that we are very serious about execution,” she said.

This summer, Deep Sky started up its Alpha facility in Innisfail, Alta., where it is testing technology deployed by several vendors to examine energy use, overall efficiency, durability and scalability as they remove climate-warming gas from the air. When fully operational, the plant will remove 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

Ms. Petre declined to divulge which vendor will supply the gear for the Manitoba project, only that Deep Sky is “working with some exciting front-runners” on next-generation carbon-removal technology.

The company said it has garnered the support of the Dakota Grand Council by working with the Dakota Nations of Manitoba, and it has signed a declaration to explore investment and partnership opportunities.

Ms. Petre said the council is enthusiastic about the investment in the region and prospect of future power generation to support later phases. “They are definitely looking forward to discuss all possible avenues, but equity investments from their side have been on the table as well,” she said.

Council chairman Raymond Brown, Chief of the Canupawakpa Dakota Nation, said in a statement that Deep Sky's project aligns with the Dakota economic development strategy and its vision of a sustainable future.

As Deep Sky unveils its investment, the U.S. government has announced it is cancelling billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs and is considering more cuts. Projects on the list include two major direct air capture hubs that received billion-dollar awards from former president Joe Biden's administration.

Ms. Petre said the development is bad news for the U.S. industry, but it puts the spotlight on Canadian carbon-removal opportunities.

“I would say we had already been working with a number of U.S.-based companies that saw the writing on the wall and now we definitely have an influx,” she said. “I have gotten a lot of fairly panicked calls from a lot of my peer group in the U.S.”

One of those companies, CarbonCapture Inc., had been developing a project in Arizona, but moved its equipment to Deep Sky's Alpha project.

“They basically had everything ready to go in Arizona and within four weeks they shipped everything across the border, and because we already had all of the infrastructure, they are basically able to plug and play.”

A 29-year-old man has been charged with sparking California's deadly Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive wildfires in its history, authorities said Wednesday.

Federal officials said Jonathan Rinderknecht, who lived in the area, started a small fire on New Year's Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through Pacific Palisades, home to many of Los Angeles' rich and famous.

The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods across Pacific Palisades and Malibu, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.

Rinderknecht was arrested Tuesday in Florida and made his first court appearance Wednesday in Orlando on charges including malicious destruction by means of a fire, which carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison. Wearing shorts and a T-shirt while shackled at the ankles, he told a federal magistrate in a soft-spoken voice that he was not under the influence and did not have mental issues.

The judge set a hearing for Oct. 17 to consider bond and extradition proceedings. Messages seeking comment were left for Aziza Hawthorne, the federal assistant public defender assigned to represent Rinderknecht.

Los Angeles Fire Department Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva said the arrest was an important first step toward justice.

The department released a report Wednesday that found firefighters lacked enough resources and struggled to communicate clearly in the first 36 hours of the blaze, and that those challenges hampered their response during a critical time. The report said the department did not pre-deploy enough resources despite warnings of severe winds.

Investigators said Wednesday that Rinderknecht was working as an Uber driver on New Year's Eve, 2024. After dropping off a passenger in Pacific Palisades, he parked and walked up a trail. He took videos at a nearby hilltop area and listened to a rap song with a music video showing objects being lit on fire, prosecutors said. Shortly after midnight, he lit the fire, they alleged.

He fled the scene after starting the fire but returned to the trail to watch it burn, acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said.

“He left as soon as he saw the fire trucks were headed to the location. He turned around and went back up there. And he took some video and, and watched them fight the fire,” Essayli said.

Strategy and architecture helped L.A.'s storied Getty Museum survive the wildfires

Uber said in a statement that it worked with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine the driver's whereabouts around the time of the fire.

Rinderknecht also made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint.

During an interview Jan. 24, Rinderknecht told investigators where the fire began, information not yet public and that he would not have known if he hadn't witnessed it, the complaint said.

He lied about his location, claiming he was near the bottom of the hiking trail, Essayli said.

He was visibly anxious during that interview, according to the complaint. His efforts to call 911 and his question to ChatGPT about a cigarette lighting a fire indicated that he wanted to create a more innocent explanation for the fire's start and to show he tried to assist with suppression, the complaint said.

Federal officials called the Palisades blaze a “holdover fire” from the Jan. 1 fire, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters. LA's interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.

Investigators determined the initial blaze was likely lit by a lighter taken to vegetation or paper, according to the criminal complaint.

Investigators found a “barbecue-style” lighter in the glove compartment of Rinderknecht's car on Jan. 24. It appeared to be the same lighter as one that was in his apartment on Dec. 31, based on a photo on his phone. He admitted to bringing a lighter with him when he walked up the hill, authorities said.

Federal prosecutors will need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Palisades Fire grew from the blaze six days earlier, said Jerod Gunsberg, a California criminal defense attorney with experience in arson cases.

The department found that there was a delay in communicating evacuation orders to the public, resulting in spontaneous evacuations without traffic control that caused residents to block routes to the fire. The incident command had to be frequently relocated to escape the fire front, the report said.

The first evacuation orders came 40 minutes after some homes were already burning, reporting by The Associated Press has found.

The department could not effectively recall off-duty personnel, and some fire chiefs had limited experience with “managing an incident of such complexity,” the report said. Most firefighters worked for more than 36 hours without rest.

The Eaton Fire broke out the same day in the community of Altadena, destroying more than 9,400 homes and killing 19 people. Investigators have not officially determined a cause, but the federal government sued utility Southern California Edison last month, alleging that its equipment sparked the fire.

An outside review released in September found that a lack of resources and outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delayed evacuation warnings.

The report commissioned by Los Angeles County supervisors said a series of weaknesses, including “outdated policies, inconsistent practices and communications vulnerabilities,” hampered the county's response.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Will the 2026 World Cup be a disaster for fans?","https://www.dw.com/en/will-the-2026-world-cup-be-a-disaster-for-fans/a-74276038","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:32:04 GMT","

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to be the most expensive, polluting and political yet.

Immigration difficulties, mass deportation raids and climate issues have plagued the United States, the biggest of the three World Cup host countries, for most of 2025. With the first phase of ticket sales leaving fans astounded by the record-high prices, it raises the question: how much will fans really be able to enjoy the 2026 World Cup?

Since Donald Trump's return to power, the US has made entering the country a nightmare for many.

Unpredictable rejections and even detentions at the border made headlines early in the year, notably in March when German citizens were being detained by US immigration.

The previous two World Cups had a fast-track, temporary visa process, but the US has yet to offer such a program. The final tournament schedule won't be clear until the draw on December 5, leaving many fans facing a lengthy bureaucratic process before even knowing when, or if, their country will play.

For some, attending the tournament may already be legally impossible. At the start of the summer, Trump announced a new list of countries whose citizens are outright banned from traveling to the USA. An exception was defined for the players and staff from any sporting team taking part in the tournament, meaning the teams will be allowed in, but fans will be left sitting at home.

So far, the only nation from that list which has qualified for the World Cup is Iran. But local media in Brazil has speculated that their fans may also be barred from travel, as Trump has heavily sanctioned the South American country over the prosecution of former president and ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro. A World Cup without fans from Brazil, the only country to have qualified for every edition, is unimaginable.

As difficult as getting into the country may be, staying might be just as hard. Mass deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been carried out across the country for months now. The targets are usually large, liberal-voting cities such as  Los Angelesand Chicago. Many of these cities will be host sites for the tournament next year.

During the summer's Club World Cup, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made its presence known. In a post on X, they stated their officers were ""suited and booted ready to provide security."" Despite quickly deleting the post, they still advised attendees to carry proof of legal status.

Though the tournament ultimately concluded without any major ICE-related incidents, the statements caused enough fear to keep many fans away. Should this continue into next year, many fans might be discouraged from traveling.

On top of these civil rights concerns comes the financial impact on fans.

The most expensive 2026 final tickets are nearly four times higher than those in Qatar 2022 — from roughly $1,600 (€1,375) then to over $6,300 (€5,400) now.

Prices vary for the group stage and opening matches of each host nation. Matches played in Los Angeles and San Francisco, for example, are more expensive than those in Dallas and Philadelphia. But even with these disparities, group stage tickets, historically the cheapest of the tournament, are still about three times higher than the last edition.

Combined with ""variable-pricing"" schemes and resale portals with no price cap, simply getting a ticket could cost fans hundreds to thousands of dollars. Travel to the country and accommodation costs will make the trip even more untenable.

Along with the financial cost, there is also a large environmental one.

After the last World Cup took place in the small Gulf state of Qatar, this edition sees games taking place across the biggest three North American nations. This means teams and fans will have to rely primarily on air travel. The US will play its first game in Los Angeles, the second in Seattle, and the third again back in LA. That's nearly 2,000 miles traveled on the most pollutive form of transportation.

While car rentals and ridesharing might offer a possiblity for traveling fans, the increase in road traffic is expected to be so great it will reportedly contribute to making this World Cup the most polluting ever.

Public transportation options also remain a major concern. The AT&T Stadium near Dallas, for example, will host the most matches of any venue but cannot be reached by public transport.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has reassured the public that immigration issues will not be a concern.

""There is definitely a commitment of the government in the United States to make sure that the process is smooth, so fans from all over the world will be welcome,"" Infantino said during a press conference in August. He did not, however, detail how this process will work.

FIFA's media director Bryan Swanson defended the ticket pricing structure, saying it is crucial to have ""a ticketing model that reflects our responsibility to provide access to fans, while at the same time ensuring as much value as possible is retained for redistribution into the game around the world.""

When it comes to civil and human rights concerns, a group of 90 rights groups signed an open letter to FIFA asking them to address the growing abuses in the United States. No direct response was given.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Tehran is increasingly shifting to unofficial channels and clandestine networks to keep selling its crude oil. Most of the benefits go to a small clique of corrupt Iranian elites — and China. 

At the end of September, the United Nations reinstated wide-ranging sanctions on Iran that had been suspended under the now-defunct JCPOA 2015 nuclear agreement. 

The move came after the three European signatories to the deal — Britain, France and Germany — triggered the so-called ""snapback"" mechanism embedded in the accord.

The renewed sanctions imposed a freeze on Iranian assets abroad, a halt on arms deals with Tehran and additional restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures.

""No big deal,"" Iranian Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad remarked.

""In less than two years, 25 sanction packages with a total of 470 to 480 new punitive measures have been imposed on Iran. There are no further sanctions that could seriously concern us,"" he told reporters on October 1.

Some of the reinstated punitive measures are targeting Iran's nuclear program, in the aftermath of the US strikes on its nuclear sites which in June.  Following the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, which culminated with the US bombing Iran, US President Donald Trump claimed the nuclear sites were ""obliterated.""

Now, Washington wants to keep up the pressure on Tehran and force the theocratic regime to back down and completely give up its nuclear ambitions. In order to fund the nuclear program, Iranian elites are forced to pour enormous amounts of money into it — primarily through the revenue it generates by exporting crude oil.

""With the return of UN sanctions, restrictions now apply to Iranian shipping, there's a ban on the sale of fuel to Iranian tankers, increased inspections of ships carrying potentially dual-use goods, and restrictions on financial transfers,"" Dalga Khatinoglu, an expert on Iran's energy and economy, told DW. 

""This makes the legal export of Iranian oil considerably more difficult. Sales, transport and payment processing are severely restricted,"" he added.

The Iranian regime has sought ways to circumvent international sanctions for years, including by building up a shadow financial and shipping network to facilitate oil trading.

At the end of July, the US government slapped new sanctions targeting more than 115 individuals, companies, and ships with ties to the Iranian oil industry. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described it as the largest round of sanctions against Iran since 2018.

The restrictions primarily target the ""elites of the regime"" in Tehran, particularly a network of companies owned by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani, a close adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The Shamkhani family has used its political influence to build up a shipping empire, controlling a large fleet of tankers and container ships that transport petroleum products from Iran and Russia, as well as other cargo around the world.

""The Shamkhani family's shipping empire highlights how the Iranian regime elites leverage their positions to accrue massive wealth and fund the regime's dangerous behavior,"" Bessent said in July.

But the Shamkhani family's shipping empire is not the only option for Iran to bypass sanctions.

The US has been able to uncover many of these networks in recent years due to ""internal power struggles"" in Iran, Hamzeh Safavi, a professor at the University of Tehran, said during a press conference with economic experts in Tehran earlier this week. ""These networks expose each other in order to make billions in profits.""

""Just six months ago, Iran was selling its oil at a discount of around $1 compared to the Brent price,"" Homayoun Falakshahi, senior analyst at oil and commodities data company Kepler, told DW, referring to a global benchmark for oil prices.

""Three months ago, the discount was already $3, and now it's $6.5. Iran is currently offering its oil at discounts of $8 to $10 compared to similar grades from the Middle East,"" he added.

Despite sweeping US sanctions that make it nearly impossible to officially process financial payments to Iran, China continues to import Iranian oil.

The Asian giant, in fact, has been the largest buyer of Iranian oil since the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement during President Trump's first term, in May 2018.

As reported by the Wall Street Journal on October 5, Iran and China have established a largely clandestine barter system, where Iranian oil is shipped to China, and in return, state-backed Chinese companies build infrastructure projects in Iran.

By circumventing the international banking system, this arrangement between the two sides has provided much-needed revenue to Iran, whose economy has been dealt a devastating blow by sanctions.

In 2024 alone, up to $8.4 billion (€7.2 billion) in oil payments flowed through this system to finance Chinese infrastructure projects in Iran, the US paper reported.

Can a veggie schnitzel legally be called a schnitzel even if it contains no meat? Some have argued such names are confusing consumers. The European Parliament seems to agree.

The European Parliament has voted in favor of banning words like ""burger"" and ""sausage"" to market their plant-based counterparts. 

The decision comes on the back of a proposal from members of the center-right European People's Party (EPP).

""A steak is made of meat — full stop. Using these names only for real meat keeps labels honest, protects farmers, and preserves Europe's culinary traditions,"" said lead negotiator and EPP member of parliament Celine Imart ahead of Wednesday's vote. ""Calling it 'meat' is misleading for the consumer,"" she added. 

But there was disagreement within the EPP, with some members voting against it.   


""We shouldn't take consumers for fools. If a package says 'veggie burger' or 'veggie sausage,' everyone can decide for themselves whether they want to buy it or not. I believe and hope that the discussion will come to nothing,"" said EPP member Peter Liese. 

In response to the majority ballot, Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party said ""While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel."" 

She told DW it was now ""up to the Council and the German federal government to put an end to this nonsense, which confuses consumers, costs companies millions, and won't help farmers."" 

According to the German consumer protection organization Verbraucherzentrale, people prefer products meant to mimic the taste of meat have names that made them recognizable as such. 

""Terms such as 'vegan schnitzel' don't cause confusion but help with orientation and promote clarity,"" the organization's food expert Astrid Goltz told DW. 

In Germany, major supermarkets such as Aldi Süd and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle pushed back against the proposal and called on the EU parliament to vote against it. 

Consumers are well able to distinguish meat and plant-based alternatives, they said in a joint statement before the vote. A ban would ""force companies to use unfamiliar terms which significantly complicates market access and slows down innovation dynamics.""

A recent study put the potential for plant-based products at about €65 billion ($75 billion) by 2045 in Germany alone, with some 250,000 new jobs. 

According to European consumer watchdog organization foodwatch, the proposal was an attempt at slowing down the uptick in people choosing to occasionally forego meat. 

""Under the pretext of consumer protection, the EU wants to ban familiar terms such as tofu sausages or seitan schnitzel — this is not consumer protection, this is lobbying for the meat industry,"" said Chris Methmann, director of foodwatch Germany, in a statement.

Research by sustainability NGO Changing Markets Foundation points to aggressive tactics deployed by the meat industry, with massive campaigns pushing for disinformation.  

A 2020 study by the European Consumer Organization found that 80% of consumers don't see any problem with names such as soy sausage or veggie schnitzel if they are clearly labeled as plant-based products. 

In response to a push by France to regulate the wording of veggie foods, the European Court of Justice ruled in 2024 that EU member states cannot prohibit the use of terms traditionally linked to animal products. 

Even after the vote, it remains up in the air whether consumers have to stomach new words for their plant-based schnitzels — it's now up to the heads of state and governments to decide.

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Left-wing Antifa violence, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a handwritten message.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly.”

A photographer captured the text with a long lens (see below). “Very close,” read the scrawl, with the two words underlined.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” it added.

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform. A few hours later, it dropped.

“I am very proud that Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” it said.

“BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS,” the post concluded.

The statement capped a frenetic period of diplomatic activity in which Mr Trump has applied the full heft of the White House towards reaching a deal.

If it holds – and it is a big if – the president would have a good case to achieve his long-held dream of being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Insiders said the latest round of negotiations kicked off in earnest exactly a month ago, on Sept 9, when Israel carried out its failed air strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, the capital of Qatar.

Missiles crashed into the terror group's headquarters, killing the son of chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, just as its political bureau was weighing up the latest US proposal.

Mr Trump was furious. The strike had embarrassed the United States, sparked fury among the Arab and Gulf allies crucial to any deal, and achieved none of its military goals.

The president's impatience with Mr Netanyahu hardened. He delivered via backchannels and, later, in person a message: if you do not go along with us on this path to peace, the US will withdraw from its position as Israel's chief ally.

At the same time, Mr Trump tightened his alliance with Qatar, ensuring its leaders would do everything in their power to bring Hamas to heel.

Soon afterwards, Al Jazeera, the state-owned broadcaster, began to promote calls for the Islamist terror group to lay down arms, while watering down anti-Israel coverage.

Another breakthrough came in a meeting between Mr Trump and leaders from Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

The US president said he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. But diplomats from those countries were surprised when the president's 20-point plan dropped the following week.

They felt it reflected Israeli interests much more strongly than the recommendations they had made to Mr Trump and his officials.

A diplomatic source familiar with discussions told The Telegraph: “The output didn't quite add up to the inputs shall we say.”

But Mr Trump and Qatar were now at the head of a process with growing momentum. The source said Arab and Muslim leaders were still discussing how best to raise their worries about the peace plan when Hamas announced they would accept it.

Mr Trump then invited Mr Netanyahu to the White House on Sept 29 and presented a draft of the peace plan pulled together with input from Sir Tony Blair.

Some of it was hard to swallow for the Israeli prime minister. Point 12 stated that Gazans would not be forcibly displaced from the Strip. Point 19 outlined how the deal would help create a “credible pathway” to a Palestinian state.

The Israeli team managed to make last-minute tweaks, but Mr Trump's team rejected an amendment that would allow it to restart the war if it deemed Hamas had broken clauses of the agreement.

To cap off Mr Netanyahu's sudden reversal of fortunes, he was brought into another of the president's “Made For TV” moments in the Oval Office.

Handed a phone by the president, he was forced to call up the Qatari prime minister and personally apologise, more like a naughty schoolboy than the political colossus who has devastated Gaza and humiliated Iran and its proxies.

Next, the plan was presented to Hamas. The group, Mr Trump warned, had three or four days to respond – and, if it refused, Israel would be let off the leash to “destroy” it.

On the night of Oct 3, Hamas issued a full-throated agreement to release the 48 hostages it holds (20 alive, 28 dead).

But it skirted the demand to disarm, and remove itself from post-war governance in Gaza. Analysts characterised it as a carefully calibrated “Yes, but”. Mr Netanyahu saw it as a flat-out rejection – and phoned Mr Trump to persuade him of that view.

A key dividing line between the two men appears to be their approach to the Israeli hostages. Mr Netanyahu spends little time with the hostage families, many of whom accuse him of continuing the war for personal political gain.

By contrast, Mr Trump knows some hostages by name and keeps tabs on their recovery, while Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, regularly texts with the families praying for the release of their loved ones.

Hamas took a gamble: the clear “win” for Mr Trump would be enough for him to overlook its murky views on other parts of the 20-point plan.

It paid off. When Mr Netanyahu phoned the president in an attempt to torpedo the deal, he replied: “Why are you always so f---ing negative?” Axios reported.

The president told the news website he had given Mr Netanyahu no choice but to move towards peace.

“I said, ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it,” Mr Trump said. “He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you've got to be fine.”

Instead of nitpicking the Hamas reply, the president ordered Israel to “stop bombing” in Gaza City, where its troops had begun a full-scale offensive.

Mr Netanyahu accepted, this time. He could not outmuscle the commander-in-chief, as he had with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israel Defense Forces halted offensive operations and began to prepare to receive the hostages.

On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister gave a brief, televised address to the nation. He said Israel had achieved its war goals and cast the move towards diplomacy as his decision, rather than one taken at the behest of the White House.

Hostage families protested in Tel Aviv and other cities, warning against any attempt to sabotage the deal by Mr Netanyahu or his far-Right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who abhor the prospect of an agreement with Hamas.

By Monday, delegations from Israel and Hamas had arrived in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh.

Following reports of progress, Mr Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, joined the talks on Wednesday morning.

However, there were several sticking points to iron out before the “72-hour” window in which Hamas would release the hostages opened.

Israel objected to some of the individuals the terror group wanted to be among the 250 life prisoners freed, including Marwan Barghouti, who was jailed for his role in the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.

In a rare interview, Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader who dodged the missile strike in Qatar, said his group was seeking “real guarantees” that the war would not resume after the release of the hostages, as it had after two earlier ceasefires. The terror group also demanded the body of its former leader, Yahya Sinwar.

By Wednesday night, it appeared that enough progress had been made behind closed doors.

In the White House, Mr Trump was handed the note. True to his style, the president went on to take a further 11 questions, spanning the government shutdown, sanctioning Antifa and on his Nobel Peace Prize hopes, before departing the state dining room to address the matter of ending the war in Gaza.

One of the new cadre of softball reporters who are now routinely admitted to such events pointed out that several nations had nominated Mr Trump for the prize. “By many… by many, many countries,” he agreed. “That's right.”

Mr Trump had, by his own count, ended seven wars and was on the brink of an eighth, he continued. The claims are greatly exaggerated, critics contest.

“I don't think anybody in history has settled that many, but perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me,” he said.

Minutes later, he was gone, heading back to the Oval Office, flanked by JD Vance and Mr Rubio.

Then a Truth Social post dropped, buzzing on journalists' phones all across Washington and beyond. Thumbs scrambled to see if it meant peace in the Middle East.

“Democrats,” intoned the sombre narrator of a political video, “the party of open borders, transgender for everybody, lawlessness in our streets, are shutting down the government in an effort to appease the radical Left”.

A false alarm, as it turned out. But the world was listening, and it did not take long for the big announcement to drop.

Some 50 minutes passed before the president finally declared: “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan.”

All hostages would be released and the IDF would withdraw to “an agreed-upon line”, his post said.

That leaves most of the rest of the 20-point peace plan, including a stabilisation force, aid and a future Palestinian state, to be negotiated. But that is a problem for another day.

Pete Hegseth is investigating hundreds of Pentagon employees for comments they made about the death of Charlie Kirk.

Almost 300 military members, civil workers, and contractors are suspected of mocking the fatal shooting of the conservative influencer on Sept 10, The Washington Post reported.

The Pentagon, which employs some 950,000 civilians and more than one million active-duty personnel, said staff who make fun of Kirk's death would be sacked.

So far, the hundreds of investigations have only resulted in several disciplinary actions.

Mr Hegseth has presided over a department in turmoil since taking the reins as US defence secretary 10 months ago, clearing out members of the top brass while senior aides depart en masse.

Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, told The Washington Post: “Those in our ranks who rejoice at an act of domestic terrorism are unfit to serve the military people.”

Mr Parnell previously said mocking Kirk's death was a “violation of the oath” and “dangerously incompatible with military service”.

Following the 31-year-old's assassination in September, Donald Trump announced a crackdown on “radical” Left-wing terrorists, who he accused of fanning the flames of political violence.

Critics, including prominent conservatives, warned the policy could be exploited to clamp down on free speech under the guise of “hate speech”.

On Thursday, critics of Mr Hegseth accused the defence secretary of creating a culture of fear inside the Pentagon following the dismissal of Jon Harrison, the navy chief of staff, who was appointed to the post by Mr Trump in January.

In a statement following his departure, the department thanked Mr Harrison for his work, but remained tight-lipped on the reasons for his sacking.

There is an emerging “culture of fear; there's a culture of intimidation and retaliation,” a senior defence official told Politico.

“It's better just to keep your head down and not necessarily try to do anything to the advantage of the organisation, because it's very much run from the top down.”

“We all serve at the pleasure of the president,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The White House said Mr Trump had full confidence in Mr Hegseth.

The Pentagon has been approached for comment by The Telegraph.

Donald Trump declared a “momentous breakthrough” in the Middle East on Thursday, saying his administration has “ended the war in Gaza” and achieved what he described as “lasting peace”.

Speaking in a cabinet meeting on Thursday night, the US president said the deal marked “something that people said was never going to be done.”“We ended the war in Gaza and really – on a much bigger basis – created peace that I think is going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace,” Mr Trump said.

Mr Trump also said he would try to go to Egypt for the “official” signing of the Gaza peace deal between Israel and Hamas. “I'm going to try and make a trip over,” Mr Trump said. “It will be a day of joy”.

Israel will partially withdraw from Gaza and Hamas will free all remaining hostages it captured in the Oct 7 massacre under the deal's terms. In exchange, hundreds of prisoners held by Israel will be released.

Donald Trump said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.

“I'm not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But... there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces.

Donald Trump has said he has agreed to speak to the Israeli Knesset and will do so if requested by officials there.

“They asked me to speak at the Knesset and ... I've agreed to if they would like me to,” Mr Trump told reporters as he met his Cabinet at the White House.

Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby that Hamas rejects Donald Trump's proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's administration, headed by the US president himself.

Israel and Hamas have agreed a ceasefire deal to free hostages held in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails following indirect negotiations in Egypt.

But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, on which the indirect negotiations were based, also calls for post-war Gaza to be ruled by a transitional authority governed by a board headed by Mr Trump.

“No Palestinian would accept this. All the factions, including the Palestinian Authority, reject this,” Mr Hamdan told Al Araby Television Network.

Donald Trump said he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

“I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there, and we're working on the timing, the exact timing,” Mr Trump said.

Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told his US counterpart Donald Trump in a phone call that he “deserves the Nobel Peace Prize” for bringing about a deal to end the war in Gaza.

He invited Trump to “participate in the celebration to be held in Egypt to mark the conclusion of the agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, the first phase of which has been signed during talks in Egypt.

The statement from Sisi's office said the president “stressed the need to move forward toward implementing the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip in all its stages”.

Donald Trump says the US will work with Iran so it can “rebuild” its country.

“We will work with Iran, as you know we have major sanctions on Iran, we would like to see them rebuild their country too, but we they can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said.

He said that Tehran acknowledged that it is in favour of the Israel and Hamas peace deal. 

Donald Trump has said the Hamas-held hostages should be returned on Monday or Tuesday

“I'm going to try make a trip over,” he said. “It will be a day of joy.”

Israel has released details of its hostage handover plan, outlining a multi-step process under the new Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas.

If the deal is approved in today's cabinet meeting, a ceasefire is expected to take hold within 24 hours.

The IDF will pull back its forces to an agreed upon line which will see it retain control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the plan.

Hamas is to release the 48 hostages it is holding – beginning with the 20 believed to be alive – within 72 hours of Israel's troop withdrawal, as outlined by the US-brokered agreement.

They will be passed to the Red Cross who will transfer them to IDF troops within Gaza. The soldiers will then escort them to the Re'im military base near the border, where their families are waiting for them.

Hostages requiring urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation.

Professor Mark Bray, author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” says he has received death threats.

The Rutgers teachers' unions are standing in solidarity with History Professor Mark Bray, who has been targeted by Turning Point USA's student chapter at Rutgers.

The group has falsely claimed that Bray, the author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook is “a prominent leader of the antifa movement on campus,” and launched a campaign to have him fired. “Antifa,” which is short for antifascist, is a frequent target of President Donald Trump and others on the extreme right. As Holly Baxter wrote in The Independent:

Antifa isn't real — at least, not in the way one convenes a roundtable. It has no central command structure, no coherent leadership, no membership rolls, no headquarters. It is a loose ideological umbrella — a term that is sometimes used by disparate activists and local groups, but much more frequently by the far right than by the supposed lefties who are part of it.

Bray says he has received death threats, and that he and his partner, Yesenia Barragan, also a Rutgers professor, are temporarily relocating to Europe because they fear for their family's safety.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

On Wednesday, Rutgers AAUP-AFT and the Rutgers Adjunct Faculty Union issued a joint statement calling on the administration, students, and staff to publicly support Bray. A petition, unaffiliated with the unions, is also circulating asking the Rutgers administration to disband the Turning Point student chapter. So far, the petition has close to 2,000 signatures. (Disclosure: The author signed the petition and has taught at Rutgers.)

“Silence in the face of these assaults will only embolden the far right,” the unions said. “With that in mind, the Rutgers faculty unions reject Turning Point USA's smear campaigns and proudly stand with our colleagues Dr. Mark Bray and Dr. Yesenia Barragan.”

They continued: “Turning Point's attack is part of an escalating effort by the far right to suppress the speech, teaching, and scholarship of faculty who do not conform to their movement's politics.”

Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last month, founded Turning Point USA, an extremist right-wing group in 2012. A close ally of President Trump, Kirk frequently made racist, sexist, and anti-trans statements, and mocked the Palestinian victims of Israel's genocide in Gaza.

In 2016, Kirk's organization created a “Professor Watchlist,” of, the group says, “professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.”

Twenty-two Rutgers professors are currently on the Turning Point Watchlist, which is available online.

People can submit tips to the site via a website form that requests the professor's name, university, and an explanation of how they are “biased.”

It asks tipsters to “select all that apply to the professor,” above a list that includes, Anti-Law Enforcement, Anti-Second Amendment, Antisemitic, Climate Alarmist, Foreign Influence, Socialism, Identity Politics, and Riots and Violence. “Antisemitic” is also included on the list, which is likely code for pro-Palestine. Those who support Israel's genocide use baseless accusations of antisemitism to attack pro-Palestine, anti-genocide activists.

Professors on the list say they've been harassed and received death threats.

“For weeks my inbox and voicemail were deluged. Mostly white men spat venom through the phone: ‘bitch,' ‘c*nt,' ‘n****r,'” Howard University Professor Stacey Patton posted on Facebook after Kirk's death.

She was placed on the Watchlist in 2024.

“They threatened all manner of violence,” she continued.

Kirk's Watchlist has “terrorized” professors “who challenged white supremacy, gun culture, or Christian nationalism,” she wrote.

“Kirk sent the loud message to us: speak the truth and we will unleash the mob!”

Can the US and South Korea's tenuous alliance survive Trump's tariffs and ICE's raid on a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia?

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Zip ties. Helicopters. Crowded cells. Guns trained on bewildered workers. Foul water. Forced vaccinations. An unconscious detainee left on the floor by negligent guards. A pregnant woman in handcuffs. A detainee being called “Rocket Man” (Donald Trump's nickname for Kim Jong Un) by sneering federal agents. A menstruating woman forced to attend to her period with only toilet paper.

These are the details of 316 South Korean nationals' experiences in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that have flooded the country's media in the weeks after the September 4 raid on a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. A wave of fury is now pouring forth from across South Korean society — and the political consequences are only just beginning.

There is far more at stake than a single factory in Georgia, which by itself represented 8,500 jobs and $4.3 billion in investment, and is just one of 23 plants being built across the U.S. by Korean conglomerates. Since the raid, the U.S. and South Korea have announced that Korean workers will be able to use B-1 visas and ESTA visa waivers to continue working in the U.S. A new bill in Congress, the Partner with Korea Act, also seeks to extend 15,000 professional E-4 visas to South Koreans for the first time.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

But U.S. flexibility on immigration is not all that matters. Seoul and Washington have yet to finalize their trade deal instigated by Trump's threat to impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on South Korean goods. At the current stage of negotiations, South Korea has agreed to accept a 15 percent tariff on its exports and provide tremendous investments and other financial agreements: $350 billion in state-backed short-term investment, $150 billion in private sector contracts with U.S. corporations, and a guarantee to purchase $100 billion in U.S. liquid natural gas. Despite so much on the table, a written agreement has yet to be produced, and negotiations are proving tense as the Trump administration presses for Seoul to provide the lion's share of its $350 billion commitment in cash. While some of the shock over the ICE raid has died down, Washington's conduct over the course of months of negotiations has also raised deeper questions in South Korea about the real nature of the alliance — and whether this is a relationship that can last.

The anger unleashed by ICE's abuse of Korean workers has been building for some time. Trump's tariff threats, announced in March, hit South Korea at a difficult time, when the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was unresolved, and the country was reeling from years of flagging economic performance.

The issue was not only a matter of timing. The Biden administration's CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act also used similar (though less onerous) tariff threats to force South Korean conglomerates to transfer production and make large investments in the U.S. — which is how the Hyundai-LG plant made its way to Georgia in the first place. Having already complied with the previous administration, South Korea nevertheless now finds itself facing an even graver economic threat that could lead to recession: not just a 25 percent tariff on all exports (since reduced to 15 percent), but sector-based tariffs impacting most of South Korea's key industries as well.

Trump's tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

While much of the anger on either side of the Pacific has focused on the current administration in Washington, Trump's tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

The 1997 International Monetary Fund crisis is the most notorious of these, and led to the “irregularization” of nearly half the workforce as employers moved to subcontracting and other forms of indirect employment to dodge existing labor law and deny rights to their workers. The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers. With Joe Biden, and now Trump, the U.S. has moved to maintain its privileges under the agreement while subjecting South Korea to unequal burdens and penalties.

As with prior rounds of U.S. economic warfare, South Korea's workers and other affected sectors of society responded to the tariffs with force. Farmers reacted with rancor to demands to open up the rice and beef markets to U.S. imports; civic groups staged protests at the U.S. embassy; peace groups highlighted the military demands attached to the tariff threats; and unions educated their workforces and, in some cases, moved to partial strike action — as with the case of General Motors Korea.

Like most governments, South Korea opted to appease the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15 percent, with no corresponding tariff on U.S. goods in the Korean market. So far, Seoul has offered to inject a cumulative $600 billion into the U.S. economy. This is a dizzying figure for any country, no less for South Korea with an annual GDP of roughly $1.7 trillion in 2023, and an annual budget of roughly $500 billion in 2024.

According to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the $350 billion in short-term state-backed investments offered by South Korea is more than the total direct investments it made worldwide over the five-year period from 2020-2024. Beyond extracting such an enormous tribute, Washington has cast a covetous eye toward South Korea's most valuable and strategic industries, seeking to either smother them through tariffs or transfer their most lucrative parts of the production chain to the U.S.: in shipbuilding, automobiles, steel, and more.

While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung attempted to spin the deal as a victory, the domestic labor movement and many progressives swiftly rejected this. The minority Progressive Party, which holds seats in the National Assembly, denounced Trump's tariff maneuvers as “an act of plunder.” The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a massive umbrella union representing over a million workers, described the “unilateral” negotiations as “humiliating,” and criticized the government's declaration of victory as an attempt to confuse the public, since the 15 percent tariff is still ultimately an increase that will burden Korean industry and workers.

At the outset of Trump's tariff threats, labor, farmers, and progressive civil society organizations spearheaded vocal opposition. South Korea's conglomerates (or chaebol) opted to hedge against further potential losses by adopting conciliatory rhetoric and offering handsome investment packages before the details of a deal were worked out at the state level. This was reflected in Lee's first summit with Trump in August, which was noted for its convivial atmosphere and his lavish praise of Trump. Pressure to transfer production to the U.S. was no doubt uncomfortable for South Korea's capitalists, but for a moment, an illusion endured that profits might be sustained in the long term. Then came the ICE raid in Georgia — not only raising questions about the safety of the workforce, but also raising questions about investments.

The ICE raid in Georgia … precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea.

This precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea. Right-wing papers and business media outlets released a barrage of editorials in the wake of the raid. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's conservative paper of record, said the raid “raises fundamental questions about what the United States truly means by ‘alliance.'” Even the People Power Party, whose former leader, ex-President Yoon, now sits in jail, spoke out against the incident.

Some even went as far as to speculate whether the ICE raid might have had something to do with the unsettled tariff negotiations. The Korea Economic Daily, one of South Korea's most important business papers, left little room for subtlety in its editorial: “If the US attempts to leverage this incident in trade negotiations, such as the $350 billion US investment fund and the further liberalization of agricultural and livestock products, it would be a betrayal of the trust of the alliance.” While this statement falls short of an outright accusation in print, one wonders what might have been said in more private settings among the elite.

Despite the pivot in South Korean public opinion, Washington has since only doubled down. Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea's governments have been at odds over how South Korea's investments will be decided. Trump has long claimed that he will personally determine the allocation of South Korea's investments, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick previously tweeted that “90 percent” of the profits will go to “the American people” — a point that continues to rankle South Koreans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick is also applying additional pressure to get Seoul to further raise its investments. Trump has no doubt taken confidence in his success in getting Japan to agree to similar terms, under which its $550 billion tariff tribute will be distributed according to the decisions of a U.S. committee — with Japanese input relegated to only a consultative position. If this all sounds bizarre and corrupt, that's because it is. While Trump has touted his tariff deals as the prelude to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, a better way to see them may be as just another handout for Wall Street — this time subsidized by taxpayers worldwide.

Now, the Trump administration is demanding that the majority of Seoul's $350 billion investment be made “up front” in cash. Though an arrangement based on some credit is more likely, if handed over in full, the $350 billion would represent 83 percent of South Korea's foreign reserves, threatening to trigger a currency crisis for the Korean won. Lee's government has rejected this demand and countered with an offer for an unlimited currency swap to protect the value of his country's currency, but the Trump administration has so far refused.

As negotiations drag on, Lee faces growing pressure to adopt a more assertive stance — including from within his own Democratic Party. For a moment, Lee put up more combative rhetoric, telling the Korean press he would not accept “any irrational or unfair negotiations,” and noted that, “We did not go to the US to gain anything, but to defend ourselves against the US' unilateral tariff increases.” In a separate statement, Lee's office indicated it would be willing to accept a 25 percent tariff to the U.S. market if the alternative were overly detrimental to South Korea. And in a much-circulated Facebook post, Lee called for a “self-reliant” South Korean military while castigating the “submissive mindset of some who think that self-defense is impossible without foreign troops” — a statement widely interpreted as made in reference to U.S. Forces Korea, which stations over 28,000 permanent U.S. troops in South Korea in more than 60 military bases.

Lee's rhetoric is certainly sharpening, but his administration isn't done with the U.S., or Trump, just yet. There are real obstacles preventing a sudden strategic shift from Washington. Lee's economic program pegs South Korea's future competitiveness to massive investments in AI and associated hardware, and recent deals with BlackRock and Open AI would provide the capital for the necessary data infrastructure and chip production.

More immediately, South Korea needs to diversify its trade partners to soften the blows of the U.S. tariff cudgel. Exports rallied to a new monthly record high in September, buoyed by a sharp rise in trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, and more modest gains in trade with China. Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea's military — something Lee has vowed to recover more than 20 years since Washington first agreed to a process for transferring military control.

Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea's military.

A disadvantageous deal for South Korea may yet be in the offing, but a victory on trade may prove pyrrhic for Washington. For its part, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has unambiguously called for Seoul's investment pledges to be withdrawn. Should a potential deal fail to spark public ire immediately, ample opportunities will remain. Trump's demands go far beyond economic matters. The U.S. is also calling for South Korea to raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP (Lee has already taken steps towards this, increasing defense spending by 8.2 percent in next year's budget); raise its annual military “cost-sharing” payments to the U.S. to $10 billion a year; and consent to changes in U.S. Forces Korea's mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.

Out of all these demands, the proposed change in the mission of U.S. Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea. By redefining the mission of the U.S. occupation of Korea, South Korea would essentially lose any ability to avoid a U.S.-China war, since its territory would become part of a battlefield of Washington's making. Lee has consistently maintained that South Korea should stay out of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which Washington has not been shy about as its rationale for pursuing “strategic flexibility” in Korea. As U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson put it, to the U.S. military in the New Cold War, South Korea is akin to a “fixed aircraft carrier” whose geographical position makes it indispensable to dominating the region.

The ICE raid and trade wars alone will not undo the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, but they will likely persist as an open wound marring the relationship for years to come. As Washington presses on with its efforts to economically cannibalize Seoul and impose its military exigencies in preparation for wars few Koreans or Americans want, something will have to give. Whether that will be the alliance and the U.S. empire of bases, or whatever vestiges of democracy that remain in both countries, only time will tell.

A majority of voters, 58 percent, said presidents should only send military forces to cities that face external threats.

Two sets of recent polling data demonstrate that Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's actions in office so far — particularly his mobilization of the National Guard in U.S. cities.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Wednesday found that Americans largely disapprove of troops being deployed to U.S. cities when there isn't an external threat. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans, 58 percent, said the president should only deploy troops to areas of the country facing an external threat, while fewer than 3 in 10 Americans, 25 percent, disagreed with that sentiment.

A plurality of respondents, 48 percent, said they were opposed to a president sending troops to a state if the governor of that state disapproves of such an action. Only 37 percent said a president should be allowed to send troops to a state without the governor's consent.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Shortly before the poll was conducted, Trump told a meeting of hundreds of generals and admirals that they should prepare to face off with an “enemy within,” a phrase he's frequently used to describe people with left-leaning views. 

The poll comes as Trump is attempting to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois. In Portland, a federal judge has placed a temporary hold on Trump's attempts to mobilize troops; a different federal judge is allowing National Guard troops to be deployed to Chicago pending an upcoming hearing on the matter.

Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if judges further block his orders to send National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities across the U.S. He has also threatened governors and municipal leaders who challenge his actions, saying they should be “in jail” for refusing to cooperate with his plans to militarize their cities.

Another poll published this week, conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, shows that most American voters disagree with a number of controversial actions the president has taken since being sworn in nearly nine months ago. 

Trump received a net-negative approval rating on several issues, including the economy (-9 point approval rating), his management of the government (-10 points), trade with foreign nations (-9 points), and immigration (-6 points). On the issue of crime, 48 percent of voters said they approve of his actions while 47 percent said they disapprove — a figure that demonstrates a stark split among voters, and that is within the poll's margin of error.

Trump's overall approval rating is -11 points, with 43 percent approving of his performance as president and 54 percent expressing disapproval. 

A large segment of respondents said Trump has gone “too far” on numerous matters, including immigration enforcement (51 percent), sending the National Guard to U.S. cities (53 percent), coercing corporations into supporting his far right agenda (50 percent), and pressuring colleges (49 percent). On the matter of Trump threatening to revoke the licenses of TV stations if they don't fire on-air personalities he dislikes, an overwhelming 77 percent of respondents were opposed, while only 12 percent were in support.

Alarmingly, a majority of voters seem to recognize that Trump is governing in an authoritarian manner. When asked whether he has cleaned up “chaos” and “disorder” or created it, only 42 percent said he's cleaned things up, while 53 percent said he's been creating chaos and disorder, the poll found. 

It's no wonder, then, that nearly 6 in 10 voters (58 percent) feel the country is heading in the “wrong direction,” according to the poll, while only 36 percent believe we're on the “right track.”

 What Happens When the Threat Comes From Both Left and Right

 Robert A. Pape

The United States is in the grip of an era of violent populism. Threats and acts of political violence have been on the rise for roughly a decade, affecting a wide variety of victims, including Republican Representative Steve Scalise, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and U.S. President Donald Trump. In September 2024, I argued in Foreign Affairs that Americans must be prepared for an even more “extraordinary period of unrest” involving “serious political assassination attempts, political riots, and other instances of collective, group, and individual violence.” Sadly, this prediction has been borne out in 2025. An arsonist attempted to burn down Pennsylvania Governor Joshua Shapiro's home (while he and his family were inside), an assassin killed Minnesota House Representative Melissa Hortman—and in September, a shooter murdered the commentator and activist Charlie Kirk in the most significant assassination in the United States since the 1960s.

Kirk's death, in particular, has prompted bitter arguments among partisans about which political “side”—the left or the right—is to blame for the turn toward political violence. The truth is that neither is most responsible. Because it is notoriously difficult to assemble a comprehensive list of incidents of political violence and then accurately categorize them by their ideological motivation, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST), a University of Chicago research center I run, studied threats to members of Congress prosecuted by the Department of Justice. By focusing on a discrete, well-defined group of potential targets, this study largely avoids the subjectivity that muddies much research on political violence. We determined that, since 2017, the total number of threats to lawmakers has risen markedly, and Democratic and Republican members have been equally targeted.

This finding supports other research that shows that political violence in the United States now stems from both the left and the right, a rare and unusually dangerous phenomenon. Left to its own momentum, political violence is likely to escalate further, with major consequences for American liberal democracy: it drives fear in communities and among leaders who perceive themselves to be under threat and, in turn, a willingness to accept constraints on civil liberties or wield government power to suppress the danger. That only increases the likelihood that the legitimacy of future elections will be questioned. But the broad nature of the threat also suggests that if political leaders join forces to condemn political violence, they could push back the tide.

Violent populism—a phase of politics characterized by high levels of political violence and broad support for it—now represents a greater risk to American democracy than any competition with another country or any menace by a foreign terrorist group. The United States' democratic foundations have, of course, been threatened by political violence in the past. During the 1920s, for instance, the Ku Klux Klan and nativists carried out terror campaigns against Black people, Catholics, and immigrants. In the 1960s and 1970s, urban riots and political assassinations were a more regular feature of American life.

But unlike other waves of violent populism over the past century, the new surge is defined by historically high levels of political violence motivated by both left- and right-wing ideology. In the 1960s, analysts broadly agreed that left-wing instigators were responsible for the preponderance of American political violence—for example, the Weather Underground's “Days of Rage” protests in 1968. Likewise, there is a scholarly consensus that between the early 1970s until roughly 2015, people motivated by right-wing ideology carried out most acts of political violence in the United States, peaking with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168.

Since Kirk's assassination, U.S. leaders and commentators have argued over which political faction is more responsible for the rise in political violence. Trump and others in his administration have insistently claimed that the “radical left” is now disproportionately to blame. Prominent writers and think tanks have asserted that the right is more at fault. On September 11, for instance, the Cato Institute released a study claiming that between January 1, 1975, and September 10, 2025, (and excluding the 9/11 attack, whose lethality was an outlier), terrorists motivated by right-wing ideologies have murdered more Americans than those motivated by left-wing views. Two weeks later, the Center for Strategic and International Studies released a study claiming that “in recent years, the United States has seen an increase in the number of left-wing terrorism attacks and plots.”



What aligns these two apparently opposed points of view is the conviction that one side must be most culpable—and that accurately identifying this perpetrator faction is key to reversing the rise of violence. But the reality is that the pattern of U.S. political violence has fundamentally shifted. Politicians on both the left and the right are now subject to an extraordinary degree of threat. Indeed, a close look at the data in each of the dueling studies reveals a pattern of rising attacks carried out by both right- and left-wing perpetrators starting about ten years ago.

The Cato study does show that, since 1975, attackers that the researchers categorized as right-wing have killed more people than attackers described as left-wing. But death tolls cannot be a proxy for the threat posed by violent populists. The number of people killed in a politically violent incident is often a function of circumstances. In the attack on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, for example, three intended victims survived. When Ronald Troyke stalked the town of Arvada, Colorado, armed with an AR-15 in 2021—intent on killing law enforcement officers—he almost certainly intended to murder more than one, but a bystander shot him dead. And because lethal attacks are a small sample, it would take only one more mass shooting to dramatically alter what the study claims to reveal.

Even more important, although the Cato study shows that although right-wing attacks were more prevalent than left-wing ones between 1975 and 2015, after 2016, they become nearly equal. The CSIS study's data reveals that acts of political violence committed by attackers it categorizes as left- and right-wing have both risen in the past decade. Establishing any kind of reliable count of incidents of political violence is a huge challenge. There is no official FBI definition for “political violence”; creating one would require congressional legislation, because only the U.S. Congress has the power to define what constitutes a federal crime. And it can be very hard to capture all incidents with certainty and accurately judge perpetrators' motivations, leaving analysts of violent incidents open to accusations of bias. In its study of political violence, for instance, Cato categorizes the attacker who killed a student at Antioch High School in Nashville, Tennessee, in January 2025 as right-wing and the murderer of two Israeli embassy staffers in May 2025 as left-wing, while the CSIS study omits the first and describes the second attacker's motivation as “ethnonationalist.” These ambiguities show the inherent difficulties of assembling a comprehensive data set and classifying political motives when the depth of evidence varies case by case and when incidents may be poorly covered by the media.

Fortunately, there is a better way to systematically capture a picture of political violence in the United States: by considering threats against members of Congress that the Department of Justice deemed to be serious enough to prosecute. Studying this data has multiple advantages. It creates an objective standard for what counts as a serious threat, one determined by a relevant government institution and reliably identified with media reports and public court records. And it establishes a clearer set of incidents by focusing on readily identifiable political targets. Although using the partisan identity of targets as a proxy for the partisan motivations of perpetrators is not a perfect approach, it is a fairly good one (especially when considering whether an overall pattern changes over time), since cases motivated by personal issues are known to be rare. Annual numbers of threats can also be compared across years. Most important, the risk that the researcher will embed partisan bias in categorizing threats by political ideology is eliminated.

CPOST has comprehensively assessed threats made against members of Congress between 2001 to 2024. During this 25-year period, the Department of Justice prosecuted 377 threats to U.S. legislators, counting as a single threat cases in which a perpetrator threatened the same legislator more than once or multiple legislators in the same court case so as not to inflate the numbers. The threats included perpetrators repeatedly calling a senator's office to threaten an assassination, sending menacing powder to a legislator's office, carrying a weapon to a legislator's office or home—or, of course, physically harming the legislator. It is possible that different administrations' Justice Departments did not prosecute threats against the other party's legislators as they did threats against their own, but the fact that our study period covered different parties' tenures in the executive branch balances this risk.



There was a clear turning point in the nature and magnitude of the hazard. Every year starting in 2017, prosecuted threats increased more than fivefold from the previous year. Between 2001 and 2016, Democrats appeared to be generally more at risk (except during the first Bush administration, when all legislators were subject to a relatively low degree of threat). Since 2016, however, the threats to Republican and Democratic members of Congress have been roughly equal. And like the Cato and CSIS data, starting in that year, CPOST's study shows a marked rise in political violence on both the right and the left.

By all crucial measures, the pattern is the same: political violence has been rising over the past decade, and it is high on both the right and the left. Continuing to emphasize relatively small differences in the balance only contributes to a dangerous blame game that may well make matters worse.

Kirk's assassination did not simply constitute another data point in a years-long trend. It reflected a recent, even sharper acceleration in political violence. And it set off its own cascade of aggravating events: a crackdown on free speech, a probable copycat attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Dallas, and in late September, Trump's order to U.S. generals to “handle . . . the enemy within” and treat American cities as “training grounds.” “They spit, you hit,” he commanded. Trump's opponents, meanwhile, have amped up their rhetoric. “You've got to fight fire with fire,” 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said in a late September speech.

Intentionally or not, U.S. political elites on both sides of the partisan spectrum have encouraged the mobilization of the country into two separate, fighting camps. This violent polarization is visible on the streets: this year, Tesla dealerships have been the target of nearly 100 politically motivated attacks and ICE officers are facing assaults; Trump has responded with increasingly aggressive threats to treat predominantly Democratic cities like “war zones.” And tens of millions of Americans who have not committed political violence now say they support it.



For the past four years, every quarter, CPOST has surveyed Americans to gauge their support for political violence. In our most recent poll, conducted between September 25 and September 28, over a quarter of self-identified Democrats agreed that “the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency,” and over a quarter of Republicans agreed that the president “is justified in using the U.S. military to stop protests against the Trump agenda.” This is triple the proportion of respondents who agreed with similar questions we posed in September 2024.

Research by scholars such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Roger Petersen, the late Princeton economist Alan Krueger, and the University of Madrid's Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca has clearly shown that an increase in popular support for political violence often precedes real assassinations, bombings, and bloodletting. That is why it is crucial to understand the current breadth of support for political violence in the United States—as well as the fact that violent acts are perpetrated by people motivated by both right- and left-wing ideologies. Spirals of violence can take on their own momentum, generating reciprocal cycles of emulation and revenge.

In the absence of a major effort to forestall such a spiral in the United States, political violence's momentum will not halt. And in light of Trump's orders to the U.S. military, it is useful to remember that British troops entered Northern Ireland in August 1969 with the intent to de-escalate local violence. Instead, their presence led to the rise of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, which split from the official IRA over a dispute about violent tactics. The Provisional IRA's explicit goal was to expel the British troops by force, and its terrorist campaign lasted for decades.

Our CPOST September survey did reveal a reason for optimism. It revealed that a large majority of Americans still abhor political violence—and that equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans agree that threats of violence against politicians constitute a serious problem. Furthermore, the study found that over 80 percent of Democrats and Republicans agreed that leaders in both parties “should make a joint statement condemning any political violence in America.” This contingent includes some of the respondents who supported political violence, suggesting they could turn against it if they had confidence that partisans from the other side would, as well.

It is crucial that U.S. leaders speak to this majority. Between now and the U.S. midterm elections in November 2026, there is virtually no chance that any grand bargain will truly close the United States' cavernous partisan divide. A summit against political violence attended by top leaders such as Trump, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker—in which they all stressed that political violence is illegal, immoral, and un-American—would be very powerful. But even a more modest joint condemnation of political violence would be meaningful.

Scholarly research consistently shows that if the public is exposed to rhetoric from their leaders that threatens violence or characterizes their political opponents using dehumanizing metaphors, its support for political violence rises. There is good reason to think that calming statements can encourage the opposite trend. Since Kirk's assassination, various Democratic and Republican governors have separately condemned political violence. Assembling a group of leaders to do so jointly at the same publicized event would send the strong signal that U.S. leaders can live with each other—and so should all Americans.

 How Investments in Resilience Can Deter Beijing

 Lin Fei-fan

In July 2025, Taiwan conducted one of its most extensive military exercises in decades. This time, however, the training did not occur in isolated training grounds but in the heart of Taiwan's cities. Tanks moved through urban streets, more than 20,000 reservists were mobilized, soldiers transported weapons via underground metro systems, and simulated strikes targeted critical infrastructure, including the river crossings that link Taipei's urban core. As part of the exercise, planners tested civilian agencies under extreme contingency scenarios while air-raid alerts emptied the streets. Underground parking lots and metro stations served as bomb shelters, and schools and civic centers became relief shelters and emergency medical hubs. The exercise also mobilized nongovernmental organizations and fire and police agencies to support material distribution logistics and community protection efforts. The government even released updated civil defense instructions, providing the public with air-raid sheltering and safety guidelines.

The exercise, in other words, extended far beyond the armed forces and reflected Taiwan's deepening belief that effective deterrence against China relies not only on military modernization but also on societal resilience—the ability of Taiwan's people to withstand the most extreme scenarios or to resist an invasion. Although it was the first time the Taiwanese people witnessed such a large-scale exercise in their own neighborhoods, the public did not panic but instead expressed strong support for these realistic training and preparedness efforts.

Since 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his ambitions to annex Taiwan, by force if necessary, and to seek Indo-Pacific dominance. The Chinese Communist Party has framed these objectives as essential to the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” and has targeted Taiwan with escalating military pressure and hybrid operations across multiple domains. From near-daily incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone to large-scale kinetic drills, cyberattacks, and disinformation operations, Beijing has pursued a campaign designed not simply to intimidate but to erode Taiwan's confidence and capacity to resist.

In response, Taiwan is undertaking a systemic effort to build its “whole-of-society defense resilience,” a comprehensive strategy that combines military preparedness with democratic cohesion, infrastructure hardening, and societal strength. The goal is to raise the costs of aggression to such a degree that no adversary can hope to achieve victory. Taiwan is making great strides in this approach, as seen in the July exercise. But deterrence is strongest when it is collective. Now is the time for democracies to help preserve peace by investing in Taiwan's resilience.

Long before any conventional methods of war are deployed, authoritarian powers are increasingly trying to exploit their democratic adversaries' societal vulnerabilities. By breaking public morale, degrading infrastructure, and paralyzing decision-making, an aggressor can cripple a state's ability to function before war is even declared. Prior to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for instance, Moscow targeted the country with a steady campaign of hybrid aggression: cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, disinformation aimed at sowing internal discord, economic coercion leveraging Ukraine's reliance on Russia's energy supplies, and political interference exploiting pro-Kremlin forces. These actions were not tactical diversions but rehearsals for a full-scale invasion, designed to soften the target and test its ability to endure systemic shocks. When hostilities began in earnest, Moscow followed a similar script: attacking infrastructure, communications systems, and power plants to create widespread disruption and psychological fatigue.

But Ukraine—leaning on pillars of resilience such as media literacy, a mobilized civil society, redundant infrastructure, and territorial defense—denied the Kremlin a rapid victory. What Moscow expected to be a lightning campaign became a grinding conflict that drained its military strength, triggered unprecedented sanctions, and heightened domestic political risks. Ukraine's resistance has shown that modern deterrence hinges on a society's capacity to absorb shocks and continue resisting under fire.

Ukraine, of course, is not the only country with a formidable civil defense. In response to decades of threats, Finland and Israel have cultivated some of the world's most resilient traditions of whole-of-society defense, or total defense. Their systems go far beyond military readiness. Civilian defense training programs, medical networks, and civic protection rapid-response units are underpinned by a deeper societal conviction that surrender is never an option. Public communication strategies and psychological support structures seek to ensure that civilian morale can withstand prolonged crises, and continuity-of-government planning helps prevent societal breakdown even under extreme pressure.

But it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine that served as the wake-up call for Taiwan. The war made clear that peace cannot be secured through appeasement. It also showed how quickly coercion can escalate into full-scale assault and how the survival of a small democracy up against a powerful authoritarian adversary depends on preparations made long before the first shot is fired. Kyiv's resistance against overwhelming odds was a clear lesson for Taipei, which is why, three years ago, then President Tsai Ing-wen's administration quietly initiated preparations across government agencies to integrate civil defense planning into daily life, fortify critical infrastructure, and foster a society prepared mentally and materially for any contingency.

The Tsai administration started its national resilience campaign by auditing living necessities and essential supplies, including combat medication. It pledged $18.5 billion over ten years to harden and decentralize the power grid, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. It also started investing in low-orbit satellites to maintain communications if undersea Internet cables are severed. To improve reserve mobilization and civil-military coordination, it created the All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency. Amid the intensifying war in Ukraine, the Tsai administration extended conscription from four months to one year and enhanced training programs. These efforts laid the foundation for a much more structured whole-of-society resilience campaign when President Lai Ching-te took office in 2024.



President Lai has made resilience building one of his administration's top priorities. For instance, he has established a national-level committee on whole-of-society defense resilience, which meets quarterly with representatives from the business community, religious groups, academia, and nongovernmental organizations to review the progress of government plans and coordinate across sectors. With the participation of experts and representatives from various sectors, the committee has undertaken new initiatives throughout the last year, including a tabletop exercise to improve coordination among different levels of government, a small-scale live exercise testing civilian agencies' crisis response mechanisms, and the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience International Forum to exchange experiences with like-minded partners, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. The Lai administration also oversaw the July exercise, which emphasized not only military training but also the involvement of civilian agencies—signaling a shift in Taiwan's defense approach. These efforts have underscored that defending Taiwan is a shared responsibility, one that does not rest solely with the military but must also be upheld by all civilian agencies. To that end, Lai has also tasked the National Security Council with closely monitoring each government agency's progress across five major lines of efforts: civil manpower training and utilization, emergency supplies, energy security, medical capacity, and cyber and communication redundancy.

This strategy of whole-of-society defense is far from complete, but these efforts over the past three years demonstrate how decisively Taiwan has progressed from pure military defense to broader societal survivability. The objective is not only to resist armed aggression but also to maintain democratic governance, economic stability, and institutional continuity under pressure, thereby blunting Beijing's use of “gray-zone” and hybrid tactics that fall short of war.

The proposed defense budget, which is set to exceed 3.3 percent of GDP in 2026 and aims to reach 5.0 percent by 2030, further underscores Taiwan's commitment to deterrence. Taipei is not merely investing in conventional systems; it is also directing substantial resources toward asymmetric capabilities, including coastal missile systems, mobile air defense platforms, and a growing array of unmanned technologies such as drones and counterdrone systems. In parallel, the Lai administration has also proposed an $18.1 billion special budget package, with $4.9 billion for national resilience supporting the coast guard's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; disaster relief equipment; and the hardening of shelter facilities. This fund, when combined with regular resilience spending and the core military budget, will elevate Taiwan's total security-related spending to meet NATO's defense benchmarks by the end of 2026.



Still, resilience cannot be built through procurement alone: it also requires unwavering public support and societal consensus. Some opposition voices have called the government's efforts to strengthen resilience and defense a provocation to Beijing. But the reality is that authoritarian aggressors are preparing for military expansion and seeking to change the world order, whereas Taiwan's practices are preserving the status quo and, with it, freedom and democracy. There is no time to waste, so the Lai administration has chosen to accelerate the pace of societal preparedness through more rigorous discussion with the public, including bipartisan and public-private partnerships, particularly in technology and logistics, to ensure preparedness at both the state and societal levels. Many of Taiwan's international partners, including the United States, are also engaging across Taipei's political lines to illustrate the importance and urgency of such preparations.

Ultimately, unity—whether domestic or international, public or private—sends a powerful signal to potential aggressors that Taiwan remains politically strong under pressure. Deterrence is as much about perception as it is about capability. This is why the Lai administration has explicitly stated in its newly published civil defense handbook: “In the event of a military invasion, any claims that the nation is defeated or the government has surrendered are false.”

As Taipei's leaders have repeatedly warned partners and allies, Beijing's ambitions extend well beyond Taiwan. China and its allies seek to reshape the global order. Across the Indo-Pacific, the People's Liberation Army has intensified large-scale military exercises, harassed Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, and even staged unannounced live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea near Australia that disrupted civilian air routes and naval travel. China has also supplied critical components and dual-use technologies to Russia and Iran, enabling Moscow's war in Ukraine and bolstering Tehran's capacity to initiate attacks. Taken together, this pattern of regional aggression and global military support underscores Beijing's determination to erode the existing balance of power and challenge the security architecture that has underpinned peace and stability for decades.

Taiwan's ability to resist, therefore, has repercussions far beyond its shores. Should Taipei fall to Beijing, the resulting power shift could fundamentally alter the global order. Strategically, China would gain a forward operating base in the western Pacific, threatening several vital sea-lanes and undermining the United States' ability to meet security commitments to its Indo-Pacific partners and allies. The collapse of part of the first island chain—which stretches from Japan to the Philippines, separating China from the Pacific Ocean—could erode regional deterrence, raising alarm bells for key U.S. allies such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. China's annexation of Taiwan would also send a dangerous signal that small democracies cannot survive in the shadow of strong autocracies. It would fracture the credibility of democratic solidarity and further legitimize the use of force as a tool of statecraft.

The global economic consequences, meanwhile, would be immediate and severe. As part of a highly specialized global supply chain, Taiwan manufactures cutting-edge components that power today's economy, including the majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Taiwan is also a critical hub for global trade: in 2024, its ports handled a record $690 million revenue tons in cargo, and analysts estimate that roughly half of the world's container ships pass through the Taiwan Strait each year. Any disruption to either this maritime lifeline or Taiwan's high-tech manufacturing would reverberate across global markets, crippling industries from consumer electronics to automotive manufacturing and even defense systems. The potential consequences are staggering: Bloomberg has estimated that a war over the Taiwan Strait could inflict as much as $10 trillion in annual losses on the world economy, erasing more than ten percent of global GDP.

The future of Taiwan is not merely a regional concern; it is a test of whether the international order can withstand the pressure of authoritarian expansionism. Taiwan, especially the current Lai administration, understands this reality and has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to building credible deterrence through both defense capacity and societal resilience. Yet as authoritarian powers coordinate more closely—combining cyber-operations, economic coercion, and military pressure across the region—the preservation of Indo-Pacific peace cannot rest on Taiwan alone.

Although the Taiwanese people deeply appreciate statements of solidarity, further action is needed. More of the world's democratic leaders should take immediate, tangible steps to enhance security cooperation with Taiwan, including improving the ability of security forces to work together across domains. By recognizing that the resilience of one democracy strengthens the security of all, Taiwan and the United States have bolstered their security cooperation in 2025 through military procurement and arms deliveries, significantly accelerating Taiwan's preparedness. This should serve as a call to action for other democracies, as well. Taiwan is doing its part with urgency and resolve and is committed to achieving peace through strength by going beyond military readiness to strengthen whole-of-society resilience. As Taiwan accelerates its preparations, there should be no doubt about its determination to defend its future and its freedom.

Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            The news last night from Egypt brings hope for the first time in months to suffering hostage families, Israelis with loved ones on the front lines, and Gazans trapped in a tragic war that Hamas started. The deal requires the release of all remaining hostages living and remains held by Hamas and then a long process that aims to see Gaza recover with Hamas no longer in control of the Strip or its Palestinian population.
    


            So, what should we make of this deal, and expect to see over the coming days?
    


            Diplomacy is a lonely task. Former Sen. George Mitchell after negotiating the Good Friday Accords to end the Northern Ireland conflict described “700 days of failure and one day of success.” In my experience, far more so when the mission involves negotiations to free hostages and end a regional war that engulfed the Middle East after Hamas's invasion of Israel two long years ago this week.
    


            That is one reason the agreement reached last night on Gaza is a massive and unequivocal triumph.
    


            This year began with some hope following agreement for a three-phase deal to release hostages and ultimately end the war. I helped negotiate that deal, with support from the incoming Trump administration, a rare example of bipartisan cooperation. But it fell apart in March, and the last six months have been some of the worst in the entire war.
    


How the Biden and Trump teams worked together to get the Gaza ceasefire and hostages deal done



            Consider that as of only a few weeks ago, there were no talks ongoing. Israel had just launched its largest offensive of the war, and Qatar had backed out of its mediating role after an Israeli strike into its capital city targeting Hamas's outside leadership.
    


            France and the UK pursued their own initiatives to recognize a Palestinian state without asking anything from Hamas, the Palestinians, or Israelis. Hamas hailed that approach, and many in Congress at the same time lined up behind legislation to cut military aid to Israel.
    


            Against that trend, the Trump administration offered its own framework that demanded Hamas release all hostages at once or else face “obliteration.” This plan requires Hamas to cede control in Gaza in favor of an interim security force and to decommission its weapons and for Israel to give up any claim to annex or occupy Gaza.
    


            It also points to a conditions-based pathway to establish a Palestinian state well down the road.
    


            The president and his team rallied unanimous regional and majority-Muslim state support behind this plan, helping to further isolate Hamas, while also pressuring Israel to accept its terms. Last Friday, the president threatened Hamas again with obliteration if it refused to accept the plan and then called on Israel to stop military strikes after Hamas responded with an equivocal yes.
    


            This was good diplomacy backed by the application of power, incentives, and deadlines. And it appears to have worked.
    


            Yes, this framework builds on what was developed in the Biden administration and intended to be Phase 2 of the January deal, but credit where it is due: Trump and his team, led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, stood in the face of critics and events to forge a deal that saves lives and may end this awful war, together with a pathway towards longer term peace. That alone is an achievement worth celebrating.
    


            Now, what should we expect over the coming days, and can the plan work as intended?
    


            In the January deal, Hamas emerged from its underground fortress of tunnels, a labyrinth longer and more extensive than the Manhattan subway system, in full military gear, clean informs, and a demonstration of staying power as the only security force in Gaza. It paraded hostages and the coffin of an Israeli baby, taunting Israel into restarting the war and forfeiting any serious prospect for a second phase.
    


            This time, the deal calls for Hamas to relinquish power and such grotesque displays and shows of force would be a clear violation of the accord.
    


            One early sign of whether this promising deal can lead to a new beginning for Gazans without Hamas, is whether and how Hamas manages the release of the hostages.
    


            If it looks like the January deal, that will be a bad sign, and Israel might be more inclined once its hostages are returned to renew the war. It is thus incumbent upon the countries with influence over Hamas, primarily Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, to ensure that implementation goes smoothly with handovers managed quietly and overseen by the International Committee for the Red Crescent / Red Cross (ICRC).
    


            Hamas and what's left of it as a military organization needs to stay out of view if the aim is to set conditions for a longer-term peace.
    


            Phase Two of this new deal is basically all that happens after Hamas has returned the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The deal calls for establishment of an interim security force and an interim political structure in Gaza. None of that has yet been stood up, and doing so could take months absent steady US pressure and leadership.
    


            In the Biden administration, US Central Command developed plans for an interim international security force inside Gaza. US forces would not be in Gaza but would provide logistical and other forms of support from Egypt and elsewhere.
    


            These plans are likely being dusted off now, and several countries have reportedly offered forces for the interim security structure. But building such a security coalition also takes time, and in that time, Hamas will likely seek to reassert its authority, even if quietly though the intimidation of Gazans.
    


            Thus, it's critical that the US move rapidly to lock down troop commitments and establish the command structure and rules of engagement for this interim phase. Failure to do so might forfeit the promise of the present moment and increase risks of the war reigniting.
    


            Similarly, the political entity outlined in the deal needs to be named, and there will be debate and controversy over every name to be included. Once again, only the US can impose discipline and help get these structures stood up fast.
    


            Finally, the plan calls for an international backed and financed reconstruction program. This, too, requires leadership. Fortunately, the US knows how to do this. One example is Mosul, the Iraqi city that was nearly destroyed in the year-long battle to oust ISIS ten years ago. I recall standing in the rubble shortly after the battle and questioning whether the city might ever be rebuilt let alone recover.
    


            But the US, through a global coalition, mustered the organization and the resources to begin the process and now ten years later, even the historic mosques and churches that were flattened in the battle have been restored.
    


See Mosul rebuilt after ISIS



            The same process and more will be needed for Gaza and it should begin now together with a coalition of countries ready to contribute resources and expertise. For now, what is critical is to set all these processes in motion and not allow the spoilers including the remnants of Hamas to reconstitute and recover.
    


            As one of the negotiators of the only two previous ceasefires of the Gaza war, I've gotten to know many of the hostage families and shared their suffering and in some cases grief over loved ones lost to Hamas. When first learning of the deal last night, these families were my first thought, and I have not stopped thinking of them since.
    


            Twenty families this week will be reunited with loved ones who suffered over two years in the most horrific conditions imaginable, underground, chained, suffocating, darkness. Nearly 30 more will be reunited with the remains of loved ones, those killed by Hamas on October 7 and afterwards.
    


            These innocent families and the hostages soon to return home deserve admiration and support long after this coming week.
    


            It's too early to conclude that this deal will lead to a more lasting peace. Much can go wrong, and Israel will have elections for a new government sometime over the coming year, which may divert focus from regional diplomacy.
    


            But the potential is now there. On October 7 two years ago, Hamas intended to rally its partners in a multi-front war against Israel. For a time it succeeded, but those partners – Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi militias, and the Assad regime in Syria – have now one-by-one been defeated or significantly degraded. No doubt, this opens a historic opportunity for a broader peace and integration in the Middle East, and that will be a topic over the coming months.
    


            But for now, let's focus on these first halting steps and welcome the scenes of hostages coming out of Gaza – all of them – together with those of Gazans celebrating relief from the war Hamas started. It's a day many believed would never come and one delivered by the old-fashioned art of persistent diplomacy.

Live Updates


• Hearings latest: A hearing in a California court over deploying National Guard troops to Oregon has adjourned. Meanwhile, in Chicago, a judge is hearing arguments as the city and state contend that President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the city.
    


• The courtroom showdowns: The hearings could determine the fate of Trump's National Guard deployments in two major American cities, potentially setting a precedent for future federal intervention in local law enforcement and civil liberties.
    


            • National Guard in Chicago: Texas guardsmen have started their mission in the greater Chicago area, according to US Northern Command, as Illinois lawyers argue Trump is exceeding his authority in federalizing them. About 500 National Guard members – 300 from Illinois and 200 from Texas – are tasked with protecting ICE and other personnel.
    


            • Portland: National Guard troops remain blocked by several court orders from deploying in Oregon. State officials and the Trump administration argued in a California court today over whether troops from other states should be allowed to deploy in Oregon.
    


• Anti-ICE protests continue: Rallies outside ICE facilities in Broadview, a Chicago suburb, and in Portland go on despite large perimeters and heavy security. The Trump administration is tying planned deployments in Chicago and Portland to the increasingly tense protests after weeks of pushing an effort to fight crime in what the president has described as violence-ridden Democratic-led cities.
    


            An appeals court hearing on whether the Trump administration should be blocked from federalizing the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland has concluded.
    


            The hearing, originally scheduled for 40 minutes, lasted more than an hour as the three judges pressed both sides with questions about the law and the impact of the protests on federal agents.
    


            “The case will be taken under advisement, and we'll respond as quickly as we're able,” said Judge Ryan D. Nelson.
    


            President Donald Trump should first consider more law enforcement options to deal with protests in Portland, Oregon, before sending a military presence, the state said in arguments before an appellate court Thursday.
    


            Federal law enforcement has plenty of officers who could respond to any perceived threat before the need for the National Guard, said Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin.
    


            ”We have a ton of law enforcement agencies under the President's control,” Chaffin said, adding that responding to threats “is their job. That's what they do.”
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee – pushed back, adding that it is counterintuitive to suggest the City of Portland can tell the president how to respond to threats.
    


                    ”The problem that I have with this argument, that I'm just trying to struggle with is, the President gets to direct his resources as he deems fit,” Nelson said. ”It just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say, ‘No, you need to do it differently.'”
                





            An appeals court judge who strongly challenged concerns from the state of Oregon about the legality of National Guard deployment to a Portland ICE facility also acknowledged worries about a dangerous precedent being set.
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said he was not “trying to diminish” concerns to arguments that the National Guard's deployment is a “slippery slope” when pushing back on several arguments from Oregon's attorney.
    


            “I'm not trying to diminish that,” Nelson said of the concern of unlawful use of troops. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now.”
    


            “All we have is a document that says, ‘We have a federal facility under attack or that violence has forced to close down, and we want to protect it,'” Nelson added. “That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused local and state law enforcement officials she met with in Portland of being “dishonest” and “disingenuous” in remarks during Thursday's Cabinet meeting at the White House.
    


            “I was in Portland, went out back with the governor, the mayor, met with the chief of police and the superintendent of the highway patrol,” Noem said.
    


                    “They are all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people. Because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response.” 
                





            Noem visited Portland Tuesday, meeting with local officials and touring an ICE facility just days after a Trump-appointed judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon.
    


            The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers.
    


            National Guard troops remain blocked by court orders from deploying in Oregon as state officials and the Trump administration argue in a California court today over whether troops from any state should be allowed.
    


            The attorney representing the state of Oregon and city of Portland in their legal battle against the Trump administration said protests in Portland do not rise to a level that gives the president the legal right to send the military.
    


            In attempting to focus on the legal definition of rebellion used to justify the National Guard's deployment, Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin said rebellions “are unusual and extreme emergencies.”
    


            “If we're comparing it to an invasion from a foreign power, that's something that goes to the heart of the safety of our country,” Chaffin said.
    


            A situation should be considered a rebellion when circumstances arise “which may be vital to the existence of the Union,” she added.
    


            Chaffin argued that any difficulties federal agents have experienced carrying out the laws are due to a lack of personnel more than violence.
    


            “We have declarations (from federal officers) that say ‘we're short staffed,'” Chaffin said.
    


            “(The argument that) we're having administrative difficulties because we don't have enough people – that is not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other city in the United States,” Chaffin said.
    


            Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said there doesn't need to be an “actual rebellion” for President Donald Trump to federalize the National Guard, and their deployment is lawful.
    


            The plaintiff's argument that the move targets sanctuary city laws is “wrong,” Hamilton said.
    


            “The argument also makes no sense when considering the federalization of Guardsmen in California,” he said, adding the force has since been responsibly “drawn down.”
    


            As the state of Oregon began its argument in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals over whether President Donald Trump can federalize the Oregon National Guard to deploy to Portland, an attorney almost immediately got into a dispute over the severity of protests at an ICE processing facility that has been the site of protests for months.
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee to the appellate court – shot back when Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin cited the lower court's finding that protests at the Portland ICE facility were small and peaceful, calling it “clearly erroneous.”
    


            Chaffin said the judge who put deployments on hold found “that the Portland ICE facility protests were small, less than 30 people, largely sedate and generally peaceful.”
    


            “Okay, hold on that,” Nelson said. “I mean that that's clearly erroneous, because there's clearly been protests that were above 30. Unless you're trying to limit it to certain time periods, we have evidence in the record that there were protests as much as 200.”
    


            “It was generally small,” Chaffin said.
    


            The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers.
    


            DOJ attorney Eric McArthur said the Trump administration believes the National Guard can be mobilized in response to violence and threats against federal agents.
    


            “The legal question,” McArthur said, is whether the law “authorizes the president to call up the National Guard when violence and threats of violence directed at federal officials and facilities has significantly impeded federal law enforcement and required an unsustainable diversion of the regular forces in order to contain it.”
    


            McArthur said the administration does not disagree with the lower court judge's factual findings about the case, but says the dispute is over “whether that risk suffices to invoke the statute” allowing President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard.
    


            Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur argued that deploying troops in Portland is legally justified, saying 115 federal officers have been sent to protect the city's ICE facility.
    


            “The key evidence in this case,” McArthur said, is “the violence, the threats of violence that have occurred at this facility, and the unsustainable and unsafe, diverse diversion of the government's limited protective resources that has been necessary to contain the violence there.”
    


            Those officers, part of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service — which specializes in protecting federal buildings — have been stretched too thin in guarding the facility, McArthur said, and “are not equipped to deal with this kind of ongoing, sustained unrest.”
    


            “While the officers are expected to be able to respond to emergencies, they are not expected to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, which has become the norm,” he added.
    


            An attorney for Chicago and the state of Illinois said some of the conduct by protesters against officials is, “of course deplorable,” and the defendants are asking for a degree of deference.
    


            The case is not about what the president says in the media and on social media, and the court should “take the president at his word when it has been unfiltered by his attorneys.”
    


            What the president has done to Illinois is “lawless,” the attorney said. “We ask the court to rest the balance in Illinois.”
    


            An appeals court panel quickly got into legal details of when a president can take control of the National Guard during Thursday's hearing over efforts to deploy troops to Portland, Oregon, asking a Trump administration attorney what he thinks the word “rebellion” means in the law.
    


            “I think one defined the term to mean a deliberate, organized resistance by force and arms to the laws and operations of the government,” Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur said.
    


            Leaders in Oregon and Portland have said the unrest outside an ICE building in Portland does not constitute a riot that could give President Donald Trump power to federalize the Oregon National Guard.
    


            “The statute doesn't actually require any rioting, contemporaneous or otherwise, in order for the president to be able to invoke this statute,” said McArthur.
    


            An attorney for the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago rejected White House arguments for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago as “audacious.”
    


            “Rebellion. Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” he said. He went on to say, “There is no rebellion in Illinois,” an attorney for the state said.
    


            “That is such an audacious claim,” the attorney said.
    


            A three-judge appeals panel is now hearing arguments from the Trump administration, which says a lower court order that blocks the president's federalization of the Oregon National Guard should be overturned.
    


            A military presence is necessary at an ICE facility in Portland in order to “contain the violence,” according to Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur.
    


            “For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,” McArthur said.
    


            A federal judge in Chicago is hearing from both sides as the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois argue President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the Windy City.
    


            Unlike Portland, the judge in the Chicago case declined to issue a temporary restraining order immediately, noting she didn't have time to go through hundreds of pages of legal filings.
    


            While the Federal Protective Service has authority in most federal buildings, the US Marshals Service – not the National Guard – has primary responsibility for security at the Chicago courthouse where today's hearing will be held, the city's federal court chief judge said in a statement today.
    


            “At no point did I, nor did the Building Security Committee authorize or request the National Guard's assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall said in a statement to CNN.
    


            The judge has added additional security measures, “to allow court operations to proceed, but those measures do not include the National Guard at the Dirksen Courthouse,” she said, adding the courthouse remains open and accessible for all matters.
    


Remember: Members of the Texas National Guard have already deployed in the greater Chicago area, an official said Wednesday night, as lawyers prepare for critical court hearings on federalized troops.
    


            With its history of protest and progressive politics, Portland, Oregon, has been a target of President Donald Trump since his first term.
    


            Unlike other Democratic-run cities where the president has tried to send federal troops, the Pacific Northwest city isn't even among the nation's 30 largest metro areas.
    


            Despite Trump's claims that federal troops are needed because the city is “war-ravaged,” Portland did not rank among the 30 U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates last year, according to the Real Time Crime Index — and its violent crime numbers have been dropping.
    


            Trump said he would be watching Portland closely since 2018, when demonstrators set up outside an ICE facility in the city.
    


            Protests erupted in the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020, with thousands rallying for more than 100 days. Without approval from local leaders, Trump sent more than 700 officers from federal agencies. Oregon's attorney general at the time sued the federal government in response.
    


            As protests have continued in the city this year over the administration's immigration actions, Trump escalated his response by calling in National Guard troops. The protests are ongoing, as a legal battle unfolds over Trump's federalization of the National Guard in Oregon.
    


            National Guardsmen were seen Thursday morning patrolling the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.
    


            CNN is at the scene and captured video of two guardsmen making laps around the facility.
    


            Overnight, Texas National Guard troops were seen entering the building. Some wheeled luggage while others carried riot shields as they arrived at the facility.
    


            A defense official said Thursday that a small contingent of California National Guardsmen are joining the Texas National Guard and Illinois National Guard in Illinois to assist with ongoing pre-mission training.
    


            Separately, in a declaration filed in federal court Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Niave Knell wrote that 14 members of the California Guard had arrived in Illinois on October 7 to assist with the training.
    


            CNN reported Wednesday that 200 Texas National Guard and 300 Illinois National Guard were assembling in the Chicago area on Tuesday, the same day the California troops arrived.
    


            The defense official said the group of California Guardsmen were sharing best practices and lessons learned from their mobilization in Los Angeles over the summer. The California Guardsmen are working in coordination with US Army North, the defense official said.
    


            Troops from the Texas National Guard were seen entering the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, near Chicago, overnight, as a federal judge is preparing to hear arguments on whether a military callup is legal.
    


            Video taken by a freelance journalist showed men in fatigues with a Texas National Guard patch and carrying riot shields and luggage entering the facility, which has been a flashpoint for clashes between protesters and federal law enforcement. Two Guardsmen appeared to be adding fuel to a generator.
    


            The Texas Guardsmen are now deployed on their official mission of protecting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel in the Chicago area, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday night.
    


            Texas troops were seen earlier this week staging at an Army training facility in Elwood, about 40 miles from the ICE building. A photo tweeted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this week showed guardsmen carrying riot shields as they prepared to board a transport plane.
    


            Judge April Perry declined earlier this week to issue an order that would block the National Guard deployment in Chicago, saying she first wanted to hear arguments from both sides at a hearing Thursday.
    


            As major courtroom decisions loom today to determine whether National Guard deployments will go forward, the key question is: Who gets to make that decision? CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said.
    


                    “We've seen reasonable people disagree about whether the situations … on the ground in Portland, in Chicago, constitute an emergency or not,” Honig said. “The key question becomes when will the court actually come in and overrule the president?”
                





For context: Texas Guardsmen have started their mission in the Chicago area, according to US Northern Command. Meanwhile, National Guard troops are still blocked through court orders in Oregon.
    


            The judge who's going to be hearing the case in Illinois today has told both parties the court wants details about when, where and how the troops will be deployed, Honig said.
    


            As for talk of President Donald Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, Honig said he thinks “that's more just lurking in the background as a next step,” adding, “the president might take a more dramatic invocation of law that actually would involve the entire military, not just the National Guard.”

            Hot Stocks 





            Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has propelled markets to record highs this year. But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.
    


            AI has been the dominant theme in markets since 2022, when OpenAI first launched ChatGPT. Optimism has since spread among investors about a potential transformative AI boom, and enormous amounts of money have flowed into tech stocks. Valuations have risen to historically expensive levels.
    


            To some analysts and economists, those are red flags that the market might be in a bubble — when investors bid up stock prices beyond what they're worth, creating an unsustainable rally that often results in a significant downturn, as seen during the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000.
    


            “Fired up by optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI, global equity prices are surging,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Wednesday.
    


            “Today's valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” Georgieva said. “If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth.”
    


            Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said he thinks “AI is real,” but some money being invested now will “probably” be wasted.
    


            “Take AI, there's a lot of money going into it,” Dimon said in an interview with the BBC. “AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off. But most people involved in them didn't do well.”
    


            Dimon also said he thinks there is a higher chance of a meaningful drop in stocks in the next six months to two years than what is being reflected in the market.
    


            “I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others.”
    


            “The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal,” he said, adding that geopolitics and government debt burdens are contributing to the uncertain outlook.
    


            Big tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and infrastructure to build out and power AI, and have earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for more spending.
    


            These companies' earnings results continue to impress Wall Street, supporting elevated valuations and the rally in stocks.
    


            Yet some investors said there are questions about whether the spending and AI aspirations will eventually generate enough returns to justify the enormous buildout.
    


            Concerns are growing about whether it is sustainable and what the fallout might be if there is a significant drop in stocks.
    


            Concerns about a potential bubble intensified in recent weeks as AI stars like Nvidia and OpenAI announced deals with circular financing that raised eyebrows that the top players might be propping up the market.
    


            The rise in valuations and emergence of circular financing are among aspects that “rhyme with previous bubbles,” according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.
    


            “While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” the strategists said in a note.
    


Yet another OpenAI financial entanglement is renewing fears of a repeat of the dot-com era



            Despite concerns, anything related to AI has been in high demand. OpenAI on Monday announced a new deal with chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), sending AMD's shares soaring almost 24%.
    


            The rally has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble. However, investors said there is a key difference: Big Tech companies now are actually profitable and delivering strong earnings results.
    


            “Unlike the 1990s tech bubble that featured soaring stocks from unprofitable early-stage companies, strong mega-cap company earnings are driving this year's rally,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management, said in a note.
    


            Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said the market is signaling “bubble light” territory. He said investor sentiment has not yet reached the levels of exuberance that would signal the market is at peak risk levels.
    


            “Valuations, positioning and flows are all certainly signaling that we're in bubble light territory, but sentiment has just not got there yet,” Mullaney said. “And so this thing could still run.”
    


            Big Tech is an increasingly influential part of the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies' market value. As AI-related stocks have carried the market to record highs, they have also become a more significant part of people's 401(k) retirement plans.
    


            While the rapid growth of tech stocks lets individual investors and people saving for retirement take part in companies' gains, it leaves people vulnerable to a potential extended drawdown if a bubble bursts.
    


            Just seven stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for 55% of the S&P 500's gains since the end of 2022, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
    


            The Bank of England on Wednesday said the risk of a sharp downturn in the stock market has increased.
    


            “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” the bank said in a quarterly report.
    


            “This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” the bank said.
    


            In 1996, then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan famously asked whether “irrational exuberance” might be taking hold in financial markets.
    


            While Greenspan warned that the stock market could be running too hot on emotion, the dot-com bubble peak did not happen until four years later in 2000.
    


            Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on September 23 said stocks are “fairly highly valued,” drawing comparisons to his predecessor's comments 30 years ago.
    


            Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note: “Is the stock market back on the road to the same irrational exuberance that inflated the Tech Bubble of 1999, which was followed by the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s? Perhaps.”
    


            “However, the S&P 500 has been driven to new highs this year by better-than-expected earnings,” Yardeni said. “We are still targeting the S&P 500 to get to 7,700 by the end of next year.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","What to watch in the only debate of the Virginia governor's race","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/virginia-governor-debate-what-to-watch","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:00:53 GMT","


            The only debate in the Virginia governor's race is likely to focus on a candidate who won't be on stage: Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, who suggested in text messages that a Republican colleague be shot in the head.
    


            Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears are set to square off Thursday night in their first and only scheduled debate. The two will debate at Norfolk State University, with early voting already underway for nearly three weeks and Election Day on November 4 approaching.
    


            Spanberger and other prominent Democrats have condemned Jones' texts and violence in politics but stopped short of calling on him to drop out of the race. Earle-Sears has pounced on Spanberger's reaction to the controversy.
    


            Here's more on that and other key issues to watch for Thursday night. The debate starts at 7 p.m. Eastern.
    


            Earle-Sears is certain to look to pin Spanberger down on the Jones texts, first published by the National Review and later obtained by CNN. How Spanberger responds could determine whether efforts to link her to her ticket-mate remain potent through the rest of the governor's race.
    


            In a new 30-second ad Earle-Sears launched Tuesday, a narrator highlights Jones' texts and says Spanberger “stands with him, not us.”
    


            The Jones texts have come at a critical time for Earle-Sears, who has trailed Spanberger throughout the race and faced GOP criticism over how she's run her campaign.
    


            The Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which endorsed Spanberger while backing Republicans for lieutenant governor and attorney general, issued a statement Wednesday calling on Jones not to take office if he were to win.
    


            The federal government shutdown is especially impactful in Virginia, home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Rather than weighing in on the debate over health care spending that's led to the impasse, Spanberger has focused on Trump's threats to withhold pay from furloughed workers.
    


            She's linked Earle-Sears to Trump, pointing to the Department of Government Efficiency's cuts to the federal workforce, which slashed jobs in Virginia. Spanberger said in a statement Tuesday that Earle-Sears “has backed President Trump's job-killing and price-hiking agenda at every turn.”
    


            Earle-Sears has blamed Democrats for the shutdown, pointing to Democratic senators' opposition to a short-term spending bill and saying Spanberger should lobby the state's two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, to vote to pass such a measure.
    


            “Every House member who's a Republican voted for it, and every senator who's a Republican voted for it. Come on, Abigail, don't be a coward on this,” Earle-Sears said in an interview with WTOP last week.
    


            Earle-Sears has blanketed Virginia's airwaves with ads accusing Spanberger of being for “they/them,” a reference to nonbinary individuals that mimics the attacks Trump used against former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race.
    


            While Spanberger has focused on economic issues, Earle-Sears has leaned into the cultural divide, hoping to paint Spanberger as out of touch and undermine her messaging on economics and health care. She has repeatedly attacked Spanberger for not answering whether she agrees that trans youth should be able to use any bathroom in a school building or play on a sports team that corresponds with their gender identity.
    


            The candidates could both be put on the spot on trans issues Thursday night.
    


            Whether Earle-Sears' attacks will work is a question both parties will be watching closely. Polls have consistently found the economy and affordability at the top of Americans' list of concerns. But Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won four years ago on a message that emphasized parents' rights in schools and a vow to end the teaching of critical race theory.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.

In August, a Miami jury found that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology — which is different than full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages. 

Tesla said it would appeal the decision.

The new probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.

The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.




Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a “summon” technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed. 

Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla apparently has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.

NHTSA investigations can often lead to recalls.

Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not only fixed such glitches but have made them so good drivers don't even need to look out the window anymore. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.

Tesla shares fell 2% Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, both Democrats, should be jailed as they oppose his deployment of National Guard troops for his immigration and crime crackdown in the nation's third-largest city.

Aerial footage showed a large group of demonstrators marching through downtown Chicago Wednesday night, in the wake of President Donald Trump's deployment of federal troops to an Army training center outside the city.

Illinois urged a judge Thursday to order the National Guard to stand down in the Chicago area, calling the deployment a constitutional crisis and suggesting the Trump administration gave no heed to the pending legal challenge when it sent troops overnight to an immigration enforcement building.

The government “plowed ahead anyway,” attorney Christopher Wells of the state attorney general's office said. “Now, troops are here.”

Wells' arguments opened an extraordinary hearing in federal court in Chicago. The city and the state, run by Democratic elected leaders, say President Donald Trump has exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the Guard off the streets.

Heavy public turnout at the downtown courthouse caused officials to open an overflow room with a video feed of the hearing.

U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness.” He noted an incident last weekend in which a Border Patrol vehicle was boxed in and an agent shot a woman in response.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They're not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

He said some people were wearing gas masks, a suggestion they were poised for a fight, but U.S. District Judge April Perry countered that it might be justified to avoid tear gas at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago.

“I, too, would wear a gas mask,” the judge said, “not because I'm trying to be violent but because I'm trying to protect myself.”

Hamilton also tried to narrow the issues. He said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field — not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

Guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and have been activated for 60 days. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a legal challenge to President Trump's Chicago-area National Guard deployment.

Some Guard troops could be seen behind portable fences at the ICE building in Broadview. It has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents, but the scene was peaceful, with few people present. 

Police noticed troops apparently sleeping “undisturbed” in vans Wednesday night, Broadview said in a statement.

“We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night's sleep, too,” the village said.

Chicago and Illinois filed a lawsuit Monday to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. Trump has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show significant reductions this year.

In a court filing, the city and state say protests at the ICE building in Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

The deployment “is the latest episode in a broader campaign by the President's administration to target jurisdictions the President dislikes,” they said.

The Republican president said Wednesday that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court was scheduled to hear arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building. Like in Illinois, state and city leaders insist troops are neither wanted nor needed there.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Portland. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed an appeals court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor Paul Young said Guard members would begin patrolling Friday. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports using the Guard.

Israel and Hamas agreed to pause fighting in Gaza to free the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, accepting elements of a plan put forward by the Trump administration. Speaking in India, Keir Starmer praised the “tireless diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, the United States, and many others, in securing this crucial first step.”

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — World leaders on Thursday expressed hope for peace and urged Israel and Hamas to fulfill their commitments in the hours after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the parties had agreed to the “first phase” of a deal signaling a major breakthrough in the two-year war in Gaza.

Hamas will release all 20 living hostages in the coming days in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while the Israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of Gaza. 

“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” Trump wrote on social media.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media: “With God's help we will bring them all home.”

Here's how other leaders responded. 

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country played a role in the negotiations, hailed the agreement. He thanked Trump in a statement on X for “demonstrating the necessary political will,” as well as Qatar and Egypt for facilitating the deal.

“I extend my heartfelt greetings to my Palestinian brothers and sisters who have endured indescribable suffering for two years,” Erdogan said, adding that Turkey would closely monitor the full implementation of the agreement.

Erdogan later said that Turkey hoped to participate in any task force that would be responsible for overseeing the ceasefire agreement. Getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, ensuring the exchange of hostages and prisoners, and pressing Israel to stop its military actions and “retreat to the designated lines” were of utmost importance, he added.




President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi hailed the deal between Israel and Hamas as a “historic moment.”

“This agreement does not only close the chapter of war; it also opens the door of hope for the peoples of the region for a future defined by justice and stability,” el-Sissi wrote on social media.

Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, after phone calls from his European counterparts, expressed hope that the deal would start a “new chapter in the region, one in which the Palestinian and Israeli people enjoy security and stability, opening the door to a just and lasting peace between them.”

Syria's Foreign Ministry welcomed the ceasefire announcement and expressed hope the development would pave the way “for a phase of regional stability.” 

The ministry also praised the mediation role of Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and the U.S.

The UAE, which struck a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel in 2020, praised the move toward a ceasefire, saying it hoped it would “constitute a positive step toward ending the humanitarian suffering in Gaza” while moving toward a two-state solution.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said that the U.N. “will support the full implementation of the agreement and will scale up the delivery of sustained and principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery and reconstruction efforts in Gaza.”

He urged all “to seize this momentous opportunity to establish a credible political path forward” toward “recognizing the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, and achieving a two-state solution that enables Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.”

China hoped for a “lasting and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun saying that President Xi Jinping's government expects the agreement to ease the “humanitarian crisis” in Gaza and calm tensions in the Middle East.

“We are ready to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue and the realization of peace and stability in the Middle East,” he said, noting that China advocates for a two-state solution.

President Emmanuel Macron said that the agreement is a “great hope for the hostages and their families, for the Palestinians in Gaza, and for the entire region.”

Macron commended “the efforts of President @realDonaldTrump, as well as the Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators who helped make it happen,” and called on the warring parties “to strictly uphold” the terms of the deal.

Macron also said on X that European and Arab countries' foreign ministers will discuss the deal in Paris later Thursday. “This agreement must mark the end of the war and the beginning of a political solution based on the two-state solution,” he said.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed the agreement and urged an immediate lifting of restrictions on aid.

Speaking while on a trade mission to India, Starmer praised the “tireless diplomatic efforts” of the mediators and said the U.K. will support efforts to turn the ceasefire into a “sustainable path” to long-term peace.

“This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years,” he said.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the agreement and said that he was hopeful for a full deal this week.

Merz said that the developments are encouraging and that “hopes regarding Israel and the Gaza Strip increased again last night, but this is not yet really concluded, so we are of course watching the situation very closely and remain optimistic.”

The kingdom's foreign ministry expressed “hope that this important step will lead to urgent action to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, a complete Israeli withdrawal, the restoration of security and stability and the initiation of practical steps to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.”

Jordan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, praised the efforts of Egypt, Qatar and the United States and thanked Turkey for its role in the deal. 

Safadi stressed the need for aid to enter Gaza, and said Jordan was ready to resume aid deliveries. 

President Joseph Aoun said that he hoped the initial agreement would “constitute a first step toward a permanent ceasefire and an end to the humanitarian suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people in Gaza.”

Aoun called for “continued international and regional efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people” and for Israel to “halt its aggressive policies in Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria.”

“I want to take the opportunity to say that I will sign the candidacy of Donald J. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to international peace,” Argentine President Javier Milei posted on X. 

“Any other leader with similar achievements would have received it a long time ago,” the libertarian leader and Trump ally wrote.

LAPD Lieutenant Guy Golan said that the victims were 'ruthlessly shot multiple times' regarding the murder of Robin Kaye and her husband Thomas Deluca.

Four people have been found dead in a multimillion-dollar home in San Francisco as police investigate their ""suspicious"" deaths. 

The gruesome scene was discovered at 1:23 p.m. Wednesday when officers conducted a welfare check on the 900 block of Monterey Boulevard in the affluent neighborhood, the San Francisco police said.

The four victims, believed to be family members who lived in the home, were pronounced dead at the scene. Two sources told KTVU-TV that the incident is being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, though San Francisco police said they are treating it as a case of suspicious deaths. 

""This is a very rare occurrence in this neighborhood,"" Officer Robert Rueca, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), told the local outlet. ""This area rarely sees any type of activity close to this.""

NEW PHOTO REVEALS SLAIN QUEENS COUPLE ATTACKED IN BRUTAL HOME INVASION; SUSPECT CHARGED WITH MURDER

The department's homicide unit is leading the investigation, but police have not classified the case as of Thursday morning.

The family had two girls, one who was around 12 or 13 years old, neighbors told ABC 7 San Francisco. Neighbors told KTVU-TV that the family had moved into the affluent neighborhood a year ago and would regularly decorate for the holidays.

""We didn't hear anything or notice something unusual. They were a quiet family,"" said Belinda, who lives next door and has lived in the neighborhood for three years.

President Donald Trump announces the National Guard will be deployed to Chicago and touts the success of his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has spent weeks criticizing President Donald Trump's threats to deploy National Guard troops to the city — a stance that some Republicans call a sharp reversal from the Democratic Party's long-held opposition to ""states' rights"" arguments.

While the legality of Trump's actions remains to be seen — his federalization efforts are being reviewed by several federal and appeals courts this week — the move has sparked a fierce debate across party lines. Democrats, for their part, have denounced the move as unlawful and beyond the scope of Trump's authority.

""The president has declared war on poor people,"" Johnson said during a press conference, responding to Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to Chicago. His comments followed a series of warnings from Democratic governors and mayors who argue that federalizing Guard units is both unnecessary and an unlawful intrusion into local authority.

Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators argue that Democrats are contradicting their past stance on state sovereignty. ""Democrats were out of touch with reality the moment they said they don't need President Trump's help; everything is fine in Chicago,"" Gianno Caldwell, a Chicago native and founder of the Caldwell Institute of Public Safety, told Fox News Digital.

 PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

""When you look at the numbers, you look at the crime, 75% of the murders that are committed in Chicago are going unsolved. Seventy-five percent — that is a serious issue, a systemic issue that Chicagoans are dealing with on a daily basis,"" Caldwell said.

Caldwell also pointed to a 2012 clash over the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which required local police to share fingerprint data with federal immigration agents. Republicans at the time accused Obama of hypocrisy for suing Arizona over strict immigration enforcement while taking no action against Democratic-led Chicago and Cook County, which sought to limit cooperation with federal authorities.

But others disagree, especially on claims of hypocrisy. ""However you want to characterize it,"" the accusations of hypocrisy ""are a symptom of the poverty of our current political debate,"" George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County told Fox News Digital in an interview.

""A lot of liberal Democrats, not conservative Democrats, in the 1960s, 1950s, and before that, were critics of states' rights because segregationists were using the principle of federalism or states' rights as a sort of ‘watchword' to protect segregation,"" Musgrove said. 

""Today, the president is walking away from the idea of states' rights because he wants to punish Democratic cities,"" Musgrove said. 

Trump, for his part, has characterized the actions as necessary to crack down on violent crime and to help carry out his administration's policy priorities, including immigration enforcement.

But Democratic mayors, including Johnson, have rejected the notion that their cities are in the throes of violence necessary to warrant a military response. Johnson has emphasized the progress Chicago has made in reducing violent crime. (Homicides in Chicago have fallen 28% so far in 2025 compared to the same point last year, according to data from the city's police department, and down by roughly 50% compared to 2020, when violent crime in many major U.S. cities peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic.) 

Ultimately, Musgrove told Fox News Digital, the question of ""hypocrisy"" is too simplistic and fails to capture the broader context, principles and policies at stake in a given political moment.

""It obscures what we're really talking about. It walks away from the question of whether or not what the president is doing is legal,"" he said.

""And it sort of shifts to this issue of hypocrisy, rather than dealing first with the fact [of whether] this is a legal question that can be decided in a court of law, based on legal principles.""

To that end, more clarity is expected soon. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is slated to review Trump's ability to deploy troops to Oregon on Thursday — and regardless of how they rule, the matter is widely expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Trump also has the ability to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that gives the president additional powers in a national emergency.

Invoking that law would bring to the fore a whole host of new legal considerations, and Trump has suggested he would invoke the law if needed as recently as this week.

""If I had to enact it, I'd do it,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.""

Democratic leaders have also vowed to take action of their own to combat what they describe as unlawful overreach by Trump. Both California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker threatened Monday to withdraw their states from the National Governors' Association if the group fails to condemn Trump's deployment of other states' National Guard troops to their jurisdictions.

Asked by reporters Tuesday about the troop deployment, Trump defended his decision, saying only: ""If you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.""

""And if the governor can't do the job, we will do the job,"" he added.

Ryan Clark, Pat McAfee and Scott Van Pelt gave strong reactions to the evidence that attempted to prove Kyren Lacy innocent of allegedly causing a fatal wreck last year.

However, when Louisiana State Police issued their own surveillance to defend their findings that Lacy's ""reckless operation"" eventually led to a 78-year-old man's death, they walked back their earlier sentiments.

Upon seeing the video, Van Pelt said Monday night that he could not ""recall ever seeing something that made me react viscerally to the point that I felt like my hands were trembling.""

""There is video to show this is not what happened, and this young man took his life,"" Van Pelt said of Lacy, who died by suicide in April.

Clark said Lacy ""died having to live with the guilt and the consequences of a guilty man, knowing he was innocent,"" and ""police… tried to coerce and doctor and use ways to manipulate statements that put this young man behind bars.""

On Wednesday, after police released their findings, Van Pelt issued a monologue on his ESPN show, apologizing ""for the incomplete reaction that aired on this show Monday night.""

""Lacy faced several charges, including felony negligent homicide, but died by suicide days before a grand jury was set to convene — meaning his guilt or innocence will never be determined in a criminal court. The one certainty here is that this was a senseless tragedy in December, magnified by a second life lost in April,"" Van Pelt added.

On Thursday's edition of ""First Take,"" Clark said ""it's always important to me that I gather all factual and important information to provide the complete story... and when discussed in real time on Monday evening, I failed to do so. And for that, I apologize.""

McAfee, after seeing Lacy's attorney's claims, said he ""didn't do it"" and ""we gotta get that s--- right,"" via OutKick.

""We thought we had more context. Now, more video has been made available and it shows even more context. It shows Kyren Lacy driving on the wrong side of the road and could have easily made the case that he caused the car to swerve and the tragic accident. We apologize for adding any more heat. We will continue to stay on top of the news breakings and this story. This is tragically sad and involves an athlete's legacy,"" McAfee also said Tuesday.

FORMER PENN STATE, OHIO STATE PLAYER CHARGED WITH HOMICIDE, DUI AFTER GIRLFRIEND DIES IN FATAL ATV CRASH

Louisiana State Police released a ""Critical Incident Briefing Video"" that appeared to show that Lacy was driving at ""a high rate of speed, passing three passenger vehicles and one loaded 18-wheeler in a designated no-passing zone with a 40 mph posted speed limit.

The briefing video showed bodycam footage of one witness — the driver of the 18-wheeler — saying Lacy caused the wreck. That witness said the driver of a gold truck traveling north slammed on the brakes as Lacy's Charger approached southbound, causing a female driver in a Kia Cadenza behind the gold truck to swerve into the southbound lane to avoid the truck. The Cadenza then crashed into the Kia Sorrento carrying Herman Hall, which was traveling south. Hall died as a result of his injuries.

""The gold truck traveling north veered right to avoid a head-on collision with the green Charger. As the gold truck veered right, the driver of the Kia Cadenza saw the approaching green charger. In reaction, the Kia Cadenza driver swerved left into the southbound lane and impacted a northbound Kia Sorrento,"" police said, adding that the driver of the gold truck ""reacted appropriately"" to avoid a crash with Lacy. 

Lacy's attorney Matt Ory said Lacy could not have caused the crash, considering he was nearly a football field's distance away from the wreck by the time he got back into the correct lane.

""At the time of impact, he's 72.6 yards behind the vehicles at the time of impact. Key word: behind the vehicles. That is not how this story was ever painted. Never,"" Ory said.

However, police said, ""All evidence collected supports the conclusion that Lacy's reckless operation of the green Charger into oncoming traffic triggered the chain of events involving the other drivers, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.""

The 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discuss the latest on the feud between Gov. JB Pritzker and the Trump administration over the presence of federal troops amid the illegal immigration crackdown. 

A federal judge Tuesday ruled that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents violated a federal consent decree when arresting nearly two dozen illegal immigrants at the start of President Donald Trump's second term earlier this year.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings in Chicago federal court extended the consent decree that limits immigration agents' authority to make warrantless arrests until February 2026.

Cummings also ordered ICE to start making monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make each month.

The ACLU of Illinois and other Chicago immigration advocates sued the Department of Homeland Security and ICE in March, alleging that the January arrests of at least 22 people violated a 2022 consent decree that bans ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause.

""Today's decision makes clear that DHS and ICE — like everyone else — must follow the Constitution and the law,"" Michelle García, deputy legal director at the ACLU of Illinois and co-counsel in the case, said in a statement. ""The federal government's reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people — and then finding a justification for the action must end.""

Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., was the second 'Squad' member defeated in a primary in recent months. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: Former Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who just launched a comeback bid for her old seat, claimed she brought ""billions of dollars"" home to Missouri's 1st Congressional District while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, but public records reviewed by Fox News Digital tell a different story. 

During her failed re-election campaign last year, Bush's fundraising claims for St. Louis skyrocketed from $41 million to $2 billion in less than a month. 

""I'm proud to have delivered home over $2 BILLION and counting,"" Bush claimed on April 19, 2024. 

But less than a month prior, on March 28, 2024, Bush's campaign submitted language for an ad, which ran for a month beginning on April 3, 2024, touting just $41 million in ""community project funding since 2021."" Her campaign has not responded to Fox News Digital's request to explain the 4,778% increase. 

'SQUAD' DEM LAUNCHES COMEBACK HOUSE BID AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL VIEWS TORPEDOED CAMPAIGN: 'WE NEED A FIGHTER'

Federal contract and grant records published by the Departments of Defense and Justice and reviewed by Fox News Digital show that a majority of that funding came from those agencies.

While in Congress, Bush consistently voted against National Defense Authorization funding, which between Feb. 1, 2021, and May 1, 2024, included $48,812,351 in Department of Defense funding for research at Washington University, Saint Louis University and Vandeventer Place Research Foundation, which are all located in St. Louis. 

Bush's claim that she delivered more than $2 billion to her district seems to include the nearly $49 million in DOD research grants that she voted against. 

Through National Defense Authorization funding between 2021 and 2024, Missouri's 1st Congressional District also received at least $6,020,147 from the Department of Justice to increase police department headcounts, provide overtime pay or purchase new equipment.

The district also benefited from $1,286,634,821.76 in Defense Department contracts, primarily for missiles, military aircraft and drone purchases with The Boeing Company.

Bush was also one of six Democrats who voted against former President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which passed through Congress in 2021 as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). 

Much of the government funding that flowed into Bush's district during her tenure supported programs at odds with her progressive platform. 

Bush has a long record of calling to ""defund the police,"" and in 2020, also called to ""defund the Pentagon.""

The former ""Squad member"" announced last week that she is mounting a comeback congressional bid more than a year after losing her Democratic primary to a more moderate challenger.

While campaigning for re-election in May 2024, Bush said she was proud ""to have delivered more than $2 billion"" for Missouri's 1st Congressional District.

On Friday, while launching her comeback bid, Bush more ambiguously touted that she ""brought billions of dollars home directly to our community.""

""St. Louis deserves a leader who is built different,"" Bush announced in a video shared on social media. ""That's why I'm running to represent Missouri's 1st District in Congress. We need a fighter who will lower costs, protect our communities, and make life fairer. I'll be that fighter.""

The ""Squad"" member was ousted in the Democratic primary in Aug. 2024 by St. Louis County prosecutor Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who is a more moderate candidate and had the backing of pro-Israel groups that spent millions to unseat Bush. 

Democratic Majority for Israel President Brian Romick criticized Bush's inconsistency with her St. Louis fundraising numbers in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""Cori Bush lied to her constituents last year when she claimed she brought back billions to the district and it's brazen that instead of owning up to it, she just said it again in her launch video. Cori Bush lost because she was an ineffective Member of Congress and lies like this only remind the voters of that,"" Romick said. 

""I ran for Congress to change things for regular people,"" Bush said in the campaign launch video. ""I'm running again because St. Louis deserves leadership that doesn't wait for permission, doesn't answer to wealthy donors and doesn't hide when things get tough.""

Bush was first elected to Congress in Nov. 2020, quickly joining the ranks of the progressive ""Squad,"" including Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who were elected in 2018. 

The Missouri progressive was re-elected in 2022, but she became the second member of the ""Squad"" to lose her Democratic primary last year after Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., also lost to a more moderate pro-Israel Democrat. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Bush's campaign multiple times for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Antifa leaders flee America as Trump cracks down on domestic terrorist networks","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3843239/antifa-leaders-flee-america/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Several high-profile antifa leaders have fled the country or are actively making plans to abscond overseas.

News of their escape comes after President Donald Trump designated antifa as a domestic terrorist threat and directed federal authorities to dismantle terrorism networks operating within the United States.

Mark Bray, a financier of transnational antifa operations and antifa's foremost thought leader in America, announced he is fleeing to Europe, settling in Spain specifically, under the pretext of safety concerns following negative media attention.

THE MEDIA'S GO-TO ANTIFA ‘EXPERT' IS A FINANCIAL BACKER OF ANTIFA

Before his departure, Bray issued an apparent call-to-action, urging widespread militancy. “Only mass antifascism, legal or not, can save us,” Bray declared on Bluesky, a popular platform on the political Left.

Bray, an assistant professor at Rutgers University, will continue teaching classes on “Terrorism” and the “History of Antifascism” remotely, despite a Change.org petition from students calling for his firing.

Derisively dubbed “Dr. Antifa” by critics on campus, Bray openly supports far-left violence in his academic work. Bray's book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, is a how-to guide intended to serve as operational “reference” material for stamping out so-called fascism.

Half of his handbook's proceeds are funneled to the funding arm of Antifa International, which financially supports hundreds of affiliates around the world, including accredited antifa chapters in America, such as Atlanta Antifascists and the Central Oregon Anti-Fascist Action.

By way of its bail fund, Antifa International pays for an array of expenses, not just legal defense fees, from riot-related tactical gear to “emergency relocations.”

“As a precaution,” Antifa International has since shut down its donation infrastructure “to protect our donors and recipients.” The announcement mentioned relocating operations due to Trump's edict, suggesting that the global group's fundraising apparatus is based in the United States. Antifa International accepts donations through standing campaigns on Patreon, FundRazr, and the Action Network, all American fundraising sites.

Trump's clampdown on antifa includes prosecuting, as co-conspirators, individuals suspected of providing material support to terror-listed criminal enterprises.

U.S. intelligence officials are also investigating antifa's international ties and working toward a foreign terrorist classification for antifa abroad. Under U.S. anti-terrorism law, sponsors of foreign terrorists face up to 20 years behind bars, and the federal government can freeze assets, cutting off the funding flow, as part of counter-terrorism sanctions.

ANTIFA MAINTAINS TIES TO INTERNATIONAL NETWORK, AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EYES FOREIGN TERRORIST DESIGNATION

Bray is not the only expat among antifa's ranks seeking shelter in foreign countries.

Independent reporter Christian Peterson recently found the leaders of Rose City Antifa, the most notorious American antifa cell, holed up in Europe.

Caroline Victorin (née Gauld), one of the founding members of the Portland-based antifa faction, was discovered this week hiding with her husband, Johan Victorin, a Swedish-born activist and another Rose City Antifa architect, in the coastal town of Varberg, Sweden.

Together as co-founders of Rose City Antifa, the oldest-known antifa chapter in America, the Victorins reportedly had helped import the European model of antifascist extremism into the U.S.

Peterson, a Swedish investigative journalist covering far-left radicalism, confronted Johan Victorin, who has dual citizenship, outside their residence and asked whether the couple fears federal prosecution in the United States.

“You are a citizen of the United States. Are you afraid of being convicted of conspiracy yourself?” asked Peterson, according to an English translation of the interaction posted on Monday. Victorin refused to comment.

Rose City Antifa, a sophisticated organization with strict recruitment practices, has gone underground in fear of conspiracy charges, according to antifa expert Andy Ngo.

Over the years, Rose City Antifa has been linked to a string of attacks against political opponents and government property. At least one Rose City Antifa member is facing federal charges of felony assault on law enforcement for allegedly punching an officer in the face outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland. The crime carries up to eight years in federal prison.

ANTIFA INC: HOW AN IDEOLOGY BECAME AN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORK

Most recently, U.S. Homeland Security said Rose City Antifa is responsible for publishing the private information of ICE personnel, including posting their personal addresses online and on “wanted”-style public flyers, which allegedly solicited additional “tips” about individual ICE agents.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised to pursue anyone involved in illegal doxxing efforts against ICE officers. “We will prosecute those who dox ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law. These criminals are taking the side of vicious cartels and human traffickers,” Noem said in a statement. “We won't allow it in America.”

The nationwide Torch Anti-Fascist Network, which Rose City Antifa belongs to, claimed that DHS was spreading “a false conspiracy theory about our member crew.”

Today's statement about ""Fighting Back Against Antifa Violence"" from the DHS contains a false conspiracy theory about our member crew Rose City Antifa.RCA has not doxed any ICE agents, a fact confirmed by going to the URL DHS conveniently censored from their photo.RCA did not put up this flyer.

“RCA did not put up this flyer,” the Torch Network insisted. Authorities consider the Torch Network the “most radical” of antifa collectives, overseeing the accreditation and recognition of regional antifa chapters stationed all over America.

In a separate post, Rose City Antifa stated, “We are aware that our tipline email address was recently included on flyers identifying ICE agents. We applaud any efforts to unmask ICE's secret police, who we consider to be agents of state fascism.”

However, “we can't take credit for these flyers,” Rose City Antifa added.

The cell said its focus as a group is generally on fighting “local fascist activity.” While the cell “support[s] doxxing and any other actions that undermine ICE's blatant human rights abuses,” Rose City Antifa noted, “It is not within our capacity or purview to handle tips of this nature.”

The Senate rejected a Democratic-led effort Wednesday to block President Donald Trump from unilaterally ordering additional U.S. airstrikes on boats off the Venezuelan coast allegedly carrying drugs.

Democrats forced a vote in the GOP-controlled chamber under the War Powers Act on a resolution to require congressional authorization for future strikes, something the president says could expand to alleged foreign drug cartels on land. Trump has authorized four such strikes in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks.

The vote failed 48-51 and fell mostly along party lines, although several members cast votes across the aisle. A simple majority was required. 

Nearly all Democrats voted in favor of the measure, led by Sens. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Tim Kaine (D-VA). Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was the lone Democrat to vote against it, while Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a libertarian, was the lone Republican to vote in favor.

In the hours leading up to the vote, Secretary of State Marco Rubio lobbied Senate Republicans behind closed doors to defeat the resolution and laid out the president's authority to greenlight what he called “targeted strikes against imminent threats.”

“These drug trafficking organizations are a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States,” Rubio told reporters. “They unleash violence and criminality on our streets, fueled by the drugs and the drug profits that they make, and the president is the commander in chief, has an obligation to keep our country safe.”

TRUMP LOOKS TO PIVOT TO LAND DRUG TRAFFICKING AFTER DEADLY BOAT STRIKES

Paul, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, blasted the administration for a lack of transparency and due process when determining whether to kill suspected drug-runners in international waters.

“There's a one-in-four chance, statistically speaking, that one of these boats may not have had any drugs on it,” Paul said in floor remarks, citing statistics based on U.S. Coast Guard interdictions that do not turn up drugs. “We will never know because they were blown to smithereens.”

A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Oregon National Guard can remain under the Trump administration‘s control.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued the ruling, rebuking the efforts of Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR), who sought to prohibit her state's National Guard troops from being placed under the authority of President Donald Trump. However, the court's decision was not a total loss for Kotek, as it also ruled that troops were not yet allowed to be deployed to Portland, Oregon. The president desired to have troops assist with protecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from violent protesters and in crime prevention efforts.

The three-judge panel stayed the two orders issued by U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut over the weekend, which prohibited Trump from deploying National Guard troops from any state into Oregon. Wednesday's orders are temporary until the court hears arguments for justifications to deploy the National Guard to Portland, which are scheduled for Thursday at 9 a.m. local time, according to reports.

“An administrative stay of the October 4 temporary restraining order will maintain the federalization of Oregon National Guard members, because that order prohibits implementation of the Memorandum,” read court documents. “Additionally, the second temporary restraining order has not been challenged or appealed, and it prohibits the deployment of National Guard members in Oregon.” 

“Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed,” noted the court order.

Protesters have allegedly harassed and demonstrated against law enforcement officers for months at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. The Trump administration has claimed that many of the demonstrators have engaged in violence against ICE officers, necessitating the aforementioned federal deployment of National Guard troops. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, Oregon's governor, and many Democrats in and out of Oregon have rejected such claims, saying the protesters only amount to a small gathering and are mostly peaceful.

Immergut agreed with those suggesting the violence in Portland is minimal, ruling in two hearings over the weekend that the Trump administration did not have a basis to use National Guard troops in Portland. She also categorized the deployment as illegal.

“You have to have a colorable claim that Oregon conditions” require National Guard troop deployment, said Immergut. “You don't. We went over it.”   

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield praised the Ninth Circuit's order prohibiting National Guard troops in Portland.

CHICAGO HAS NO SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY

“Today's order from the Ninth Circuit doesn't change anything on the ground,” Rayfield said in a released statement. “While it keeps the Oregon National Guard under federal status, most importantly, [it] prevents the President from deploying the guard in Portland. That means no unnecessary federal escalation – and that's a win for Oregonians who want calm, not conflict in our communities.”

Thursday morning's hearing should provide legal clarity on Trump's authority to use the National Guard in Portland.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Three people have been killed in related shootings committed by a now-deceased suspect in the Houston area, police said on Wednesday.

The Houston Police Department is trying to determine a motive for the shooting spree as the investigation remains ongoing.

The suspect, while driving in a Houston suburb, fired multiple shots at a female driver in a road rage shooting around 1 p.m. Wednesday local time, police said. The first victim was pronounced dead at the hospital.

After fleeing the scene, police said the shooter then killed a mechanic and a witness around 1:45 p.m. while reportedly getting into an argument at the mechanic's shop. The witness started filming the suspect before he opened fire, killing the two men. The second shooting took place approximately 7 miles southeast of the first shooting.

The description of the shooter and the vehicle he drove matched in both incidents.

The suspect was found dead in his vehicle about 4 miles away around 2 p.m. He is believed to have turned the gun on himself and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Houston Police Department Lt. Larry Crowson said there is no known connection between the two shootings, only that these were committed by the same person.

“We just know that the guy was involved in the shooting there in Sugarland, drove to this location, went to the mechanic shop,” he told reporters. “I don't know if his car broke down. We don't know at this point. That's part of the investigation.”

SECOND VICTIM HAS DIED AFTER DALLAS ICE FACILITY SHOOTING

Authorities said there was no longer an active threat to the public.

Political strategists are raising questions about California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter's campaign to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after an unflattering interview resurfaced this week. 

In the CBS appearance, a palpably irritated Porter, viewed as the front-runner among six Democrats vying for the primary win, was scrutinized for threatening to end what she called an “unhappy” interview when pressed on whether she believes she needs the support of Republican voters to win the race. Porter's odds of winning the primary tanked by 20 percentage points, according to some betting markets, and analysts widely agreed it was a “bad night” for the candidate, as critics accused her of partisan, entitled, and generally unlikable behavior. 

Strategists across the board told the Washington Examiner that “one bad interview” isn't likely a “game-changer” for the race. 

But Elizabeth Ashford, a Los Angeles-based strategist who was chief of staff to former Vice President Kamala Harris during her during her time as California attorney general, suggested that while she doesn't see the interview as “a deal breaker moment at all,” campaigns will jump at the opportunity to leverage such incidents “anytime you have, you know, a human moment.” She added that it could send Porter's campaign spinning.

All five of Porter's Democratic rivals, as well as Republican challenger Steve Hilton, used the incident as an opportunity to dig into Porter's lead, issuing statements attacking her for “being afraid to answer simple questions,” “hiding from the press,” and “excluding any votes.” 

Lingering doubts about Porter's candidacy could aid liberal momentum to push Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) into the race, spelling danger for her in the crowded primary battle to win voters. Padilla's entrance into the race as a left-wing Democrat would likely pose the greatest threat to Porter's base, as she is viewed as one of the more liberal candidates campaigning.

“If the Democratic leadership doesn't think that Katie Porter is ready for prime time, [then there is] the push to get Padilla to enter the race,” Republican strategist Matt Clink told the Washington Examiner. “He could immediately become a front row.” 

“Katie Porter is clearly running far left of center,” he said. “So I think Padilla could come in, and he's got a carpet niche that would be left of center.” 

Padilla enjoys comparable name recognition to Porter, which strategists have said is the primary reason she's considered the front-runner. He also made headlines in June when he was detained during a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, garnering him support from liberals frustrated by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Challenges from Padilla and other rumored Democratic contenders, such as businessman Rick Caruso, might not be a problem if it weren't for California's open primary system.

In that structure, candidates for governor, regardless of their political party, are listed on the same ballot — with the top two candidates proceeding to the general election. The vote is already split between seven candidates, bringing the total to nine if Padilla and Caruso hop in. That means there's an ever-shrinking slice of voters for the crowded field of contenders to vie for.

Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff suggested that if controversy over Porter's likeability and media style persists, he believes “it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary,” giving rivals such as former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra a boost. 

“I do see [the CBS interview] perhaps not being a big deal,” he said. “At the same time, now, if there's  several other more current examples of this, where she continues to have moments like that, I do think it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary, especially because it is a competitive primary.”

Hours after Shroff made the comments, more footage of Porter losing it during a media interview resurfaced, adding fuel to the fire. The gubernatorial candidate is seen yelling, “Get out of my f***ing shot!” at a staff member who wandered into the background of an interview video she was recording, in resurfaced clips obtained by Politico. 

For Democrats disillusioned by Porter, “there are other options here, and there's still time,” Shroff said of alternatives, arguing that the race remains wide open as the primary election remains eight months away. 

Clink suggested that the open primary system spells warning signs for Porter's belief that she can pull off a win without the help of any Republican voters. 

“She's assuming that she makes it through the open primary to get into a general election, and then she can ignore Republican voters, but that's a big assumption on her part,” he said, adding she has only “focused Republican attention that OK, we know who they will never vote for Katie Porter now.”

“Let's say you only have two Republican candidates and you have seven or eight Democratic candidates. Let's say that the two Republican candidates split the Republican vote, and let's say that the seven Democratic candidates split the Democratic vote. It's not inconceivable that the top two finishers in the primary could be Republicans. If you just do simple math … I don't think that it's likely, but mathematically, it works,” Clink said.

While nearly 40% of Californians voted for President Donald Trump on the Republican side in the 2024 election, Porter has expressed full confidence that she can emerge as the victor in the governor's race next year because she believes most Democrats will coalesce behind her candidacy in the primary and leave the general election to her and a Republican candidate. With the state leaning majority-Democrat, Porter believes she can pull off a win. 

When asked what she would do if the race ended up between her and another Democrat, in which case the winning candidates would need to secure support of some moderates and Republicans, Porter replied, “I don't intend that to be the case. … I'm going to build the support. I have the support already in terms of name recognition.”

Porter's CBS interview also raised concerns about the likability factor in the gubernatorial race, similar to the scrutiny Harris triggered during the media interviews she granted during her 2024 presidential campaign. 

Shroff warned the CBS kerfuffle was “not really a one-off,” pointing to other public incidents in which Porter has struggled to manage her public image, including when she lost the Senate primary last year to Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and accused him of rigging the election.

“I remember she kind of left on such a sour note in her race against Adam Schiff,” he said. “And definitely interesting to … make the point that if she's willing to do that on camera with a journalist from CBS … what is she like behind the scenes? And I think we kind of have a glimpse of that from several other episodes and moments.” 

Of comparisons between Porter and Harris in the wake of the CBS debacle, Clink suggested it would be unwise for the gubernatorial candidate to follow the former vice president's lead of avoiding the press when it comes to building rapport with voters.

“Porter's next few interviews are going to be heavily scrutinized, and I think that she would be wise to do the opposite of what Kamala Harris did. She should get out and do as many interviews as possible so that she buries the bad CBS interview with decent interviews with other reporters,” Clink said. 

As Porter tries to recoup her image, her challengers are pouncing on the CBS debacle as an opportunity to argue to voters that she's not a strong candidate. 

Former California state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa attacked his rival for trying to exit the tough interview. 

“We need a governor who will work to solve hard problems and who is not afraid to answer simple questions. You can't just throw up your hands and refuse to answer as Katie Porter did,” he told the Washington Examiner. “California faces a lot of big problems, and voters deserve a leader who will answer the questions and speak the truth about how to solve them.”

In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Hilton made a dig at Porter for saying she didn't “need” Trump voters to become California governor.

“Every day, I'm on the road meeting Californians from every background and political stripe. As governor, I'll serve every citizen of this state — whether they voted for the President or not, whether they vote for me or not. It's not about what the politicians ‘need,' California needs a governor focused on improving people's lives, not another career politician looking out for political insiders and allies. And I'm certainly not afraid to talk to the media about it,” the Republican candidate said. 

CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE KATIE PORTER SECURES EMILY'S LIST ENDORSEMENT

Clink believes that at the end of the day, Porter's front-runner status at the head of a stack of nearly 10 candidates is “all well and good” over a year before the election, but all it does is put a big target on your back.” 

“For Katie Porter, I think it just highlights the fact that she has very thin skin,” he said. “She's a very good politician, but she's not a very good retail politician.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Founders were inspired—and threatened—by the independence and self-governance of nations like the Iroquois Confederacy.

The Declaration of Independence is venerated for its poetic language and universalist prologue, with the soaring, “self-evident” truth that all men have the right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” But, less famously, the Declaration is also a set of specific grievances. There are 27 in total, building to a defining final charge against the Crown: The King of England has attempted to afflict frontiersmen with “merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.”

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The most famous text of the Revolution culminates not with an idealistic wish but with a derogatory indictment, legal as well as moral. The drafters drew upon nascent doctrines of international law and made England's incitement of “Savages” the ultimate unjust act against a “Free and Independent” people. In this so-called Age of Reason, Native Americans were charged with having none at all. They were not only lawless but also irrational, incapable of self-governance, and lacking moral capacity.

Jeffrey Ostler: The shameful final grievance of the Declaration of Independence

This one-dimensional vision of Native Americans was new. Having lived alongside Native communities for generations—during war, peace, and constant trade—the colonists had ample evidence that they were capable of self-government. Native people maintained distinct customs, laws, and forms of sovereignty, many of them in defiance of both British and colonial authorities. Long before the arrival of Europeans, the nations of the Iroquois (or Haudenosaunee) Confederacy centralized political, military, and diplomatic practices. Throughout the 1740s and '50s, Benjamin Franklin commented on the durable forms of union exercised by the Iroquois, whose confederacy, as he wrote, “has subsisted Ages, and appears indissoluble.”

In fact, Native self-governance was so evident and persistent that it became a source of colonial frustration. Pamphleteers often decried the Crown's diplomacy with Native nations, as well as its inability to control them. Across the colonies, and particularly beyond the Appalachians, Native independence was seen as a threat to colonists, who had begun to envision their own claims to the same lands as necessary to their independence and sovereignty.

The colonists sought not just territory, but unchallenged dominion. To achieve this, they needed to erase the legitimacy of Native governance and justify violent dispossession. It was precisely because Native societies mirrored some of the colonists' own ideals (autonomy, law, liberty) that they had to be cast as savages. By 1776, American colonists had positioned Native peoples—and their resistance to conquest—as the antithesis of their own vision of an enlightened society: merciless, uncivilized, and geared toward “undistinguished destruction.” The founding documents of the United States may have been modeled on Enlightenment philosophy, but they were informed by the conflict among settlers, Native nations, and the Crown.

Understanding this history is not a matter of diminishing the Revolution's accomplishments, but of recognizing the contested ground from which they arose—and the Native lives, lands, and liberties they attempted to foreclose.

The origins of the American Revolution stretch back further than the fabled year of 1776, and the poetics of the Declaration. The year 1763 stands out because of the momentous Treaty of Paris, which transferred most of New France to the English, more than doubling the Crown's claims to North America. Now a person could travel from the Florida Panhandle to Hudson's Bay and remain within the purported realm of King George III. The Crown (and its colonists) claimed all lands east of the Mississippi River, despite knowing that Native peoples governed much of this territory. The treaty would eventually inform the territorial boundaries of the United States, but Native dominion remained even as land transferred between European countries—a geopolitical reality absent from most current textbooks.

In the summer of 1763, the Great Lakes region exploded when Indigenous villagers under the Odawa leader Obwandiyag (also known as Pontiac) destroyed a series of English forts. Pontiac, born around 1720, had experienced the withdrawal of French trade and authority and now rallied other Native villagers to fill the power vacuum. This Native resistance compelled British officials to the bargaining table—trade would eventually resume—and the Crown fatefully altered its own laws to accommodate Native resistance. In October, a royal proclamation prohibited colonial settlements past the Appalachians.

Natives “with whom We are connected, and who live under Our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed,” King George declared.

Early in the Revolutionary era, then, recognition of Native sovereignty both shaped the laws of the Crown and limited the prospects of its colonial subjects—kindling their eventual rebellion. Rather than accept new English prohibitions, and the Crown's growing diplomacy with Pontiac, colonists formed new resentments, from which sprung new ideas, politics, and militancy.

Around that same time, an anonymous author published “Some Hints to People in Power, on the Present Melancholy Situation of Our Colonies in North America,” which was addressed to the King's secretaries of state and concerned the “destructive Tumult” that was “raging on our Frontiers.” The author advised making Natives “dependent upon us” in order to thwart their supremacy over colonial farmers, whose commitment to a sedentary pastoral life rendered them slow and prone to attack. For as long “as the Bark of the Trees furnishes them with Shelter, and their endless Forests and numerous Rivers with Food, they know they cannot be seriously distressed,” the author concluded, arguing that Native peoples' relationship with nature gave them advantages over a “civilized and settled Race of Men.” The pamphlet exposed a paradox in colonial reasoning: While colonists viewed Indigenous peoples as “savage” and inferior, they simultaneously recognized—and some even envied—their different forms of government and social organization.

Across the Pennsylvania colony, men formed militia units. The frontiersman James Smith and his “Black Boys” militia donned Native dress, darkened their faces for concealment, and attacked supply trains from the Crown destined for Pontiac's forces. In December, another militia unit known as the “Paxton Boys” massacred a Conestoga community in Lancaster County for allegedly ferrying information and supplies to Pontiac's warriors. Benjamin Franklin, then a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, published a pamphlet condemning the attack as lawless and immoral. In his description of the event, “White People” were the “Barbarians” guilty of “Wickedness,” while Natives had historically demonstrated “Kindness and Hospitality.” The Paxton Boys, Franklin said, had brutalized the innocent Conestoga out of pure racism.

“The only Crime of these poor Wretches seems to have been, that they had a reddish brown Skin,” he wrote.

Prior to the Seven Years' War—which began in the mid-1750s and involved conflict among France, Great Britain, and Native tribes—the term white people had rarely been used. It had appeared a little more than once a year in colonial newspapers. During the war, however, there was a more than tenfold increase in newspapers' use of the term. In 1757, George Washington, then an officer for Britain, wrote to a fellow colonel about a Cherokee conspiracy to attack “Traders and white people.” In Natives, white colonists found yet another group to define themselves against.

When James Smith defended his militia's violence, he framed British treaties with Native nations as alliances with “the enemies of Mankind.” In doing so, he revealed the new ethos of the era. In print, spoken verse, and everyday parlance, white people became synonymous with mankind, a notion not universal—as the Declaration would have one believe—but exclusionary.

This racial logic was embedded in the founding documents of the United States. In 1776, Smith represented interior interests at Pennsylvania's constitutional convention in Philadelphia, helping draft the state's first constitution. The document, in its opening paragraph, scolded the King for employing “savages and slaves” in a “cruel and unjust war” against the commonwealth—an echo of the final grievance of the Declaration of Independence, adopted mere steps away, 12 weeks earlier.

The founding documents thus served a dual purpose: to oppose both tyranny and “savagery.” Colonists saw themselves besieged by an oppressive monarch abroad and by violent “savages” on their frontiers, with no guarantee that they would share in “the blessings of peace” or the profits of “victory and conquest,” as it was phrased in the July 1775 Olive Branch Petition signed by Thomas Jefferson and other delegates to the Second Continental Congress.

In essence, their Revolution was not only for liberty but also for the ability to expand and to govern the lands and resources of Native nations—lands that they felt they and the Crown had “won” on the battlefield, and that they would soon win again by rejecting the Crown and declaring sovereignty.

The Revolution was not, however, a contest between the order of the state (reason) and the perceived disorder of nature (savagery). It was a contest between competing visions of governance and law, and between colonial sovereignty and the sovereign traditions of Native nations.

The Declaration of Independence opened the world to democratic possibility, sparking a wave of revolutions, yet it also marked the narrowing of political possibilities within the nascent United States. The very document that proclaimed a new kind of liberty also stifled other forms of governance, particularly those practiced by Native nations, which became outsiders to the new American body politic. Across eastern North America, European forms of authority and landownership were now imposed on Native communities, displacing matriarchal clan systems that had long governed village politics and intertribal diplomacy.

In the story of America, Native peoples are reduced to a perpetual “thorn in the side” of the state, in the words of the political scientist James C. Scott, who argued that modern states were built to manage nonmigratory, easily categorized populations that could be taxed, conscripted, and surveilled. Much of American history has involved efforts to impose constrained visions of liberty—rooted in individualism, private property, and patriarchal norms—on Native peoples. Settler societies, like the colonies in 1776, are legible to a state. In contrast, Indigenous communities exist outside that frame, with fluid, seasonal, and relational systems of economics and politics that remain hard to regulate and control. Native nations have long fought to secure fishing and hunting rights through treaties, and therefore preserve migratory economies and animal resources.

Studying the contradictions of the Revolution disrupts the myth of a singular founding moment and reveals a contested process. Thousands of Native people fought and an untold number died during the Revolutionary War, not all in opposition to the colonists; Daniel Nimham, a Wappinger Indian who was made a captain in the Continental Army, perished with colonial troops while leading the Stockbridge Indian Company at the Battle of Kingsbridge (in what is now the Bronx) in August 1778. And if Native peoples formed the “climax of the Declaration,” as the historian Robert Parkinson put it, then their history is central to the country's. Native nations retain sovereignty despite colonization, and acknowledging this makes them parallel rather than peripheral to the American story—which, in turn, gives the Revolution fuller dimension and meaning.

The United States continued to grow after its founding by displacing and subordinating generations of Native nations. A century after the Declaration, federal assimilation programs removed Native children from their families, placed them in institutions, and subjected them to abuse and indoctrination. The goal was clear: to break familial and cultural ties and instill new values. Depriving nations of their children is how peoples are destroyed, which is why the United Nations lists this tactic among its definitions for genocide.

Textbooks have inched toward acknowledging these histories, yet they still fall short of explaining how “liberty and freedom” for some was often used to justify the conquest and dispossession of others. Indeed, the lofty ideals at the core of our founding documents risk becoming hollow if they are stripped of their historical failures and limitations. Rather than smoothing over the Declaration's paradoxes—which Native peoples have long sought to expose—Americans should confront them directly. As the Lakota author Luther Standing Bear reflected in 1933, recalling his time at the notorious Carlisle Indian Industrial School: “I can well remember when Indians in those days were stoned upon the streets as were the dogs that roamed them. We were ‘savages,' and all who had not come under the influence of the missionary were ‘heathen.' ”

Standing Bear's words, written a full century and a half after the Declaration's signing, remind us that the phrase merciless Indian Savages was never just rhetorical; it was strategic in its vilification. The U.S. Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment both explicitly excluded “Indians not taxed,” as did civil-rights laws of the Reconstruction era. Not until 1924 were Native peoples granted U.S. citizenship through congressional legislation, in part to advance Indian assimilation and alienate more reservation lands.

Reckoning with this complex legacy requires a reframing of American independence, nationhood, and the self-evident truth that “all men are created equal.” Perhaps, upon its 250th anniversary, the United States can envision the Declaration as one of interdependence—expansive enough to confront its own contradictions and inclusive enough to honor the sovereignties it sought to erase.

The idea that everyone has intrinsic rights to life and liberty was a radical break with millennia of human history. It's worth preserving.

Listen to more stories on hark

For thousands of years, the view that only rulers conferred rights or privileges on everyone else was taken for granted in traditional societies around the world. In the ancient empires of Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, only those whom rulers regarded as their peers had value, or what the Romans called dignitas. Hindu societies enshrined the ruler as one who embodies the divine order of the gods, and established a hierarchical rank for everyone else. The caste system even defined some people as “outcaste,” with no right to move freely and little recourse from lifelong servitude.

The anonymous Babylonian scribes who wrote the legal code of Hammurabi some 4,000 years ago seem to have regarded human value as a quality that the king could grant to certain people and deny to others. This code assigned privileges, and what we call “rights,” according to a strictly hierarchical view of social power.

The archaeologists who discovered Hammurabi's code must have been surprised, at first, to see that it offered certain protections from mutilation, torture, and execution. But it became clear that these were dependent on one's social rank. The king—who authorized the code—assigned punishments based on the social status of the offender and the victim.

Ancient kings and emperors enforced their power through terror and violence. They claimed to derive their own prerogatives from the gods—from Marduk, in Babylonia; Ra, in Egypt; Jupiter, in Rome. Ancient philosophers held similar views. More than 2,000 years ago, when Plato wrote his famous treatise on “The Laws,” he declared that human laws merely articulate the will of the gods, and extend privileges to people like himself, members of the aristocratic class in Athens.

Aristotle took a different approach, invoking what would later be known as biological determinism. Observing that among wild animals, different creatures possess different innate abilities, he argued that the same is true of humans—for instance, that disparities in intelligence and physical strength predispose people to be natural-born rulers or slaves.

The Declaration of Independence, by contrast, speaks of the rights to life and liberty as sacred gifts that “Nature” and “Nature's God” have given freely to all humanity. These principles were inspired partly by the Enlightenment, the philosophical movement that emerged in Europe after hundreds of years of horrifying religious war. But they originated in the Book of Genesis, which declares that every human being has value.

As Thomas Jefferson knew when he wrote the Declaration, the idea of innate rights to life and liberty was a bold innovation. The “truths” for which the Founders risked their lives were not in fact “self-evident.” That makes preserving them all the more important.

By suggesting that ultimate value resides in the individual, regardless of their sociopolitical status, the Bible defied some of the world's most enduring conventions of rank and worth. Genesis declares that adam (Hebrew for “man” or “humankind”) was created in the image of God, thus affirming the intrinsic value of all human beings—a fundamental theme for “peoples of the book,” Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.

The Bible describes how, for several hundred years, the ancient Israelites governed themselves by tribal councils, maintaining a measure of equality. In a crisis, when tribal councils failed to reach consensus, Israel's people agreed to choose a king, “like the other nations.” But they also developed methods to resist autocratic power. Those who wrote the Bible well remembered the oppression that Israel's people had experienced in Egypt and Babylonia.

Biblical chronicles that tell of the great King David's triumphs also show that when he acted wrongly, the prophet Nathan rebuked him, speaking on behalf of the Lord, and ordered him to repent and reform. In that culture, moral law remained as binding for the king himself as for his subjects—David obeyed the prophet's command. Other kings of Israel, too, were reprimanded by prophets when they failed to act morally. Jesus of Nazareth amplified the theme of innate rights by advocating generosity and love toward all people.

Jefferson admired the Bible's ethical principles, but was skeptical of its metaphysics. He famously took a razor to the New Testament, excising the miracles while leaving intact the teachings of Jesus, whom Jefferson venerated as a philosopher and the author of “the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man.”

From the November 2020 issue: James Parker on reading Thomas Jefferson's Bible

In drafting the Declaration, Jefferson cited the “sacred and undeniable” truth that “all men are created equal.” He also drew on the idea of natural law that ensured human rights—a concept that had been popularized in mid-18th-century Europe with the Enlightenment. The final version of the document, of course, referred to humans' natural rights as “self-evident.”

Above all, the Founding Fathers agreed that because these are innate rights, they can only be recognized, and not conferred, by human beings. They went on to state, “To secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”

This contradicted prevailing views not just from ancient times but also from their own day. From the fifth to the 18th centuries, Europe's Catholic and Protestant kings claimed to rule by “divine right,” insisting that the lower status of everyone else, whether aristocrat, merchant, servant, or slave, was simply God's will. (To this day, the British Crown's ancient motto proclaims: “God and My Right.”) This was also an ideal that Jefferson himself did not live up to. Glancing out his study window at Monticello, he would have seen people whom he had bought as property working in his fields, people denied rights of any kind.

It took another war to extend those rights to Black Americans, and the work of protecting the rights defined in the Declaration is an ongoing project. But over the course of its first 250 years, the United States became the strongest and most prosperous nation on Earth, offering hope to countless people worldwide. Starting with Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and their courageous colleagues, many of the fiercest defenders of intrinsic rights have been people who understood the alternative all too well—power maintained by means of fear, autocracy, and military force. Many of these people had faith in God and the biblical vision of human nature, both in America and throughout the world, whether they were explicitly religious or not.

The Founders knew that monarchy had been the norm for most of human history, and they saw how difficult that would be to change. The cruel and dangerous reversion to rule through fear and violence that we are seeing now was among their greatest concerns. But I have faith in their 1776 vision; I believe that the rights to life and liberty are the sacred inheritance of every human being, grounded in a transcendent reality.

Now is the time for those of us who love what the Founders entrusted to us to pledge anew—to one another, to our children, and to all who come after us—that we stand for their Declaration.

Violence has marred the American constitutional order since the founding. Is it inevitable?

Shays's Rebellion filled Alexander Hamilton with dread. In 1786, armed men shut down courts in five counties across Massachusetts and, early the next year, marched on the federal armory in Springfield. The mobs included debtors trying to prevent the courts from foreclosing on their farms, and opponents of centralized government. The insurrectionists believed that the newly adopted Massachusetts Constitution, drafted in 1779 by John Adams, would shift power from the poor to the rich, from the many to the few, from the backcountry to Boston, from democracy to aristocracy. They were led by Daniel Shays, a dashing Revolutionary War veteran who'd had to sell a sword given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette to pay his debts.

Observing the rebellion from New York, Hamilton worried that civil unrest in Massachusetts could augur the rise of a demagogue on the national stage, one who might pander to angry debtors across America and threaten the stability of the new nation. The insurrection was eventually put down by a private army hired by Massachusetts Governor James Bowdoin, after members of the state militia refused his call to do so. But what might have happened, Hamilton wrote, if, instead of Shays, the rebellion “had been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell”?

In Hamilton's view, the greatest threat to the American experiment was a demagogue who might flatter the people, overthrow popular elections, and consolidate power in his own hands. “Of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics,” he wrote in “Federalist No. 1,” “the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people.”

Afraid that Shays's Rebellion might spread, Hamilton and James Madison called the Constitutional Convention in 1787. George Washington agreed to attend, because he shared Hamilton and Madison's concern that, under the Articles of Confederation, the new nation was vulnerable to men like Shays. “I could not resist the call to a convention of the States,” he wrote to Lafayette, “which is to determine whether we are to have a Government of respectability under which life, liberty, and property will be secured to us,” or one “springing perhaps from anarchy and Confusion, and dictated perhaps by some aspiring demagogue.”

From the October 2018 issue: Jeffrey Rosen on how James Madison's mob-rule fears have been realized

A central goal of the convention was to check populist mobs in the states and empower the national government to defend itself. Because the undisciplined Massachusetts militia had failed to stop Shays, the new Constitution gave Congress the power to nationalize the state militias “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.” Hamilton would have gone even further in creating a strong central government and an energetic executive. In a notorious speech at the convention, he proposed a president elected for life who would have no temptation to resort to demagoguery to extend his term.

Thomas Jefferson was serving as the American minister in Paris when he learned of Shays's Rebellion. His reaction differed dramatically from Hamilton's. In Jefferson's view, the government should be restrained in its response to popular uprisings. “The late rebellion in Massachusets has given more alarm than I think it should have done,” he wrote to Madison. “Calculate that one rebellion in 13 states in the course of 11 years, is but one for each state in a century & a half. No country should be so long without one. Nor will any degree of power in the hands of government prevent insurrections.”

Jefferson remained in Paris during the Constitutional Convention but followed its progress from abroad. “Our Convention has been too much impressed by the insurrection of Massachusets,” he wrote to John Adams's son-in-law in 1787. “What country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.”

Jefferson would have pardoned the rebels, relying on a free press to disabuse those who had participated based on misinformation. “The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure.”

Jefferson felt that the presidency created by the new Constitution was too strong. He, too, feared a Caesar: His study of ancient history had convinced him that all “elective monarchies” had ended with popular leaders converting themselves into hereditary despots. But if Hamilton envisioned a demagogue who would flatter the majority from below, Jefferson foresaw one who would thwart majority will from above. He was especially concerned that an unscrupulous president might narrowly lose a bid for reelection and falsely insist that the contest had been stolen.

“He will pretend false votes, foul play, hold possession of the reins of government, be supported by the states voting for him,” Jefferson wrote to Madison. His solution was not a life term but a one-term limit for the presidency—“an incapacity to be elected a second time.”

Hamilton's and Jefferson's radically different responses to Shays's Rebellion represent an opening skirmish in one of the most consequential intellectual battles among the Founders. In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson had defined America in terms of three shining ideas: liberty, equality, and government by consent. Just a decade later, after the new Constitution was drafted, he and Hamilton began a debate about the relationship among these three ideas that has shaped American life ever since.

For Jefferson, centralized power threatened liberty; for Hamilton, a vigorous national government could help secure it. Jefferson, the author of the Declaration, was determined to expand democracy; Hamilton, the defender of the Constitution, viewed democracy as a turbulent force to be filtered and checked. Jefferson believed in local self-government and states' sovereignty; Hamilton believed in the Union and national supremacy. Jefferson, the gentleman planter, exalted rule by the people and feared the tyranny of consolidation; Hamilton, the scholar-warrior, preferred rule by elites and dreaded the anarchy of the mob. Jefferson revered the white farmers of the agricultural South; Hamilton championed the financiers and manufacturers of the urban North. Their opposing visions led to opposing approaches to the Constitution. Jefferson interpreted it strictly, to limit federal power; Hamilton interpreted it liberally, to expand federal power.

The competing positions of Hamilton and Jefferson are like golden and silver threads woven through the tapestry of American history, sometimes running parallel to each other, sometimes crossing, and at crucial moments pulling so far apart that they threaten to snap. From the founding until today, a productive tension between the two men's ideas has mostly kept American politics from descending into violence. Whenever the threads have been pulled too far in one direction, however, the shooting begins.

The new Constitution wasn't yet five years old when the nation was tested again by internal violence. White farmers in Western Pennsylvania resented a new federal tax on grain, one of their main sources of revenue—and the fact that those accused of evading the tax had to stand trial in federal court in Philadelphia, far from the frontier. In July 1794, an armed mob of about 500 men attacked the federal tax collector. Like the Shaysites, the Whiskey Rebels saw themselves as a protest movement against economic inequality.

Once again, Hamilton and Jefferson reacted to the violence in radically different ways. The whiskey tax had been Hamilton's idea. It was the centerpiece of the financial plan he'd proposed in 1790, intended to help the new federal government pay interest on debts it had assumed from the states. Hamilton recommended a military response to the rebellion, with himself at the head of an expanded army; he believed an “imposing” force was needed to “suppress the insurrection and support the Civil Authority in effectuating Obedience to the laws and the punishment of offenders.” Jefferson, by contrast, viewed the uprising as a legitimate form of civil disobedience. He saw the yeoman farmers as virtuous freedom fighters reluctantly trading their plowshares for swords.

On September 25, Washington issued a proclamation calling up the militias of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Several days later, he and Hamilton convened on Market Street in Philadelphia and decorously set off for war in a carriage. Washington inspected his troops in Carlisle and traveled with them as far as Bedford, becoming the only sitting president to command an army in the field. Then he returned to Philadelphia, leaving Hamilton in charge of a force that eventually swelled to nearly 13,000 men. Advancing west, the army found the resistance melting away. By late October, the insurrection was over.

Hamilton was confident that the successful suppression of the insurgency would ultimately strengthen the Union. Jefferson, once again, pleaded for leniency for the insurgents. Washington's response found a middle ground. He ordered local leaders of the insurrection arrested, but absolved rank-and-file followers. Over the next year, the federal government tried a dozen men for high treason. Two men were convicted and sentenced to hang. In the end, Washington pardoned both, the first pardons to be issued by an American president.

It took the political chameleon Aaron Burr to make Hamilton and Jefferson see the other man's perspective. Though the Whiskey Rebellion had only hardened their differences, they could agree that Burr posed a unique threat to the republic. Hamilton supported Jefferson over Burr in the 1800 election; he recognized, in Burr, a man who might become the American Caesar he'd foreseen. At a dinner in February 1804, Hamilton shared his fears that Burr would foment insurrection; an account of Hamilton calling Burr a “dangerous man” found its way into the newspapers. Burr demanded an apology. Hamilton's refusal to apologize led him, on July 11, to the dueling grounds below the cliffs of Weehawken.

After slaying his rival, Burr vindicated Hamilton's fears. He offered his services to the British ambassador as the leader of an insurrectionist movement that would incite the western states to secede from the Union. During Burr's eventual trial for treason, one of his associates testified that he had also hoped to enlist the Marine Corps in a plot to seize Washington, D.C. (“Hang him!” Burr reportedly said of President Jefferson, praising dictators from ancient history, including “Caesar, Cromwell, and Bonaparte.”)

In 1806, Jefferson was sufficiently alarmed by the reports of Burr's activities that he asked Madison what powers the president had to put down insurrections by force. Madison responded that, according to the Insurrection Act of 1792, state militias could be called to repel insurrections against the U.S., but “it does not appear that regular Troops can be employed.”

Jefferson then sought new tools. In December, he drafted “a Bill authorising the emploiment of the land or Naval forces of the US. In cases of insurrection.” He sent the bill to Congress through proxies and signed the amended Insurrection Act on March 3, 1807.

Burr was arrested for conspiracy before he could foment any kind of revolt that would require using the amended Insurrection Act. But Jefferson invoked it in 1808 to quash protests in Vermont against his Embargo Act. The Insurrection Act has served ever since as the most important legal instrument authorizing military force for domestic law enforcement. From the Civil War to the civil-rights movement, presidents have invoked it to put down violent resistance to federal authority. Having previously held that “a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,” Jefferson might not have appreciated the irony.

Insurrectionary violence has recurred throughout American history. It erupted during the secession crisis in 1861 that sparked the Civil War and the white-supremacist insurgencies across the South during Reconstruction. It reemerged in the Ku Klux Klan terror of the 1920s, and during the civil-rights era as violent opposition to racial integration, including at Little Rock in 1957 and Selma in 1965. Nearly all of these outbursts of what the historian Jefferson Cowie has called “white resistance to federal power” led presidents to invoke Jefferson's Insurrection Act. They also used the act against a separate strain of Black resistance to state and federal power, beginning with the slave rebellion in Virginia suppressed by Andrew Jackson in 1831 through the violent protests against racism suppressed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967, and George H. W. Bush in 1992.

But nothing in American history anticipated the events of January 6, 2021, when men and women stormed the U.S. Capitol at the urging of the president of the United States. They had been sold a conspiracy theory: that the 2020 election had been stolen. The leader of the Proud Boys, the far-right militia group that led the attack, invoked an apocryphal line from Thomas Jefferson to justify the insurrection: “When governments fear the people … There is liberty.”

President Donald Trump defended January 6 as a “day of love” on which there was “nothing done wrong,” and denounced the prosecution of the insurrectionists. Like Jefferson, he supported pardons rather than prosecutions. He was less interested, though, in disabusing the participants of the conspiracy theory that had motivated their actions.

On January 20, 2025, the first day of his second term, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of about 1,600 people involved in the January 6 attacks. He then set out to consolidate executive power, with the acquiescence of Congress. Asserting the president's unitary control over the executive branch, he fired or bought out more than 100,000 federal workers; he also fired the heads of independent agencies and challenged the agencies' constitutionality before the Supreme Court.

Trump's defenders insist that his actions fall squarely within the tradition of the Hamilton-Jefferson debate. Allysia Finley, a member of The Wall Street Journal 's editorial board, wrote in February that Hamilton would have approved of Trump's vigorous use of executive power. Alan Dershowitz, who had defended Trump in his first impeachment trial, argued that Jefferson would have approved as well. “As soon as our third president was elected, he fired many Federalist government officials and issued blanket pardons to people the previous administration had prosecuted for sedition,” Dershowitz noted in a letter to the editor of the Journal. In Dershowitz's view, Trump was making a legitimate effort to consolidate political power and authority in the executive branch.

Many of Trump's supporters see him not as a Caesar but as a modern-day Andrew Jackson, resurrecting a version of Jackson's “spoils system” to shrink the size of government and return power from the elite to the people. Trump himself has encouraged the comparison: On Jackson's 250th birthday, he visited the Hermitage, Jackson's Tennessee home, and likened himself to the hero of New Orleans. “It was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite,” Trump said. “Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew.”

Trump's critics, by contrast, see him as the second coming of Aaron Burr, a man who unites Hamilton's and Jefferson's greatest fears for American democracy: Hamilton's demagogic Caesar and Jefferson's oligarchic one. History suggests that they were both right about the threats to popular sovereignty; since the fall of the Greek and Roman republics, authoritarian rulers have sought to consolidate power in their own hands by flattering the mob and co-opting the financial elite.

Throughout American history, followers of Hamilton and Jefferson have warned that when Americans abandon their devotion to the principles of the Constitution, political conflict ends in tyranny, violence, or both. The warnings have taken the form of what the Puritan scholar Sacvan Bercovitch called the “American Jeremiad.” Just as Puritan political sermons warned that Americans, like the ancient Israelites, had lost their way by violating their covenant with God, so Revolutionary-era jeremiads warned that Americans, like the citizens of ancient Rome, risked losing their way by abandoning their devotion to liberty, civic virtue, the rule of law, and the principles of the Constitution. In 1772, three years before he was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Patriot Joseph Warren wrapped himself in a toga and cautioned that the Romans' spurning of their “noble attachment to a free constitution” had enabled Caesar to consolidate absolute power. He urged Americans not to do the same.

The success of the American experiment doesn't require agreement between Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians about how to balance liberty and power; it requires a good-faith commitment to participate in the inevitable tug-of-war between them. In his final years, Jefferson placed a bust of Hamilton in the front hall of Monticello, facing his own bust. He viewed his greatest foe not as a hated enemy to be destroyed but as a respected opponent to be defeated, and he accepted his own defeats as an opportunity to fight another day. During the two decades that he survived Hamilton, Jefferson would remark to visitors that the two men remained “opposed in death as in life,” sometimes emphasizing the point with a smile. The two busts remain on opposite sides of the main entrance at Monticello today, an enduring sign of Jefferson's respect, if not affection, for his most significant foe.

The president's threats of revenge are no longer bluster.

If the secret to understanding a strongman is to identify his greatest weakness, one place to start with Donald Trump is his obsession with his own eventual obituaries. Trump knows that they will mention his history-making presidencies, his ostentatious wealth, and his unusual charisma—but he also is aware that when he dies, people will remember his conviction on 34 felony counts, and that there is nothing he can do about it. Even now, White House officials have told me, Trump rages about how his guilty verdict is sure to be mentioned way up high in his obituaries.

Trump's fixation on all of this leapt to mind today when I heard that he'd called for the arrests of the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago—not just because it explains Trump's psychology, but also because this obsession is one of the driving motivations of his revenge crusade, which is now escalating dramatically.

It bears pausing on the starkness of these facts: The president of the United States today demanded the jailing of two elected officials who belong to the opposing political party. Trump did not offer evidence that Governor J. B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson had committed a crime, nor did he even suggest what charge either man would face, though the outburst presumably stemmed from their opposition to Trump sending the National Guard to Chicago to protect ICE officers.

This, of course, is hardly the first time Trump has urged the incarceration of his political foes. (This is the man who led “Lock her up” chants at his rallies, after all.) But what makes this moment so significant is what happened a short time later, in a courtroom just outside Washington, D.C. There, former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned on charges of making false statements to Congress. Trump's threats are no longer bluster. The guardrails of his first term are gone. He is instead surrounded by enablers, including a pliant attorney general. The federal government is taking legal action against those whom Trump wants punished. Retribution is here.

White House aides scoffed to reporters in the first months of this administration that the talk of vengeance was an overblown media creation and that Trump was instead focusing on matters such as tariffs and resolving global conflicts. They acknowledged that during a signature campaign speech, Trump had flat-out declared, “I am your retribution,” promising his supporters that he'd strike back at those in power who they believed had oppressed them or curtailed their freedoms. He would simply right some wrongs, his aides claimed, by, say, pardoning the January 6 rioters—and yes, yes, all of them, including those who'd violently attacked police officers. Even as those around him, led by his aide Stephen Miller and others using Project 2025 as a playbook, began to challenge powerful institutions—such as law firms and universities—that they believed had long worked against conservatives, the president's aides insisted that talk of revenge was just hyperbole.

Yet after the passage of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the revival of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, things changed, one current and two former White House officials, as well as one outside adviser, told me on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump couldn't get some die-hard MAGA supporters to stop dwelling on his ties to the disgraced sex offender. The signature Republican legislation proved unpopular. The economy, whipsawed by tariffs, was displaying warning signs. Trump's poll numbers began to slip, and the GOP was in danger of losing the midterms—which alarmed Trump and fueled some of his most extreme moves. With Republican control of Congress in danger, Trump began focusing more on retaliation.

Trump has long ruminated about the criminal and civil charges that were brought against him after his first term in office. He now privately acknowledges that they were a political gift, believing that the charges reeked of government overreach and made him look like a martyr to his supporters, the outside adviser and one former official told me. He has told advisers that, in retrospect, every day he spent at the defense table in a Manhattan courtroom during a trial for falsifying business records was a political advertisement. The case yielded a conviction, but that was the only trial he faced before last year's presidential election (after his win, he faced no real punishment and was able to make the other cases vanish). But in the moment, he was terrified of being convicted and still seethes at the humiliation he faced.

He has fumed for months to aides and outside allies about the injustices he believes he has faced, but often, his rants—or social-media posts—have not contained explicit instructions, leaving it up to officials to determine how, or whether, to carry out his wishes, one current and one former aide told me. But one Truth Social post late last month was shocking in its directness. In what appeared to have been intended as a private message to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump directly called for the prosecution of Comey as well as of Senator Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James. All three had crossed Trump: Comey had helped steer the initial steps of the Russia investigation; Schiff was among the leaders of Trump's first impeachment; James was behind a civil case that resulted in a $500 million penalty for the president. Comey was indicted just days after Trump's message, in a case brought by a replacement federal prosecutor after the original attorney balked and was forced out. Another prosecutor reportedly resigned rather than bring charges against James.

The normal barriers between the White House and the Department of Justice were obliterated. And Trump made his motivation plain, writing in the message to Bondi: “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Trump has never much cared for the principles of the criminal-justice system. In the 1980s, he added to his then-growing fame by calling for the execution of the five suspects in the Central Park jogger case before they'd even been convicted. (They were later exonerated.) In his 2016 campaign, he called for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, though she had not been charged with any crime. In his first term, Trump believed that the Department of Justice was there to serve his whims—he famously asked for his own Roy Cohn, the notoriously ruthless New York lawyer—but was stymied at times by his previous attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, and by entrenched department norms enforced by career officials. Trump's wishes for investigations into Clinton, John Kerry, and Barack Obama were denied.

But those obstacles are gone. Trump has insisted that the Department of Justice under Joe Biden was weaponized against him, claims goaded on by aides such as Miller and Russell Vought, who also champion efforts to expand the president's power over all facets of the executive branch. And Bondi's appearance before the Senate oversight committee yesterday was defined by her refusal to answer basic questions about her work—including the Comey indictment—as well as an obsequiousness to Trump that suggested that she was indeed comfortable acting as the president's personal lawyer.

“The firewall between the political side and the DOJ has completely eroded,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told me in an email. “And there's the very peculiar parallel that you have a former FBI director coming in to be charged with lying to Congress, yet we have the Attorney General of the United States not being truthful to Congress.”

The administration has creatively used other levers of government to punish its foes; see the way it has wielded the threat of cutting off federal funding to universities or federal business with large law firms, or the way it's either toyed with or initiated harassment against individuals—stripping security clearances, triggering IRS audits, revoking licenses, pursuing expensive litigation. The pace has picked up since the murder of Charlie Kirk. Officials have used the assassination as a pretext to act upon plans that were already in the works, some written by Miller, to crack down on what they deem are lefty NGOs and other organizations, including those funded by George Soros.

Read: Fear of losing the midterms is driving Trump's decisions

When I asked what charges Trump thought would be appropriate against Pritzker and Johnson, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded in a statement that the men “have blood on their hands,” and that “these failed leaders have stood idly by while innocent Americans fall victim to violent crime time and time again.”

Trump has aimed to expand presidential power and use it to go after his critics in ways that this country has never seen. He stripped away Kamala Harris's security detail, the Department of Justice is investigating the former CIA director turned Trump critic John Brennan, and the Federal Communications Commission threatened Jimmy Kimmel. In some cases, he wants to inflict on others the charges he himself faced: John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, had his home raided by FBI agents as part of a classified-materials probe, and Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, has been accused of mortgage fraud (Trump was previously accused of mishandling classified materials and falsifying property records).

Those close to Trump no longer downplay the possibility of the retribution campaign widening further. And the president himself, following Comey's indictment, indicated that his personal vengeance tour is only getting started.

“They weaponized the Justice Department like nobody in history,” Trump said. “What they've done is terrible, and so I would, I hope, frankly, I hope there are others. You can't let this happen to a country.”

The answer isn't just about parties dividing on policies.

In America today, there are conservative and liberal jeans (Levi Strauss versus Wrangler), beer (Heineken versus Coors), and footwear (Birkenstocks versus cowboy boots). The MAGA movement itself is seen as tied to Kid Rock and eating steak.

In an era when partisan division is so febrile that acceptance of political violence has grown and violent political attacks are on the rise — the Charlie Kirk assassination being the latest of great note — it is hard to remember that it wasn't always so.

As recently as the 1950s, Americans were politically calm — so calm that a committee of the American Political Science Association urged the two parties to accentuate their differences, to provide a “true choice.” In 1964, Barry Goldwater campaigned for president as the Republican who would provide “a choice, not an echo” and was badly defeated for his pains. Some political scientists applauded the political apathy of the era as both a sign of popular satisfaction and a shock absorber for the system. Four generations on, there seems to be too much party difference and too little political apathy.

Why have we gotten to a place where even open-toed sandals are left-wing?

Simple answers might point to combative politicians, President Donald Trump above all, to aggressive social movements like the Tea Party and Black Lives Matter, or to changes in the media such as the rise of cable television and then online feeds like Facebook and TikTok. But the key dynamic, many researchers have found, is the increasing proportion of Americans for whom political affiliation is central to their identities — to what they think, to what they feel, to who they feel they are.

I need to stop right here: This assertion does not directly apply to most Americans. In 2024, only 30 percent of Americans described themselves as “strong” Democrats or Republicans (only about half even claimed a political party). The largest chunk of Americans are not partisans. About politics, they care little, talk little, consume little, and know little — and they vote little (although when they vote they determine who holds power, the partisans being evenly divided).

Politicization has now gone beyond shaping many Americans' stances on issues or even their cultural tastes, to shaping who they are.

Still, the politicization of so many Americans matters even for the apolitical. The latter are the audience for the political theater — which Americans find “exhausting” — and when they do vote, usually only every four years, they are presented with polarized options. For the nation as a whole, it means less constructive cooperation and more animosity and anger.



There is a story of political polarization that has often been told. Differences between the national parties were narrow in the first half of the 20th century. A higher percentage of Republican than Democratic senators voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act; 13 Republican senators voted in 1965 to establish Medicare.

Then the division between the politicians widened greatly and quickly, first probably driven by racial issues and then by others. When Obamacare passed in 2010, it did so with zero Republican votes; only one Democrat voted for the Supreme Court appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. The widening chasm spread to other areas of government, for example, to state legislatures and judicial decisions, and on to the politically engaged public.

Party has become so important that opinions on how much racial discrimination exists now differ more between Democrats and Republicans than between Black people and white people.

But politicization entails much more than the parties dividing on policies. Politicization has now gone beyond shaping many Americans' stances on issues or even their cultural tastes, to shaping who they are — whom they date (and marry and befriend), what communities they join, what religious faiths they profess, what life-and-death choices they make.

In the last several decades or so, more Americans have sorted or changed their views on many disparate policies — for instance, on immigration, abortion, war, climate, gender, and crime — to better fit with their identities as Democrats or Republicans. Views on abortion, so deeply tied to one's moral intuitions, provide a dramatic example. In the early 1970s, Republicans were about as likely as Democrats to agree in the NORC/University of Chicago General Social Survey that it should be possible for “a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion if she is married and does not want any more children.” Fifty years later, overall American opinion had not changed, but Republican support for such abortions had dropped by about 20 percentage points and Democratic support had increased by about 15 points; abortion had become a defining party issue. Similarly, in 1997 members of the two parties had, as recorded by a Gallup poll, the same level of concern about whether the effects of global warming had begun; by 2021, there was a 53-point gap between increasingly worried Democrats and increasingly sanguine Republicans.

One way this polarization could happen is that people switched parties to fit their evolving views on subjects such as abortion or the climate. Some of that surely happened. But much research shows that people as or more often switched their views to fit their political identity. This shows up in studies that follow people over several years and find that people often change their positions on a substantive topic after they first change their political affiliation, having adopted the new affiliation perhaps because of political events unrelated to that topic or because of new personal circumstances such as a marriage, a new job, or a new neighborhood. In other words, to follow the abortion example, many became Republicans (perhaps because of racial beliefs or new friends) and then became pro-life.

Increasingly, even survey respondents' reports of what is real, such as whether the economy is getting better or worse or whether inequality is growing, vary by party. Party has become so important that opinions on how much racial discrimination exists now differ more between Democrats and Republicans than between Black people and white people; views of income inequality differ more by party than by individuals' incomes.

Political position has come, for more Americans, to connect with all sorts of tastes far beyond government policy— e.g., listening to Kid Rock or Beyoncé, going to museums or playing golf, watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Antiques Roadshow. Consumption as political signaling — for example, coffee branded by political affiliation — has been vividly demonstrated in (my own) Berkeley, California: First, high rates of Tesla ownership displaying climate liberalism (as well as displaying a healthy bank account), and then high rates of protests against Tesla, displaying DOGE-fighting liberalism.

Some of this politicization might be dismissed as simply posturing, owning the libs, or what pollsters call “expressive responding.” But the politicization goes deeper than that.

Party affiliation seems to increasingly determine, and not just reflect, Americans' important personal decisions. Much of the discussion about “affective polarization” — that more Democrats and Republicans nowadays actually hate the other side — started with a study reporting that more Americans were displeased in 2010 than were in 1960 with the prospect of gaining a son- or daughter-in-law of a different party. Years later, many single Americans rule out dating someone with differing political views.

A 2020 survey found that about half of both Democrats and Republicans have intimate social networks made up exclusively of people who share their politics. Survey respondents often see more agreement with the people in their lives than actually exists, but nonetheless, this homogeneity is substantial and has increased. (Social homogeneity, in turn, encourages partisanship and hostility.)

Such political homogeneity results in part from who individuals choose to spend time with and who they choose to avoid. Strong partisans prefer to be with the like-minded and to avoid conversations with the unlike-minded. And they tend to drop friends (not so much family) who disagree with them politically. By one estimate, 15 percent of Americans “have ended a friendship over politics.” Political homogeneity also results in part from the influence of family, friends, and neighbors to conform to their views.

Political identity affects people in less explicit ways, too. Americans have increasingly segregated themselves geographically — not primarily because they are seeking neighbors who are fellow party members, although some of that is going on, but because the reasons people move — or decide not to move — increasingly connect with party. Those, for example, who like large houses and big yards tend to end up in red neighborhoods, while those who like to walk to local amenities tend to end up in blue neighborhoods. Both ways, party and neighborhood have become more linked. A 2021 study concluded that many “voters live with virtually no [local] exposure to voters from the other party.”

Yet more striking, Americans have increasingly lined up what they profess religiously to fit what they profess politically. Religion and politics have long been entangled in the United States — in 19th-century fights over alcohol prohibition, Sunday postal service, and which version of the Bible should be read in public schools, for instance; this was Americans' faith driving their politics. For about 30 years now, politics have been joining with religion and, importantly, political identity is driving expressions of faith.

It first became clear in the 2000s that those identifying as Democrats, liberals, and moderates were leaving organized religion and describing themselves as having no religion (as “nones”) in great part as a reaction against what they saw as the conservative politicization of the church, especially on lifestyle issues.

Then, evidence in the last decade or so accumulated that more conservatives were starting to profess faith, especially evangelical faith, probably for mirror-image reasons: to reject the secularism associated with liberal positions such as supporting gender transition. Ryan Burge, the dynamo researcher of Graphs about Religion, suggested to me that the recent leveling off of the growth of “nones” might be explained by conservatives' view that non-affiliation had “become so linked to left-wing politics.” These conservatives “are functionally non-religious… but they still can't bear to not ID as Christian on a survey.” That political affiliation has come to alter a significant number of Americans' religious identities is profound testimony to the politicization of many Americans' lives.

And then there is politics' connection to life-and-death decisions. As might be expected, left and right differ on many health-related matters — childhood vaccines, cancer preventatives, and the dangers of tackle football, for example. But left and right also differ in health behavior, from diet, such as how much meat people eat, to exercise. One result is that residents of red counties more often tend to be obese than residents of blue counties, even taking into account race, poverty, and education.

The most tragic example was the Covid-19 pandemic. People in red states, where the vaccines were most resisted, died at higher rates than those in blue states; individual Republicans died at higher rates than individual Democrats. Hundreds of thousands of deaths can likely be attributed to political identity.



Seventy years ago, gender, race, and region determined Americans' lifestyles, fortunes, and identities more than they do now; educational attainment and, increasingly, politics have become the key answer for many people to who they are.

What has happened to get so many of us here? Researchers have debated how much of today's red-blue divide and hostility are matters of ideological and policy differences, or of “social identity” and emotion.

On the first side, the argument is that more Americans have aligned themselves more consistently around a set of political positions. In the mid-20th century, voters with any opinions tended to hold mixed bags of them; it was an era of conservative and liberal Democrats, conservative and liberal Republicans, but mainly of the apathetic, as the political science commission complained. Party membership could be tied to issues — say, the way union workers were to Democrats — but was more often a matter of family and community tradition going back generations.

Change started in the 1950s and then accelerated in the 1960s and '70s, first around race. Conservative white Southerners fled the Black-friendly Democratic Party into the arms of what had become, with its “Southern strategy,” a more white-sympathetic Republican Party. Since then, goes one argument, parties adopted positions on other issues favored by their constituents. The GOP, increasingly the home of white Southerners, adopted their evangelical views on abortion; the Democratic Party then, by reaction, became the party of legal abortions. (This is one reason Catholic identification with the Democratic Party dropped in the late 20th century and early 21st century.) Thus, it is policy differences, particularly about a set of well-known, “branded” party issues, such as government spending, race relations, immigration, and abortion, that drove politicization.

The other story is that the political animus, the motivated reasoning, and the fealty to the tribe exhibited in contemporary politics is best understood as resulting not from profound policy preferences, but from so many Americans rooting their personal identities in politics. The party's “failures and victories become personal,” writes one proponent of this view.

In practice, the two — policy ideology and partisan identity — are intertwined and drive one another. The right-to-life believer comes to identify as Republican and the deep-red Republican comes to have right-to-life views. But most scholars seem to recognize that, either way, there is a profound psychological element to this politicization. Given partisanship's depth and breadth across even personal realms of life, how much party seems to influence other identities like religion, the unreasoning emotion often involved, and the frequent arbitrariness of the party packages (e.g., combining lower estate taxes with closed-door immigration policy), it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that identity has driven politicization.

Bolstered both ways, living in a politically homogenous social world has consequences, among them more hostile and uninformed views about the partisans of the other party (such as overestimating how many Democrats are LGBTQ+ and how many Republicans are rich) and exaggerating the positions they hold. There are many ongoing efforts to overcome the polarizing effects of partisan homogeneity by bringing partisans together or exposing them to new information, some with success and some not. But the point is that politically defined relationships underline the extent to which so many — although, again, not most — Americans have been politicized. Who they are is intimately bound to who their people are, and those affiliated people are increasingly political.

If we see the politicization of everything as a problem, can we roll it back to the 1950s? Doubtful; the consensual '50s were also an anomalous era. Perhaps the 1990s level of political engagement, partway between the mild 1950s and the manic 2020s, is attainable. But not soon. It will probably require a hangover from the politicization of the Trump era — which has supercharged politicization, as displayed in the Charlie Kirk memorial when Trump, following the widow's plea for compassion, said, “I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them. Sorry, Erika” — or cataclysmic social change like an economic collapse that elevates other affiliations over that of party to imagine that partisan identities, so strong that they affect everything from shoe brands to religious belonging, will weaken any time soon.

Is the Comey case getting tossed?

Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to the two counts of lying to Congress being brought against him by the Trump administration. On the same day, ABC News reported that the prosecutors who were working on the Comey case — who were fired for their refusal to charge him — believed the key witness against Comey was fatally flawed.

It's a case that appears both flimsy and nonetheless loaded with meaning for the future of American justice. Vox senior correspondent Andrew Prokop has been covering Comey, President Donald Trump, and their increasingly embittered feud for years. I wanted to ask him four big questions as the case moves forward.

You've been covering Comey for so long — back to the Hillary Clinton email investigation. How surprising is it that we've ended up here?

I think the real change is from 2016 when Comey was announcing his findings on the Hillary Clinton email case. At that time, he got a lot of criticism, but it was considered politically unthinkable that his job would be at risk or that anyone would interfere with his management of the FBI in any significant way. When Trump won, he stayed in the job — until, of course, he ran afoul of Trump and was fired. But even the firing of Comey then resulted in Trump getting himself into more trouble, kickstarting the Robert Mueller investigation.

Fast forward to the present, and the independence of the Justice Department and FBI has completely collapsed, and Trump has essentially emerged triumphant in this long-running feud. He finally got the payback and the indictment that he wanted. It's a pretty stunning turn of events that just goes to show how successful Trump has been in a way that really would've been pretty far-fetched to imagine back then.

That's the meta-narrative. Let's talk about the case. Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday morning. What's next?

It looks like things are going to move very quickly, because the case is in the Eastern District of Virginia, commonly called “the rocket docket.” The judge set some very fast-approaching deadlines [Wednesday] for pre-trial motions later in October.

But this case may never reach trial, because Comey's attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in court [Wednesday] that he was going to file several motions: to have the case thrown out for vindictive prosecution, to argue that the crony Trump put in as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was unlawfully appointed, and to argue the grand jury process was used in an improper way.

They are going to try to get this thrown out before it even goes to trial, and the judge seems to be disposed to acting very quickly on it.

Then, how can there be an indictment in the first place?

When a case is presented to a grand jury, prosecutors get full control over the information they present. It is not an adversarial process, and the defendant has no say whatsoever. So a prosecutor could give the grand jury a very misleading, incomplete, or one-sided version of events that completely ignores exculpatory evidence.

The grand jury process is secret and behind closed doors, so we don't know exactly what they were presented with. But we do know that the grand jury rejected one of the three counts that they tried to charge, which is very rare. The other two counts they approved, but they were split on it. They had a notation that, on both counts, only 14 out of 23 grand jurors approved of those counts, and that is with the very skewed, selective information they were getting.

So even the grand jury, with its limited information relying entirely on prosecutors, is mixed on whether it's worth an indictment. With an actual jury, which requires unanimity for conviction, there's no way they're going to convict. It's basically unthinkable if the case is that weak, even in the grand jury stage.

The ordinary process at DOJ would hold that this case should not have been brought, because you are not supposed to bring cases that you think will not end in conviction. But, of course, Trump circumvented the ordinary process. He pushed out the US attorney. He installed Lindsey Halligan instead, and she seems to have rushed this forward just before the statute of limitations was about to expire.

So what are the stakes here, in the longer term? What will this case tell us about the country we're living in?

I think this case reveals paradoxically both the dangers of what Trump's doing and the limitations. He proved that he can fire enough people and appoint enough hacks to get a grand jury indictment of somebody. But then, once that happens, it could get thrown out by a judge. It could be rejected by a jury. There are many more steps before an actual conviction, and this case looks extraordinarily weak and unlikely to end in a conviction.

But that might not be the case for every other case that Trump's people are considering bringing against his political enemies. What if they managed to get the case before a very far-right Trump judge? What if it's in a red district where a lot of people are more predisposed to convict?

This is still dangerous. But if the Comey case ends in a big embarrassment for the administration, with either the charges being thrown out or Comey being acquitted, I do think it will be seen as pretty revealing that Trump tried to lock up Comey and failed. It sends a message that anybody can resist Trump and that there's no reason to obey in advance or to fear that he's going to actually be able to make good on the threats and intimidation he's trying to bring to bear against any of his critics and opponents.

﻿Everyone needs help on GoFundMe. So how do we give?

Cori Jackson — a single mom living in Indiana — took in her two young nieces to keep them out of foster care this summer. It hasn't been easy.

The sheer scope of just how many fundraisers fail still blows my mind. The top 5 percent of campaigns get about half of all donations — those are the ones that we normally see on our For You page — while the vast majority of fundraisers fail.

The youngest still isn't potty-trained. The oldest isn't used to having food in the fridge so, sometimes, she eats so much it makes her sick. The radiator and head gasket of Jackson's car went out at just the wrong time. And the recliner in her living room, where she has been sleeping so the girls can have her bed, is on “its very last leg.”

Jackson, who is 38 years old, has been doing the best she can. She works full time for a travel agency, earning a steady income for her and her 10-year-old son, but hardly enough for a family of four. She qualifies for food stamps now, but they won't kick in until the end of the month. With nowhere else to turn, a friend helped her do the only thing left to do: Start a GoFundMe.

“When you're getting to the point of a GoFundMe, it is desperation,” said Jackson. GoFundMe, the world's most popular crowdfunding site, acts as the internet's collective beggar's cup, filled to the brim with people like Jackson pleading for help. The kids need back-to-school clothes and she just needs a bump of support — her goal is $2,200 — to pay for food, diapers, and repairs while she adjusts. A month in, and she's only raised $75.

Why?

You will never find Jackson among the scores of fundraisers on GoFundMe's discovery page, a cross-section of today's major crises. If you scroll through the site, you'll see a clickable catalog of mothers buckling under medical debt, Palestinians in Gaza pleading for aid, researchers recouping lost federal grants, and coworkers desperate to help friends in ICE custody.

All the world's in crisis, and we are merely fundraisers. And in this moment of mass need, with foreign aid running low and our attention more divided than ever, it's hard not to feel overwhelmed by all the options in front of us.

In a little over a decade, the rise of online crowdfunding has entirely reshaped what it means to donate your money — and the contours of who receives it. In some ways, that's a great thing: Sites like GoFundMe have democratized access to support for people left behind by charities and governments. And donors get to feel good too, because giving to someone after reading their story on GoFundMe often feels more intimate and immediately impactful than a monthly donation to a nonprofit might.

But like anything else powered by algorithms and social media, the crowdfunding campaigners who thrive are the ones who can most deftly communicate their needs and their trauma. Those with the right social media acumen, follower count, and wealthy connections are much more likely to reach their fundraising goals, research shows, while close to 90 percent of fundraisers fail.

That means there are a lot of people who aren't getting the help they need. Of the over 2 million people and organizations that fundraised on GoFundMe for the first time last year, up to 1.8 million of them probably did not get the help they needed.

“The kids deserve better,” said Jackson, who's tried to spruce up her fundraising page but to little avail. It bothers her when she sees other campaigns on GoFundMe's discovery page raising thousands of dollars for, say, a sports competition or a family vacation.

There's nothing wrong with asking your friends, or strangers on the internet, for help. But it's hard to shake the feeling that we're all passing around the same $20 back and forth, just one unexpected medical fee away from turning our trauma into fundraising content ourselves, all while navigating an almost endless and inescapable barrage of bad news.

Many of us feel the urge to do something — really, anything — to stem the flow. The good news is there is so much you can do and no shortage of places to give. It's just a matter of finding the right way to give it.

If it feels like GoFundMe is everywhere these days, it's because it is. People used the platform at the mind-boggling pace of two donations every second in 2024.

And even as the number of Americans who donate to charity dwindles each year, the gravitational pull of GoFundMe has only gotten stronger. The company has raised $40 billion since its founding in 2010. About $30 billion was raised in the past five years alone.

GoFundMe has become so popular, trusted, and user-friendly that nonprofits have started plopping their fundraisers on the platform too. Many do so in the hopes of connecting with young people who prefer to give to whoever's tackling the issues they care about rather than to a specific organization enmeshed in the so-called nonprofit industrial complex.

But back in 2010, GoFundMe was just a nascent crowdfunding website; one of many, like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, to emerge just after the Great Recession and the internet's coming-of-age.

Nora Kenworthy, author of Crowded Out: The True Costs of Crowdfunding Healthcare, remembers stumbling upon a tear-off flier for a GoFundMe while on a stroll through her neighborhood back then. “Is this helping to connect people to sources of support that they wouldn't otherwise have?” she asked herself. “Or is this a kind of desperation politics on display?”

The question sent her down a 15-year rabbit hole of research into the efficacy and ethics of digital crowdfunding. The answer: probably a little bit of both.

“Part of the reason that this is so popular — despite the fact that a lot of us have somewhat icky feelings about it — is that it also provides meaningful support to people,” said Kenworthy. At the same time, she says, “it's really not doing anything to avoid people having to crowdfund in the first place. It really doesn't solve any of those problems.”

I've always tried to be the kind of person who keeps a couple of extra dollars in cash on hand for when someone asks me for money on the street.

But social media has taken that idea to a whole new level, with my friends and friends of friends constantly fundraising for often really worthy causes. I wanted to get some clarity over when and where to give when it feels like everyone needs help.

In other words, it's basically a huge bandage for a lot of serious issues that are overdue for some intensive surgery. Think skyrocketing health care costs, federal cuts to science research funding, and human-made humanitarian catastrophes. “Crowdfunding reveals these fundamental, looming chasms in our societies, and we've got to get real about how to address those,” Kenworthy added.

But that bandage can be absolutely life-changing for the lucky few.

People like Elisabeth Potter, the plastic surgeon who went viral after a UnitedHealthcare representative tried to disrupt a breast reconstruction for a cancer patient. In what she considers retaliation, the company has allegedly refused to cover surgeries at her practice, sharply limiting the number of patients who can seek her care, nearly bankrupting her practice. Her husband cashed out his 401(k) to make payroll this summer.

But thanks to her newfound fame, Potter recently raised over $800,000 on GoFundMe — an eighth of it from hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman — to cushion the losses. She knows how lucky she is for the support, but it baffles her that she needs it at all.

“I'm a microsurgeon who went to Princeton — it's just ridiculous that I have to have a GoFundMe,” she said. “It's ridiculous that Americans have to have a GoFundMe to afford medications for their children or surgeries that they hadn't planned on and thought that insurance would cover.”

Even GoFundMe readily admits that its platform is no replacement for a social safety net.

The company has tried to put a bigger focus on supporting traditional nonprofits in recent years, acquiring the online fundraising juggernaut Classy in 2022, launching snazzy new donor-advised funds, and building a directory of charities. But the bulk of GoFundMe donations — about 42 million of them in 2024 — still go to individuals, versus the 23 million that went to nonprofits like Feeding America or Save the Children.

That's because the platform, like social media more broadly, thrives on personal storytelling, and more often than not, that warm glow of giving to what's relatively fixable. It's more immediately gratifying to donate to a viral heartwarming story — like an apple orchard rebuilding from a fire — with a relatively fixable aim, than it is to give to a more complicated goalpost, such as a nonprofit trying to end malaria.

But why not have it both ways?

“Even the best-resourced nonprofits and the earliest responders and government programs aren't able to meet the full range of individuals' needs,” said Margaret Richardson, GoFundMe's chief corporate affairs officer. “Individual fundraising really is a complement in those moments.”

And, it's important to give credit where it's due. Crowdfunding has been genuinely effective at filling gaps where governments and traditional charities have fallen short.

Platforms like GoFundMe have facilitated tens of millions of dollars worth of donations to humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, for example, where traditional aid organizations have been severely restricted by Israel.

With no help in sight, one day, Mahmoud Almadhoun “grabbed three pots, some canned peas, some tomato paste” and decided to feed over 120 families himself in north Gaza, his brother Hani told Vox. Mahmoud had been relying on the few farms and suppliers left standing to source local food. Hani, a longtime fundraiser based in the US, built Mahmoud a GoFundMe in early 2024 that surpassed its $25,000 goal within a week. Soon, they were raising up to $10,000 per day.

“People were sending me money on Venmo and Zelle and giving me cash, and I was like, ‘Wow, people want to respond,'” Hani said. “People want to help, and they're not feeling that these bigger agencies are doing what they need them to do.”

Just like that, the Gaza Soup Kitchen was born.

An Israeli drone strike killed Mahmoud, a father of seven, in November 2024. The tragedy spurred even more support, says Hani, and the group has since incorporated into a formal nonprofit.

Gaza Soup Kitchen now has dozens of employees at about 11 locations in Gaza, feeds hundreds of families daily, and is in talks to spearhead a humanitarian aid project funded by a European government.

The kitchen's success “speaks to how desperate and bleak the situation is,” said Hani. “But also how hurt people are and how much they want to help.”

That is crowdfunding at its absolute best, and we'll have more on that later. But let's turn back for a moment to the 90 percent of GoFundMe campaigns that fail.

The ones that don't have a Hani Almadhoun at their helm or a hedge fund billionaire willing to give them a boost. “Most people don't realize just how grim the chances are,” says Kenworthy. In the end, some 43 percent of campaigns raise nothing at all.

The platform can be inefficient but also emotionally onerous, said Martin Lukk, author of GoFailMe: The Unfulfilled Promise of Digital Crowdfunding. His research has found that the top 5 percent of campaigns receive a whopping half of all donations.

A growing body of research indicates that crowdfunding most often rewards people who are middle-class, white, and internet savvy with a broad — and ideally, wealthy — social network to spread their message to. People like Jackson, the single mother in Indiana, rarely check off all of those boxes.

Also, there are a lot of causes that just don't do well on the algorithm. It's much harder to crowdfund for insulin than it is to fund an emergency surgery. The same is true for other chronic crises or nonprofit operating costs, like a research team or clean water project, where government grants make a big difference.

As a result, crowdfunding has done little to fill the gap for those buckling under the Trump administration's vast funding cuts. “It feels like every day is a new uphill battle,” said Cheri Levinson, who directs the University of Louisville's EAT Lab for eating disorder research.

Levinson started a GoFundMe after the Trump administration abruptly canceled federal grants amounting to $500,000. But her campaign has only managed to raise about $4,500, which is “not enough to cover anything,” she said. She's had to lay off two PhD students and a post-doctoral fellow, who moved to Kentucky for the grant and are now “thinking twice about if they should be doing this work or being in science” at all.

“The work that we're doing is work that saves lives,” she said. “If somebody would step up and actually fund this work, it would make such a big difference. But no, no one has stepped up.”

Even people affected by a highly visible crisis like the mass starvation and killings in Gaza — which has garnered widespread outrage, attention, and sympathy online — often struggle to raise significant funds because there's simply so much need.

Hani Almadhoun, the co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, regularly asks his followers to drop links to their own fundraisers so that his supporters can spread out their generosity a little bit more. He has friends in Gaza whose personal fundraisers have faltered because they don't have the same political acumen, connections abroad, or knack for storytelling that he does.

What's more, GoFundMe only allows people with bank accounts in North America, Europe, or Australia to fundraise on its platform, though Richardson says the company is actively trying to expand its global reach. For now, if you're from anywhere else, you need to ask someone from one of those largely white and wealthy countries to fundraise on your behalf.

And though Almadhoun's experience with GoFundMe has been positive, other Palestinian fundraisers have criticized the platform for its lack of support and the heightened scrutiny they've said it applies to their campaigns.

The Sameer Project, a mutual aid group founded by three Palestinians living in the diaspora (including in the United Kingdom and the United States), had a successful campaign removed from the platform. The group formed a few months after the war began, initially purchasing tents for people facing a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In April, they started a GoFundMe that began raising up to $80,000 daily.

In July, GoFundMe asked for more evidence of where the money was going. GoFundMe has said that fewer than 1 in 1,000 campaigns turn out to be fraudulent, but with millions of campaigns on its platform, that's still thousands of fake fundraisers each year. In response to the company's request, the group sent over reams of data documenting their financial transactions.

After a few weeks of back-and-forth over their financial documentation, said co-founder Hala Sabbah, GoFundMe sent an email in September shutting down their campaign with plans to refund to donors the $250,000 that the group raised that month.

Sabbah and her team were forced to dig into their “own money, savings, friends of friends” to continue paying their almost 100 full-time staff members in Gaza. Eventually, they found a new fundraising home on the nonprofit crowdfunding site Chuffed. But the experience left Sabbah with a sense that GoFundMe, which wields enormous power over the vast sums of giving it facilitates, is “a discriminatory platform choosing who lives and who dies.”

“Decisions to remove fundraisers from the platform follow thorough, evidence-based investigations and are based on these requirements, giving organizers multiple opportunities to provide all necessary context and supporting documentation,” GoFundMe said in a statement regarding the Sameer Project. “In this case, there were unfortunately material discrepancies in the information shared by the fundraiser organizers and their actions, which we communicated directly to them. Our team offered them the option of delivering the donations to a verified nonprofit organization providing aid to Gaza and they declined to do so.”

But it's true that with so much charitable giving pumping through GoFundMe — a for-profit company that earns a hefty commission for each successful fundraiser on its site — even a small twist in the algorithm or a controversial business decision can have wide-ranging, life-altering implications.

There is one big caveat to these critiques: Anything that gets you giving is probably a good thing.

Not just for the recipient, but for you too. Giving — however imperfectly or inequitably — is better than not giving at all. As Jon Bergdoll, an applied statistician at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, puts it: “What produces that warm glow for you? Charity does not need to feel like a chore.”

It's kind of like how the workout that's best for you is the one that you actually enjoy doing. The same applies for giving, whether that's a GoFundMe, a volunteer gig, or a charity that you give to every month.

The key here is not in forbidding any kind of giving, but catching yourself when the algorithm's about to batter you into apathy or direct you to a GoFundMe that's already raised more than the organizers know what to do with.

With so much at stake and limited resources, it's worth being intentional about which kind of GoFundMe campaigns or nonprofits can do the most good — and in what context.

It's easy to think that you have to give a ton of money in order to have an impact. But let's zoom out for a quick second. If you don't have kids and you make $70,000 per year, then you are part of the global 1 percent, earning more — often much, much more — than 99 percent of people on earth. And with that kind of money, you really can make a big difference, even with a small amount of cash.

$5 will buy a bednet to help prevent a family from getting malaria in Malawi. $12 is enough for an eSIM to get a journalist in Gaza online. $15 can help someone see with a new pair of prescription eyeglasses. And $50 can erase a whopping $5,000 in medical debt here in the United States. It can be empowering to know there are concrete ways that you can make people's lives better right now that don't require you to be a billionaire.

That said, there's no one-size-fits-all prescription for how to give effectively. How and where you choose to give is up to you. (Read this great piece from my colleague Sigal Samuel for more on that.) But there are some guiding questions that can help you channel your apathy or outrage — the kind you feel when you read the news or scroll through crises on your feed — into real-life, tangible solutions.

Phew. That's a lot to take in.

But a healthy giving diet can easily include a zesty combination of all of the above. A recurring gift to Wikipedia. A chunk of your tax return going to school lunches for hungry kids. A weekly gig volunteering with your local food pantry.

And it's okay if crowdfunding is a part of that too. When it comes to helping strangers on the internet, a happy medium can be seeking out a mutual aid group that distributes resources to those who need it the most.

In Los Angeles, a network of immigrant-serving nonprofits set up a street vendor solidarity fund that's raised over $200,000 to help cushion the financial blow of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns.

After this year's devastating wildfires, “day laborers were the first on the streets to pick up the ashes” while street vendors “fed a lot of those displaced,” said Sergio Jimenez, one of the fund's organizers. The city received an outpouring of donations — $250 million on GoFundMe alone — for those who lost their homes.

But it's been harder to raise funds, says Jimenez, for the hundreds of thousands of undocumented families now enduring a “similar tragedy” involving the “loss of an identity, the loss of your belongings” as a result of Trump's immigration raids. $200,000 is not nothing, he said, but “it's not enough — it's never enough.”

It's great that donations poured in after the LA wildfires, but with the constant barrage of crises on our feeds, it can be difficult to stay informed and engaged with the communities who need the most support long after the disaster fades. As my former colleague Kelsey Piper previously reported, it might also be better to loop back with charities on the ground after some time — when people have turned their attention to a different crisis altogether. Removing yourself from urgency and focusing instead on recovery long after disaster strikes can be a great way to help effectively.

Taking these steps can help avoid the compassion fatigue and the algorithm-induced apathy that accompanies our modern era of live-streamed crises. They can help you stay in it for the long haul, too. You probably won't be able to donate away the doomscroll — to foot every medical bill or feed every hungry child. But, in an age when everyone needs help, we can't afford to feel helpless.

In this scary economy, everything is computer.

It's been a big couple weeks for OpenAI. The most valuable startup in the world recently announced that ChatGPT will become more like an operating system, released its first social networking app, and even spread rumors about launching a device designed to make us happy.

There is some tricky accounting along the way, of course. These big product announcements happened after chipmaker Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, invested $100 billion in OpenAI to build more data centers, which OpenAI will fill with Nvidia chips. OpenAI then made a deal with AMD, Nvidia's rival, to build even more data centers and then fill them with AMD chips. Some analysts call these kinds of deals “circular,” since one company is investing money in another company that gives some of it right back. Others call it “bubble-like behavior.”

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

All things told, OpenAI has inked $1 trillion worth of computing deals this year alone. That staggering amount of money will help you do things like shop for houses on Zillow without leaving ChatGPT, star in your own AI-generated sitcom, and carry around an artificially intelligent surveillance device in your pocket. A trillion dollars is also a very silly sum when you acknowledge that OpenAI has never turned a profit and reportedly expects its losses to triple to $14 billion in 2026. And yet OpenAI's valuation climbed to $500 billion last week. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)

Math like this is what's got more and more people talking about the AI bubble and its imminent popping. On Wednesday, the Bank of England cautioned that the risk of a “sudden correction” to global markets is growing as the valuations of top AI companies increase. The same day, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva issued a similar warning and said tech company valuations “are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago.” The Nasdaq index reached a peak on March 10, 2000, before imploding. The Nasdaq closed at an all-time high on October 6.

The idea that we're looking at another tech bubble is not new. It's been around for at least a decade, and people were wringing their hands about AI hype even before ChatGPT stunned the world with its popularity. But now the stakes are higher than they've ever been, as investment in the AI industry has expanded into every corner of the economy. The AI boom is no longer just a Silicon Valley venture, as building the data centers needed to power apps like ChatGPT relies on the real estate, construction, and even air conditioning industries. Then there's the chip industry, which is ultimately reliant on a single company in Taiwan to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors for AI. Everyone seems to believe that the AI bet is too big to pass up.

The AI hype is so powerful, it's lifting up the rest of the economy. It's also obscuring a lot of bad economic news in the United States, including inflation, stagnated growth, and a dreadful job market for young people, which the rise of AI probably contributed to. If the AI boom has indeed become an AI bubble and that bubble bursts, the shock wave would hit everything.

That's a scary thought. It's also increasingly looking like a very real possibility. The circular dealmaking is just one red flag and it's not just OpenAI. Elon Musk's xAI recently raised $20 billion, some of which came from Nvidia, in order to buy Nvidia chips.

Another red flag is the simple fact that we don't know if these big bets on AI will pay off. AI companies expect demand for their products to keep growing, which is why they're investing so much in infrastructure so they can meet that demand if and when it comes. But everything is speculative. The hundreds of billions of dollars being thrown at data centers is reminiscent of the huge investment in internet infrastructure back in the 1990s. Eventually, however, the supply of fiber optic cables outpaced demand, and the telecom industry crashed.

The most salient signs of danger, however, are what you've probably experienced yourself: the bad vibes. Americans in general are pessimistic about AI and have only grown more concerned about the technology since ChatGPT's launch. We don't really know how AI will make our lives better. Sure, ChatGPT is popular — OpenAI says it has 700 million weekly active users — but it's far from clear if it will become our new operating system or the new front door to the internet. AI's ability to boost productivity is so far unproven, too. An MIT study released last month found that 95 percent of organizations surveyed found zero return from their AI initiatives.

It's certainly possible the AI boom remains just that, and we all ride into the future with virtual assistants in our ears and data centers in our back yards. It's also possible that the bubble-callers are correct, and that we're about to relive not only the dotcom crash of the early 2000s but also the aftermath of Railroad Mania in the 1840s. In both of those periods, companies collapsed, and lives were ruined. The infrastructure survived, however. Victorian England ended up with a railway system, and Silicon Valley got tubes to run the internet on. Eventually we figured out how to make it all work.

Google changed a policy that pushed employees to use a third-party AI health tool, after Business Insider reported on backlash from staff.

Google had told employees who want health benefits in the new enrollment cycle that they must allow an AI tool from Nayya to access their personal data, or else they wouldn't be eligible for benefits for the coming year.

The move rankled some staff who raised concerns about sharing personal data with the service. After Business Insider reported on the guidelines and backlash, Google updated its internal policy to tell employees that they can choose not to opt-in and will still be eligible for benefits.

""Our intent was not reflected in the language on our HR site,"" a Google spokesperson told Business Insider after publication. ""We've clarified it to make clear that employees can choose to not share data, without any effect on their benefits enrollment.""

The spokesperson added that no data will be shared with Nayya for employees who don't opt-in.

Companies from Meta to Microsoft are increasingly incorporating AI tools into their workplaces. Google is pushing AI usage to increase employee productivity as well. Like Google, some companies, such as Salesforce and Walmart, have also rolled out AI-powered health benefits tools, like Included Health, to their workforces.

Google's new guidelines were posted on an internal benefits site. The company had initially stated that employees who wanted health benefits must give access to AI-powered tools provided by Nayya, which offers personalized benefits recommendations, according to internal documents reviewed by Business Insider.

""Nayya provides core health plan operating services to optimize your benefits usage, so Alphabet health plan participants can't entirely opt out of third-party data sharing (as permitted under HIPAA),"" the guidelines previously read.

""To opt out of health supplier data sharing going forward, unenroll from the Alphabet-provided benefits during Open Enrollment or when you experience a qualified Family Status Change,"" it continued.

Updated internal guidelines seen by Business Insider now tell staff that Nayya is optional. For those who still choose to opt in, data such as pay, gender, and social security number will be shared with the tool, according to the guidelines.

Nayya, a New York-based healthcare AI startup, allows employees to input information about their health and lifestyle, and provides recommendations on benefits to choose. The company has raised funding from HR software giant Workday, ADP and Iconiq Capital.

The original policy caused a furor among some employees this week. Staff posted messages on an internal Q&A site, asking why they must give potentially sensitive medical data to an outside tool if they want to receive medical coverage.

""Why are we providing our medical claims to a third-party AI tool without a way to opt out?"" read one of the questions submitted, which was viewed by Business Insider.

""This is a very dark pattern,"" read another post. ""I cannot meaningfully consent to my data being shared with this company, and I do not want to consent in this manner.""

Some employees also posted their concerns on Memegen, Google's internal message board. One post read: ""Consent for an optional feature like 'benefits usage optimization' is not meaningful if it's coupled to a must-have feature like Google's HEALTH PLANS! The word you're thinking of is 'coercive.'""

A Nayya spokesperson said its tool allows employees who choose to participate to see how much of their deductible has been met and receive personalized plan recommendations. They also said that Google conducted a standard security and privacy review of Nayya's product.

""Nayya is required to protect health data maintained in accordance with HIPAA,"" read an internal Google FAQ page about Nayya, which added that Nayya ""will not share, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose"" personally identifiable information it collects.

There's sticker shock, and then there's whatever is happening with America's used-car market. Prices for a slightly-less-than-new-car have been soaring over the past few years. Before the pandemic, the average price for a 3-year-old vehicle topped out at a little over $22,000. In 2025, the cost is upward of $31,000. And according to Edmunds, which tracks the car market, that number may soon sound like a bargain.

""I mean, it's kind of mind-boggling for anybody who had the pleasure or context of having bought pre-2020, right?"" says Ivan Drury, the director of insights at Edmunds.

You may remember the used-car apocalypse nestled inside the whole-world apocalypse during the COVID-19 outbreak. Supply chain disruptions in new vehicle production, increased competition from rental car companies, and a surge in demand from consumers seeking to socially distance themselves from others behind the wheel caused a scramble for older vehicles. Like many things post-pandemic, the used car sector is not back to normal. The average price of all used car transactions is below its pandemic peak, but still thousands of dollars more expensive than it was six years ago. Prices are creeping up again, too: The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows they're up 6% over the past year.

""Those hangover effects from so much disruption from years ago, it's all playing out now,"" Drury says.

With tariffs in the mix and new car prices continuing to creep up, the future may be worse. The answer to the perennial question of when is the ""best time"" to buy a used car may now permanently be ""there's no such thing as a best time."" And when it comes time to get a car, new or used, hope you have some time to shop around.

Or as Drury puts it: ""It's not just reestablishing your expectations, but coming to terms with today's new reality, which is unfortunately not in your favor.""

To state the obvious, before a car can be used, it has to be new. So when there's a slump in new cars rolling off the lot, that hits the used vehicle market down the road. According to data from Edmunds, millions fewer new cars have been sold in the US in recent years. Sixteen to 17 million new cars were sold annually in the US from 2014 to 2019. From 2020 to 2022, that number fell to 13 to 14 million each year. Sales have been creeping back up — Edmunds estimates sales will finally surpass 16 million again this year — but even with the rebound, the ripple effects of the pandemic-era semiconductor shortage and other supply-chain and sales headaches continue to have an impact.

""Those vehicles never entered the vehicle ecosystem to become used vehicles for consumers, and that's the crux of the matter right now, it's that hole that was made,"" says Jeremy Robb, senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive.

There simply aren't as many people going to dealerships looking to trade in cars they bought new two, three, or four years ago. And if they are turning up, it's with vehicles that were more expensive in the first place because of pandemic-era pressures. Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global, says that because of supply chain issues, carmakers focused on ""their most popular models and their most popular trim levels,"" which tended to be on the middle or high-end of their price range.

""So you have a combination of a vehicle that was more expensive in the first place and relatively low supply,"" Brinley says.

Leasing is a factor, too. Typically, about 30% new cars are leased every year, Robb explains, but that fell to about 17% in 2022. Automakers would rather customers simply buy a car outright — they make more off of it — so heightened consumer competition for a limited number of pricey new vehicles reduced the need for manufacturers to offer leasing terms, because they were selling premium cars for close to full price. Most leases mature in 36 months, at which point the car is often turned in and put on the used car market.

""The lease maturities have really been contracting over the past year and a half and will continue to contract,"" Robb says.

Apart from the pandemic, there are other generally consumer-unfriendly shifts in the new car market that are trickling down to the used car market. New cars have gotten extremely expensive as people load up their vehicles with all sorts of pricey features and tech. Once a new car's price goes up, used cars of the same model go up, too, as they tend to be anchored together. American drivers lean toward bigger, pricier cars, which is fine with automakers since the larger models tend to produce more profits. Many more affordable, smaller vehicles have been pulled off the market altogether — RIP to the Ford Focus, Chevy Cruz, and Dodge Dart. The impact is multi-fold: Used cars are more expensive because they were more expensive when they were new, owners may be holding onto them longer to justify the higher price tag, and some more cost-conscious would-be new car buyers are being priced out of the market.

""We're not seeing a great expansion of new vehicles and definitely not entry-level new vehicles, so the people who would look to a $30,000 entry-level model are forced into the used car market,"" says Sam Fiorani, an industry analyst at AutoForecast Solutions. Some manufacturers are starting to notice the missing part of their lineups and fill it, but even those prices are going up quickly. ""Where entry-level was $15,000 not too long ago, it's suddenly closing in on $30,000,"" Fiorani says.

""Every time you do something that raises the cost of a new car, they're at such high levels already, what you're really doing is creating another used vehicle consumer,"" Robb says.

When I ask analysts and auto experts whether the used-car price picture is going to get brighter anytime soon, the answer is more or less… not really. While vehicles are taking longer to sell as people hunt for deals and think it through, demand isn't coming down. Nathan Garnett, chief business officer at online marketplace OfferUp, tells me that even as listing prices for used cars have increased on the platform over the past year, sell-through rates have not budged. ""Buyers are willing to pay those prices,"" he says.

It makes sense: The US is very car-dependent, and if you need a car to get to work or school or the grocery store, you need a car, full stop. Plus, driving can be a fun and pleasant way to get around.

As with many other industries, the tariffs are an elephant in the room. Brinley, from S&P Global, says their implications are the ""thousand-dollar question."" Many automakers have been eating the costs of tariffs, though that can't go on forever if trade uncertainty persists. Brinley says they're ""cautiously watching"" for trade agreements with the EU and Japan to be solidified, but bigger questions loom around negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico — especially since the free trade deal between the three countries is up for review in July 2026. ""In the meantime of all of that, automakers are moving through a lot, so prices will come up,"" she says.

While tariffs haven't been a big factor so far, the anticipation of them caused some people to pull forward their purchase of a new car to avoid anticipated price hikes in the future. That's good for the used market in that they traded in their old car, but at the same time, dealers who are also expecting higher prices paid more for trade-ins than they would have otherwise. ""That's messed with the market a bit,"" Drury says.

Tariff-driven purchases haven't been linear, either, says Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at CarGurus, a car research and sales website. They saw sales of new and used vehicles pick up in March and April, around President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcements, normalize, and then pick back up again toward the end of the summer. ""I think people were just kind of like, 'Oh, prices could go up even further. I should go get a car now if I was kind of looking for one,"" he says.

One of the more uncomfortable realities of the American economy in the wake of the pandemic is that prices will not return to their previous levels. While inflation has slowed, we won't see widespread deflation (nor do we want to). That means resetting expectations before you walk onto the car lot, developing a bit of price tag amnesia, and kissing that 2013 cost you may have in your head goodbye. There are surely deals to be had, but they're hard to find, and the $20,000 that might have gotten you a solid 3-year-old vehicle 10 years ago will now land you an 8-year-old car with 80,000 miles on it. On used vehicles, we've made our bed, and now we have to lie in it.

""You can't make new used cars,"" Fiorani says.

Scott Thomas, 66, lives near Tampa, Florida, and earlier in his career, worked in customer service operations at companies including Citigroup. Since then, he's owned several businesses, including fitness centers. He has been trying to re-enter the corporate world. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I spend about four to six hours a day completing job applications. It's become this weird treasure hunt for me. Each time I try to stop doing it, I go, ""Well, now I have nothing to hope for.""

So every day, it drives me to keep searching. I've gotten to the point where I get about 75 to 100 emails a day filled with job postings. Every morning, I go through my inbox, and by the time I get done, it's cleared out, and I've applied to maybe 100 jobs. That's every day.

It's just me and my dog, so that's pretty much all I do. I don't watch TV. I don't watch movies. I have a part-time business pressure washing, but I only do that two or three times a week.

Every day, job listings are right in front of me on my computer. It's almost like FOMO. What if I missed that golden opportunity?

I can't retire. I lost my businesses just before the pandemic. I owned two fitness centers. I basically have already used my retirement money, and now I have to go back to work during everyone else's retirement. My buddies say, ""Oh, I just retired."" I'm like, ""Well, I'm going back to work for the next 15 years.""

I'm OK with it. I'm kind of bored and want to use the skill set that I've built.

If the fitness centers had stayed in business, I would have been happy adding a couple more and ending my career that way. But since they didn't, I have to think of another way to get back on track.

I have no capital left, so I really can't start another business. The only way to get back to the lifestyle that I was used to is to catch a pretty significant, senior-level job. I'm searching for anywhere from $80,000 and up a year.

My brother is like, ""You need to go to Home Depot and work in the electrical aisle."" But I'm just not going to do that. That would be admitting defeat. It wouldn't be utilizing what I worked so hard to create.

There's no question that ageism has been a problem for me. One guy just flat out said, ""How long do you think you're going to work for?"" I said, ""Well, at least 10 years."" He said, ""Really?"" So, I knew I was in trouble there.

I don't know if I look 90 years old or 40 years old, but I think I look my age, or maybe a little younger. They're going to figure out my age by the timeline on my résumé. I always question whether I should chop my résumé in half.

At this point, I'm a professional interviewer. Every time they tell me, ""Great answer. Love it."" But then afterward, they sit back and go, ""Wait a minute. He hasn't done this for 15 years."" That's my Achilles' heel.

I don't ask for feedback anymore because they just give me a whitewashed answer.

I'm an AI fanatic, so I really push that hard during the interview process: I say, ""I jumped on the AI bandwagon before it was a wagon.""

I've learned more about customer service operations by reading job descriptions and preparing for interviews than I ever did doing it. I'm reading the white papers and watching the webinars. In seven years, I've spent more time doing research than I ever did sitting in my office at Citigroup. When you're running it, you're not doing the deep research. You're too busy.

I can interview as often as I want, really. I think, ""Hey, I might hook one. It would be great."" That's what keeps me going. If I give up, I'll just be sitting here doing nothing. So I might as well use my free time to keep trying until my fingers don't work anymore.

I started looking in 2019, about a year before I lost my fitness centers, because I had that feeling that I wanted to get back into corporate.

I have well over 100 versions of my résumé and have used AI to help make it clearer. Before, it was a laundry list of all kinds of stuff.

I use LazyApply, where I don't even know it's happening, and I get a rejection letter from a company I've never heard of. That's just within the last couple of months. For the most part, I use Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn. Networking is difficult and time-consuming, so I use more of the shotgun approach.

Applying is therapeutic. Otherwise, you can fall into a deep depression with this number of rejections. I've tried to be fearless about keeping going. It's part insanity and part ambition. I think now I'm going for the world record. Not many people have done the two things I've done: One is not getting a job, and the other is not giving up.

Last year, I was running on empty. Decades spent as an editor in the relentless pace of London, Hong Kong, and Dubai had left me depleted. What some might call a midlife crisis, I saw as a necessary intervention — one that led me straight to Thailand.

I began my reset in bustling Bangkok, but it was the calmer southern shores of Phuket where I truly found my peace. My mission was to stop, reset, and rebuild on my own terms.

Naturally, the most pressing question loomed over me: What was the price tag on this kind of freedom? My research, a deep dive into online forums and even AI assistants, consistently delivered the same magic number, $1,500 a month to live comfortably in Thailand.

My first concern was where to live. I discovered I could rent a studio for as low as $200 a month or splurge on a modern condo for about $1,000.

I chose a serviced apartment in a mid-range hotel in Kathu, a leafy suburban jungle area in Phuket that's far from the tourist crowds of Patong. 

As a long-term resident, I pay around 13,000 Thai baht, or $400, a month. This includes all utilities, cleaning, high-speed WiFi, and access to amenities like an infinity pool and gym. The rent fluctuates slightly between high and low seasons, but the average is roughly that amount.

The best part? I don't have a long-term contract, just a flexible two-week notice period when I decide to move on.

No day in Thailand is complete without a trip to a 7-Eleven or Tops Daily. I've come to believe that everything you need to stay happy, healthy, and alive can be found in a Thai convenience store. It's where I can fill my basket to the brim without worrying about the final cost.

Between fresh fruit, yogurt, probiotics, vitamins, soft drinks, water, and snacks, I spend about $10 a day. This is also where I top up my mobile plan. My pay-as-you-go package, free of any expensive, locked-in contracts, costs $10 a month for unlimited calls and high-speed data.

Transport is one area where I've kept things simple. Instead of renting a motorbike for about $6 a day like many people do in Phuket, I rely on Grab, a local ride-hailing app. A quick ride to the beach on a GrabBike costs a dollar or two, and I book a car for longer trips.

Since I work remotely and can walk to most places, I only travel every other day, keeping my transport costs low while getting my steps in.

One of the biggest joys of living in Thailand has been discovering that I can eat exceptionally well without spending a fortune. For someone who can barely boil an egg, it's been a life-changing convenience.

A plate of pad Thai from a street-side vendor costs around $2. I've since leveled up by ordering through a food delivery app, which often comes with free delivery and promotional discounts. 

I get restaurant-quality meals like papaya salad and spicy basil pork delivered to my door for $3. I don't think I've ever eaten so healthily or deliciously — budget aside. 

All in, I spend roughly $250 a month on food, which covers everything from morning market fruit to my daily delivered dinners. 

Staying fit and well-groomed in Phuket has also been easy and inexpensive. My local neighborhood gym is a multi-level space stocked with modern equipment and a schedule of classes.

I now have a regular schedule of Tabata and HIIT classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and weight training every other afternoon. While the standard monthly membership is about $50, I renewed during my birthday month in August and scored a six-month package for $115.

After a workout, I often reward myself with a $10 one-hour recovery massage. I also visit my favorite rock-and-roll styled barber twice a month, where a stylist gives me a cut for $9.

Even what I once considered luxury treatments are within reach. Korean Botox starts at around $125 for 50 units, proving that living on a budget doesn't mean sacrificing your personal care — or vanity.

Living in Phuket is genuinely affordable, especially if you embrace local living and avoid tourist traps. When I add up my core expenses like rent, daily convenience store runs, food, and transport, it totals about $1,000 a month. This leaves enough wiggle room for all kinds of extras, including weekend trips to nearby islands. 

The budget not only covers a comfortable life in Thailand but also funds an exhilarating lifestyle in what I've deemed one of the world's most dynamic and welcoming countries.

When Anshul Gandhi graduated from dental school in India, the idea of working for a company like Apple — let alone as a machine learning engineer — felt far beyond his reach.

But 11 years later, after moving to the US for graduate school and navigating multiple job transitions, that's exactly where he ended up.

During his final years of dental school, Gandhi realized the profession wasn't for him. He and other students had begun treating patients, including performing root canals, dentures, and other procedures. The experience gave him a clearer sense of what day-to-day work in the field would look like.

""Deep down, I knew it wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life,"" said Gandhi, who's in his 30s and lives in Austin.

So he began exploring other paths. Gandhi said he'd taken computer science courses in high school, which gave him some familiarity with the coding languages C++ and Java. During his final year of dental school, he enrolled in a few programming courses, which he said helped him develop his coding skills. The more he learned, the more confident he felt about pursuing a programming role in the tech industry.

""By the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to start my career in this field,"" he said.

In the years that followed, Gandhi would set his sights on an even bigger goal: landing an AI role at one of the largest US tech companies. However, his lack of formal education and work experience in the field, combined with a competitive tech job market, posed a real challenge. If he wanted a shot at Big Tech, he knew he'd have to keep building his skillset.

Gandhi is among the professionals who've pursued AI roles in recent years, as major tech companies like Meta and Google collectively invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure.

While several tech giants have laid off workers in recent years, many are aggressively chasing AI talent and offering eye-popping pay packages. A LinkedIn analysis of job growth rates between early 2022 and mid-2024 found that ""artificial intelligence engineer"" was the fastest-growing role on the platform.

While AI roles are competitive, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Gandhi shared how he landed interviews at Microsoft and Walmart — and ultimately secured a machine learning role at Apple.

We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com (or Signal at jzinkula.29). See more of our job market coverage below:

After graduating from dental school in 2013, Gandhi said he secured a data analysis role in India that provided him with more hands-on programming experience. He also connected with computer science engineers who helped him find online boot camps and side projects focused on AI and machine learning.

While AI is arguably the biggest trend in tech today, Gandhi said that a decade ago, ""big data"" was the industry's buzzword. His early exposure to AI helped him build expertise that felt relatively niche at the time.

""At that time, nobody was talking about AI,"" he said.

After a few years, Gandhi decided he wanted more practical knowledge and hands-on experience in AI and machine learning, so he started applying to graduate school programs. In 2016, he moved to the US to pursue a master's degree in biomedical informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He hoped the degree would give him a strong foundation in AI and data science, while also allowing him to build on his healthcare background.

""It gave me the technical depth I was looking for, while still feeling connected to my previous experience,"" he said.

After graduating in 2018, he began working as a data scientist until 2021, when he landed a machine learning engineering role at Dell. While Gandhi was generally happy with his new position, he hadn't given up on his goal of working at one of the largest US tech companies.

""I wanted to work on designing large-scale machine learning systems that serve tens of millions of users globally,"" he said. ""And that kind of scale, you only get from working for a company like Meta, Amazon, Google, Netflix, or Apple.""

Around August 2024, Gandhi began looking for a new role, he said. But he soon realized the job market was tougher than he'd previously experienced. He said demand for generative AI-specific skills — rather than traditional machine learning expertise — had surged, and the bar for technical proficiency was higher than ever.

""This round of hiring was totally different,"" he said.

One of the first steps he took to boost his chances was becoming more active on LinkedIn. At the time, he had about 200 connections, a number a recruiter told him raised concerns about the authenticity of his profile. She expected someone with his experience to have at least hit the ""500+"" threshold LinkedIn uses to display connection counts.

To boost his LinkedIn presence, Gandhi began connecting with more people. He now has over 500 connections and more than 3,000 followers. Over the past year, he has also begun posting his thoughts on the tech industry, aiming to establish himself as an expert in AI and machine learning.

Gandhi said he learned two other things during the early stages of his job search. One was that he needed to be more selective about what roles he applied for, prioritizing positions that were the best fit.

The other was that he might need a referral to land the type of job he desired, and that he needed to be strategic about how he pursued one. While Gandhi continued to reach out to strangers on LinkedIn for referrals, he said he also began investing time in building a minimal online relationship first.

""When you connect, you don't just say, 'Hey, can you refer me?' because nobody has the time,"" he said. ""I realized that you have to keep engaging with their content, sharing your thoughts, and let them know that you not only exist, but are also a thought leader in your field.""

Gandhi said his experience working in the AI field helped him land interviews at multiple companies without referrals, including PayPal. However, he said that a referral from a friend helped him get an interview at Microsoft, and a LinkedIn connection led to a referral at Walmart.

In the fall of 2024, Gandhi accepted a machine learning role at a large healthcare organization that checked many of his boxes. However, he continued to interview for roles he'd previously applied for, and later that year, he landed an offer for a machine learning engineering job at Apple. He started in January and said he's very happy with his role.

Gandhi said he didn't have a referral for the Apple job — it came through a cold application — but he still considers pursuing referrals to be a wise strategy for job seekers. When preparing for machine learning interviews, Gandhi recommends practicing LeetCode problems, mock interviews, and system-design drills — as well as familiarizing oneself with agent-based AI, retrieval-augmented generation, prompt tuning, and inference engines.

Gandhi said among the top takeaways from his job search journey is that career pivots — even unconventional ones — are possible.

""I didn't have a linear path,"" he said. ""I don't think a lot of people have a very pre-planned career path. So you can start over, even if it feels impossible.""

If your old coffee maker has been struggling to make a good, strong brew or you're ready to test out your barista skills with an espresso machine, Prime Day is the best time to shop for coffee machines and accessories.

Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged Thursday after China tightened restrictions on exports, fueling market speculation that the Trump administration will move more aggressively to invest in building out a domestic supply chain.

Ramaco Resources soared more than 11%, Energy Fuels surged over 12%, USA Rare Earth jumped more than 16%, NioCorp Developments rallied 14%, and MP Materials advanced over 6%. Albemarle popped 7%, Trilogy Metals rose over 4%, and Lithium Americas was up about 2%.

Beijing is now requiring foreign entities to obtain a license to export products that contain rare earths worth 0.1% or more of the goods' value, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. Companies will also need export licenses if they use China's extraction, refining or magnet recycling technology.

""The White House and relevant agencies are closely assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without any notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world's technology supply chains,"" an administration official told CNBC.

China imposed the restrictions ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea, later this month.

Rare earths have been a major point of contention in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Beijing dominates the global rare-earth supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on imports from China.

The White House and the U.S. critical mineral industry have accused China of manipulating the market to drive foreign competition out of business. Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs for U.S. weapons platforms, robotics, electric vehicles and electronics among other applications.

The Defense Department struck an unprecedent deal with the largest U.S. rare earth miner MP Materials in July that included an equity stake, the first big salvo in the Trump administration's push to back the U.S. industry against China. The White House has subsequently taken stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals, fuelling investor speculation that more deals will follow.

""This action reinforces the need for forward-leaning U.S. industrial policy,"" a MP spokesperson said of China's export restrictions. ""Building resilient supply chains is a matter of economic and national security.""

USA Rare Earth and Energy Fuels have not struck deals with the White House, but their CEOs told CNBC that they are in close contact with the Trump administration.

""It's going to take a lot of players to build out this marketplace,"" USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC on Oct. 2.

China's export restrictions ""help to ensure a strong position for Xi to sit down with Trump"" on the sidelines of the summit in South Korea, Evercore ISI analyst Neo Wang told clients in a Thursday note.

""Although both Beijing and Washington learnt the lesson the hard way in their last exchange of export controls back in [April] and May, China's stronger pain endurance rooted in its political system adds to the credibility of its threats in a game of chicken,"" Wang wrote.

The Senate on Thursday is set to vote for a seventh time to try to end the government shutdown, as the stalemate on Capitol Hill continues with no sign of a breakthrough.

Now in its ninth day, more of the shutdown's widespread impacts on the government are starting to emerge. The IRS, for instance, said Wednesday that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce as a result of the congressional funding lapse.

Still, lawmakers on both sides remain dug in, showing no indication that they are open to yielding on their demands.

The Senate is expected to vote at around 11:30 a.m. ET on dueling Republican and Democratic proposals to end the government shutdown.

Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the Senate, need about eight votes from the Democratic caucus in order to pass their short-term funding bill in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required for passage.

In the last round of voting on Wednesday, the GOP bill was rejected 54-45, while the Democrats' version fell short in a 47-52 tally.

In this article

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Thursday that it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million Tesla vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving system over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes.

The auto safety agency said FSD - an assistance system that requires drivers to pay attention and intervene if needed - has ""induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws.""

The agency said it has reports of Tesla vehicles using FSD driving through red traffic lights and driving against the proper direction of travel during a lane change.

In total, NHTSA is reviewing 58 reports of issues involving traffic safety violations when using FSD, including 14 crashes and 23 injuries.

The new investigation comes amid growing scrutiny of Tesla's advanced driver assistance system from Congress and weeks after a new NHTSA administrator was confirmed.

Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, issued a software update to FSD this week.

NHTSA said it has six reports in which a Tesla vehicle, operating with FSD engaged, ""approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles in the intersection.""

NHTSA said four crashes resulted in one or more injuries.

The investigation - a preliminary evaluation - is the first step before the agency could seek a recall of the vehicles if it believes they pose an unreasonable risk to safety.

A driver in Houston in 2024 told NHTSA that FSD ""is not recognizing traffic signals. This results in the vehicle proceeding through red lights, and stopping at green lights.""

The complaint added: ""Tesla doesn't want to fix it, or even acknowledge the problem, even though they've done a test drive with me and seen the issue with their own eyes.""

NHTSA also said it will review FSD behavior when approaching railroad crossings. Last month, Democrat Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal cited a growing number of reported near-collisions in urging the agency to investigate.

Tesla's FSD, which is more advanced than its Autopilot system, has been under investigation by NHTSA for a year.

In October 2024, the agency began an inquiry into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD after four reported collisions in conditions of reduced roadway visibility, such as sun glare, fog or airborne dust, including a 2023 fatal crash.

Tesla says FSD ""will drive you almost anywhere with your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention"" but does not make the car self-driving.

Tesla's other automated vehicle features have also drawn agency scrutiny.

In January, NHTSA opened an investigation into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that lets users move their cars remotely.

NHTSA is also reviewing Tesla's deployment of self-driving robotaxis in Austin, Texas, launched in June.

In this article

Novo Nordisk said on Thursday it would buy U.S.-based Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion to gain access to a promising liver disease drug candidate, in the first major deal by the Danish drugmaker's new CEO to spur growth.

Mike Doustdar, who took the helm at the Wegovy maker in July, has signaled a focus on new, highly effective obesity and diabetes drugs that can also treat related cardiometabolic conditions such as MASH, rather than expanding into other areas.

Akero's drug candidate, efruxifermin, is currently in late-stage trials for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).

""We view this deal, coupled with recent internal restructuring at Novo, positively as Doustdar works to bring the ship back on course,"" said BMO Capital analyst Evan Seigerman.

Under Doustdar, tasked with stemming market share losses to U.S. rival Eli Lilly, the company last month said it would cut 9,000 jobs.

Efruxifermin has shown potential in reversing liver scarring in MASH patients in earlier studies.

Doustdar called it ""an important building block"" for future growth, especially as Novo prepares for the loss of exclusivity on semaglutide, the active ingredient in blockbuster drug Wegovy, starting next year in regions like India and China.

Lukas Leu, a portfolio manager at Novo Nordisk shareholder ATG Healthcare, said it was encouraging to see Novo seal a major deal and expand in a high-growth area, where rivals such as Roche and GSK have also made recent moves.

In August, Wegovy became the first GLP-1 drug to receive accelerated approval for MASH in the U.S., where the disease affects around 5% of adults.

Novo has discontinued its MASH candidate, zalfermin, which belonged to the same class of treatments as efruxifermin.

Akero marks a significant increase in deal size for Novo, as its recent biotech acquisitions in metabolic diseases typically ranged between $1 billion and $2 billion.

""They need to start acquiring assets and expanding their pipeline,"" Leu said, adding that he remains cautious given the stock is ""still in the doghouse"".

Novo shares have risen 11% since Doustdar's appointment, but remain down nearly 40% for the year, reflecting investor concerns over Wegovy's U.S. prescription trends.

The Akero deal includes an upfront cash payment of $54 per share held, totaling about $4.7 billion, a 16.2% premium over Akero's last closing price.

An additional $6 per share will be paid if efruxifermin secures full U.S. approval by June 2031.

Akero's shares rose over 16% in afternoon trading, while Novo shares slipped 1%.

Novo plans to finance the acquisition through debt and expects to close the deal by the end of the year.

In this article

Shares of Ferrari are on track for their worst trading day ever on Thursday after the luxury carmaker updated its full-year and 2030 guidance and scaled back its electrification ambitions.

Analysts were disappointed by the new guidance, saying it fell short of expectations.

The Maranello, Italy-based sports car manufacturer said at its Capital Markets Day (CMD) event that it expected net revenue of at least 7.1 billion euros ($10.7 billion) this year, up from a previous forecast of more than 7 billion euros.

Net revenue is expected to be around 9 billion euros in 2030, and the company is targeting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of at least 3.6 billion euros by 2030.

Ferrari's Milan-listed stock price tumbled 16.1%, before paring some of its losses to close at 354 euros, down 15.4%. It was Ferrari's worst trading day since the automaker publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.

U.S.-listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange opened Thursday at $419.18, down roughly 13%. Like the Milan-listed shares, the stock is on track for its worst day since listing in October 2015, down about 15% during intraday trading early Thursday afternoon.

U.S.-listed shares, with a market cap of nearly $80 billion, is now down about 4% for the year amid Thursday's decline.

Analysts at Citi said in a research note that Ferrari's guidance ""falls below our 'lower growth case' estimates from our CMD preview and reflects conservatism from management, we think.""

They added: ""Given guidance, albeit conservative, implies limited operating leverage through the coming cycle we think there is some risk to both consensus EPS and multiples near-term.""

In a separate update, Ferrari said it would target a 2030 sports car model line-up made up of 40% internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, 40% hybrid and 20% fully electric vehicles.

Ferrari said the revised target, which is down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales by the end of the decade, is the result of a client-centric approach, the current environment and its expected evolution.

The pivot comes as the Italian carmaker lifted the hood on the technology set to power its maiden electric vehicle. Ferrari unveiled the production-ready chassis and powertrain of the ""elettrica"" during a technology and innovation workshop, saying it would start deliveries of the model in late 2026.

The completed car is expected to be launched at a global premiere next year.

""With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing,"" John Elkann, executive chairman of Ferrari, said in a statement.

Several global carmakers have scaled back their EV sales targets in recent months, citing factors such a lack of affordable models, a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging points and intense competition from China.

Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, abandoned its heavily promoted plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying in September last year that it needed to be ""pragmatic and flexible"" amid changing market conditions.

Ferrari, which has seen its current number of active clients grow to 90,000, an increase of 20% compared to 2022, also said it planned to launch an average of four new cars per year between 2026 and 2030.

Analysts at JPMorgan were bullish following the announcements laid out in Ferrari's 2030 Strategic Plan.

""We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,"" analysts at JPMorgan said Thursday in a research note.

""We also estimate the company benefits from CEO Benedetto Vigna's leadership style, which has challenged the company to capitalise on collaboration to increase the speed at which it embraces innovation. An imminent Supercar launch may also have the potential to turbocharge profits,"" they added.

Beleaguered wind farm operator Orsted announced Thursday that it intends to reduce its workforce by a quarter toward the end of 2027, in a bid to become more competitive and refocus its efforts on Europe.

Shares were 0.7% higher in European trade on Thursday. The stock came under pressure earlier this year amid concerted efforts from the White House to reduce renewable energy generation in the United States.

On his first day in office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending new or renewed onshore and offshore wind leases. He also told reporters earlier this year that during his presidency, America was ""not going to do the wind thing.""

Over the summer, the Trump administration ordered Orsted to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island — which was 80% complete and set to power more than 350,000 homes. A U.S. court overturned that order last month.

In September, Orsted cut its full-year guidance, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its offshore portfolio.

""Today, we've told our employees that from now and until the end of 2027, we'll be saying goodbye to many skilled and valued colleagues who've contributed greatly to Ørsted,"" Rasmus Errboe, the company's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.

Orsted currently employs around 8,000 people worldwide, and said it would reduce its headcount by 500 before the end of this year, culminating in a total of 2,000 reductions. The firm will trim employee numbers through natural attrition, cutting positions, divestment, outsourcing, and layoffs, it said.

The annual savings for Orsted are expected to amount to 2 billion Danish krona ($311 million) from 2028.

""This is a necessary consequence of our decision to focus our business and the fact that we'll be finalising our large construction portfolio in the coming years – which is why we'll need fewer employees,"" Errboe added on Thursday. ""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organisation and a more competitive Ørsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.""

China has tightened export controls on rare earths and related technologies while barring its citizens from participating in unauthorized mining overseas, adding fresh strains to a sector central to its geopolitical leverage.

Foreign entities must now obtain a license from Beijing to export any products containing over 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.

To prevent the ""misuse"" of rare-earth minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors, companies tied to foreign militaries or placed on export-control or watch lists will be denied permits, the commerce ministry said. Applications for items that could be used in weaponry, terrorism or other military purposes will also be rejected.

The latest move marks a ""major upgrade for rare earth export control,"" expanding restrictions from only raw materials to intellectual property and technologies, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. China added several rare earths and related materials to its export control list in April.

These restrictions could further deepen other countries' dependence on Chinese know-how while supporting Beijing's efforts to move its own industries up the value chain, Wang added.

Chinese citizens are also prohibited from supporting overseas activities related to rare earth extraction and magnet manufacturing without approval from Beijing.

The new rules on the export of rare earth materials will take effect on December 1, while those on technologies and labor took effect immediately, according to official statements.

Applications for rare earth exports used in producing sub-14 nanometer semiconductors, advanced memory chips, semiconductor manufacturing or testing equipment, or artificial intelligence with potential military applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the ministry said.

The measures mainly target the defense sector, said George Chen, partner at The Asia Group, as part of Beijing's efforts to dwarf the U.S. defense capabilities.

Rare earths are critical to high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors. Tightened access to rare earths has disrupted international supply chains caught in the U.S.-China crossfire this year.

""Beijing has realized that it has leverage in this sector and is clearly not shy about using it,"" said Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and former U.S. trade negotiator. The move could pressure Washington to make further concessions in ongoing talks, such as tariff reductions or relaxed U.S. export controls.

China accounts for about 70% of the global supply and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

The latest restrictions came just weeks before a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The two leaders are expected to meet in person on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.

The new announcement can be viewed as ""a series of bargains"" that Beijing wants to place even before the next round of major trade talks, The Asia Group's Chen said.

""The Chinese side is getting more and more experienced in dealing with their counterparts and they know what their American friends want,"" Chen added.

Since late last year, China has tightened restrictions on rare earth exports, including demanding proof that they will not be used for military purposes. Beijing started issuing single-use export licenses following a trade truce with Washington in May.

While China's official data showed that exports of rare earth magnets have recovered in recent months, progress appeared uneven. The European Chamber of Commerce said in a survey released last month that Beijing's tight grip had cost at least one member ""millions of euros"" while other members cited inconsistent procedures for obtaining export approvals.

A Chinese ministry spokesperson on Thursday said that there would be certain exemptions under the new rules, including exports for emergency medical situations or disaster relief. A ""transition period"" will also allow businesses to fulfill existing contracts and meet compliance requirements.

The transition window is likely to cushion some near-term impacts for companies, Eurasia's Wang said, noting that ""similar to how the U.S. tech export ban to China left room for American tech companies to lobby and apply for approval — most of them did get approvals.""

""It will give China more power than just a blunt ban,"" Wang said.

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that the carrier's operation is running smoothly despite the federal government shutdown, but if it goes another 10 days that could change.

More than 13,000 U.S. flights were delayed this week, some of them due to shortages of air traffic controllers, raising concerns about strains on the country's aviation industry during the shutdown.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Monday that the Federal Aviation Administration is seeing a ""slight uptick"" in sick calls of air traffic controllers.

Bastian also said the shutdown is exacerbating concerns about the strain on air traffic controllers, a shortage of whom has vexed airline executives for years. Under the shutdown thousands of federal employees, including air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers at airports are working without pay.

Delta's CEO said in an interview that the airline hasn't seen ""any impacts at all"" so far from the shutdown but urged a quick resolution. A more than monthlong government shutdown from late 2018 to early 2019 ended hours after an increase in sick calls from air traffic controllers snarled travel in the New York area.

""I would say that if this doesn't get resolved, say beyond another 10 days or so, you probably will start to see some impacts,"" Bastian said in an interview Thursday with CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

A perpetual shortage of air traffic controllers has vexed U.S. airline executives for years, and the FAA has scrambled to increase hiring.

Delta on Thursday reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and forecast a more profitable end of the year than analysts expected.

In this article

Delta Air Lines forecast a better-than-expected end to 2025 and a strong start to next year thanks to rising airfares and resilient luxury travel demand.

The airline on Thursday projected adjusted earnings of between $1.60 and $1.90 a share for the fourth quarter, compared with the $1.65 per share analysts polled by LSEG were expecting. Revenue in the last three months of the year will grow as much as 4%, Delta said, above the 1.7% Wall Street expects.

""Looking to 2026, Delta is well positioned to deliver top-line growth, margin expansion and earnings improvement consistent with our long-term financial framework,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in an earnings release.

Delta's outlook points to improved demand and less of a surplus of flights that pushed domestic fares and revenue down at airlines this year, particularly early in 2025 when consumer confidence was rattled in the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

""Starting in July, cash sales picked up,"" Bastian said in an interview.

The Atlanta-based carrier is the first of the major airlines to report results this quarter. Its shares were up about 4% in afternoon trading.

Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:

Delta's third-quarter profit rose 11% to $1.42 billion, or $2.17 a share, up from $1.27 billion, or $1.97 a share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including investment-related adjustments, its profit climbed 15% to $1.12 billion, or $1.71 a share, ahead of analyst estimates.

Adjusted revenue rose 4% year over year.

Premium travel demand continued to outshine the coach cabin. Revenue from the high-end segment, which includes first class and roomier economy seats, increased 9% in the third quarter to nearly $5.8 billion, while main cabin revenue fell 4% to about $6 billion.

Bastian said there were no signs of a consumer pullback for premium products. Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, reiterated that revenue from the airline's upmarket options like first class is on track to eclipse main cabin sales next year.

Delta and other carriers have culled unprofitable or less profitable flights such as those during unpopular midweek travel days to help stem an oversupply of seats in the market. That surplus of capacity along with shifting consumer habits and higher costs has made previously slam dunk summer profits more elusive for some U.S. carriers.

Domestic unit revenue rose 2% in the third quarter at the carrier on a 4% increase in capacity, and Delta forecast it would remain positive year over year in the current quarter. Stronger corporate travel demand helped to drive a 5% increase in overall domestic passenger revenue in the third quarter.

Delta said it expects adjusted, full-year earnings per share of $6, at the upper end of the $5.25 to $6.25 it forecast for 2025 in July.

When asked about the federal government shutdown, Bastian told CNBC that the airline hasn't seen ""any impacts at all"" to its operation in recent days, but that if it continues for 10 more days or so, that could change.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Citi has invested in stablecoin infrastructure company BVNK, the startup told CNBC on Thursday, as big U.S. banks ramp up their presence in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space.

Stablecoins are a type of digital asset pegged to a fiat currency and backed by real-world assets like bonds. The two biggest are USDC and Tether, which issues USDT.

BVNK's core technology is effectively a payments rail to facilitate transactions in stablecoins globally, allowing customers to move money from fiat into the cryptocurrency and back.

The company declined to disclose the sum that Citi invested or its current valuation. But Chris Harmse, co-founder of BVNK, told CNBC in an interview that its valuation is higher than the $750 million that was publicly disclosed at its last funding round.

The investment was made by Citi Ventures, the venture capital arm of Citigroup.

Stablecoins, once just a tool for people to trade quickly in and out of other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, are now being seen as a potential key tool for cross-border transactions due to the speed to send and receive them, the low cost and 24/7 settlement.

There were nearly $9 trillion worth of stablecoin transactions over the last 12 months, according to Visa, while the current valuation of all stablecoins in existence stands at over $300 billion, Coinmarketcap data shows.

BVNK's Harmse said the company is seeing momentum, especially in the U.S., which has been its fastest-growing market over the last 12-18 months thanks to what is seen by the crypto industry as a more favorable regulatory environment.

Earlier this year, the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate and bring more clarity to the stablecoin market.

""You are seeing with the GENIUS Act coming through, and regulatory clarity, an explosion of demand for building on top of stablecoin infrastructure,"" Harmse told CNBC.

BVNK's technology can be used by customers to pay suppliers, contractors or merchants in other countries. The company is looking to expand its customer base, including to digital-only banks or neobanks that may use stabelcoins for their core checking account, Harmse said.

The co-founder declined to get into the specifics of the company's work with Citi as it's ""too early to announce"" but noted the Wall Street bank has been bolstering its cross-border payment services.

""U.S. banks at the scale of Citi, because of the GENIUS Act, are putting their weight behind ... investing in leading businesses in the space to make sure they are at forefront of this technological shift in payments,"" Harmse said. 

Citi signaled its step up into crypto this year. CEO Jane Fraser said in June that the company is considering issuing its own stablecoin and is interested in offering custodian services for crypto assets.

BVNK has ""dipped in and out of profitability"" as the company has invested in growth, Harmse said, adding that the company is on track to be profitable next year. BVNK is also backed by Coinbase and Tiger Global.

The startup is playing in a highly-competitive space with other newcomers like Alchemy Pay and TripleA and established players like Ripple trying to get a slice of the cross-border digital money pie.

Citi isn't alone in embracing digital assets when it comes to major U.S. banks and financial institutions.

JPMorgan Chase launched its own stablecoin-like token called JPMD this year. The bank also made the decision this year to allow clients to buy bitcoin.

Banks have been looking at how to use blockchain, a technology originally developed to underpin bitcoin, to lower the cost and speed up transactions of many kinds. Part of this involves ""tokenization"" which broadly means the idea of issuing a digital token that represents something such as a deposit.

Bank of New York Mellon, for example, is exploring tokenized deposits. HSBC has already launched a tokenized deposit service.

OpenAI has expanded its lower-cost subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, to 16 more countries across Asia, company head Nick Turley announced Thursday.

""Making ChatGPT more affordable has been a key ask from users,"" said Turley in a post on social media platform X in August.

The artificial intelligence company launched ChatGPT Go in India and Indonesia earlier this year.

The rollout brings OpenAI's cheapest plan to users across a total of 18 Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste (East Timor) and Vietnam.

The expansion aims to increase the accessibility of the company's latest model GPT-5, OpenAI said on its website.

ChatGPT Go includes all features in the free version, as well as extended access to image generation, file uploads, advanced data analysis and other functions. It also includes higher usage limits than the free plan for core chat and tools, according to OpenAI.

ChatGPT Go launched in India and Indonesia at a monthly fee of 399 rupees (about $4.50) and 75,000 rupiah (about $4.53), respectively — which are a fraction of the price of the company's other subscription plans. The cost of the plan in other Asian markets may differ.

OpenAI currently has two other paid personal plans: ChatGPT Plus, which is offered at $20 a month and ChatGPT Pro, which is offered at $200 a month. The company also offers a business plan for $25 a month.

The use of ChatGPT has grown rapidly across the globe since its launch in late 2022. According to data from OpenAI, adoption growth rates of the AI chatbot in the lowest income countries were over four times those in the highest income countries by May 2025.

OpenAI noted that the budget-friendly plan is gradually being made available to all users. For those in Cambodia, Laos and Nepal, ChatGPT Go is already available on web and Android subscriptions, but not yet in the iOS app.

BEIJING — The latest sign of hyper-competition, or ""involution,"" has emerged in China's tourism industry, adding to concerns about growing deflationary pressure in the broader economy.

Over the Oct. 1 to 8 public holiday — dubbed ""Golden Week"" — total domestic tourism trips reached 888 million and generated 809.01 billion yuan ($113.63 billion) in revenue, according to official data released Thursday. That's up by 1.8% and 7.6% from last year, respectively, according to CNBC's calculations of the figures.

The gains, however, slowed from the May 1–5 holiday earlier this year, when domestic trips and tourism revenue grew 6.4% and 8% respectively. In fact, average spending per domestic tourist trip during the Golden Week was also around 3% lower than in 2019 before the pandemic, Goldman Sachs pointed out Thursday.

""The Golden Week was 'Golden Weak,'"" said Mix Shi, founder of PoshPacker Hostels Chengdu Group.

Although his three hostels in the city ended up being fully booked, Shi said he had to cut nightly rates by about 60% — because nearby hotels dropped prices even more.

""Way too much money has been pouring into the hotel industry lately,"" Shi said, noting, ""the competition is insane, and some really nice places are going for dirt cheap. It's great for travelers because they have more choices, but it's a real blow to hostels.""

Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in southwestern China, ranked second to Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province in the east, in tourism spending for the holiday on the Meituan online booking platform.

Among local and international visitors to hostels in mainland China, Chengdu's popularity more than doubled from last year's Golden Week, second only to Shanghai, according to HostelWorld. Still, average bed prices fell more than 20% in both cities — to 165.70 yuan ($23.27) in Shanghai and 80.99 yuan in Chengdu.

While most locals have only a handful of paid days off each year, China has sought to encourage businesses to give workers more vacation days and extended official public holidays to boost consumption.

This year's Golden Week was one day longer than usual because it coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, which follows the agrarian calendar. The festival fell on Oct. 6 this year, versus Sept. 17 last year.

""The Mid-Autumn Festival is considered to be a family reunion festival,"" said AJ Wang, owner of the X Hotel and Observatory Hill House venues in the northeastern coastal city of Qingdao.

""The real Golden Week, in terms of revenue generation, actually ends on the 6th,"" he said, noting he had to cut prices after that date by 60% due to falling demand.

Official domestic tourism revenue for the Golden Week alone rose by 15.4% from 2024, but when including last year's Mid-Autumn Festival revenue figures, the comparable revenue growth slowed to 7.6%, CNBC calculations showed.

""Everyone's working harder, spending more, but the profit gap stays small,"" said Sasa Yau, who runs a hostel and restaurant in the southern city of Guangzhou.

Yau said his daily restaurant sales surged from the typical 3,000 yuan to as much as 10,000 yuan during the Golden Week, with the average customer spending just 30 yuan.

""We were busier than ever and broke our revenue record,"" Yau said. ""There are only four of us running the show, so by the end of the week we were so tired that when I said, 'Let's celebrate with a late-night meal!' everyone just said, 'Can we celebrate by sleeping instead?'""

In Chengdu, famous for its Giant pandas and spicy food, Shi said travelers tend to book rooms only a day or two in advance instead of a week or two ahead, making accommodation rates unpredictable

China's vast network of high-speed trains and airports — with flights sometimes cheaper than train tickets — has made travelling on a whim fairly easy. Large price swings and challenges in booking tickets for the first or last day of a public holiday are pushing travelers to stagger their trips when possible — and save money.

Many tourists chose to travel slightly before or after the Golden Week period this year, according to Chinese travel booking site Trip.com. It noted that hotel prices in late September were about 20% cheaper than during the Golden Week, while mid-holiday airfares were more than 30% cheaper than at the start of the break.

Alibaba-owned travel booking site Fliggy said average spending per travel booking rose 14.6% from a year earlier, and noted that far cheaper flights started the weekend after the holiday, such as a flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong for less than 400 yuan ($56).

Official figures also pointed to a rise in road trips, with the holiday seeing an average of 304 million trips per day, mostly by car.

""The Golden Week unleashed a wave of energy across China: record-breaking travel, booming business activity, and fresh spending trends all gave domestic demand a solid boost,"" said Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School.

""Still, it might take a while before the [consumer price index] returns to positive [year-on-year] growth, as food prices and oil prices remain soft compared to their peak,"" he said.

China's official consumer prices fell by 0.4% in August from a year earlier but rose 0.9% when stripping out food and energy prices. The tourism sub-segment saw prices rise 0.7% year over year in August, but they were 0.3% lower for the January to August period compared with the same period in 2024.

Travel platforms also reported increased demand in smaller cities, where prices can be far lower. Chinese booking site Tongcheng said hotel bookings in at least 30 such cities and less developed areas more than doubled from a year ago.

China's inflation data for September is due Oct. 15, and retail sales on Oct. 20. Retail sales rose just 3.4% in August from a year ago, missing analysts' expectations.

Oops, something went wrong

The U.S. government holds approximately $17 billion in Bitcoin, which it won't sell, and also plans to continue to accumulate additional Bitcoin, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Senate Committee on Banking Chairman Tim Scott reportedly revealed at a private dinner in Washington, D.C.

The two senior officials of the Donald Trump administration recently attended a private dinner with S. Matthew Schultz, chairman and CEO of the Bitcoin mining company Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) when the plan was discussed, Schultz shared on X.

Schultz revealed that they discussed several issues at the dinner:

Market structure bill

Economy

Next Federal Reserve Chairman

Sovereign AI

Land and power

Strategic Bitcoin reserve

He also shared that Bessent and Scott care enough about what the industry does to talk about how they can help.

""No other ‘crypto' or AI folks were here."" 

Notably, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The order mandated that the reserve consist of forfeited coins and asked to explore budget-neutral ways to accumulate more coins at no additional cost to American taxpayers.

Trump has proclaimed that the goal of his administration is to turn the U.S. into the Bitcoin superpower and the ""crypto capital of the world.""

As of Jan. 6, the U.S. led the world in Bitcoin mining, followed by Russia and China, as per Hashrate Index. States like Texas and Wyoming have emerged as industry hubs due to their business-friendly policies and cheap power.

Bitcoin only recently surpassed the $126,000 price mark amid the government shutdown to hit a new record high. As per Kraken's price feed, BTC was trading at $123,264.92 at the time of writing.

Oops, something went wrong

A new Chainalysis study estimates that more than $75 billion in cryptocurrency linked to criminal activity is currently identifiable on public blockchains, presenting what the firm calls an unprecedented opportunity for coordinated asset seizures.

The analysis focuses on static balances rather than transaction flows, arguing that the stock of assets sitting in wallets tied to illicit activity is the clearest indicator of what can be recovered today.

As of July 2025, wallets directly attributed to illicit entities hold nearly $15 billion across Bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins—up roughly 359% since 2020. Stolen funds are the single largest category by balance, reflecting the tendency of hackers to park assets while testing laundering routes or awaiting cash-out opportunities.

While the share of Bitcoin held by illegal actors has fallen in coin terms since 2020, BTC still represents about 75% of illicit entity balances by value, thanks to long-run price appreciation.

Ether and stablecoins have grown as a share of holdings, with stablecoins often used tactically as short-term liquidity during laundering.

Beyond the first hop, Chainalysis identifies over $60 billion sitting in “downstream” wallets—addresses that received more than 10% of their inflows from illicit sources—roughly four times the balances held by the illicit entities themselves.

Darknet market administrators and vendors account for over $40 billion of this total, showing how marketplace structures distribute wealth across operators and sellers and have benefited from a decade of crypto price gains.

Chainalysis cautions that some laundering hubs and cross-chain bridges act primarily as transit points, so their standing balances may understate their centrality to criminal value chains.

Centralized exchanges remain the preferred off-ramp, with illicit inflows averaging more than $14 billion per year since 2020 and nearing $7 billion in the first half of 2025.

But criminals are adding layers to evade compliance: direct transfers from illicit wallets to exchanges have plunged from roughly 40% of quarterly flows in 2021–2022 to around 15% in Q2 2025.

Deposit address reuse is also collapsing, indicating faster turnover of exchange accounts. After operations cease, liquidation speeds diverge by asset: nearly 95% of stablecoin balances drain within 90 days, about 87% for ether, and only ~52% for Bitcoin—leaving a longer runway to interdict BTC holdings.

With Washington's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Assets Stockpile indicating a more aggressive seizure policy, Chainalysis argues that speed and coordination are now decisive.

Effective recovery requires expedited seizure powers, cross-border information sharing, and technical capacity to trace funds across chains. The company says its KYT and Reactor tools, along with its services arm, have already helped authorities seize more than $12.6 billion.

The headline figure—$15 billion in illicit-entity balances and over $60 billion downstream—suggests that with modernized workflows and clearer legal pathways, law enforcement can translate blockchain transparency into record-level recoveries.

Two major crypto ETF issuers are joining the rush to bring crypto asset staking to the U.S.

Bitwise and 21Shares each unveiled updates to their crypto funds on Tuesday, cutting fees and adding staking features for investors, just days after Grayscale became the first to introduce staking in its U.S. Ethereum ETFs.

Bitwise's latest filing formally renames its product to the aptly titled “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while adding language that allows it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.”

It also introduces a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets.

At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETF filings, which typically range between 0.21% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among approved crypto products.

21Shares, meanwhile, announced enhancements to its 21Shares Ethereum ETF (TETH), adding staking and waiving its 0.21% sponsor fee for 12 months starting October 9.

The move is being touted as a “natural evolution of Ethereum investment products in the U.S. market,” Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, said in a statement.

By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains.

Institutional investors “will likely be more interested in how much of the staking yield will be passed to them,” Maksim Balashevich, founder and CEO of crypto analytics firm Santiment, told Decrypt.

In conversation, when it was noted that some investors hold overlapping positions in digital asset treasuries tied to Solana and Ethereum, Balashevich suggested those holders may view staking ETFs as a simpler way to consolidate yield and manage exposure.“

""Yield is what is different,” in this case, he said. “The battle will likely be on this field.”

Commenting on Bitwise, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X that the firm is “not playing around,” adding that low fees have a “near perfect record of attracting investors,” and is a “good sign for inflow potential.”

Balchunas did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions on whether this could ostensibly mark a race to the bottom similar to the so-called “fee war” that broke out ahead of the SEC's approval of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in January last year.

Bitwise declined Decrypt's request for comment. Decrypt has reached out to 21Shares.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Foundation Expands Privacy Push With Dedicated Research Cluster","https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/10/09/ethereum-foundation-expands-privacy-push-with-dedicated-research-cluster","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 06:53:53 GMT","

The Ethereum Foundation is making privacy a formal pillar of its roadmap, expanding research efforts into a dedicated cluster that now covers private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases.

Ethereum has supported privacy research through its Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team since 2018, with experiments like Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail and zkTLS, and the Anon Aadhaar project.

These have become reference points for developers across the ecosystem, spawning hundreds of forks and integrations.

The new “privacy cluster,” coordinated by Igor Barinov, brings these experiments under a single umbrella alongside new initiatives, per a Wednesday blog post.

Those include private reads and writes for payments and interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID systems for selective disclosure, UX work to normalize privacy tools, and Kohaku, an SDK and wallet designed to make strong cryptography usable by default.

An Institutional Privacy Task Force is also part of the cluster, translating compliance and operational requirements into specifications that larger enterprises can test.

The Foundation framed privacy as essential to Ethereum's credibility. Blockchains are transparent by design, but widespread adoption requires that users and institutions have the option to transact, govern, and build without exposing sensitive data.

More than 700 privacy-focused projects exist across the broader crypto ecosystem, but Ethereum's size means its primitives often set standards that others adopt. If the Foundation can deliver credible tools that balance privacy with neutrality and compliance, it could define how the next cycle of applications is built.

Meanwhile, privacy remains politically charged. Regulators have targeted mixers and shielded transactions, and developers are aware that features enabling confidential use can just as easily enable illicit finance.

That's why the Foundation's approach of open-source research, institution-facing task forces, and tools aimed at everyday users can be considered cautious but deliberate.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation announced the formation of the Privacy Cluster, a team of 47 researchers, engineers, and cryptographers coordinated by Blockscout and xDai founder Igor Barinov.

In a Wednesday blog post, the foundation said that it is collaborating with the broader community — complementing existing privacy projects — to establish privacy as a “first-class property” of Ethereum.

As such, the foundation has released a roadmap outlining current progress towards building comprehensive end-to-end privacy into the world's second-largest blockchain. 

“Ethereum was created to be the foundation of digital trust, one that is worthy of civilizational scale. For that trust to remain credible, privacy must be part of its core,” the foundation said in the blog post.

The development also marks an escalation of the foundation's ongoing efforts to protect users from surveillance, data leaks, and metadata exposure in an era when blockchain transactions are increasingly under scrutiny. The Privacy Cluster is expected to address such leaks, targeting Layer 1 improvements like confidential transfers and protections against RPC node metadata leaks.

The Cluster will expand on the Foundation's Privacy & Scaling Explorations team, which has been working on privacy research and development since 2018.

It will allocate resources toward privacy-preserving research and tooling, spanning cryptography (including zero-knowledge proofs), protocol improvements for transaction confidentiality, and applications such as private payments, identities and wallets.

The crypto market has already surged to new highs, while Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has broken the previous ATH after hitting $125,559 this bullish October. Now, all eyes are turning to altcoins.

Prominent trader Bull Theory hints that the market may be mirroring patterns from the explosive 2020–2021 altcoin boom.

The 2020 Altcoin season saw a 1000% Rally

According to Bull Theory, altcoins are entering their most explosive phase yet, similar to the one that launched the legendary 2020 altcoin season.

Back in 2020, the TOTAL3 market cap, which tracks the value of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Ethereum, spent almost two years building a strong base. 

When it finally broke out, the market went vertical, delivering a jaw-dropping 1,000% surge in less than a year. That move is what many still refer to as the real start of “Altseason.”

2025 Setup: Same Structure, Bigger Market

Fast forward to today, in 2025, Bull Theory points out that the chart is showing the same structure again.

The TOTAL3 chart has been forming a multi-year base with higher lows, signaling that buyers are quietly soaking up supply. The key resistance level now sits around $1.2 trillion in TOTAL3, and the market is currently testing just below it at $1.14 trillion.

According to the trader, a breakout above this level could ignite another massive uptrend, with projections pointing toward a $5 trillion to $7 trillion altcoin market cap if history repeats.

Market Conditions Favor a Capital Shift Toward Altcoins

This potential move comes as several macro and market factors align in favor of altcoins. Right now, Bitcoin is holding most of the liquidity as it trades near record highs, which has slowed altcoins. 

But history shows that once BTC dominance rolls over, capital floods into altcoins. 

Supporting factors include the rise of ETH ETFs as investors are pouring billions, while regulatory clarity is improving, and global liquidity is expanding through policy shifts in the U.S., Japan, and China.

Ethereum Above $5,000

For now, the market remains in consolidation, not decline. Well-known crypto analyst Moustache believes that once Ethereum breaks above $5,000, momentum could shift rapidly, marking the beginning of the long-awaited altcoin supercycle.

If 2020 was the spark, 2025 might be the explosion.

Altseason doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It usually begins with a breakout in TOTAL3, and charts suggest that moment is getting closer. 

FAQs

Altseason is a period in the crypto market where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin, often leading to rapid, massive price surges across the board.

Some projections, based on historical patterns, indicate the total altcoin market cap could surge from ~$1.14 trillion to between $5 and $7 trillion.

The TOTAL3 chart tracks the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Ethereum, helping traders gauge altcoin market strength.

The Federal Reserve Chairman speaks today amidst economic slowdown and persistent inflation. Crypto traders are closely monitoring every monetary signal to predict future price movements. Bitcoin is consolidating above $122,000, with the total market capitalization hovering around $2.44 trillion.

Written by Charles Ledoux

Translated on October 9, 2025 at 12:53 by                                        Simon Dumoulin


Jerome Powell's speech scheduled for 2:30 PM today will be the true catalyst for crypto markets. Traders are already positioning themselves in anticipation of accommodative rhetoric that could inject more liquidity into risk assets. Historically, interest rate cuts favor cryptocurrency performance by reducing the opportunity cost compared to traditional investments.

Bitcoin is currently trading in a consolidation zone near its all-time highs. Major altcoins are following this momentum with notable gains on certain tokens, although volatility remains high. The psychological support levels at $120,000 for BTC will be crucial in the coming hours.

If Powell confirms gradual monetary easing for the remainder of the year, market sentiment could improve significantly. Capital flows into Bitcoin ETFs and declining bond yields would make cryptocurrencies more attractive. Conversely, a more hawkish tone than expected would likely trigger profit-taking and a short-term technical correction.

Traders should monitor three key elements following this Fed intervention. First, the interest rate trajectory for the second half of 2025: one or more additional cuts are expected, but their magnitude remains uncertain. Second, Powell's stance on imported inflation related to tariffs could influence the pace of monetary easing.

Third, the evolution of the US dollar against other major currencies will provide valuable insights. A weakening greenback generally favors Bitcoin, considered by many as an alternative store of value. Trading volumes on major platforms already show gradual accumulation ahead of the event.

XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) are sitting on their final technical supports, with traders warning that one decisive move lower could trigger a cascade of liquidations across the altcoin market.

SOL Technical Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Solana trades around $222, struggling to hold its rising trendline support near $219 after a sharp rejection from $225. 

The level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $222 and short-term EMAs, forming a key support zone.

Broader structure on the 4-hour chart forms a large symmetrical triangle. 

A breakdown below $219 could open a move toward $214 (0.382 retracement) and $205, with further downside risk to $190.

On the upside, bulls need a close above $229 to retest $240, where the 0.786 Fibonacci level meets the triangle's upper boundary. 

A breakout above $240 would shift the technical narrative toward $253 and signal renewed strength.

Marcantonio of GalaxyHQ compared Solana to a ""digital Panama Canal,"" predicting it could dominate tokenized securities trading by 2030.

While the broader outlook remains positive, the near-term setup leaves no room for error.

XRP Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

XRP trades near $2.81, testing its ascending trendline support that has held since mid-July. 

The level aligns with the 50-day EMA at $2.85, creating the final technical layer before a potential breakdown.

A move below $2.80 would invalidate the higher-low structure and expose $2.70 and $2.64 (200-day EMA) as next support zones. 

Deeper loss of momentum could send XRP toward $1.89, which served as the base for its summer rally.

For bulls, recovery depends on reclaiming $2.92 and then $3.10, where descending trendline resistance caps upside attempts. 

Only a daily close above that level would restore short-term bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward $3.50.

Supports like $219 on Solana and $2.80 on XRP are not just chart levels — they are the fault lines of altcoin leverage.

Billions in open interest sit tethered to these ranges, meaning a single breach could unleash cascading liquidations across exchanges.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)  is battling resistance near $4,500 and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is trying to regain $122,000, creating a backdrop where majors may dictate whether altcoin floors survive.

The convergence of major-cap stability and fragile altcoin supports makes this inflection point unusually decisive for market structure.

QumulusAI, a company building GPU-powered cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence, has locked in a $500 million credit facility to fund its growing fleet of graphics processing units (GPUs).

The financing was arranged by Permian Labs and will be distributed via USD.AI, a blockchain-based credit protocol that connects crypto liquidity to real-world infrastructure, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk.

The non-recourse facility will allow QumulusAI to borrow stablecoins against up to 70% of its approved GPU deployments, giving the company faster access to capital than traditional credit routes like bank loans or venture debt, the company said.

GPUs are the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, as they can handle thousands of tasks at once and are critical for training and running large AI models. As demand for AI systems grows, so does the race to secure access to the chips that power them.

QumulusAI's funding comes as demand for computing power soars, but capital for smaller operators remains tight. Much of the industry's GPU supply is still cornered by tech giants such as Google, Meta and OpenAI in the race for the most advanced AI model.

Permian Labs, which developed the USD.AI framework, tokenizes GPUs into warehouse receipt tokens, GWRTs, which can be used as collateral on-chain.

""By leveraging Permian Labs' tokenization framework, we can scale faster and more flexibly – meeting the surge in AI compute demand without the constraints of legacy financing,” said QumulusAI CEO Mike Maniscalco.

Bullish, whose parent company Bullish Global is also the owner of CoinDesk, last month invested $4 million into USD.AI.

This story was originally published by the Daily Montanan.

The Montana Legislature grappled with a lot of technological innovation during the 2025 session including determining how to regulate the growing digital economy and this month has seen the launch of new laws and committees focused on the digital space. 

One new law, the Financial Freedom and Innovation Act, took effect in October, paving the way for companies that issue network tokens to do business in Montana, and ensuring the State Auditor's office has authority to regulate the burgeoning industry and prosecute bad actors. 

The bill, Senate Bill 265, carried by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, defines a number of buzzwords in the digital asset space — such as network token, blockchain, and decentralized network — in state law. It also provides the framework for uses of network tokens and what boxes businesses must check off to do business in Montana. 

Under the new Innovation Act in Montana, companies that issue digital tokens — used to power decentralized services like computing, data storage and media streaming, among other things — can register with the Commissioner's office as non-securities assets, making Montana among the first states to do so.

Zolnikov said network tokens have the ability to decentralize so many parts of industry, essentially cutting out middle man companies, which he said fits a Montanan ethos. 

“If you have a new technology that's an exception to the rule, but you want to play by the rules, what do you do?” he said. “We finally gave them a regulatory path forward.”

In a press release, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Jim Brown said the new law charts the course for “responsible innovation.”

“This law gives entrepreneurs the certainty they need while ensuring Montanans are protected. SB 265 strengthens both our business climate and our national reputation as a state that embraces innovation while striking the right balance,” Brown said. 

Speaking to the Daily Montanan this week, Brown said that one of his office's main roles is to protect Montana consumers from “fraudsters and bad actors.”

“Not only in the insurance area, but in financial institutions, which includes digital currencies and anything related to the blockchain,” Brown said. “…At this point in the world of digital currency, there isn't a whole lot on the books in Montana about giving either my office or the attorney general's office the authority to either regulate companies or persons who engage in this.”

On the consumer protection front, Brown has been advocating on a national level to strengthen laws in the digital space. He recently joined with securities regulators from across the nation in urging the federal government to move forward with regulating aspects of the digital economy, including giving states prosecutorial authority in the digital space. 

In a letter sent last month, Brown and his counterparts with the North American Securities Administrators Association asked for changes to a proposed federal market structure legislation that he said “is a gift to fraudsters,” by limited actions states can take to investigate and charge crypto scammers. 

The Association is also behind legislation called the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act which would cement state authority to prosecute fraud involving digital assets. 

“We believe we have the authority to go after these bad actors,” Brown said. “I take the authority of this office to prosecute bad actors very seriously to protect consumers. … and we don't want to create a system where smaller bad actors fall through the cracks.”

Brown said with the explosion of digital assets in recent years, his office has seen a parallel increase in fraudulent claims within the digital space. 

Last year, his office received nine complaints of digital asset fraud, totaling more than a million dollars. Through September of this year, his office has already received 20 complaints — to the tune of $3.1 million. 

On Tuesday, Brown's office issued a press release about an individual charged in Missoula County for defrauding investors, including several elderly Montanans, through a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. 

According to the release, an Idaho resident and two uncharged co-conspirators set up a “fund” of more than one million dollars from investors purportedly invested in cryptocurrency. 

The defendant is charged with six felony counts of elder exploitation, securities fraud, operating a pyramid promotional scheme and operating as a securities dealer without a license. 

“By the end of the century, (blockchain technology and digital assets) are going to be so integrated in our economy and our way of life that people won't even recognize how we operated financially in 2025,” Brown told the Daily Montanan. “While that's exciting and I want to be on the forefront as a regulator and help support that, we have to keep our ability to prosecute bad actors. We can't have it be the wild west out here.”

Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force holds first meeting 

On Monday, members of the newly formed Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force met for the first time to discuss the state of cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation in Montana and how to remain competitive in the digital economy. 

The task force, created during the 2025 Legislature, is comprised of legislators, representatives from the State Auditor and Attorney General's offices, and public members with experience in the financial or digital technology sectors. 

Co-chair Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, said he envisions the task force as “a big brainstorming operation.”

“So many people think about crypto when they think about blockchain, but it's so much more than that, so much more than the financial end of it,” Lammers told the task force. “But, it has implications in agriculture, fraud, chain of custody, record keeping — all kinds of things we could apply this baby to.”

One area of discussion on Monday revolved around Wyoming's approach to digital assets, which has included launching their own state-backed cryptocurrency. 

“They've certainly laid the baseline for this,” Brown, a member of the task force, told the Daily Montanan. “We might not be looking at having Montana be the issuer of a stablecoin, but we will look at a model of what's made Wyoming a leader in blockchain technology … we'll look at how Montana can be an innovator like Wyoming is, maybe even going beyond what they've done.”

In upcoming meetings, the task force will focus on educational sessions to understand the scope of the digital economy and identify specific topics to tackle, as well as examine how the other states are currently regulating blockchain and other digital technologies. 

“I think we're going to be able to come up with some real great stuff here to make our lives easier, and to protect the people in Montana,” Lammers said.

Episode 3 of Killer Whales TV Show throws entrepreneurs into the deep end of innovation, challenging them to redefine luxury goods, NFTs ,and AI. 

With 1,500,000 in prizes at stake, founders face off against the show's formidable investor panel, the “Killer Whales,” to prove their ventures are poised to disrupt industries. From tokenizing high-end assets to pioneering next-gen data ecosystems, the pressure is palpable as each pitch could secure a game-changing ‘Swim' vote or sink their shot at crypto glory.

Reflecting on the episode's focus, Sander Görtjes, CEO of HELLO Labs, shared: 

“Tonight's episode delivers on Web3's promise on building tangible utility for major industries. We're moving into practical use cases like NFTs authenticating a luxury watch, utilizing AI models trained on user-owned data, and taking advantage of advanced NFT finance. This episode shows how blockchain is quietly rebuilding the infrastructure of luxury, gaming, and artificial intelligence from the ground up.”

Episode 3 spotlights three visionary projects vying for dominance. Galileo Protocol, led by CEO Pierre Beunardeau, transforms luxury asset ownership with its B2B tokenization platform and authenticity verification tools. 

CARV, represented by Chief Business Officer Paul Delio, empowers gamers and AI developers through its modular data layer, backed by $20 million from heavyweights like Temasek's Vertex and ConsenSys. Meanwhile, Sniper.xyz, helmed by founder Max Zhuang, reimagines Solana's NFT landscape with staking, auctions, and cutting-edge trading tools. 

Judging the fray are titans like Anthony Scaramucci and Ran Neuner, alongside Hacken's Yevheniia Broshevan and media entrepreneur Aaron Arnold. Tune in for a clash of ideas, razor-sharp critiques, and the quest to claim crypto's ultimate prize.

UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine

The UK's data protection watchdog has won its appeal against a controversial facial recognition technology firm, making a £7.5m fine more likely.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued the penalty in May 2022, after it found Manhattan-headquartered Clearview AI guilty of breaching the UK GDPR.

It said the firm had illegally scraped the images of UK residents from websites and social media pages and uploaded them to a global database that could be used by Clearview customers for facial recognition. None of the data subjects had given their consent for their images to be used in this way.

Clearview AI had successfully appealed the fine and enforcement notice with the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT). However, the ICO was recently successful in counter-appealing at the Upper Tribunal (UT).

The UT upheld three of the regulator's four grounds of appeal. It found that:

Information commissioner, John Edwards, welcomed the decision as providing much needed clarity on the scope of the UK GDPR. No matter where companies are based in the world, if they want to monitor the behavior of UK residents, they will be in scope of UK data protection law, he confirmed.

“The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge,” Edwards added.

“The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organizations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK.”

The decision is legally binding, although Clearview AI can appeal. The UT has now directed the FTT to consider the appeal again now that it is confirmed the ICO did have jurisdiction to issue the fine.

The case highlights the difficulty data protection regulators have in collecting fines from deep-pocketed technology firms which they believe have broken the law.

The ICO initially issued a £17m fine but more than halved it after representations from the company.

Australia's privacy watchdog last year called off its investigation into Clearview AI, despite no evidence that the company had complied with an order compelling it to delete the images of Australians in its database.

In the UK, an appeal by the Information Commissioner has succeeded in substantially overturning a 2023 ruling, which declared that facial recognition specialist Clearview AI could not be fined under GDPR.In 2021 the ICO said it planned to impose a fine of just over £17m on Clearview for using images of people in the UK, and elsewhere, collected from the web and social media to create an online database - the amount was subsequently reduced to £7.5m. At the time Information Commissioner John Edwards (pictured) said: 'Clearview AI not only enables identification of people, but effectively monitors their behaviour and offers it as a commercial service. That is unacceptable. That is why we have acted to protect people in the UK by both fining the company and issuing an enforcement notice'. Two years ago, a judge in the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT) of the UK General Regulatory Chamber disagreed, and said Clearview had successfully argued that - as a company based outside the EU and UK, and acting on behalf of foreign law enforcement authorities - it was not subject to GDPR. The judge said one government is not able to bind or control the activities of another sovereign state. The ICO in turn appealed this decision to the Chamber's Upper Tribunal (UT), and this week the UT handed down a reversal of the FTT's judgement, upholding  three of the Commissioner's four grounds of appeal. It concluded that Clearview's processing of personal information does relate to the monitoring of behaviour of UK residents; that its processing does not fall outside the reach of UK data protection law; and that the FTT applied the law incorrectly in finding the processing to be outside the material scope of the UK GDPR under Article 2(2)a. 'The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge,' Edwards said in a statement. 'The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK.' The UT's decision is legally binding and should guide similar cases in future - however Clearview can still seek permission to appeal the decision. Clearview's CEO resigned the position in February this year. The company has also faced lawsuits and fines in Europe, Australia and the US, and (as of February) remained unprofitable. Web sites: www.ico.org.uk and www.clearview.ai .

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Clearview sees red as UK tribunal sides with data regulator","https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/ico_clearview_ai_tribunal/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:42:00 GMT","

The UK General Regulatory Chamber's Upper Tribunal (UT) has ruled in favor of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which appealed against a 2023 decision that it could not fine Clearview AI over GDPR violations.

In what some Reg commenters called a ""knee-capping of the UK GDPR"" at the time, the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decided in October 2023 that the ICO did not have the territorial scope to issue the £7.5 million fine (c $10 million) it planned for the US-based AI company.

The case relates to an ICO fine issued in May 2022 after the regulator accused Clearview of scraping Brits' images uploaded to social media before adding them to a database used to train its AI algorithms.

As we reported at the time, the FTT accepted that it was reasonable to expect UK residents' faces to appear in Clearview's database, given the size of the country and the ample access to the internet most people enjoy.

However, on Tuesday, the UT upheld most of the grounds on which the ICO based its appeal, crucially ruling [PDF] that Clearview's data processing fell within the territorial scope of the UK GDPR.

It also ruled that the FTT incorrectly applied the law when deciding that Clearview's data processing fell out of scope based on the fact that it was doing so as a competent authority for the purposes of assisting law enforcement clients.

In its appeal of the ICO's decision to fine it £7.5 million ($10 million, or $9.43 million at the time) in 2022, Clearview heavily leaned on Article 2(2)(a) of the UK GDPR to clear its data processing activities.

This is the provision that precludes foreign data processing for law enforcement purposes from regulatory penalties.

Clearview said when appealing against the fine that its service is an internet search engine offered only to non-UK/EU law enforcement and national security agencies, whose uses are out of scope of the regulations per Article 2(2)(a).

The Information Commissioner accepted this was valid. Under the principles of international law, one state cannot seek to compel another to meet a legal demand, i.e. a foreign power investigating a Brit for a crime committed on its own soil should not attract interference from the UK, or penalties under the UK GDPR.

The UT's decision this week, however, overturned the FTT's previous decision and this crucial aspect of Clearview's appeal against the ICO's fine.

It ruled that Clearview's processing was related to behavior monitoring of UK residents, per Article 3(2)(b), and was still bound by UK GDPR regulation despite being carried out on behalf of its foreign law enforcement clients.

The UT, citing case law and previous statements from the EU's Advocate General, said that this exclusion only applies to the UK state itself, and not a commercial entity such as Clearview selling services to foreign governments.

Even if the data is, or can be used by a government in the interests of its national security, the data processing still falls within the scope of the GDPR.

The latest ruling, which New York-based Clearview can also appeal against, means that the case will be sent back to the FTT to decide whether the ICO can, in fact, impose the fine.

This case was solely focused on determining the UK GDPR's territorial scope, not the fine, although the ruling suggests the ICO's decision to issue a fine was valid.

The FTT will then decide again whether, in light of the UT's decision, Clearview contravened the UK GDPR.

John Edwards, the UK's Information Commissioner, said: ""The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge.

""The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK.""

Jack Mulcaire, chief legal officer at Clearview AI, told The Register: ""Clearview AI is disappointed by this ruling which misapplied the law to improperly seek to regulate how American companies serve the US government. We do not offer any product or do any business in the United Kingdom. We intend to file an appeal.""

On that point, Jon Baines, Senior Data Protection Specialist at Mishcon de Reya LLP, commented: ""It's worth noting that it was a very strong, three-judge bench (with President of the Chamber Mrs Justice Heather Williams DBE as lead judge) and the judgment very much has the feel of one the bench has tried to make as 'appeal-proof' as possible."" ®

 Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling, has been deployed on a permissioned blockchain and backed by Ugandan treasury bonds. 

Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot as part of a broader tokenization effort across the African nation, while its neighbor Kenya is on the verge of enacting a crypto regulation bill. 

Blockchain financial infrastructure company the Global Settlement Network (GSN) has partnered with Ugandan developer Diacente Group in an initiative to tokenize $5.5 billion of real-world assets, which also includes a CBDC pilot, the companies announced on Wednesday. 

It comes as Kenya's virtual asset service providers (VASP) bill passed through the country's parliament on Tuesday and now awaits President William Ruto's signature to become law. 

Sub-Saharan Africa, regions south of the Sahara that include Uganda and Kenya, were flagged as the third-fastest growing region for crypto adoption in a September report from blockchain data platform Chainalysis, after $205 billion in onchain value was received between July 2024 and June 2025.

Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling, has been deployed on GSN's permissioned blockchain, backed by Ugandan treasury bonds, and is accessible through a smartphone, according to GSN and the Diacente Group.

The pilot also adheres to both local and international compliance standards, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols.

Meanwhile, the tokenization effort will focus on digitizing key flows across major sectors, including physical infrastructure such as agro-processing hubs, mining operations, and solar plants. 

Edgar Agaba, the chairman of Diacente Group, said the initiative hopes to unlock “long-term value for our people and our region.” 

Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC in 2021, according to think tank Overseas Development Institute. Several other countries, such as Ghana and South Africa, have also piloted CBDCs. Egypt has a launch date of 2030, while Rwanda and Kenya are still in the research and public consultation phase. 

Kenya's VASP bill, first introduced in January, establishes licensing, consumer protections, and a framework for exchanges, brokers, wallet operators, and token issuers. The bill passed the country's parliament on Tuesday after the third reading and now awaits the president's signature to become law.  

Under the legislation, the Central Bank of Kenya will oversee payment and custody functions, while the Capital Markets Authority will regulate investment and trading activities.

There are also KYC and AML provisions in line with the standards of the intergovernmental body, the Financial Action Task Force, and rules against deceptive advertising, along with fines and other penalties. 

It's estimated that over 75 million users will be in the crypto space in Africa by 2026, according to online data platform Statista, with a user rate of 5.90%. The total revenue from the continent is projected to hit $5.1 billion by 2026. 

Stablecoins account for approximately 43% of the Sub-Saharan African region's total transaction volume, Chainalysis reported on Oct. 2, with Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Zambia making up the top five. Uganda was seventh.

Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot, marking a significant step in the country's digital finance efforts. This move comes amid growing interest in cryptocurrencies across Sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, Kenya is about to pass a crucial bill that will regulate the crypto industry. Both developments represent important milestones in the region's evolving digital economy, reflecting a broader trend of embracing blockchain technology.

Uganda has introduced a CBDC pilot as part of a broader plan to digitize its financial infrastructure. The digital Ugandan shilling, backed by the country's treasury bonds, is deployed on a permissioned blockchain.

This effort aims to boost economic transparency and financial inclusion. The CBDC is available for use via smartphones, which could potentially increase access to financial services in remote areas.

The pilot complies with both local and international standards, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. GSN, a blockchain financial infrastructure company, partnered with Uganda's Diacente Group to tokenize $5.5 billion in real-world assets. This initiative is focused on various sectors such as agro-processing, mining, and renewable energy.

In neighboring Kenya, the virtual asset service providers (VASP) bill has passed its final parliamentary reading and is awaiting President William Ruto's signature to become law. The bill seeks to create a regulated framework for crypto exchanges, brokers, and wallet operators. The law also includes consumer protection measures and establishes the Central Bank of Kenya as the overseeing authority for payment and custody functions.

The proposed legislation is in line with global standards, including KYC and AML measures. It also includes provisions to prevent deceptive advertising practices and enforce penalties for non-compliance. Once signed into law, this bill will set a clear regulatory path for Kenya's growing crypto industry.

Both Uganda and Kenya are part of the rapidly expanding crypto ecosystem in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to blockchain data platform Chainalysis, the region saw a surge of $205 billion in on-chain value between July 2024 and June 2025. Countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana are also leading the charge in crypto adoption, with Uganda ranking seventh in the region for total transaction volume.

As blockchain technology and digital currencies gain traction, many African nations are exploring the potential of CBDCs. While Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC in 2021, other countries such as Ghana and South Africa have also conducted CBDC trials. In contrast, Kenya and Rwanda are still in the research phase but are expected to launch in the coming years.

The initiatives in Uganda and Kenya underscore a wider shift toward digital finance across Africa. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into the financial system, countries are positioning themselves to attract new investment and stimulate economic growth. Tokenization of assets, along with CBDCs, can enhance transparency and help industries access new funding opportunities.

With a growing user base in the crypto space, Africa's digital asset market is expected to reach significant heights. Statista estimates that over 75 million users in Africa will be engaged in crypto by 2026, with a revenue of $5.1 billion expected. This growth could further reinforce the region's position as a key player in the global blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.

The East African country of Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot backed by treasury bonds. At the same time, its neighbor, Kenya, is on the verge of signing its first cryptocurrency regulation bill into law, pending presidential approval.

The Bank of Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling on a permissioned blockchain, has been implemented by a partnership between blockchain infrastructure company Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Ugandan developer Diacente Group. It forms part of a $5.5 billion national tokenization initiative announced on Wednesday.

Under the pilot program, GSN and Diacente will tokenize real-world assets, including treasury bonds, agricultural investments, and renewable energy projects, to modernize Uganda's financial system and attract international investment. According to GSN, funding will come from tokenized loans and investors across Korea and the Middle East.

More than 80% of Uganda's workforce operates in the informal economy, where access to formal banking is limited. The new CBDC system seeks to change that by enabling low-cost, mobile-based transactions via smartphones and USSD codes for over 40 million Ugandans.

GSN representatives said the platform uses full Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols in tandem with both local and international standards.

“We are building infrastructure that goes beyond theory—a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility. This is how we close the gap between digital finance and real-world impact,” remarked Ryan Kirkley, co-founder and CEO of GSN.

The pilot will begin in the Karamoja Green Industrial and Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), a government-supported development centre within Uganda's Vision 2040 plan. The country's government is seeking to industrialize and expand the economy to $500 billion through regional trading.

Uganda's pilot follows similar efforts by Nigeria, which became the first country on the continent to launch a CBDC in 2021 with its eNaira, while Ghana and South Africa have both conducted pilot programs. Egypt plans to roll out a national digital currency by 2030, and Rwanda and Kenya remain in the research phase.

Kirkley asserted that Uganda's CBDC deliberately avoids the pitfalls faced by Nigeria's eNaira, which he said struggled with low user adoption. 

“Previous systems failed because they were not linked to real use. We are starting with industries, with jobs and production, so people have a reason to use it,” the GSN CEO surmised.

The Ugandan government hopes the pilot will lay the groundwork for full-scale tokenization in several economic activities, including agriculture, mining, renewable energy, and global trade.

Crossing the border from Uganda, Kenya is on the brink of passing its first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. On Tuesday, the 2024-tabled Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, 2025, cleared its third reading in Parliament, sending it to President William Ruto for assent.

Kenyan Members of Parliament reached a consensus to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets under the joint oversight of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). It also grants the Treasury Cabinet Secretary powers to issue detailed rules on stablecoins, tokenization, capital adequacy, and anti-money laundering (AML) standards.

If signed into law, the framework will create clear licensing and solvency requirements for both domestic and foreign digital asset operators. Companies expected to be part of the approval list include Luno, Busha, KotaniPay, Fonbnk, Swypt, and Binance. President Ruto is expected to receive the final bill within weeks.

Chebet Kipingor, the country lead for crypto platform Busha Kenya, said the legislation is a turning point for the country's crypto market confidence.

The bill's approval would make Kenya one of the few African nations with formal legal recognition of digital assets and service providers. Sub-Saharan Africa, which includes Uganda and Kenya, is the world's third-fastest growing region for crypto adoption, according to a September report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

BISMARCK — The Bank of North Dakota and its core banking services provider, Fiserv, announced a partnership Wednesday, Oct. 8, to develop the state's own stablecoin, which will be called the Roughrider coin.


According to J.P. Morgan,
    
       ""A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is designed to be stable, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. On paper, they aim to offer the benefits of cryptocurrency — high-speed, low-cost and decentralized transactions — with the stability of traditional assets.""

ADVERTISEMENT

Fiserv COO Takis Georgakopoulos said stablecoins allow for essentially instantaneous transactions as compared to existing options like wire transfers and ACH transfers.



Wire transfers can typically be accomplished in the same day. ACH transfers can take 1-3 business days to complete. 

Making the announcement during an event held at Bismarck State College, Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the Roughrider coin will be developed in the new financial environment created with the passage of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a framework for payment stablecoins by requiring they be backed with high-quality assets, as opposed to more volatile cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

Initially, Morgan said, the Roughrider coin will be used for things like bank-to-bank movement of money using Fiserv's digital assets platform.

Eventually, he added, the Roughrider coin could be used for other types of transactions, though he did not go into details.

When the Bank of North Dakota takes future steps, Morgan said, it will do so ""diligently, thoughtfully, step by step. We've operated that way for 100 years.""

Georgakopoulos said that by developing its own stablecoin, North Dakota will have greater say in how it may be used compared to going with an established stablecoin.

""The moment you go with any of the existing coins, you have to live with their rules. You are intermingled with all of their other clients,"" Georgakopoulos said.

""Banks are different,"" he added. ""You want to be able to set your own rules, and there is a whole host of capabilities you can bring to the table that you wouldn't be able to do if you went with an established provider.""

He said one area of flexibility relates to the custody of real assets that are moved to stablecoins and how those deposits might be shared between banks ""in ways you guys decide make sense.""

State officials said the Roughrider coin will be available to banks and credit unions in North Dakota in 2026.

Following the Roughrider coin announcement, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota, issued a statement applauding the development.

“As the only state-owned bank in the country, BND has charted its own path numerous times over the last 106 years to benefit North Dakota residents. This is the next chapter in its financial innovation story,"" the statement said.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The Roughrider coin is a cutting-edge approach to improving efficiency and quality control in the banking sector, a direct benefit for our residents,” the statement said.

The Industrial Commission consists of North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Attorney General Drew Wrigley and  Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring.

In announcing the new coin, officials stressed that in addition to requiring that stablecoins be backed with high-quality assets, the GENIUS Act also requires things like mandated disclosures and audits, ensured reserve transparency and rules for permitted users.

Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund, the FSIL, will allocate 1% of its total investment portfolio in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Finance Minister Gilles Roth (CSV) said in his 2026 budget speech Wednesday.

“This is really great news for crypto-assets because this is the first investment of a public fund in bitcoin in Luxembourg,” the CSV MP Laurent Mosar said in a social media post.

The move is meant to highlight Luxembourg as a fintech and digital assets hub, particularly as the Grand Duchy is increasingly a European base for companies seeking a so-called Mica licence, which authorises crypto activity across the EU.

The FSIL had €764 million in total assets on 30 June 2025, according to its mid-year financial report. The government has been injecting roughly €62 million in capital into the fund each spring. That means the fund could theoretically hold more than €8.2 million in cryptocurrency next year, if markets remain steady or rise.

The fund currently does not hold any digital currencies. As of 30 June 2025, the fund had allocated about 53% of its assets to investment grade bonds, 46% to index funds and less than 1% in cash reserves, mainly as a hedge against foreign exchange fluctuations.

less than 1% in cash reserves, mainly as a hedge against foreign exchange fluctuations.

“Some might argue that we're committing too little too late; others will point out the volatility and speculative nature of the investment,” Bob Kieffer, treasury director at the finance minister, said in a social media post. “Yet, given the FSIL's particular profile and mission, the fund's management board concluded that a 1% allocation strikes the right balance, while sending a clear message about bitcoin's long-term potential. Obviously, what's right for the FSIL might not be right for other investors.”

“To avoid operational risks, the exposure to bitcoin has been taken through a selection of ETFs,” or exchange-traded funds, Kieffer stated.

Luxembourg is following in the footsteps of Norway's massive $1.9 trillion (€1.6 trillion) sovereign wealth fund, which reportedly holds 11,400 bitcoins (worth about €1.2 billion at the time of publication), as well as sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and North America.

A former
Israeli intelligence official is asking a court to force Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to turn over records of foreign bank accounts,
cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property as part of his defense against a
$150,000 defamation lawsuit filed by the prime minister.

But is it
really possible to access such information, especially in the supposedly
anonymous cryptocurrency market? Experts who spoke with FinanceMagnates.com say
yes.

Dr. Udi
Levi, who spent three decades with the Mossad, the National Security Council,
and military intelligence, filed the legal response this week, calling
Netanyahu's suit a tactic to shut down public questions about possible
financial ties to Qatar. The court filing asks for records of foreign bank
accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property owned by Netanyahu and
his family.

In his
court filing, Levi said he's received reports of witnesses who claim to have
seen cash deliveries to the Netanyahu family, both inside Israel and abroad. He
said those accounts included allegations of foreign bank accounts, digital
wallets, and real estate purchases made with money that was never declared.

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members.

The demands
arrive at a moment when tracking crypto has become far more realistic than most
people assume. Isaac Joshua, CEO of Gems Launchpad, said once funds pass

“The
offshore privacy era is ending,” Joshua said. “Israeli holders should
expect greater scrutiny and may consider voluntary disclosure before global
data-sharing becomes fully automatic.”

Israel has committed to adopting the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, known as CARF, which will create a standardized system for collecting and exchanging data on cryptocurrency transactions between countries. Through OECD information-sharing frameworks and CARF, more than 50 countries will automatically exchange crypto account data from regulated exchanges starting in 2027.

There is still a long way to go before that happens. For now, from a procedural or political standpoint, it may be considered impossible. However, current technological solutions suggest otherwise.

“Wallets can often be tied back to real identities,” Stern said. Analytics
tools have become far more advanced, some even tracking cash-for-crypto
schemes. “With governments and private players teaming up against money
laundering and terror financing, Israeli traders should expect their overseas
accounts to be within reach of tax authorities.”

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members. He also requested information on political campaign funding
received by Netanyahu and his parties in the 2012 and 2018 elections.

Stern's view is echoed by Nathan Bekerman, Head of Product at Station70. Even if the funds were held in self-custodian wallets and not directly linked to any identity, “most blockchains are actually highly transparent, not private,” he said.

“Every
transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which means with the right
analytics tools, tracing funds is often easier than hiding them,” Bekerman
added

The demands
come as Israeli law enforcement continues to investigate what's been called
“Qatargate,” a scandal in which close aides to Netanyahu are accused
of taking money from Qatar to promote Doha's interests in Israeli media. 

Two of
Netanyahu's top advisers were arrested in connection with the probe, and court
documents suggest they're suspected of accepting bribes and coordinating
messages to journalists that portrayed Qatar favorably while downplaying
Egypt's role in ceasefire negotiations.

Netanyahu
denied all of the allegations through his attorney Uriel Nizri, who called
Levi's comments “sick and insane” and accused political opponents of
spreading lies to bring down a sitting prime minister during wartime. The prime
minister claimed Levi used his security background to give false legitimacy to
what he called baseless conspiracy theories.

Levi argued
that Netanyahu, as a public figure, isn't immune from public scrutiny,
particularly when there are credible questions about financial conduct. The
former intelligence official said the radio interview was a good-faith call for
transparency, not libel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Healthcare Revolution: How AI and Crypto are Changing the Game","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/revolutionizing-healthcare-ai-crypto-impact","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 04:16:31 GMT","

With technology rapidly changing the landscape of industries, the combination of AI and cryptocurrency is set to disrupt how healthcare gets funded and innovated. A recent funding round of $343.5 million for Predictive Oncology showcases what decentralized finance can bring to drug discovery and patient care. Let's dive into how AI and crypto technologies are transforming healthcare and tackling the regulatory hurdles that crypto-friendly SMEs are facing.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is quickly becoming a major player in healthcare funding, offering transparent, efficient, and patient-centric financial interactions. By utilizing blockchain, healthcare providers can cut costs and inefficiencies, which allows for more personalized treatment plans and improved interoperability. This change gives patients more control over their health information and financial transactions, shifting the focus back to patient care.

DeFi is also bringing new funding models like peer-to-peer lending and insurance, cutting out traditional middlemen like banks and insurers. This not only reduces transaction costs but also widens access to capital, making healthcare funding more inclusive. As DeFi keeps evolving, it holds the potential to reshape how healthcare is financed, making it both more accessible and efficient.

For crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe aiming to invest in AI healthcare technologies, the regulatory landscape is a minefield. The EU has rolled out a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto assets, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which mandates that Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) obtain licenses to operate within the EU. Compliance is key for SMEs looking to integrate crypto into healthcare.

Additionally, the EU AI Act classes most healthcare AI solutions as ""high-risk"", which means they require strict certification and human oversight. SMEs must ensure compliance in areas like data governance, technical documentation, and cybersecurity to meet these standards. Working with regulatory bodies and establishing solid compliance practices will be necessary to navigate these hurdles and foster healthcare innovation.

Predictive Oncology's recent funding of $343.5 million highlights the crucial role AI-driven drug discovery plays in enhancing crypto solutions. With Aethir's ATH tokens for decentralized computing power, Predictive Oncology aims to build scalable AI applications that will boost large-scale model training and genomic analysis while ensuring data privacy. This marks a significant milestone for both healthcare and digital assets.

The use of AI in drug discovery leads to quicker identification of new compounds and predictive modeling, which could dramatically speed up the creation of new treatments. Fintech startups in Asia and beyond can look to these advancements as a way to enhance their crypto solutions, improving analytics, security, and compliance.

As healthcare begins to adopt cryptocurrency, crypto payroll platforms are becoming essential for managing payments. These platforms allow healthcare providers to pay employees and contractors in cryptocurrency, streamlining payroll and cutting down on transaction costs. The rise of crypto payroll for gamers and streamers also points to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency across various sectors, including healthcare.

Integrating crypto payroll solutions into healthcare organizations can lead to faster transaction times, lower fees, and greater flexibility in financial management. This not only boosts operational efficiency but also attracts a tech-savvy workforce that values innovative payment options.

In the future, the integration of AI and cryptocurrency in healthcare will likely speed up, spurred by tech advancements and changing regulatory frameworks. As decentralized finance continues to gain ground, healthcare organizations will increasingly seek out innovative funding models utilizing blockchain technology.

Furthermore, the growing importance of data privacy and security will require the establishment of strong AI governance frameworks that comply with regulations like HIPAA. By promoting collaboration among tech providers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies, the industry can overcome these challenges and tap into the full potential of AI and crypto in healthcare.

The convergence of AI, cryptocurrency, and healthcare offers a distinctive opportunity for innovation and transformation. As evidenced by Predictive Oncology's recent funding, decentralized finance can significantly enhance drug discovery and patient care. By addressing regulatory challenges and welcoming new technologies, healthcare organizations can set the stage for a more efficient, transparent, and patient-focused future. The integration of AI and crypto will undoubtedly reshape the healthcare landscape, presenting exciting opportunities for both fields.

A Luxembourg sovereign wealth fund has invested a 1% sliver of its holdings into Bitcoin ETFs, making it the first state level fund in the Eurozone to do so, according to a representative for the Agency for the Development of Luxembourg's Financial Centre.

European nations Finland, Georgia and the U.K. also hold bitcoin, although most of that crypto is sourced from criminal seizures, according to Bitbo, with the exception of Georgia, a nation outside the Eurozone that owns 66 BTC for investment purposes. 

During his presentation of the 2026 Budget at the Chambre des Députés, Luxembourg Finance Minister Gilles Roth, revealed the European nation's Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSIL) has invested 1% of its holdings in Bitcoin.

“Recognizing the growing maturity of this new asset class, and underlining Luxembourg's leadership in digital finance, this investment is an application of the FSIL's new investment policy, which was approved by the Government in July 2025,” said Bob Kieffer, Director of the Treasury, Luxembourg

Luxembourg, one of the least populated countries in Europe (682,000 approximately) introduced its Intergenerational Sovereign Fund (FSIL) back in 2014, intended to build up a reserve for future generations. The fund holds a modest $730 million of assets, most of its investments being in high-quality bonds.

Under the revised framework, the FSIL will continue to invest in equity and debt markets, while now also being authorized to allocate up to 15% of its assets to alternative investments. These include private equity and real estate, as well as crypto assets. To avoid operational risks, the exposure to Bitcoin has been taken through a selection of ETFs, Kieffer said.

“Some might argue that we're committing too little too late; others will point out the volatility and speculative nature of the investment. Yet, given the FSIL's particular profile and mission, the Fund's management board concluded that a 1% allocation strikes the right balance, while sending a clear message about Bitcoin's long-term potential. Obviously, what's right for the FSIL might not be right for other investors,” he said.

UK Lifts Retail Ban on Crypto ETNs, Paving Way for Investments From Pensions, ISAs

Spot solana SOL$218.22 exchange-traded funds (ETFS) are unlikely to draw major investor inflows even if approved this week, according to a Wednesday report from Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM). 

Solana ETFs could see about $1.5 billion in first-year inflows, roughly one-seventh of ether's ETH$4,309.76, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

But the analysts warned that figure could be lower due to waning on-chain activity, heavy memecoin trading, investor fatigue from multiple launches, and competition from diversified crypto index products such as those tied to the S&P Dow Jones Indices Digital Markets 50. Corporate treasuries could also divert demand away from spot ETFs.

JPMorgan also noted weak demand signals in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) solana futures positioning.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide on roughly sixteen spot crypto ETF applications in October, including solana.

Markets widely expect approval, helped by an existing CME futures contract and the July launch of the first Solana ETF from REX Osprey, the bank said.

JPMorgan noted that expectations are already visible in pricing. The premium to net asset value (NAV) on the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) has collapsed from around 750% last year to near zero, echoing bitcoin BTC$120,468.13 and ether trends ahead of ETF launches.

An attempted bitcoin BTC$120,489.98 rally back toward a record high was quickly snuffed out and reversed in morning U.S. action on Thursday.

Trading just below $124,000 just ahead of the opening of the stock market, bitcoin pulled back to below $121,000 about ninety minutes later. The action happened alongside pullbacks in previously red-hot gold and silver markets.

Gold has been making most of the headlines of late, but the action in silver may have been today's driver. Up 50% from the April lows, the metal hit $50 per ounce for the first time ever on Thursday. That level, though, spurred some fast profit-taking, with the price dropping about 4% within minutes. At press time, silver was changing hands at $48.55.

""Near term, momentum looks choppy as technicals flag an increasingly overbought market; medium term, appetite to sustain ranges above $50 should persist if the macro and real-yield picture stays benign,"" wrote Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com.

For its part, gold reversed more than 1% from a challenge of the $4,100 per ounce level to the current $4,035.

The ongoing U.S. government shutdown may also be starting to weigh on investor sentiment, disrupting the release of key economic data and slowing operations for businesses that rely on federal services, clouding both traditional and digital asset markets.

Smaller cryptocurrencies fared worse during the pullback: ether slumped 3.5% to $4,300, while BNB and DOGE also fell 3%-4%.

Amidst the risk-off move, bitcoin's market share of the total crypto market climbed to its strongest reading in nearly eight weeks The Bitcoin Dominance metric rose above 59.4% for the first time since August, TradingView data shows, suggesting traders rotate capital back to the largest crypto asset.

The pullback rippled across crypto derivatives markets as well. Over $600 million leveraged trading positions were liquidated across all digital asset in the past 24 hours, CoinGlass data shows.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Block Street Raises $11.5M to Build ‘Execution Layer for On-Chain Stocks'","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/09/block-street-raises-usd11-5m-to-build-execution-layer-for-on-chain-stocks","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:03:54 GMT","

A new crypto infrastructure startup called Block Street has raised $11.5 million to build what it calls an “execution layer for on-chain stocks.”

The funding round was led by Hack VC, with backing from Generative Venture, DWF Labs and others including executives from firms like Jane Street and Point72.

Block Street's pitch is that trading tokenized stocks should feel as fast and reliable as traditional markets.

Its system, called Aqua, is built on Monad, and uses a request-for-quote (RFQ) model where market makers compete to offer the best price. These quotes are cryptographically signed and verified onchain to prevent manipulation or delays.

Another part of the stack, Everst, introduces lending and liquidation tools designed specifically for tokenized equities, allowing users to borrow, short, or hedge these assets. The company says this setup reduces “MEV leakage” and makes tokenized assets more functional, not just speculative.

“Our mandate is infra, not just an app,” said Hedy Wang, co-founder of Block Street. “Monad's parallel EVM gives us the settlement guarantees and latency budget institutions expect, while Aqua and Everst push best-execution and equity-native risk controls directly on-chain.”

Block Street plans to go live on Monad later this year, expanding to Ethereum, BNB Chain and Base as integrations mature. The team, which includes veterans from Citadel, Point72 and Google, plans to publish transparency dashboards showing how much better their execution is compared to automated market-makers.

 SOL's bull case is supported by a rising TVL and DEX activity, along with strong institutional demand and investors' hope for spot ETF approvals. 

Key takeaways:

Solana ETFs and ETPs recorded $706 million in weekly inflows, outpacing XRP's $219 million, per CoinShares.

SOL funding rates stayed below the 6% neutral level, signaling reduced appetite for leveraged bullish positions among traders.

Solana's native token, SOL (SOL), climbed back to $229 on Tuesday after briefly dipping to $218. The move came as investors responded positively to the US Federal Reserve's release of minutes from its Sept. 17 meeting, which reaffirmed expectations of additional interest rate cuts in 2025.

Traders remain optimistic that SOL could advance toward the $300 mark, a target that appears realistic given the strong bullish sentiment reflected in derivatives metrics and onchain data.

Solana recorded a 22% increase in seven-day network fees, driven by rising activity across decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Meanwhile, its main rival by deposits, Ethereum, saw the opposite trend, with network revenue falling 21% during the same period. Solana continues to dominate in transaction count, surpassing the combined total of Ethereum and its layer-2 ecosystem.

DEX volumes on Pump rose 78% over the past seven days, followed by a 73% increase on Meteora and a 46% rise on Raydium. Solana regained its leading position in decentralized exchange activity, posting $129 billion in 30-day volume and surpassing Ethereum's $114 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Notably, the fastest-growing rival, Hyperliquid, has stalled at around $31 billion.

Network fees remain a key element for any blockchain focused on decentralized applications, particularly when the revenue helps offset inflationary pressures. Unless the system is centralized, maintaining validators incurs costs, and staking participants expect a reasonable return. In short, weak network activity discourages holding the native token and can trigger sell pressure.

Solana's total value locked (TVL) rose 8% in 30 days, supporting further growth in network fees. Standout performers included a 20% rise in Kamino deposits, 12% in Drift, and 12% in Orca. By comparison, Ethereum's TVL increased 3% over the same period, while Tron deposits grew 6%. As a result, Solana has solidified its position as the second-largest network, with $14.2 billion in TVL, representing an 8% market share.

The rapid surge in activity on the perpetual futures trading platform Aster has redirected traders' focus toward BNB Chain, following a wave of memecoins that soared 150% or more within seven days. As a result, even though SOL's price rose 3% during the same period, BNB's remarkable 28% rally weighed on sentiment among Solana ecosystem investors.

Data from SOL perpetual futures provides insight into whether traders have lost confidence after the failed attempt to break above $250 on Sept. 18. Many SOL holders are likely frustrated, especially as some rival tokens have recently reached new all-time highs, including BNB at $1,357 on Tuesday and Mantle (MNT) at $2.81 on Wednesday.

The funding rate on SOL perpetual futures has remained below the 6% neutral threshold, signaling weak demand for bullish leveraged positions. This cautious stance among traders may be partly attributed to the growing traction of competing blockchains, which have drawn attention away from Solana despite record weekly inflows into its exchange-traded products.

CoinShares reported that Solana ETFs and ETPs attracted $706 million in inflows during the seven days ending Sept. 5, far surpassing the $219 million recorded by XRP instruments. Investors now anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve multiple spot Solana ETFs on Friday, a development that could drive additional institutional inflows and potentially push SOL's price beyond $300.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin set for ‘dramatic' surge if it doesn't top soon: Peter Brandt","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-bull-market-cycle-high-prediction-peter-brandt-trader","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:28:44 GMT","

 If Bitcoin deviates from its four-year cycle, it'll see “dramatic” price action, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt. 

Bitcoin is poised for unprecedented price discovery as long as it doesn't peak within the next few days, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

“It is reasonable to expect a bull market high any day now,” Brandt told Cointelegraph on Wednesday, citing Bitcoin's (BTC) historical cycle pattern, which has played out in the three previous cycles.

“These cycles from low-to-halving-to-high have not always been the same length, but the post-halving distance of each has always been equal to the pre-halving distance,” Brandt said.

Brandt explained that Bitcoin hit its current cycle low on Nov. 9, 2022, which was 533 days before the Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024. 

“Add 533 days to April 20, 2024, and bingo, it is this week,” he said. That date fell on Sunday, just one day before Bitcoin set a new all-time high above $126,100 on Monday.

However, Brandt emphasized, “there is always an ‘except,'” which could be significant for how Bitcoin's price plays out. “Trends that violate the prevailing cyclic or seasonal nature of markets are typically the most dramatic,” he said.

Brandt noted that while market cycles don't always repeat in the same way, Bitcoin has followed them consistently so far. 

“Sooner or later, cycles change. But betting against a cycle that has a perfect three-for-three record should not be done with reckless abandon,” he said.

Brandt said he is 50/50 on the outcome. “I will remain bullish, hopeful for counter-cyclicality. In this case, a move well beyond $150,000 would be my expectation, perhaps as high as $185,000,” Brandt said.

It comes as the debate continues over whether crypto's four-year cycle remains relevant, given the onset of institutional adoption, ETF products and corporate digital asset treasuries.

In July, crypto analyst Rekt Capital similarly said that if the Bitcoin cycle follows the 2020 pattern, the market will likely peak in October. 

“We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left,” Rekt said on July 3.

Some argue that even if Bitcoin doesn't follow the four-year cycle exactly, it will still exhibit some kind of pattern.

Gemini's head of APAC region, Saad Ahmed, told Cointelegraph at Token2049 that “it ultimately stems” from people getting excited and overextending themselves, and “then you kind of see a crash, and then it kind of corrects to an equilibrium.”

Several analysts expect Bitcoin to post significant gains before the end of the year. Economist Timothy Peterson told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that there is a 50% chance that Bitcoin ends the month above $140,000, based on simulations using data from the past decade.

Looking further ahead, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Unchained's director of market research, Joe Burnett, have both tipped Bitcoin to reach as high as $250,000 by the end of 2025.

 Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling, has been deployed on a permissioned blockchain and backed by Ugandan treasury bonds. 

Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot as part of a broader tokenization effort across the African nation, while its neighbor Kenya is on the verge of enacting a crypto regulation bill. 

Blockchain financial infrastructure company the Global Settlement Network (GSN) has partnered with Ugandan developer Diacente Group in an initiative to tokenize $5.5 billion of real-world assets, which also includes a CBDC pilot, the companies announced on Wednesday. 

It comes as Kenya's virtual asset service providers (VASP) bill passed through the country's parliament on Tuesday and now awaits President William Ruto's signature to become law. 

Sub-Saharan Africa, regions south of the Sahara that include Uganda and Kenya, were flagged as the third-fastest growing region for crypto adoption in a September report from blockchain data platform Chainalysis, after $205 billion in onchain value was received between July 2024 and June 2025.

Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling, has been deployed on GSN's permissioned blockchain, backed by Ugandan treasury bonds, and is accessible through a smartphone, according to GSN and the Diacente Group.

The pilot also adheres to both local and international compliance standards, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols.

Meanwhile, the tokenization effort will focus on digitizing key flows across major sectors, including physical infrastructure such as agro-processing hubs, mining operations, and solar plants. 

Edgar Agaba, the chairman of Diacente Group, said the initiative hopes to unlock “long-term value for our people and our region.” 

Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC in 2021, according to think tank Overseas Development Institute. Several other countries, such as Ghana and South Africa, have also piloted CBDCs. Egypt has a launch date of 2030, while Rwanda and Kenya are still in the research and public consultation phase. 

Kenya's VASP bill, first introduced in January, establishes licensing, consumer protections, and a framework for exchanges, brokers, wallet operators, and token issuers. The bill passed the country's parliament on Tuesday after the third reading and now awaits the president's signature to become law.  

Under the legislation, the Central Bank of Kenya will oversee payment and custody functions, while the Capital Markets Authority will regulate investment and trading activities.

There are also KYC and AML provisions in line with the standards of the intergovernmental body, the Financial Action Task Force, and rules against deceptive advertising, along with fines and other penalties. 

It's estimated that over 75 million users will be in the crypto space in Africa by 2026, according to online data platform Statista, with a user rate of 5.90%. The total revenue from the continent is projected to hit $5.1 billion by 2026. 

Stablecoins account for approximately 43% of the Sub-Saharan African region's total transaction volume, Chainalysis reported on Oct. 2, with Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Zambia making up the top five. Uganda was seventh.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","UK lifts ban on crypto exchange-traded notes as ‘market has evolved'","https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-lifts-ban-crypto-exchange-traded-notes","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:08:42 GMT","

 The UK has lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes, with analysts predicting the move could grow the UK crypto market by 20%. 

The UK government has finally lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes, citing a maturation of the industry and a greater understanding of digital asset products. 

In an announcement on Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) outlined that retail investors can now access crypto ETNs via FCA-approved exchanges based in the UK 

A crypto exchange-traded note is a debt product that allows an investor to gain exposure to a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. These types of products are essentially traded similarly to any other security, with underlying crypto held securely by regulated custodians.

“Since we restricted retail access to crypto ETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood. In light of this, we're providing consumers with more choice, while ensuring there are protections in place,” said David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, as part of the announcement. 

The crypto ETN ban initially went into effect in January 2021, with the FCA stating that it considered “these products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.” It also argued that there was a “lack of legitimate investment need” for these crypto products at the time. 

The latest move by the FCA marks a significant shift in tone, as the government has gradually warmed to the crypto space over the past few years. The country is awaiting the rollout of a comprehensive framework following a government leadership change in July. 

As part of the announcement, the FCA also said that its ban on “retail access to cryptoasset derivatives will remain in place,” adding that it will continue to keep an eye on “market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments.”  

Alongside lifting the crypto ETN ban, the UK government also released a policy statement on the tax treatment for these crypto products in specific types of tax-efficient investment accounts.

From Oct. 8, the government will allow crypto ETNs to be held in “registered pension schemes,” and from April 2026 will open up access for Stocks & Shares Individual Savings Accounts, meaning the citizens will have a few tax-incentivized investment options for these products.      

“The government remains supportive of the UK's growing cryptoasset sector and continues to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers,” the statement reads. 

A recent research report by IG Group predicts the UK crypto market could grow by up to 20% following the relaunch of crypto ETNs.

The report based this prediction on its own research that found that “30% of UK adults would consider investing in crypto via ETNs,” with the main appeal being the “perceived safety and regulatory oversight” offered by these products.  

“This represents a significant potential uplift from current levels of crypto ownership — 12%, according to the FCA's latest study, and 25% according to IG's new study.” Magazine: EU's privacy-killing Chat Control bill delayed — but fight isn't over

Science behind Record-Breaking Everest Blizzard That Trapped Hundreds

A blizzard that trapped hundreds of trekkers on Mount Everest was truly “off the charts,” experts explain

A blizzard that trapped hundreds of trekkers on the north side of Mount Everest last weekend captured headlines for its proximity to the famed peak. But less appreciated was the truly bizarre nature of the blizzard: the amount of snow that fell within 12 hours was 3.5 times greater than anything measured at the mountain before.

“It's off the charts in terms of the six-year record we have from the weather stations on Everest,” says Tom Matthews, a climate scientist at King's College London, who co-led the expedition to the highest weather station on earth at Everest in 2019. He uses a comparison to human heights to drive home the oddity: “Over the last six years,” he says, “the tallest person you might have seen was someone six feet, seven inches come to base camp; on [October] 4 a giant 23 feet tall rolled up.”

About 900 trekkers and guides were rescued in the days after the storm, according to the Associated Press. These individuals were trekking to and around the base camp on the mountain's north side in Tibet during China's National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holiday break. In Nepal the precipitation fell as rain, causing widespread flooding and landslides that killed at least 47, according to Al Jazeera.

The heavy blizzard dropped around three feet of snow in the Gama Valley of Tibet last Friday and Saturday, according to reporting. This came during a period that is typically dry and mild in the region. The rainy monsoon season in Tibet and Nepal runs from May to mid-September. Most climbers try to summit Everest in the spring, before the monsoon begins. The few climbers who do attempt the peak in October are lured by smaller crowds and typically clear skies.

But it wasn't climbers who were most affected by the storm. The people who were trapped by the snow that fell on October 3 and 4 were tourists trying to peer up at the mountain from its base in Tibet's Tingri County. A popular four- to five-day trek takes adventurous tourists from the village of Old Tingri to Everest's northern base camp, called North Base Camp, which sits around 17,000 feet above sea level. People can also now drive to North Base Camp, says Kent Moore, a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Toronto Mississauga, who studies mountain meteorology. Last weekend the route may have been more crowded than usual because of the holiday.

“It's easy to put yourself in a situation that's quite dangerous now,” Moore says. Twenty years ago the event would have been a “nothingburger,” he adds, because nobody would have been in the area. But infrastructure improvements in Tibet have drawn more and more people to Everest's remote north side. And because it's easy to get to North Base Camp quickly, such tourists may not be as acclimated to high elevation as trekkers to the mountain's South Base Camp in Nepal, which requires about a two-week hike to reach from Kathmandu.

“A snowstorm at sea level is not a big deal,” Moore says. “But when you're at 5,000 meters [16,440 feet], everything is just harder to do.”

According to Nepal's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal intensified the monsoon that triggered the precipitation. Trekkers also reported wind and near-continuous lightning on Everest's north side. Meteorologists are still analyzing the weather pattern, Matthews says. But two low-pressure systems, one on either side of India, may have contributed to the event by funneling high levels of water vapor from the Bay of Bengal into the Everest region. Possibly exacerbating the issue, Moore says, was the fact that the surface of the Bay of Bengal is currently two degrees Celsius warmer than its historical monthly average. Warmer water evaporates more readily, providing more vapor that could then condense into snow.

Heavier precipitation events are expected to increase as the climate warms, Moore says. “That's just because, when the air is warmer, it can hold more water vapor,” he adds. “Water vapor is what leads to storms and what leads to precipitation.”

As of October 6, the monsoon was withdrawing from the region, according to Nepal's DHM.

Scientists Turned 300,000 Litter Box Visits into an AI-Powered Cat Health Monitor

Cat bathroom data from an AI-powered litter box could offer useful pet health insights

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Clara Moskowitz

To cat owners, a litter box is a nuisance. But to scientists, it's a trove of information. A team of researchers at Nestlé Purina PetCare decided to investigate litter boxes as records of behavior: the pre-squat scratch, the whirl, the precise geometry of the bury.

The scientists built a painstaking dictionary of these gestures—a full “ethogram,” or catalog, of species-specific behaviors—and then identified the distinct moves in feline bathroom habits: grooming, digging, sniffing litter. “We landed on 39 different behaviors that cats do in a litter box, with the understanding that depending on their satisfaction with the litter box, the environment and the dynamics around them, those behaviors will shift,” says Ragen McGowan, director of digital and AI product development at Purina and one of the authors of a paper published recently in Applied Animal Behaviour Science on the development of Purina's AI-powered litter box monitor. “We realized this ethogram could be a window into their health.”

Cats commonly suffer from diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, urinary tract infections and many more conditions. The researchers hoped to predict and stave off these ailments by training an artificial intelligence system on everything a cat can do in a litter box. They believed that AI could warn cat owners of feline health concerns long before the cats—ever stoic and aloof—showed signs.

But arriving at the 39 behavior types wasn't easy. The project began in 2018. The team gathered data from 191 cats—140 at a company research center in Missouri and 51 in private homes. The researchers placed scales with a sensor at each corner that could detect tiny changes in weight and movement under litter boxes. They then made video recordings of every bathroom visit so that artificial intelligence could correlate the visual data with the weight and movements that the sensors recorded. But for the AI to do that, the scientists first had to generate the ethogram.

Watching the videos, they labeled every nudge and movement, peering at ear angles, at the bunching or flaring of whiskers. If you've ever watched a cat rotate exactly three and a half times before committing to a square inch of litter, you begin to understand the research process—multiplied hundreds of thousands of times. “We took over 300,000 videos of cats eliminating in different scenarios—single cat, multicat, all different types of litter boxes,” McGowan says.

The team then paired those video labels with the weight and movement data so that the AI could distinguish a quick tinkle from a philosophical contemplation. “We would work closely with our behaviorists to discuss what they're looking at in the videos, and then we had to develop mathematical equations,” says Natalie Langenfeld-McCoy, manager of AI product development at Purina.

The analysis of these recordings would become the foundation for Purina's Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitor, which, released in 2022, is already in more than 10,000 homes. The product is designed to alert pet owners when the measurements match the known patterns for certain cat ailments, and the team regularly updates the software to improve accuracy. The new paper documents the scientific steps behind its creation.

The monitor slides beneath an existing litter box and can recognize each cat in the house, according to the study. “Not only can we use their weight as a way to tell them apart but also their patterns in the litter box, the time of day they go and their normal habits to create what we call a ‘paw print,' or signature, for that cat,” McGowan says.

The team intends for the tool to communicate problems cats are having or offer reassurance to owners when all is well. Feline kidney disease, for example, a progressive illness that often goes unnoticed in early stages, can be treated if caught early. “By the time most pet owners would notice a behavioral change, the loss of renal function will be over 80 percent, and there's no turning back,” McGowan says. According to Purina's website, although “information provided by Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitors is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease,” the monitors can alert owners to “key changes that may indicate a health issue requiring a veterinary diagnosis.”

Jessica Quimby, a small animal internal medicine specialist and professor at the Ohio State University, uses the Petivity monitor in her own research on feline kidney disease and recently published a paper showing clinically relevant results based on the monitor's measurements. (Quimby is a Nestlé Purina PetCare advisory board member.) “One of the very first things you might see with the onset of disease, even before we know the cat has kidney disease, is that they're losing weight and urinating more,” Quimby says. “We can see those trends appearing on the Petivity data.” Cats, she explains, are good at hiding health problems from their caregivers.

The smart litter box does, however, have its limitations. “If [cats] are close in weight and they have a similar pattern of elimination, that's a struggle for the system,” says Langenfeld-McCoy. She recommends that five or fewer cats use one system. But improvements in AI capabilities should help distinguish between similar cats soon. “The deep-learning models can pick out subtle differences in behavior that maybe we don't even know exist, so we're moving towards that for those cats that are close in weight,” she says.

Household antagonists—nudgy robot vacuums, percussive washing machines—can also cause confusion, so the team coached cat owners on placement during its research. But often when problems arise, the fix is less engineering than sociology. Langenfeld-McCoy recalls a home in which the AI indicated the cat had done its usual behavior but left nothing behind. “The family dog would come after the cat and have a snack, which was confusing the AI,” she says. With a baby gate installed, the AI recovered its composure. Sometimes the outlier in the data is a Labrador.

Although the Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitor has been on the market for three years, the team waited until it had ample data to publish its scientific findings. “Smart” is one of those labels that arouses suspicion—smart toasters send overanxious notifications; smart fridges upsell milk. So when we hear “smart litter box,” we picture an appliance with delusions of grandeur. The new study is a way for the team at Purina to pull back the curtain for users and skeptics alike and let cat owners determine whether “smart” gets to take off its quotation marks.

Bacteria Use Viral Naps to Build Immunity

New research shows how microbes use napping viruses to vaccinate themselves

The idea that a single-celled bacterium can defend itself against viruses in a similar way as the 1.8-trillion-cell human immune system is still “mind-blowing” for molecular biologist Joshua Modell of Johns Hopkins University.

Scientists discovered 20 years ago that bacteria use an adaptive defense system called CRISPR that allows microbes to recognize and destroy viral invaders on repeat encounters. In a recent study published in Cell Host & Microbe, Modell and his team have deepened our understanding of how bacteria use this system to “vaccinate” themselves against phages, the viruses that try to kill them. The findings could help the development of treatments to fight antimicrobial resistance, which contributes to millions of deaths annually.

The CRISPR system allows bacteria to edit their own genome. After being exposed to a virus, bacteria can use a special enzyme to insert small pieces of the virus's DNA, called spacers, into their genome, which helps them recognize and fight off the virus next time. Scientists now use this enzyme as a pair of “genetic scissors” to tweak DNA in everything from lab experiments to gene therapies, but researchers still knew little about how this process plays out in bacteria. “We called it the CRISPR mystery because we didn't really understand what was happening inside,” Modell says.

To understand how bacteria manage to grab the DNA of invading viruses, the researchers ran controlled lab experiments using Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria and the phages that infect it. During the infectious phase, most phages rupture the cell immediately, a process known as lysis. On rare occasions, they can instead hide inside the bacterial DNA and become dormant, a state called lysogeny. This state is notoriously difficult to study.

In the lab, Modell's team infected bacteria with phages that could go dormant as well as genetically engineered phages locked in an active state. The researchers then collected surviving cells and checked their genetic code to see if they had added new spacers taken from the viruses' DNA.

They found that bacteria only added spacers from phages that could go dormant. During this lull, Modell explains, the bacteria have time to grab tiny pieces of viral DNA and store them in their genome. “The CRISPR system makes memories against an inactivated form of the virus just like a vaccine,” Modell says. To confirm their results, Modell and his team exposed spacer-carrying bacteria to the same phages again to observe whether the new genetic memories protected them from infection. The researchers observed that the bacterium can recognize the phages using those stored fragments and fight them off.

The findings are “pretty remarkable,” says molecular biologist Stan Brouns of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. Understanding the interactions between phages and bacteria is key to improving phage therapies, an approach where scientists use viruses to treat infections caused by bacteria that have developed resistance to antibiotics.

This new understanding could also help researchers design phages that more types of infection-causing bacteria will be susceptible to, says North Carolina State University molecular biologist Rodolphe Barrangou, who co-founded Locus Biosciences, a biotech company that develops antibacterial products, and who also was not involved in the study. Various bacteria can have any of more than 150 antiphage defense mechanisms that treatments have to dodge; understanding how this one works is “going to inspire people who work on [bacteria] to think about phage therapies on a broader range of infectious diseases.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Thanks to the Earth's leisurely, 1,040-mile-per-hour spin, if two points are equidistant from our equator, they should get relatively equally warmed by solar radiation. But, of course, the reality isn't quite that simple. 

A new NASA-backed study—relying on data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite—suggests that the northern hemisphere (NH) is actually growing dimmer than the southern hemisphere (SH), and that could be a big problem as the world rushes to break the planet's climate-change-induced fever. 

A team of scientists—led by NASA's Norman Loeb from the Langley Research Center in Virginia—discovered that the northern hemisphere experiences a net loss of radiative energy compared to the southern hemisphere. This means that the “upper” half of the planet is darker in the sense that it absorbs more light, and thus reflects less light. (If you were to look at it from space, the northern hemisphere would look dimmer as a result of this lack of reflection). The results of the study were published in the journal PNAS.

This all affects the Earth's “radiation budget,” or the amount of light the planet absorbs and re-emits into space as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Typically, this imbalance is offset by the oceanic currents that transport energy from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere, but surface changes have tipped the balance so much that ocean currents haven't been making up the difference for the past two decades.

“The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes,” the authors wrote. “How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.”

One of the main drivers of this change is albedo, or the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. The most striking component is arctic sea ice, whose rapid decline is quickly replacing reflective surfaces (snow and ice) with more light-absorbing surfaces (land and sea water). This increases solar absorption, thereby raises surface temperatures, and is the main reason why the Earth's polar regions are warming four times faster than other parts of the world.

Another major source of reflectivity is clouds, and recent studies have found that clouds—particularly low-lying ones—have decreased in recent decades. Adding insult to injury, this could be in part because the northern hemisphere is polluting less than it used to. Aerosols (the tiny particles that make various forms of air pollution) can act as seeds for cloud formation, and fewer seeds means fewer clouds. 

In 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) detailed how reduced emissions from transoceanic shipping could actually be accelerating climate change because of a sharp reduction of reflective clouds known as “ship tracks.” Of course, more pollution isn't the answer, as these gasses still trap heat on the planet, but the finding has led some scientists to consider experimenting with geoengineering techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection or marine cloud brightening. 

In the case of the diverging radiation budgets between the two hemispheres, while the northern hemisphere's environmental laws have lead to some progress in cutting back on pollution, the southern hemisphere has experienced extreme bouts of aerosol injection from numerous sources—from Australian brush fires to the eruptions of the Hunga Tonga volcano in 2021 and 2022, according to Phys.org. 

While the distance between these radiation budgets slowly grows (by about 0.34 watts per square meter per decade), the differences will be enough to significantly impact climate models and skew our view of the planet's future. Hopefully, with time and ample innovation, we'll find a way to get these radiation budgets back on track.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Finally Corrected a Fatal Flaw in an Unlimited Power Source. An Energy Revolution is Coming.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a68886703/pec-flow-cell-solar-power/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

The researchers exploited a weakness in current energy technology to create more electricity.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

It sounds counterintuitive, but there is such a thing as too much sun for solar panels. According to the World Economic Forum, when things really heat up—like during a heat wave—solar panel power output drops by 10 to 25 percent.

This is a longtime problem, and it might be one that's preventing greater adoption of solar panels, which emerged as a viable energy source for Americans in the 1970s. As global energy requirements continue to rise and much of the world moves away from fossil fuels, efficiency has become a vital factor in sustainable energy generation. It could be especially important as heat waves become more common due to climate change.

Now, scientists in the UK might have a fix that takes advantage of excess thermal energy, turning it into chemical energy that can then provide the missing power.

Each traditional photovoltaic cell within a solar panel array has a silicon semiconductor layer specially designed to absorb the sun's photons, or particles of light, and convert it into electricity. The photons transfer their energy to electrons in the semiconducting material, causing them to move. This motion creates an electric current in the cell. 

Such solar panels have a typical operating temperature range between 60 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can absorb too much heat, thanks to their superior sun-absorbing properties. Panels get as hot as 150 degrees Fahrenheit, even when it's only 85 degrees outside. That's when electrons within the circuit of each photovoltaic cell begin bouncing around. As a result of this instability, the voltage drops, lowering the efficiency.

The new research looks beyond photovoltaics and relies instead on silicon-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) flow cells. In particular, they are paired with a storage system whose efficiency actually rises with temperature. This positive result is described in an August issue of The Journal of Chemical Physics.

The system is similar to traditional solar panel technology, but it has a key difference: a chemical reaction takes place at the cell's surface, driving its electricity transfer, study co-author Dowon Bae, PhD, of Loughborough University said in an email. “Depending on the type of chemicals in the electrolyte [which stores and carries electrical charge], we can convert the electricity into other chemicals or store it in the form of chemical energy in the electrolyte,” he said. 

PEC flow cells operate primarily through a two-step process. First, light absorption by the photodevice generates electricity. Then, this drives a chemical reaction located at an interface between the PEC cell itself and the electrolyte. 

“What we've experimentally found in our recent work is that a certain amount of heat can promote the chemical conversion reaction, compensating the loss in voltage,” Bae said in an e-mail. “Simply put, there is a temperature range where heat can be used efficiently without overheating.”

The sweet spot for this increased energy conversion is at around 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Beyond that point, rising temperatures will cause PECs to reduce their effectiveness, too. Although this threshold can change based on the materials used, Bae says that as it gets hotter, more material adheres to the surface of the cells, and at a certain point, it's too much. 

Though PEC flow cells promise to drink up more sunlight than traditional solar panel technology, they do have to overcome their own Achilles' heel: they require what Bae calls a “toll-fee” payment to kickstart the necessary chemical reactions. This “overpotential” lowers the cells' overall efficiency. The cells are also particularly susceptible to corrosion compared to run-of-the-mill solar panels. 

So, at this time, the PEC flow cell isn't quite as robust as it needs to be. While these limitations have kept the technology from widespread adoption, some industries do use it for other applications, particularly in green hydrogen production or carbon capture.

Standard photovoltaics may remain the foundational engine of the green energy revolution, but Bae is still confident that PEC flow cells offer myriad benefits. They can be quite beneficial for situations requiring independence from the main electrical grid, because they're particularly adept at energy storage. They're also simpler, since they don't require wiring, or any other kinds of traditional electrical connections. In fact, some researchers refer to the PEC cell as an “artificial leaf.”

Bae is very skeptical of using PEC technology for hydrogen generation or carbon dioxide-reduction, because of the current efficiency and corrosion issues. However, he notes that redox batteries, which rely on an oxidation-reduction (redox) chemical reaction to produce electricity, could be a better option for PECs. “Unlike other chemical conversion processes, redox batteries require low overpotential and do not require any gas or product filtering processes,” he says.These kinds of creative solutions will become necessary in the near future, he says. The cost of photovoltaic electricity has fallen by 85 percent since 2010, and enabling solar panels to soak up more of the sun's power could further reduce the cost, making solar panel technology more universally appealing. 

Though solar engineers have treated heat as an enemy to be circumvented for decades, this new work showcases that, ironically, even heat waves could power the green energy revolution.

Surprise!

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A mapping expedition in the Tlayócoc cave in Mexico led a professional cave explorer to a hidden chamber containing shocking evidence of an extinct civilization.

Yekaterina Katiya Pavlova ventured to a community in the Sierra de Guerrero to further map the Tlayócoc cave. When Pavlova and local guide Adrián Beltrán Dimas reached the bottom of the cave, having already explored all that was mapped, they opted to head into an unknown passage through a submerged entrance. The effort paid off.

The passage led to a previously unseen room in which two engraved shell bracelets sat atop stalagmites, likely as an offering, according to a translated statement from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). 

The explorers also found another bracelet, a giant snail shell, and pieces of black stone discs similar to pyrite mirrors—all of it dated to more than 500 years ago. 

Archaeologists then descended on the cave, uncovering 14 total objects—three shell bracelets, a bracelet fragment, the giant snail shell, a piece of burnt wood, and pieces of eight stone discs (two of which were complete). Each of the bracelets were made from snail shells—likely a marine species—and were engraved with anthropomorphic symbols and figures.

The bracelets feature S-shaped symbols known as xonecuilli, zigzagging lines,a and circles to create human faces in profile. These designs could be meant to signify deities. 

The archaeologista estimate that the items were left in the cave during the Postclassic period between 950 and 1521 A.D.—a time when the area was known to be populated by the now-extinct Tlacotepehaus ethnic group. 

“This finding is of great relevance, since, with the study of the contextual relationship of the pieces of the cave, we can interpret symbolic notions, cultural aspects, manufacturing, and even trade,” Miguel Perez, INAH archaeologist, said in a statement, “to characterize the pre-Hispanic societies settled in the Sierra de Guerrero.”

The archaeologists determined that the stalagmites were manipulated in pre-Hispanic times to give them a more spherical finish, likely to better fit with ritual needs. 

“Possibly the symbols and representations of characters on the bracelets are related to pre-Hispanic cosmogony regarding creation and fertility,” Cuauhtemoc Reyes Alvarez, INAH archaeologist, said in a statement. He added that the sealed context allows experts to understand how the ancient inhabitants may have conceived of these caves—as portals to the underworld, or as sacred spaces connected to the Earth and the divine.

The black stone discs resemble others from nearby archaeological regions, such as El Infiernillo, along with ones from distant cultures like Huasteca. 

Historical reports say extreme cold forced people groups living in the Sierra de Guerrero (located over 7,850 feet above sea level and filled by dense pine and oak forests) to lower altitudes. Little is known about the Tlacotepheuas, other than 16th century historical mentions of their presence. The snail-shell bracelets could help tell their story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Unearthed an Ancient Obelisk—and Found a Stunning Face Staring Back","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a68887023/ancient-obelisk-stunning-face/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Discovered in modern-day Turkey at the Karahantepe site, it could be the first-ever carved depiction of a human face.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The T-shaped obelisks famous at Karahantepe just took on an entirely abstract—and remarkably human—visage. Excavations at the early Neolithic site uncovered an obelisk with a human face on it, the first ever found with such a carving and what could be one of the earliest examples of symbolic expression from the Neolithic period roughly 12,000 years ago. 

“In the excavations carried out within the scope of our Stone Hills Project, a T-shaped obelisk with a human face was brought to light for the first time,” Nuri Ersov, Turkish minister of culture and tourism, said in a translated statement. “This work, located in Karahantepe, sheds light on human history as the first example of the Neolithic age man in which he embraced himself in a T-shaped column.”

Karahantepe is one of the limestone heights within the Tek Tek Mountains National Park outside the Turkish city of Sanliurfa. The limestone there provided the raw material for the T-shaped pillars at Karahantepe (a Neolithic settlement discovered in 1997) and other contemporary sites.

The new find was discovered as part of the Stone Hills Project, an endeavor designed to explore southeast Anatolia and provide fresh insights into the earliest known periods of human history. The aforementioned obelisk's facial representation appears at the top of the pillar, and is similar in style to the human statues found in Karahantepe, featuring sharp lines, deep eye sockets, and blunt noses. These human statues are dated to about 11,000 years ago. 

The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that the discovery shows the technical mastery of Neolithic craftsmen, but also highlights the self-expression and abstract thinking occurring at the time.

Previously, the site had revealed T-shaped obelisks thought to symbolize people, but finding one with facial features for the first time strengthens the theory that the pieces were used for far more than architecture. Rather, they offer a potential first look at human abstract art. “The obelisks, which were previously thought to represent humans, deepened their meaning with this discovery,” Ersoy said. 

Other discoveries at the site have, over the years, shaped our understanding of Karahantepe's significance. A human sculpture was found at the site in 2023, which featured a man with a facial expression, a full body, and his arms reaching to hold his phallus. The site has also yielded statues of a gazelle, a rabbit, birds, and other animals, and could potentially represent a move toward a less nomadic lifestyle, as indicated by the discoveries of monuments and carvings amidst residential artifacts.

But those finds are all dated to about 11,000 years ago—not as old as this T-shaped obelisk with its striking facial features. Now, with the discovery of one of the earliest examples of symbolic expression from the pre-pottery Neolithic period (dated to around 10,000 B.C.E.), experts surmise that Karahantepe could be one of the first cult centers showing man trying to understand his place in nature.

Researchers at Skoltech have developed a mathematical model that explores how memory functions. When they analyzed this model, they discovered intriguing results that could help improve robotic systems, artificial intelligence, and our understanding of how the human mind stores information. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, suggest there might be an ideal number of senses—and if that's true, our five senses might not be enough!

""Our conclusion is of course highly speculative in application to human senses, although you never know: It could be that humans of the future would evolve a sense of radiation or magnetic field. But in any case, our findings may be of practical importance for robotics and the theory of artificial intelligence,"" said study co-author Professor Nikolay Brilliantov of Skoltech AI. ""It appears that when each concept retained in memory is characterized in terms of seven features—as opposed to, say, five or eight—the number of distinct objects held in memory is maximized.""

Following a research tradition that began in the early 20th century, the team focused on modeling the basic units of memory known as “engrams.” An engram can be thought of as a sparse collection of neurons in different brain regions that fire together. Each engram represents a concept, described through a set of features. For humans, these features correspond to sensory experiences—for example, the concept of a banana includes its appearance, smell, taste, and other sensory qualities. In this framework, the banana becomes a five-dimensional object within a mental space containing all the other memories stored in the brain.

Engrams evolve over time, becoming sharper or more diffuse depending on how often they are triggered by sensory input from the outside world. This process represents how we learn and forget as we interact with our environment.

""We have mathematically demonstrated that the engrams in the conceptual space tend to evolve toward a steady state, which means that after some transient period, a 'mature' distribution of engrams emerges, which then persists in time,"" Brilliantov commented. ""As we consider the ultimate capacity of a conceptual space of a given number of dimensions, we somewhat surprisingly find that the number of distinct engrams stored in memory in the steady state is the greatest for a concept space of seven dimensions. Hence the seven senses claim.""

In other words, let the objects that exist out there in the world be described by a finite number of features corresponding to the dimensions of some conceptual space. Suppose that we want to maximize the capacity of the conceptual space expressed as the number of distinct concepts associated with these objects. The greater the capacity of the conceptual space, the deeper the overall understanding of the world. It turns out that the maximum is attained when the dimension of the conceptual space is seven. From this the researchers conclude that seven is the optimal number of senses.

According to the researchers, this number does not depend on the details of the model -- the properties of the conceptual space and the stimuli providing the sense impressions. The number seven appears to be a robust and persistent feature of memory engrams as such. One caveat is that multiple engrams of differing sizes existing around a common center are deemed to represent similar concepts and are therefore treated as one when calculating memory capacity.

The memory of humans and other living beings is an enigmatic phenomenon tied to the property of consciousness, among other things. Advancing the theoretical models of memory will be instrumental to gaining new insights into the human mind and recreating humanlike memory in AI agents.

A new study published in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry by Oxford University Press reports that many tree swallow populations across the United States are living in areas with high levels of exposure to “forever” chemicals. Surprisingly, the researchers found that this exposure did not appear to harm the birds' reproductive health.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as “forever chemicals,” are synthetic materials that have become a global environmental concern. These compounds enter ecosystems through industrial discharges, firefighting training sites, and wastewater treatment facilities. Such facilities can release residues from everyday consumer products that use these chemicals, including nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, and water-repellent coatings.

Because of their strong chemical bonds, these substances do not easily degrade in the environment. They have been detected in soil, water, plants, animals, and even humans on every continent. Although previous studies have linked forever chemicals to serious human health issues, such as certain cancers and reproductive disorders, their broader ecological impacts remain uncertain. Most existing research comes from laboratory experiments on captive animals, while much less is known about how wild species are affected. Field studies that could answer these questions are uncommon because they require extensive time and funding.

In this investigation, scientists measured concentrations of these chemicals in the tissues and diet of tree swallows, a migratory bird found throughout North America. They also examined whether exposure influenced breeding success.

The research included fieldwork at multiple military installations and other locations with differing contamination histories. Sampling sites included Willow Grove, Pennsylvania; Lakehurst, New Jersey; Camp Springs, Maryland; Chesapeake Beach, Maryland; Laurel, Maryland; Ashumet Pond, Massachusetts; Lake Elmo, Minnesota; Grey Cloud Island, Minnesota; Gibson City, Illinois; and Scanlon, Minnesota.

The researchers found much higher concentrations of forever chemicals at sites treated with firefighting foams, as well as those closer to urban areas. Researchers noted the high concentration of forever chemical perfluorohexane sulfonate at a site whose sources include residual from the manufacturing plant near Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and associated waste disposal sites, but also from other numerous other household and industrial sources originating in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area.

The investigators found that despite differences in exposure levels to these chemicals, there was no statistically significant association between chemical exposure and reproductive outcomes such as whether birds hatched or grew to the point where they could take flight. The health of the bird chicks appeared unaffected by levels of chemical exposure.

Although Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere, it still experiences powerful winds that play a major role in shaping the planet's climate and in distributing its ever-present dust. These winds stir up dust into swirling columns called dust devils—rotating plumes of air and fine particles that sweep across the Martian surface. While the winds themselves are invisible, the dust devils they lift can be seen clearly in spacecraft images. Because they trace the flow of moving air, scientists use them as natural markers to study wind behavior that would otherwise remain unseen.A new study led by Dr. Valentin Bickel from the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern reveals that both dust devils and the winds driving them are much faster than scientists previously believed. These stronger winds may be responsible for much of the dust lofted into the Martian atmosphere, which has a major impact on the planet's weather and long-term climate. The research, conducted in collaboration with the University of Bern's Department of Space Research and Planetology, the Open University in the UK, and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), was recently published in Science Advances.

Movement of dust devils studied with the help of deep learning

""Using a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, we were able to identify dust devils in over 50,000 satellite images,"" explains first author Valentin Bickel. The team used images from the Bern-based Mars camera CaSSIS (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System) and the stereo camera HRSC (High Resolution Stereo Camera). CaSSIS is on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, while the HRSC camera is on board the ESA orbiter Mars Express. ""Our study is therefore based exclusively on data from European Mars exploration,"" Bickel continues.

Next, the team studied stereo images of about 300 of these dust devils to determine their movement and speed. Co-author Nicolas Thomas, who led the development of the CaSSIS camera system at the University of Bern and whose work is funded by SERI's Swiss Space Office through ESA's PRODEX program, explains: ""Stereo images are images of the same spot on the surface of Mars, but taken a few seconds apart. These images can therefore be used to measure the movement of dust devils.""

Bickel emphasizes: ""If you put the stereo images together in a sequence, you can observe how dynamically the dust devils move across the surface."" (see the images on the website of the University of Bern)

Winds on Mars stronger than previously assumed

The results show that the dust devils and the winds surrounding them on Mars can reach speeds of up to 44 m/s, i.e. around 160 km/h, across the entire planet, which is much faster than previously assumed (previous measurements on the surface had shown that winds mostly remain below 50 km/h and - in rare cases - can reach a maximum of 100 km/h).

The high wind speed in turn influences the dust cycle on the Red Planet: ""These strong, straight-line winds are very likely to bring a considerable amount of dust into the Martian atmosphere - much more than previously assumed,"" says Bickel. He continues: ""Our data show where and when the winds on Mars seem to be strong enough to lift dust from the surface. This is the first time that such findings are available on a global scale for a period of around two decades.""

Future Mars missions can benefit from the research results

The results obtained are also particularly important for future Mars missions. ""A better understanding of the wind conditions on Mars is crucial for the planning and execution of future landed missions,"" explains Daniela Tirsch from the Institute of Space Research at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and co-author of the study. ""With the help of the new findings on wind dynamics, we can model the Martian atmosphere and the associated surface processes more precisely,"" Tirsch continues. These models are essential to better assess risks for future missions and adapt technical systems accordingly. The new study thus provides important findings for a number of research areas on Mars, such as research into the formation of dunes and slope streaks, as well as the creation of weather and climate models of Mars.

The researchers plan to further intensify the observations of dust devils and supplement the data obtained with targeted and coordinated observations of dust devils using CaSSIS and HRSC. ""In the long term, our research should help to make the planning of Mars missions more efficient,"" concludes Bickel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New pill could finally control stubborn high blood pressure","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251008030947.htm","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 03:03:43 GMT","

Research Highlights:

Adding the novel medication baxdrostat to standard care may help manage high blood pressure and delay the progression of kidney disease in people with chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled high blood pressure , according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. This study was simultaneously published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

Chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure are closely linked and, when not managed appropriately, can lead to serious outcomes such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure and progression to kidney failure. Aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, can play a role in both high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease. Aldosterone causes sodium to be retained, which increases water retention and blood pressure. Over time, an excess of the hormone can lead to stiffening and thickening of blood vessels, which can contribute to heart damage and cause scarring in the kidneys, thereby playing a role in both high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease.

""These findings are encouraging for people living with chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure, two conditions that often go hand-in-hand and create a dangerous cycle,"" said lead study author Jamie P. Dwyer, M.D., a professor of medicine in the division of nephrology and hypertension at University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City. ""High blood pressure can worsen kidney function and declining kidney function can further elevate blood pressure, and these outcomes can be life-altering for patients.""

The study was designed to find whether adding baxdrostat to standard care is safe and could help lower blood pressure in people who have both chronic kidney disease (serious enough that they are likely to develop kidney failure or require a transplant during their lifetime) and uncontrolled high blood pressure. Their blood pressure has remained high despite already taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), two medications that work on a group of hormones that act together to regulate blood pressure.

At the beginning of the study, participants had an average systolic (top number) blood pressure of 151 mm Hg despite treatment and evidence of kidney disease on laboratory testing. When the protein albumin was measured in the urine, the average level for participants was 714 mg/gm of creatinine; levels of 30 or higher may be a sign of chronic kidney disease. When a blood sample was used to measure the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, a key indicator of kidney function), the average level was 44mL/min/1.73. Levels that are persistently less than 60 suggest chronic kidney disease.

Of 195 initial study participants, 192 were randomized to begin treatment with low-dose (0.5 mg-1 mg) or high-dose baxdrostat (2 mg-4 mg) or a placebo in addition to standard care. Three people finished the study early due to adverse events, their own decision to leave the study or for other reasons.

After 26 weeks:

In an exploratory analysis, the researchers looked at the amount of albumin lost in the urine, a type of protein that when found in the urine in high amounts is a predictor of cardiovascular and kidney disease. They found the urine albumin level was 55% lower in those taking baxdrostat than in those taking a placebo, comparable to the reduction seen with medications that delay the progression of kidney disease.

""The reduction in urine albumin gives us hope that baxdrostat may also help delay kidney damage. This potential is now being tested in two large Phase 3 trials to determine if baxdrostat delays the progression of kidney disease,"" said Dwyer.

""These new findings are reassuring that this new class of antihypertensive medications are likely to have both kidney- and cardio-protective benefits and to be safe and effective for broad patient populations,"" said Jordana B. Cohen, M.D., M.S.C.E., immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Hypertension and Kidney Cardiovascular Science Committee. ""Patients with chronic kidney disease were historically often excluded from drug studies. It is particularly reassuring to know that patients with chronic kidney disease, who have very high rates of hypertension and elevated renin-angiotensin aldosterone activity, were represented in their own study, tolerated the medication well, and had both blood pressure and albuminuric benefits. This medication class could be a game changer in the management of hypertension in this patient group."" Cohen, who was not involved in this study, is deputy director and associate professor of medicine and epidemiology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden “backup heater” that helps burn fat and boost metabolism","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033247.htm","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 16:04:35 GMT","

Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have uncovered a new way that brown fat, a type of fat that burns energy, can boost the body's metabolism. This process allows cells to consume more fuel and generate heat, improving overall metabolic health. Conducted in mice, the research points to new possibilities for using brown fat to address metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity.

The findings were published Sept. 17 in Nature.

Brown fat is unique because it turns energy (calories) from food into heat. Unlike white fat, which stores energy, or muscle, which uses it immediately, brown fat helps keep the body warm in cold environments. Exposure to cold can increase the amount of brown fat, and scientists have long suggested that activating it could support weight loss by increasing calorie burning.

""The pathway we've identified could provide opportunities to target the energy expenditure side of the weight loss equation, potentially making it easier for the body to burn more energy by helping brown fat produce more heat,"" said senior author Irfan Lodhi, PhD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research at WashU Medicine. ""Boosting this kind of metabolic process could support weight loss or weight control in a way that is perhaps easier to maintain over time than traditional dieting and exercise. It's a process that basically wastes energy -- increasing resting energy expenditure -- but that's a good thing if you're trying to lose weight.""

A back-up heater in brown fat

Until now, scientists understood brown fat's heat production mainly through mitochondria, the energy centers of cells. Mitochondria in brown fat can shift from making fuel to generating heat through a molecule called uncoupling protein 1. However, studies have shown that mice lacking this protein can still burn energy and produce heat, suggesting another system at work.The new research identifies peroxisomes, small structures within cells that process fats, as an alternative heat source in brown fat. When exposed to cold, these peroxisomes multiply. This effect was even stronger in mice whose mitochondria lacked uncoupling protein 1, suggesting that peroxisomes can step in when mitochondria lose their ability to produce heat.Lodhi and his team discovered that peroxisomes burn fuel and release heat through a process involving a protein called acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Mice that lacked ACOX2 in their brown fat were less able to tolerate cold, showed lower body temperatures after exposure to cold, and had poorer insulin sensitivity. When fed high-fat diets, they also gained more weight than typical mice.

In contrast, mice genetically engineered to make unusually high amounts of ACOX2 in brown fat showed increased heat production, better cold tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and weight control when fed the same high-fat diet.

Using a fluorescent heat sensor they developed, the researchers found that when ACOX2 metabolized certain fatty acids, brown fat cells got hotter. They also used an infrared thermal imaging camera to show that mice lacking ACOX2 produced less heat in their brown fat.

While human bodies can manufacture these fatty acids, the molecules also are found in dairy products and human breast milk and are made by certain gut microbes. Lodhi said this raises the possibility that a dietary intervention based on these fatty acids -- such as a food, probiotic or ""nutraceutical"" intervention -- could boost this heat-production pathway and the beneficial effects it appears to have. He and his colleagues also are investigating possible drug compounds that could activate ACOX2 directly.

""While our studies are in mice, there is evidence to suggest this pathway is relevant in people,"" Lodhi said. ""Prior studies have found that individuals with higher levels of these fatty acids tend to have lower body mass indices. But since correlation is not causation, our long-term goal is to test whether dietary or other therapeutic interventions that increase levels of these fatty acids or that increase activity of ACOX2 could be helpful in dialing up this heat production pathway in peroxisomes and helping people lose weight and improve their metabolic health.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Glowing shark and hidden crab found deep off Australia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251008030943.htm","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:56:15 GMT","

Researchers have described a new species of deep-sea lanternshark and crab, both with the help of specimens collected from a CSIRO-led 2022 voyage of CSIRO research vessel (RV) Investigator. Called the West Australian Lanternshark and a porcelain crab, the new species were described by separate research teams in papers published during September 2025.

Meet the West Australian Lanternshark Etmopterus westraliensis

Dr Will White, an ichthyologist from the CSIRO Australian National Fish Collection, was involved in describing the new shark species.

""Lanternsharks are an amazing group of sharks, and this new species was found at depths to 610 meters during biodiversity surveys for Parks Australia in the Gascoyne Marine Park area off Western Australia,"" Dr White said.

The West Australian Lanternshark is relatively small, with the largest specimen measuring just 407 millimeters long. Its large eyes are adapted for the dark depths of the ocean, and its slim body is equipped with two small dorsal (topside) fins, each featuring a sharp spine. Among the shark's most extraordinary features is its ability to glow.

""Lanternsharks are bioluminescent, with light produced by photophores located on their belly and flanks, which is where their common name comes from,"" Dr White said.

The species name E. westraliensis honors Western Australia, the region where it was discovered. It is the third shark species identified from specimens collected during the same 2022 voyage, following the Painted Hornshark and Ridged-egg Catshark, both revealed in 2023.

Meet the new porcelain crab Porcellanella brevidentata

Dr. Andrew Hosie, Curator of Aquatic Zoology at the Western Australian Museum, participated in describing this newly identified crab species.

""The new species of porcelain crab lives a symbiotic life with sea pens, which are a group of soft corals related to sea fans, where they will hide among the 'leaves' of the host,"" Dr Hosie said.

The crab is small, being around 15 millimeters in length, and is opalescent white-yellow in color. This makes it well-adapted to hide within the white leaves of its sea pen host. The new crab was found during surveys along the Ningaloo coast at depths to 122 meters.

""Porcelain crabs are known as filter feeders, feeding on plankton by using modified mouthparts with long hairs to sweep the water for small pieces of food such as plankton, rather than the typical crab method of grabbing and pinching food with their claws,"" Dr Hosie said.

Additional specimens used to identify and describe the new species of porcelain crab were collected during another CSIRO-led RV Investigator voyage in 2017.

A bounty of new life

Nearly 20 new species have now been described with the help of specimens collected on the 2022 voyage, including the Carnarvon Flapjack Octopus announced earlier in 2025. Incredibly, researchers estimate that there are potentially up to 600 new species still waiting to be described from the voyage.

The deep-sea is still largely unexplored and biodiversity surveys of these habitats are vital to increase our understanding of the incredible marine life that dwells in the depths of our oceans.

Researchers expect to discover more species new to science during an upcoming CSIRO-led voyage on RV Investigator to survey the deep-sea biodiversity of the Coral Sea Marine Park for Parks Australia. The voyage brings together many of the same researchers from the 2022 voyage, along with new collaborators and partners, to again turn wonder into discovery.

RV Investigator is part of the Marine National Facility, national collaborative research infrastructure funded by the Australian Government and operated by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, on behalf of the nation.

Chemists Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the world's most porous solid materials, known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Structured like molecular scaffolding, MOFs contain vast caverns of internal space; Nobel committee chair Heiner Linke likens them to “Hermione's handbag in Harry Potter — it can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume”. In the 30 years since they were first developed, they have become part of efforts to capture carbon from the air and remove ‘forever chemicals' from water, among many other applications.

Male mice that exercise regularly can pass on their fitness to their male offspring. Researchers found that well-exercised male mice had higher levels of 10 types of microRNA in their sperm compared to mice that hadn't exercised. These microRNAs influenced the metabolism and muscle function of an embryo during development, which resulted in male offspring that could run for longer on a treadmill than those who'd come from more sedentary fathers. A similar mechanism could be at play in humans — the team also found high levels of similar microRNAs in the sperm of men who exercise regularly.

Most carbon offsets, which allow polluters to meet their emissions reductions targets by financing climate projects elsewhere, have “intractable” problems and are too easy to game, says a new review. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed,” says environmental governance and development researcher Stephen Lezak, who co-authored the review. Despite a few redeemable efforts, such as subsidizing cleaner cookstoves, the authors call for the phasing out of most carbon credits except those generated by permanent carbon dioxide removal.

Large language models (LLMs) don't have intentions or understanding, but they can scheme and lie. For example, tests have shown that various popular models would engage in blackmail, corporate espionage, and even actions that could lead to death in highly contrived scenarios. In a separate test, a model that was told it had control over a robot attempted to disable its ethics module, make copies of itself, alter logs, act dumb, break out of the lab, and hack a car's computer. Researchers suggest part of the cause might be the fact that LLMs are trained on so many computer-betrayal stories — think Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey — and that papers describing LLM scheming could actually make the problem worse.

The code behind a study should be preserved and published to support its findings. But software — especially open source — is rarely static, and so it should also be available to build on and refine over time. To reconcile these two ideas, a group of 10 researchers and engineers outline recommendations on how software can be better handled, shared and maintained. Their suggestions include training all PhD students in code-sharing best practice, software archives hosted and supported by publishers and dedicated funding for the development and preservation of software.

Differences in RNA expression in muscle cells could explain why some people with cancer develop a wasting syndrome called cachexia and others don't. Muscle cells of people with cachexia have reduced mass and size. Researchers found that the RNAs present in these cells boosted the production of inflammatory proteins, enzymes that degrade the cell's surrounding matrix and the blood-clotting protein prothrombin. This activity was influenced by regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, that weren't present in people who didn't have cachexia. (Nature News & Views | 7 min read)

Organelles are the internal batteries, gears, actuators, 3D printers and transmitters that drive cell function. Their composition and activity vary between cell types depending on functional demands. In T cells, which are key mediators of immunosurveillance and tumour eradication, organelles are relatively few and function at basal levels when cells are at rest. However, upon activation, they increase in number and size and undergo extensive remodelling to support rapid proliferation, effector differentiation and adaptation to diverse microenvironments, including the tumour microenvironment, thereby enabling efficient clearance of target cells. In this Review, we provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of how various organelles contribute to T cell-mediated antitumour immunity. We also discuss emerging strategies to modulate organelle functions — from organelle-targeted therapies and their use as cargo delivery systems to the transfer or transplantation of native or synthetic organelles — that have the potential to enhance cancer immunotherapies involving immune-checkpoint blockade or the adoptive transfer of T cells.

A cellular process by which cells break down and recycle their proteins and organelles to maintain intracellular homeostasis. The specific removal of mitochondria through autophagy is known as mitophagy.

(CAR). A synthetic surface receptor that typically consists of three key components: an extracellular antigen-recognition domain derived from a single-chain antibody variable fragment; an intracellular co-stimulatory domain (for example, CD28 or 4-1BB); and a CD3ζ cytoplasmic signalling domain for cell activation.

A genome-wide screening approach using the CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing system in combination with libraries of guide RNAs to delete or activate large numbers of genomic loci. Cells can be selected based on phenotype, and the corresponding guide RNA that is integrated into the genome can be identified by sequencing.

Modifications that alter gene expression and phenotype without affecting the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation and modifications to histones such as methylation, acetylation or lactylation.

The presence of at least two versions of mitochondrial genomes within one cell. Different genomes may carry mutations, and microheteroplasmy (<5% mutations) is common in eukaryotic cells.

Complete identity of all copies of the mitochondrial (or plastid) genome within one cell. Some tumour cells carry homoplasmically mutated mitochondrial genomes.

The interface between an immune cell and a target cell (for example, a cancer cell) or an antigen-presenting cell (for example, a dendritic cell, macrophage or B cell).

(mTORC1). A multi-protein complex formed by the interaction of mTOR with DEPTOR, RPTOR, AKT1S1 and MLST8. mTORC1 is a crucial nutrient, energy and redox sensor within the cell. It regulates protein synthesis, cellular growth and metabolism by integrating signals from environmental cues such as nutrient availability and cellular energy levels.

A transgenic mouse model system that enables tracking of mitochondria originating from the mother cell through the permanent fluorescent labelling of a SnapSubstrate that is specifically targeted to mitochondria by SYNJ2BP. Sequential labelling of SnapTag-expressing cells with different fluorescently labelled SnapSubstrates allows for the identification and sorting of distinct cell populations based on patterns of organelle inheritance.

A polysome, or polyribosome, is a complex formed when multiple ribosomes simultaneously translate a single mRNA molecule. This arrangement allows for efficient, high-throughput protein synthesis.

Minimally differentiated T cells that share characteristics with stem cells, including self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate into various functional T cell subsets. These cells can emerge following acute infections, where they are known as stem cell memory T cells, or in response to chronic inflammation and cancer, where they are referred to as precursor exhausted T cells.

Engineered, Notch-based receptors activated by synthetic, bio-orthogonal or natural soluble ligands. Receptor activation depends on endocytosis and endosome acidification to elicit a cellular response.

A dysfunctional T cell state caused by chronic infection or cancer that is marked by reduced proliferation, impaired effector function, increased expression of inhibitory receptors, and distinct transcriptional and epigenetic changes.

A tetracycline-inducible bacteria-derived gene expression system. It consists of a reverse tetracycline transactivator that, in the drug (tetracycline)-bound state, binds to a tetracycline response element to induce expression of the downstream gene.

(TILs). The heterogeneous population of lymphocytes found in a tumour. Their relative abundance, differentiation and functions depend on type, stage and location of the cancer. T cells isolated from TILs can be activated and expanded to large numbers ex vivo before re-infusion into patients with cancer for therapeutic purposes.

(TME). Tissue at the tumour site, consisting of cancer cells, blood vessels, immune cells and surrounding stromal cells, that, depending on the type of cancer, is often immunosuppressive and has physicochemical properties of hypoxia and low pH.

(UPR). An endoplasmic reticulum stress response triggered by the misfolding of proteins inside the cell. The response can initiate repair mechanisms to correct misfolding such as upregulating chaperones, reducing overall protein synthesis to alleviate the burden, and promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins. If these repair mechanisms fail to resolve the stress, the UPR triggers cell apoptosis.

A professor at Rutgers University who wrote a book about “antifa” almost a decade ago is trying—and struggling—to flee the US for Europe after a weeks-long online campaign against him by far-right influencers was followed by death threats.

Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers who specializes in Spanish history and radicalism, has been a far-right target ever since he published Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook in 2017. But after president Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to designate antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization,” social media posts from far-right figures and a petition promoted by conservative student activists demonized Bray as an “antifa member” who was “supporting terrorist behavior."" Dozens of targeted threats followed.

The threats, emailed from anonymous accounts and reviewed by WIRED, included a message that read: “I'll kill you in front of your students.” Another message, with the subject line “your violent rhetoric is under investigation,” listed Bray's home address where he lives with his wife and two young children.

“We made the decision on Saturday [to leave the US] when our home address became known by people who want to do us harm,” says Bray. The professor informed his students on Sunday that he would be moving to Europe as a result of the threats.

But at the airport, after they had already scanned their passports, received boarding passes, checked in their bags, and cleared security, Bray says he and his family were not allowed to board their flight. Upon arrival at their boarding gate, their reservations had suddenly disappeared from the United Airlines system.

""For 20 minutes [United Airlines] couldn't even figure out what had happened,” says Bray. “Then they said that, basically, somehow someone had canceled our reservation, presumably in between checking through and then. I don't know what happened. There are various potential explanations, but I don't think it was a coincidence that it happened to us on that day.”

Bray says that he has been rebooked on flights to Spain. “We're going to try it one more time,” says Bray. “If it doesn't work, then we'll do something else.”

United Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House did not comment and redirected WIRED to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. “We got this from the White House and are trying to get ground truth but are not tracking anything like this from TSA or CBP,” says Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS.

After publishing Antifa, Bray donated half of the profits from the book to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund, a group which supports antifascist activists around the world. He was soon placed on the so-called Professor Watchlist by Turning Point USA (TPUSA), the conservative activist group cofounded by Charlie Kirk. The list, which showcases academics that TPUSA claims are pushing leftist propaganda, has been criticized as a threat to academic freedom.

Antifa is viewed by the Trump administration and many on the right as a dangerous network of violent left-wing activist groups intent on destroying US conservative values. In reality, antifa is not an organization at all, but a broad ideology embraced by antifascist activists around the world.

At the time his book was published, Bray says he did receive some death threats. But it soon blew over: “The difference was that I was renting so no one found my home address, and so it just didn't reach this fever pitch,” says Bray. “But also now I have a family and so that's relevant as well.”

Bray received attention in 2020, as well, when some conservative commentators blamed the protests held over the police killing of George Floyd on antifa. Bray received very little attention from those on the right until Trump issued his antifa executive order on September 22.

“It's manufactured outrage,” says Bray. “Trump is trying to look for a boogeyman and using this kind of nebulous term that is misunderstood in the public eye, a convenient way for him to demonize the left and anyone who opposes his administration.”

Days after the executive order was signed, the Department of Homeland Security published a memo that highlighted the perceived threat from antifa and “antifa-aligned domestic terrorists.”

In the wake of Trump's executive order, far-right influencers once again jumped on Bray after he spoke to media outlets about Trump's order. “I think I ought to visit,” wrote far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos on X, quoting a post about Bray's work at Rutgers. Jack Posobiec, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist who was recently invited by the Republican National Committee to train some poll workers, called Bray a “domestic terrorist professor.”

“The day after the Posobiec tweet, I received a very direct death threat saying that someone was going to kill me in front of my students,” says Bray.

When asked for comment, Posobiec simply repeated the claim he made in his X post. Yiannopoulos did not respond to a request for comment.

Posobiec was one of a number of far-right influencers who attended a White House event on Wednesday where Trump led a roundtable on the supposed rise and danger of antifa. During the event, which was also attended by secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, influencers were invited to share stories about their interactions with antifa.

One speaker, far-right influencer Andy Ngo, has spent years targeting Bray online. He has called him a “financier” of antifa, and has recently posted repeatedly about Bray. “Bray is a financier of antifa and advocates for their violence,” Ngo wrote on X last weekend. Ngo did not respond to a request for comment.

On October 2, Megyn Doyle, the treasurer of TPUSA's Rutgers chapter, launched a Change.org petition with the title: “Remove Antifa financier & Professor, Mark Bray from Rutgers University.” The petition questioned why Rutgers employed a professor who was, the petition claims, “supporting terrorist behavior.”

“We, the students of Rutgers University, are deeply concerned to learn that an outspoken, well-known antifa member, Dr. Mark Bray, is employed by the university,” Doyle wrote in the petition. “Dr. Mark Bray, whom we call Dr. Antifa, wrote the antifa handbook, which is a guideline to what he refers to as “militant anti-fascism.”

Doyle also suggested that Bray's public comments were similar to “the kind of rhetoric that resulted in Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month.” In an update three days after she first posted the petition, Doyle said: ""I do not endorse death threats, doxxing, or harassment and would not wish them on anyone, especially Mark Bray.""

Two days after the petition launched, Fox News ran a story about it on their website and quoted Doyle. Bray says he refused to provide a comment to Fox News, claiming that at the time the petition had fewer than 100 signatures. At the time of publication the petition had amassed almost 1,000 signatures.

“It seemed to me a bit odd to have a news story about a relatively small Change.org petition,” says Bray. “Fox News was trying to generate a story that would get clicks [and] when the Fox News story came out on Saturday, within a few hours I received another death threat and another threatening email that had my full address in it which very much disturbed me.”

Doyle, TPUSA, and FOX News did not respond to a request for comment.

At that point, Bray says, he and his family made the decision to leave the US and move to Spain. WIRED spoke to Bray on Monday as he was preparing to leave the US, and he said he had just received another death threat that morning, and his address was still getting posted online.

Scores of Bray's former students have jumped to his defense. One of them tells WIRED that his classmates were “disappointed” that he was leaving the US.

“His classes were always very lively and discussion based,” they add, “but due to him having to move to Europe, the class will be asynchronous and no longer have the same quality discussions.”

Bray says the Rutgers administration has been supportive, and says that he met with a dean at the university last week to discuss moving his classes to a different room on campus and taking down the public listing of his classes. As the situation escalated over the weekend, such actions became moot.

“The University is aware of the Change.org petition regarding Professor Mark Bray and Dr. Bray's message to his students,” says Patti Zielinski, a spokesperson for Rutgers. “We are gathering more information about this evolving situation.”

Bray reported the threats to both the Rutgers University Police Department and the police department in the town where he lives. Neither responded to WIRED's requests for comment.

While Bray says he's aware that most people who make threats online never take action, there have been enough recent instances of political violence that he thought it was “better to be safe than sorry” to temporarily relocate to Spain.

Bray, who says he plans to stay in Spain until the end of academic year, made his situation public to fight back against what he sees as a concerted effort to silence anyone who speaks out about the current administration.

“I don't see this as an aberration,” says Bray. “I don't think this is the end, and that's partly why I wanted to [make it public] so people can make more of an effort to plan, take collective action and protect academic freedom and the right to dissent in this country.”

The following sentence might make a globalist cry out for joy: A toy that is manufactured by a Chinese company in Vietnamese factories, designed by a Dutch artist in Belgium, inspired by indie toy culture in Hong Kong, and made viral thanks to a Thai K-pop star, has turned into the biggest Gen-Z cultural trend of 2025.

That abomination of a sentence is the story of Labubu, the creepy-cute stuffed monster that swept the world this summer. You must have seen the trend by now, but most people are still unaware of the global, decade-long story that led up to it. Last week, I published a feature story about my journey into the heart of Labubu, how this cultural mania moment was created, and where it may go from here.

It's an inherently international story, but it's not the first time we've seen it. Think about how the world fell for Pokemon Go or Kpop bands like BTS and Blackpink. These are all examples of regional cultural powerhouse industries successfully finding global audiences for their work. What's new about Labubu, however, is that it's the first time a Chinese company was able to engineer this level of success and cultural impact.

Sure, there are always coincidences at work for a success of this scale, but the more I reported on this story, the more I also realized the historical and economic reasons why Labubu, and the toy company behind it, Pop Mart, ended up in this place. In many ways, it resembles other Chinese tech companies that went from counterfeit producers to international name brands, moving up the value chain as they transformed manufacturing experience into valuable technological knowhow.

The story of Labubu begins in Hong Kong in the 1970s and early ‘80s, when the city became a manufacturing hub for toys. From Mattel and Disney to Japan's Bandai, almost every major toy company was outsourcing production to factories in Hong Kong, due to the low labor costs there.

Howard Lee, the founder of a Hong Kong toy studio called How2Work, told me how that period of history shaped his childhood. “Many parents would go to factories and come home with outsourced gig work like hand painting toys at home,” he says. It was also easy for people to buy toys with cosmetic or functional imperfections from the factories directly, so a generation of children like Lee grew up with relatively easy access to flawed dolls and other toys, which made them yearn more for the better ones they couldn't afford.

As they grew up, many went back to the toy industry to make their childhood dreams come true. Lee first worked in advertising before starting his toy studio in 2001 to help local artists turn their 2D designs into 3D toys. This was the start of the designer toy industry, where small artists would make limited runs of toys to sell to a niche, indie circle of fans.

By the early 2000s, the toy factories had moved out of Hong Kong to nearby cities in mainland China like Shenzhen and Dongguan, which had much cheaper labor and real estate. But people in Hong Kong like Lee still had an advantage: They could act as the intermediary between the more culturally advanced toy industry in the West and the efficient factories in mainland China. “If you were a Japanese or American toy designer at the time, you'd need an American agent who had a Hong Kong agent who went to China to find the factory for you. That would take at least two to three weeks. But we'd just go directly to Dongguan and knock on the factory's door,” Lee recalls.

Again, it was the smaller factories, which often dealt primarily in counterfeits and couldn't get big production orders from the likes of Mattel, that helped Hong Kong designers realize their ideas. Lee worked closely with these small factories in mainland China to fine-tune the production process for different toy designs, oftentimes relying on the pragmatic wisdoms of the factory workers to experiment with new techniques. Because of this legacy, the designer toys available in Hong Kong today are often quirky, full of personality, and target grown adults as customers.

Labubu was born in that environment. Kasing Lung, the designer of Labubu, used to be an award-winning children's book illustrator in Europe. In 2010, Lee saw Lung's artwork and messaged him on Facebook to ask if he wanted to come to Hong Kong and try his luck in the toy industry.

In 2015, the first year Labubu was introduced to the world, Lee and Lung only made 60 Labubu vinyl figurines to bring to a toy convention in Taipei. They were worried they might not sell the whole batch. Production had to be compromised, too, because they couldn't afford to use the more expensive machines that can do injection molding, so they had to rely on lower-cost manufacturing techniques using wax and copper molds. These cheaper production methods couldn't make toy body parts that are both long and durable. “So we had to shorten the limbs, enlarge the heads, and thicken the necks,” Lee says.

The process took so long that by the time they got to the toy convention, they hadn't had time to paint the Labubus yet. Instead, they decided to accept that the first batch of Labubus would be fully black and paint their eyes and teeth real-time at the convention, a spectacle they hoped might attract attention and sales. Painting the eyes later became a tradition at Lung's signing events for new Labubu releases.

Hong Kong's impact on Lung and Lee is still visible in the design of Labubu, says Derek Sulger, the chair of a Hong Kong–based luxury clothing brand and chairman of a contemporary art center in Beijing. A keen observer and practitioner in Asian culture, Sulger sees Labubu as “distinctly Hong Kong slash mainland—meaning an overseas Chinese version—of cuteness,” he says. “I can tell it's not Japanese and I can tell it's not Taiwanese.”

But the global success of Labubu shows that this highly specific type of cuteness now appeals to consumers everywhere. What is “Hong Kong cute” can also be an international sensation. “I am a big believer that when things are culturally authentic and culturally relevant, all of these national barriers can very quickly melt away,” Sulger says.

Today, China is the undeniable center of toy manufacturing. And Pop Mart, a company founded in 2010, has used it to its full advantage to grow into a $45 billion toy empire. In the corporate biography A Company One of a Kind, Pop Mart's CEO Wang Ning said that Chinese manufacturing prowess is one of the two historical opportunities that companies like his have benefited from. (The other is the massive size of China's domestic market.)

What Pop Mart managed to do was to turn the niche industry of designer toys in Hong Kong into a mass-produced cultural product for everyone in the world. The company started collaborating with Kasing Lung exclusively in 2019, and it has since signed many international artists and turned their designs into made-in-China products.

When I look at Pop Mart's history, I see a parallel with the rise of Chinese hardware tech companies. What used to be counterfeit gadget producers in Shenzhen can now make premium DJI drones that have no rivals in the world; what used to be factories for American and Japanese automakers are now producing their own Chinese-branded electric cars.

Yes, low-cost, counterfeit production is still a large part of the Chinese manufacturing economy, but it's no longer the full picture. Stories like Labubu's tell us that Chinese brands are increasingly leading global cultural trends too, despite the myriad of different political tensions and resistance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside Intel's Hail Mary to Reclaim Chip Dominance","https://www.wired.com/story/intel-arizona-fabrication-chips-trump-manufacturing/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

After four years of construction, Intel said on Thursday that its Fab 52 semiconductor plant in Chandler, Arizona is now turning out its first chips. The company also shared more details about the long-awaited CPUs that it will be producing in the facility using Intel's brand new 18A process technology.

The announcement comes just six weeks after the Trump administration acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in exchange for $8.9 billion in stock. The fab opening, while long in the works, is the first major opportunity for the struggling American chip maker to convince the broader tech industry that it can produce some of the world's most advanced chips at scale—and that the White House's investment might pay off.

Late last month, Intel invited dozens of analysts and business partners, along with a handful of journalists, to tour Fab 52. The tour offered an extremely rare glimpse into the world of modern chipmaking, where robots perform most tasks, lithography machines the size of school buses print microscopic patterns on silicon wafers, and workers shuffle around in anti-contamination “bunny suits,” booties, goggles, and gloves. (Guests are required to wear the suits, too.) Intel says that the air within the fab is recycled every six seconds.

All of this is to prevent contamination of the fragile silicon wafers that the entire computing industry runs on. If a single speck of anything lands on a wafer, it can be irreparably damaged.

Intel says that its Fab 52 has technically been operational since July, and the new generation of chips being made there, dubbed Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, have been in the works for years at this point.

But Intel decided to show off its new fab at a critical moment for the company. The facility is designed to make chips using a new process, called 18A, that's supposed to yield more powerful and efficient products. “Supposed to” is key: Intel's near-term fate hangs on whether it can produce semiconductors that are impressive enough to not only serve its usual hardware and computer customers, but also attract AI companies with large sums of cash to spend on advanced chips and data centers.

During the tour, Intel executives emphasized that Fab 52 is the most advanced chip manufacturing plant in the world. That may technically be true—the company's fabs, or foundries, “have been long known and respected in the industry for making the next node possible,” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategies and founder of Chipstrat, a semiconductor publication. In the early 2010s, for example, Intel made another significant node, or process advancement, when it introduced 32-nanometer chip technology. (Its latest chips are 2-nanometer.)

“But while Intel is good at figuring out how the industry can build the next-gen technology in a way that can be manufactured, TSMC is good at that and then saying, ‘How can we do this at high volume, high yield?'” Lyons said, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, widely considered the most advanced global chip firm.

Intel first pioneered the chips that revolutionized computing (and defined “Silicon Valley”) in the 1970s. The company started to falter in the mid-2000's when it failed to capitalize on the mobile phone boom and lost ground to emerging competitors. By that point, the US semiconductor industry had already moved a significant amount of manufacturing overseas to places like Taiwan.

Over the past few years, the rise of generative AI has led to a spike in demand for high-performance computing chips from Intel competitors Nvidia and AMD, putting the company at an even bigger disadvantage. Since 2024, the chipmaker has laid off tens of thousands of employees. In July, Intel's market capitalization was less than $100 billion dollars, while Nvidia's was roughly $4 trillion.

On the heels of the Trump administration's unorthodox bailout, Nvidia also made a $5 billion strategic investment in Intel. The not-so-subtle message: Intel must be saved, but it has proven it can't save itself.

Fab 52 is located on a patch of flat desert land approximately 20 miles outside of Phoenix, Arizona. It's part of a sprawling complex that also includes Fab 42, which began operating in 2020, and Fab 62, which is still under construction. The entire thing spans one million square feet.

The concrete and steel buildings stand in contrast to the green irrigated fields beside them, land that belongs to the Gila River Indian Community. Intel has assigned cutesy names to the roadways that wind around the facilities, like Data Drive, Transistor Terrace, and Silicon Street—but aside from that and the sheer size of the place, the exterior doesn't betray much of what goes on inside. At the time of the tour, a sign for “Construction Suicide Prevention Week” was affixed to a metal fence. A gigantic American flag hangs from an overpass at the entrance.

Everyone who enters the fabs has to wear a bunny suit, and get dressed—or be dressed—in a clean room. Makeup, hair products, perfumes, colognes, and any aerosol products are prohibited. Workers are separated by a metallurgical hierarchy: There are those who work with copper, and those who do not. The copper people wear orange suits, not white, and have to suit up and strip down in their own clean room.

The Intel fab worker who helped me suit up proudly told me that he has done the same for two US presidents: Obama, who visited Fab 42, and Biden, who visited Fab 52 while it was under construction. As of late September, Trump still hadn't visited, though Intel spokesperson Cory Pforzheimer said, “We'd eagerly welcome President Trump to see the most advanced R&D and leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US.”

The workers shuffling around are not pulling levers and grinding away at the gears of manufacturing as much as quietly managing robots. They stand at (sterilized) computer stations while containers called front-opening unified pods, or FOUPs, whoosh by overhead through a labyrinth of robotic tracks. The rows of equipment appear endless. The floor below has been reinforced, then reinforced again, because the tiniest of shakes can ruin a whole batch of chips.

The lithography section of the facility is awash in a strange glow, which turned our white suits neon green and the copper-suited people pink. Intel demanded that the fab tourists not share the names of its suppliers, with the exception of one: ASML, the Dutch manufacturer of the world's most cutting-edge lithography machines. WIRED witnessed two massive ASML Twinscan machines that appeared to be operational. The floor next to them was tape-marked with space for two more.

Intel has not yet publicly said how many semiconductors it expects to successfully yield, or manufacture, at Fab 52 annually. For now, the chips produced there will be used in consumer devices like laptops. But what Intel really needs is the same thing the entire industry is chasing: A hyperscaler customer, a giant data center deal, someone looking to spend billions to get an edge in AI. A whale.

Intel's Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips will be made using a manufacturing process that tosses aside decades of proven design techniques in favor of two new technologies the company calls RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFet is an architecture for transistors, stacking them in a way that allows for more density, while PowerVia moves the power interconnects from above the silicon stacks in the chip to below them.

Intel began working on the new design approach in 2021, and early tests have shown that RibbonFet and PowerVia led to performance gains. Reports suggest these new chips also use 30 percent less energy than the prior generation.

“Credit where credit is due, Intel is introducing both of these—RibbonFET and backside power—before TSMC, so they are the ones taking the risk here,” says Lyons. “I hope that bet pays off for them.” Competitors like Samsung and TSMC are now planning to introduce technologies similar to RibbonFet and PowerVia in their 2-nanometer chips.

But the overall performance and reliability of the new chips won't be clear until they are shipped to customers at scale. Panther Lake, which is Intel's third series of premium CPUs with dedicated AI processors, will start shipping this quarter. Clearwater Forest, which is designed for servers in data centers, arrives in the first half of 2026.

As Intel ramps up Fab 52 and its cutting-edge 18A process, the company will remain under intense public scrutiny. Customers are watching for any advantage they can use to get ahead in the AI arms race, hoping Intel's new capacity will give them a performance edge. The Trump administration is eager to champion American manufacturing, but remains a vocal and unpredictable partner.

Wall Street is focused on whether Intel can leverage these advances to lift chip prices, expand margins, and regain momentum in an increasingly competitive market. Analysts and amateur chip nerds, meanwhile, are dissecting Intel's supply, demand, and capacity to manage risk. And everyone is still questioning whether the chipmaker, once a crown jewel of the American tech sector, has enough momentum to make a real comeback.

Covid-19 vaccines are about to become widely available again across the United States, following several weeks of confusion around who would be able to get them this fall. Uncertainty over federal vaccine policy had caused a temporary patchwork of access across the country, with shots being offered in some places and not others.

This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance around the use of Covid vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for vaccination and instead leaving the choice up to individuals. While it marks a change in official CDC policy, the guidance allows shots to be rolled out to pharmacies, and for states to once again offer them to people of all ages.

Prior to this fall, the CDC universally recommended the Covid vaccine for anyone 6 months or older. The agency's new guidance, drafted by a panel of experts handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., says that individuals should consult with a health care provider before getting the shot, what the agency calls “individual-based decision-making.” The CDC's definition of providers includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists.

“Informed consent is back,” said Jim O'Neill, acting CDC director and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy secretary, in an October 6 statement. “CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual Covid-19 boosters deterred healthcare providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.”

Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, first moved to restrict Covid vaccines in May, when he announced that the CDC would no longer recommend them to healthy children and pregnant women.

Confusion mounted in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid vaccines but only for adults ages 65 and older and younger people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe disease. Previously, Covid shots were indicated for anyone 6 months and older. Because of differing state laws that determine the scope of practice for pharmacists, the change triggered pharmacies in some states to require a prescription, while in others pharmacies stopped offering the shots entirely. Several states, however, took swift action to restore access.

The CDC's new guidance is based on a recent recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of outside experts that advises the agency on how vaccines should be used to prevent disease. Earlier this year, Kennedy removed all 17 of ACIP's previous members and replaced them with 12 new ones, several of whom have been critical of the Covid-19 vaccines.

During a September 19 meeting, ACIP considered whether to require a prescription for the latest Covid vaccine, but narrowly decided against it. Its new recommendation on individual-based decision-making emphasized that the benefit of vaccination for people under age 65 is greatest in individuals who are at increased risk of severe Covid-19 because of an underlying medical condition and lowest for those who are not at an increased risk.

Once the CDC adopts ACIP's recommendations, they become official federal guidance. In many states, that guidance determines what vaccines pharmacies are allowed to administer. Without those guidelines, access was restricted in some states.

Now that the CDC has signed off, access issues should soon be resolved. The agency's official recommendation enables pharmacists to provide the vaccine again and also allows states to begin ordering Covid shots through the Vaccines for Children program, which provides federally purchased vaccines at no cost to low-income children and those without insurance. About half of US children are eligible for the program.

“For the average person that is interested in getting their Covid-19 vaccine, you will be able to do as you've always done. You should reach out to your provider, whether that's a pharmacist or a physician,” says Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Parents of young children who get their vaccines from their pediatrician might have found it especially difficult to get one in the past several weeks. Some doctor's offices were waiting to order the vaccine until the CDC issued its guidance for this year. Now that that's happened, more providers should be able to offer the vaccine in the coming days and weeks, she says.

The vaccine will soon be available at most pharmacies, as in previous years. “Almost every pharmacy at this point that had ordered or preordered their Covid-19 vaccine has some portion of that in stock,” says Brigid Groves, vice president of professional affairs at the American Pharmacists Association. “Patients or caregivers should be able to follow the process that they had done in years past to get one.”

The CDC's official guidance this week also requires health insurers to cover the cost of the vaccine. “Individual-based decision-making allows for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as the Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Vaccines for Children Program, as well as insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act,” according to the CDC.

Many private insurers had already committed to maintaining coverage for this season's Covid vaccines. America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group that represents the country's major insurers, released the following statement on September 16: “Health plans will continue to cover all ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the Covid-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026.”

As for the new individual-based decision-making requirement, it means that providers now must have a conversation with patients about the benefits and risks of vaccination—something the vast majority of them were already doing.

Enzo Ferrari said he was a seller of engines and that the rest of the car is thrown in for free, such was the emphasis he and his company put on its jewel-like power units. Can the same ever be true of an electric car's seemingly soulless motors, batteries, and inverters? That is the question Ferrari is at pains to answer in the positive with its first EV.

Although nameless for now, the four-door car will use a new electric platform called Elettrica. The platform is a familiar skateboard EV chassis setup, as used by almost everyone else, but with four motors instead of the more common one or two.

Total power is a little over 1,000 horsepower, the 0-62 mph time is 2.5 seconds and the top speed is 192 mph. The battery has a gross capacity of 122 kWh—one of the largest fitted to any production EV to date—can charge at up to 350 kW and operates at 880 volts. Ferrari is claiming a range of over 323 miles, suggesting an efficiency of around 2.65 miles per kWh, excluding any mileage gained through regenerative braking. Weight is approximately 2,300 kg (5,070 lbs).

Ferrari's 122 kWh battery is one of the largest fitted to any production EV and can charge at up to 350 kW with a claimed range of over 323 miles.

This was all broadly to be expected. What isn't known is exactly what sort of car it will be, or what it will be called. Today's reveal is focused on the Elettrica platform. The interior, which includes the work of a certain Sir Jony Ive, will be shown early next year, and the full car, also penned with input from Ive's LoveFrom design house, will land in the second quarter of 2026.

For now, chief executive Benedetto Vigna says the staggered reveal is because the first electric Ferrari is “a bigger deal” than its current flagship, the F80 hybrid hypercar.

You can't blame Ferrari for taking its time. By sticking to big V12 engines and clever hybrids that maximize performance over outright efficiency, the company has become accustomed to operating in a different league to other carmakers. Investors seem unfazed by the lack of an ultra-powerful EV to rival Porsche, Rimac or Lotus—and so Ferrari's share price is up 900 percent since going public a decade ago.

Its customers are equally happy, frequently shelling out six-figure sums on optional upgrades alone, while understanding that limited-run specials like the F80 are sold by invitation-only, regardless of bank balance.

Although looming regulation change means Ferrari cannot stick to the same winning formula forever, its first attempt at an EV arrives precisely as once-bullish rivals are reconsidering their position.

Lamborghini has delayed its first EV from 2027 to 2029. Bentley has pushed back its goal of exclusively selling fully electric cars from 2030 to 2035. And only recently Porsche killed plans for an electric flagship SUV, and said how some top-end models would continue to favor engines over batteries. Ferrari's Modena neighbor Maserati also recently cancelled plans for an electric version of its MC20 supercar, citing a lack of customer interest.

Even the company itself was unsure, albeit now almost a decade ago, when late boss Sergio Marchionne said a battery-powered Ferrari was “almost an obscene concept.” Then again, he was similarly robust about the idea of a Ferrari SUV, only for the high-riding Purosangue to be greeted with critical acclaim and bulging order books from day one.

Back to today and, while it doesn't want to say what the EV will look like, Ferrari is predictably keen to talk about performance. The front motors produce a combined 210 kW (280 horsepower) and 140 Nm of torque, while the rear pair send 620 kW (830 hp) and 355 Nm to their respective axle. The front and rear motors spin at up to 30,000 and 25,500 revolutions per minute, respectively, and can gain speed at a rate of 45,000 rpm per second.

Ferrari says the motors and battery were developed and built entirely in-house, using the company's new “e-building” at its Maranello, Italy campus, although the cells come from SK, a South Korean battery manufacturer. The battery pack comprises 211 pouch cells arranged in 15 modules which are designed to be accessed, removed, and replaced if future maintenance requires it.

Ferrari's setup, including this inverter, sees the carmaker opt for four electric motors instead of just one or two, which results in prodigious power: more than 1,000 hp, 0-62 in 2.5 secs and a top speed of 192 mph.

The first all-electric Ferrari is a four-door, four-seater with the driver and front passenger pushed forward in a bid to create a seating position like that of a mid-engined sports car, while the rear seats are more reclined.

Although the cabin hasn't been revealed, the EV's steering will have a pair of dials for switching between three energy modes (Range, Tour and Performance) and five drive modes: Ice, Wet, Dry, Sport, and ESC-Off. The latter will disable most of the Elettrica's traction and stability systems.

Behind the wheel are a pair of paddles, but instead of operating a transmission, the left-hand paddle cycles through different strengths of regenerative braking, and the right lets the driver access five levels of power and torque, using a new system called Torque Shift Engagement.

Although not quite the simulated gearbox of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, Ferrari says the regenerative braking modes give a sensation similar to engine braking when shifting down through the gears of a non-EV. Meanwhile, the five power and torque levels “deliver progressively stronger acceleration” with subsequent pulls of the right-hand paddle.

With regard to sound, Ferrari says it quickly dismissed the two approaches taken by most other EVs; namely, copying the sound of an engine, and producing something entirely synthesized. Instead, the Elettrica uses an accelerometer fitted to the rear axle. Like the pickup of an electric guitar, this senses vibrations produced by the motors, which are then processed and filtered—to remove annoying traits like constant whine, Ferrari says—and fed into the cabin.

Ferrari likens the sound of an engine and exhaust to that of an acoustic guitar, while it says the Elettrica's is closer to an amplified electric guitar. “The sound is authentic,” says Antonio Palermo, sound quality manager. “It belongs to the components of the powertrain.”

Palermo says the sound can be reduced when cruising, then amplified during more dynamic driving. Allegedly, it's even possible to sense when a rear wheel breaks traction, since the rise in revs of that motor would be detected by the accelerometer. He also says how latency—the time between a change in motor revs and the sound reaching the driver's ear—is “below the threshold of human perception… instantaneous.”

The sound will also adjust depending on how the driver engages with the steering wheel paddles for regenerative braking and the Torque Shift Engagement system. But, for now, Ferrari refuses to comment on exactly how motor sound is broadcast in the cabin—be it through the car's sound system, or some other means—and how external sound will be created. Underscoring Ferrari's commitment to using an authentic drivetrain sound, Palermo adds: “It's an instrument, not a ringtone.”

Remarkably, for a company whose cars are synonymous with theatrical histrionics, Ferrari says during normal driving “silence is preferred to maximize acoustic comfort.” To that end, it has worked hard to illuminate noise, vibration, and harshness (known in the industry as NVH), since there's no longer a loud engine to drown it all out.

The Elettrica's suspension is an evolution of the active system used by Ferrari's Purosangue SUV and F80 hypercar, which employs 48-volt motors to apply torque to each shock absorber, actively working to eliminate pitch and roll.

As with other electric cars, a heavy battery pack in the floor helps to lower the center of gravity; in this case, by 80 mm compared to an equivalent non-EV. Although it can't defy physics, Ferrari claims its suspension trickery and quad-motor setup makes the Elettrica handle as if it were almost 1,000 lbs lighter.

The result is a car where each wheel has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other, by up to 2.15 degrees in either direction. Each of the four motors can also operate their own regenerative braking, with up to 0.68G of deceleration possible with the most aggressive level of regen. That's more than half the braking force experienced during an emergency stop in a regular car.

Each of the electric Ferrrari's four wheels has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other.

Ferrari has said repeatedly that its first EV is not a supercar. It suggests this car will offer more usability than the V12 Purosangue SUV, with driving thrills to match the new Almalfi, a front-engined replacement to the Roma, but not trouble the more potent 12Cilindri and 296.

It's a confident first reveal from Ferrari, and one that manages to suggest there's more to its debut EV than yet another skateboard chassis. Its use of four motors, trick active suspension, a clever way of producing sound, and, yes, Apple's former design chief gives the Elettrica serious intrigue at a time when rivals are floundering.

And yet. Despite its technical know-how and massive brand power, convincing buyers to part with what's likely to be the far side of $500,000 for an EV that is not a supercar will be no walk in the park. Not even for Ferrari.

In July, just after receiving an email pitch about the “perfect” AI girlfriend, content creator Harrison Stewart made a TikTok skit using the anti-AI slur “clanker.”

Pretending to be a disapproving father, he confronted his daughter's robot boyfriend in the year 2044. “What's your name? No it's not. It's model number 626 S Series. That's your name, you dirty clanker,” Stewart says in the video.

As one of the original creators to make clanker-themed TikToks, Stewart, who goes by Chaise online, was dubbed the “clanker guy” by his fanbase after racking up millions of views. But in August, the 19-year-old content creator, who is Black, announced that he would no longer be publishing any more videos on the subject. The joke, he said, and responses to it, had become racist.

“When I go into my comment section and people are starting to call me ‘cligger' and ‘clanka' or ‘you're a dirty clanker'—not voicing those slurs at AI and electronics, but at me—I don't find that entertaining or funny at all,” Stewart explains in the video.

The origins of clanker date back to late 1950s author William Tenn, who used the word to describe robots from science fiction films, but its adoption as a sort of slur came from the Star Wars franchise, where it was used as a derogatory term toward the antagonist droids and troopers. In recent months, it has become a protest of sorts against the rapid implementation of AI into virtually every aspect of society.

Over the past three months, the term has garnered over 2 million Google searches and at least hundreds of thousands of social media posts. In an X post in July, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona wrote, “Sick of yelling ‘REPRESENTATIVE' into the phone 10 times just to talk to a human being? My new bill makes sure you don't have to talk to a clanker if you don't want to.”

On TikTok and Instagram, however, the ongoing backlash against AI has taken on the form of short video skits, envisioning a future where robots have been fully incorporated into society. The term “clanker,” along with “tinskins,” “wirebacks,” and “oil bleeders” are used as pejoratives in these skits. But some of these skits appear to be using clankers as stand-ins for Black people, perpetuating racist tropes and scenarios that harken back to a pre–Civil Rights era.

In one skit, creator Samuel Jacob dresses up in a police officer's uniform and throws out phrases such as, “Don't you know clankers sit in the back of the bus, Rosa Sparks?” and “Come on George Droid, looks like it's jail time for you, rust monkey.” Another skit by TikTokker Stanzi Potenza depicts a waitress at a diner acting out a scenario in which she's refusing service to the subject with the words “pov: you're a clanker in 2050” sprawled across the screen. Speaking in a Southern drawl, she tells the camera, “Didn't you see the sign outside? We don't serve clankers here.” The caption underneath the video is a variation of a common phrase often used by people to defend their own prejudices: “Don't worry, I have robot friends.”

Jacob tells WIRED the parallel between his skit and racial segregation in the US is intentional.

“ It's pretty obvious what it's based off of, in terms of the historical standpoint, like everything that was happening in the 1950s and such with the Jim Crow laws and stuff,” he says. “I thought it was a funny idea of ‘history repeats itself sometimes,' but at least it would be against robots.” He adds that while he's engaging in a “little bit of rage-baiting,” he doesn't take the skit seriously nor does he hold the beliefs portrayed. The backlash, he says, is likely to remain a part of what he does and is “ something I gotta learn to deal with and just move on from.” Potenza declined WIRED's request for comment.

Moya Bailey, a professor at Northwestern University who specializes in the representation of race and gender in the media, says the anti-Black subtext to some clanker skits suggests that some are using the term as a justification for racist jokes.

“I think the folks that go that route of racist humor honestly wanted an excuse—and it's a pretty good one—to make some jokes that I think they just wanted to make and felt clever in making those connections,” she says. Several of the skits show clankers being treated as second-class citizens. “For me, the racism very much shows just how embedded and how tied anti-Blackness is with our ideas of work and labor and service and servitude.”

On TikTok, people defending the trend argue it's not an example of racism because it's depicted in the context of a make-believe universe in which humans aren't being targeted. “It's not that deep” is a comment that is commonly thrown around under videos dissecting the seemingly racist references in clanker videos.

“ I didn't think too deeply about this,” Jacob says. “I was pretty much riding the trend like a lot of other creators were. Now it's slowly died out, and I'm just going to keep moving on to the next thing. I don't think people should harp on it any longer or give anymore energy to it. Don't want to keep perpetuating it into something bigger than it needs to be.”

Stewart says he's bothered that people used his skits to provide cover for the offensive ones.

“ What got me more upset than anything was people were justifying it by saying, ‘[Stewart] is Black and he made clanker videos, so what's your problem?'” he says. “ I was poking fun of the fact that if things got really that advanced, how would we deal with it? It's not supposed to be a racist thing.”

AI has already been used to generate racist imagery that draws from stereotypes featured in memes and TikToks. The generative AI tool Sora from OpenAI has come under fire for perpetuating biases against people of color, women, disabled people, and other minority groups in the content being prompted by users.

Bailey also points out that racism within the AI industry goes as far as the actual methods used to power it. She references the negative health impact of xAI data centers in a Memphis neighborhood called Boxtown, which is 90 percent Black, as an example of environmental racism inflicted by the AI industry.

Though not all clanker videos are offensive, Bailey says people should carefully consider the tropes and references they're using to take an anti-AI stance. “Jokes create an in-group and an out-group,” she says. “That's part of what makes it humorous, is like, ‘I get this. We're on the same team, we're on the same side.' And so I think people really need to take some time to think through who it is that they're aligning with when they say that certain things are funny.”

Stewart echoed a similar perspective: “I see a pattern with how Black people are portrayed in the media and how we're the butt of the joke at the end of the day.”

There was a time when AMD was the scrappy underdog of the semiconductor world. Twenty years ago, few would have imagined that the company would shape the future of global AI infrastructure alongside one of the most powerful players in the field of artificial intelligence.

Yet, that is exactly what AMD has achieved with its new multi-year partnership with OpenAI. This deal marks both a technological milestone and a strategic pivot for the entire data center industry.

The headline is staggering, and I'm not being hyperbolic. OpenAI will deploy up to six gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs, starting with one gigawatt of MI450 accelerators in the second half of 2026. In raw scale and ambition, this is a defining moment for AMD.

As Forrest Norrod, AMD's EVP and GM of data center solutions, put it during the company's briefing, “This deal is hugely transformative, not just for AMD, but also for the dynamics of the industry writ large. It is a strong endorsement of AMD's technology and its suitability for deployment at the largest scale for the most important models.”

That single quote captures the shift underway. AMD is no longer just competing. It's co-authoring the blueprint for how the next generation of AI infrastructure will be built.

The deal goes far beyond a conventional supplier agreement. It's structured as a deep strategic partnership, complete with a performance-based warrant for OpenAI to acquire up to 160 million AMD shares (nearly 10% of the company) tied to deployment milestones and stock price thresholds that peak at $600 per share. This structure aligns both companies on execution and success, creating what Norrod described as a “positive virtuous cycle” of deployment, adoption, and value creation.

One of the most telling details isn't in the number of GPUs, but in how AMD and OpenAI are defining scale. Rather than counting chips or flops, they're talking gigawatts, an energy-centric metric that reflects how hyperscale operators now plan infrastructure. As Norrod explained, “Our customers and the folks building data centers are now having to think about infrastructure in one-gigawatt tranches.”

This shift from compute metrics to power metrics hints at something more profound. AI infrastructure is becoming as much about power engineering, thermal efficiency, and systems integration as it is about silicon performance.

AMD is leaning into that reality with Helios, a rack-scale solution that integrates GPUs, CPUs, networking, and telemetry into a single, compact design. Helios embodies a holistic approach to AI data centers — one that views hardware not as standalone products but as integral elements of a massive, coordinated system.

This holistic strategy makes AMD's acquisition of ZT Systems, which occurred earlier this year, especially crucial. That move, which seemed peripheral at the time, now looks prescient. ZT's expertise in large-scale system design underpins Helios, enabling AMD to deliver vertically integrated solutions — not just components. The data center of the future will not be built chip by chip. It will be delivered as engineered pods, optimized for power, performance, and scalability from day one.

This deal is also a story about credibility. AMD's relationship with OpenAI didn't materialize overnight. It began with the MI300, when OpenAI first ran GPT workloads on AMD hardware within Microsoft's data centers. Over the last 18 months, that relationship deepened, particularly through work on Triton, OpenAI's compiler for GPU kernels. AMD became a first-class backend for Triton, aligning its roadmap with OpenAI's needs and shaping the MI450's design around real-world feedback.

That patient, iterative engagement ultimately paid off. As Norrod noted, OpenAI's commitment “didn't come from a casual date. It came from working with OpenAI for several years, having them gradually build up confidence in our capabilities.” This announcement is more than a supply agreement. It's validation that AMD now belongs in the highest tier of AI infrastructure providers.

The impact of this partnership will ripple beyond AMD and OpenAI. It signals that the AI infrastructure market is no longer a one-horse race dominated by Nvidia. The emergence of credible alternatives at hyperscale levels will accelerate competition, diversify ecosystems, and spur innovation across the stack, from compilers and frameworks to networking and power delivery.

It may also change how data centers are financed and deployed. A six-gigawatt agreement implies multi-billion-dollar investments in power, cooling, and real estate. As deployments are framed in gigawatt terms, expect data center design to become more modular, with pre-engineered, rack-scale solutions like Helios forming the basic unit of deployment. That could shorten time-to-market for AI infrastructure and make global expansion more predictable and capital-efficient.

Ultimately, this deal is about more than hardware. It is about AMD claiming a seat at the table of the most consequential technology shift of our time. Two decades ago, the idea of AMD supplying the backbone for one of the world's most advanced AI platforms would have seemed fanciful. Today, it is a reality.

The deal reflects a company that has transformed itself from a perennial challenger to a strategic partner trusted to help power the future of artificial intelligence. It hints at an industry in transition, where power, scale, and integration are redefining what it means to be a leader.

The big players of AI infrastructure now include AMD — and that changes everything.

Seattle startup Aarden AI is coming out of stealth with $4 million from investors and an AI platform that helps landowners research and navigate deals with developers eager to build data centers, clean energy installations, housing and other uses.

While there have long been tools to support developers, landowners have been largely on their own to evaluate and optimize deals so they're not taken advantage of or end up partnering with untrustworthy organizations, said Aarden CEO Danan Margason.

“And so landowners have become increasingly skeptical of working with developers, even when opportunities exist,” he said. 

Big tech companies are scrambling to build data centers to meet expanding AI needs, creating urgent demand for suitable sites. At the same time, the push for clean energy — both to power those data centers and support broader efforts to move away from fossil fuels — has developers actively seeking landowners. 

The company's current customers are businesses and entities that own and manage large swaths of timberland. They know their sector well, Margason said, but they don't know how to accurately calculate the potential for these alternate land uses.

Aarden's technology creates detailed maps with information that includes elevation, soil type, energy transmission infrastructure, environmental and wildlife habitat features, solar intensity and other factors. It estimates financial returns for various land uses and expedites the due diligence process. And it helps manage the legal aspects of a transaction.

The platform's AI foundation allows users to ask questions and dig more deeply into the information as they explore different options. 

“As an industry, land has been stuck with multi-decade assumptions and Excel models that rarely consider alternative uses. Despite that, it's been an amazing asset class for those that can access it, consistently beating the public markets,” said Ben Eidelson, general partner of Stepchange, a climate-focused fund.

Stepchange also invested in Aarden's initial round, which was led by Planeteer and included Founders' Co-op, KDX, Superorganism and Len Jordan, a venture partner at Madrona.

Aarden charges subscription fees for landowners using the platform. Future revenue options include usage-based fees that are higher for customers running more complex scenarios and models. The company aims to facilitate matches for the parties — generating revenue for helping negotiate successful transactions with developers.

Other companies are creating tools for assessing and researching properties, including Acres.com and Land id, but don't appear to be centered on landowners' needs.

The startup launched earlier this year and has a five person team: 

The startup and many of its investors have a strong connection to environmental and climate concerns, but converting forests to data centers or even solar farms doesn't obviously align with those ideals. So how does the team square those concerns? 

Margason said the question gets a lot of attention internally, and their goal is to support responsible development — which the timberland owners appreciate.

“If data centers are going to get built, if homes are going to get built, how do we help provide the right layers of information to inform not just the economic outputs, but also the environmental outputs,” he said, “and that'll hopefully drive better decision making.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Two weeks after detailing why the Seattle economy could face ongoing troubles because of layoffs at tech giants Microsoft and Amazon, The Wall Street Journal is back this week with a look at why heading east might be the more attractive option for tech companies and their workers. 

“Tech Companies Can't Get Enough of This Picturesque Seattle Suburb,” WSJ headlined a mostly glowing piece about Bellevue's cleaner streets, better schools, lower crime rate, and rise in new office space that's luring companies such as TikTok, OpenAI, Snowflake and others.

Peter Steinbrueck, a former member of the Seattle City Council, told the WSJ that Seattle's glory days of economic expansion have ended and “the pendulum has swung to the Eastside.”

The Bellevue Chamber of Commerce didn't miss its chance to promote the article in an emailed newsletter this week: “The Wall Street Journal has its sights set on Bellevue, and we don't blame them one bit,” the Chamber wrote. “Our little chunk of techy paradise, it seems as though the rest of the nation is finally catching on to what we all already know: Bellevue frickin' rocks.”

Well, frick. It's the latest iron in the Seattle-vs.-Bellevue fire that's been stoked in recent years by a battle over whether tech workers are better suited working on the east or west side of Lake Washington.

“You can look out the window of our building and see the mountains,” said Warrick Taylor, a Snowflake vice president based in California, who is perhaps unaware that those same views exist in Seattle. 

Snowflake moved more than 700 employees into new office space in Bellevue's Spring District in June.

“Like the airlines say, ‘We know you could have chosen another city, we're glad you chose us,'” Bellevue Mayor Lynn Robinson said while helping to cut the ribbon at Snowflake. 

The mostly friendly beef between the two municipalities has been going on for decades, and up until about seven years ago, it was largely lopsided in Seattle's favor. The Emerald City is where young tech workers needed to be, not just for the jobs and innovation but for the culture.

But in 2018, a rift opened up between Amazon and elected officials in Seattle when the City Council sought to impose a $275-per-employee “head tax” on the tech giant. Since then, Amazon has quickly grown in downtown Bellevue, with new buildings holding 14,000 of a planned 25,000 workers in the city.

While Amazon is promoting a more regional footprint for its headquarters, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell made it clear last month that he thinks Seattle still holds the edge over Bellevue, citing his city's diversity, arts, music, restaurants, and innovative history. He touted Seattle's new waterfront AI House, saying that Bellevue didn't have the idea for the startup hub, Seattle did.

But as Seattle's downtown core has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, with high office vacancy rates and some major retailers exiting, some in Bellevue see an opening. 

“Clean and safe is everything and Seattle is not that,” said Steve Luthman, global head of real estate at Hines, a developer and manager in Bellevue, in the WSJ report.

Amazon Web Services is launching a new artificial intelligence platform for everyday business users, moving further beyond core cloud infrastructure to compete more directly against Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and AI startups.

The platform, Amazon Quick Suite, was announced Thursday morning. It's a collection of agentic AI tools that can automate tasks by connecting with internal documents and databases, and third-party apps and services.

For example, Amazon says the tools can recap emails, send messages, update project tickets, automate content creation, and build customer strategies, using a company's own data securely and privately. Quick Suite integrates with third-party services like Salesforce for customer data, Zendesk for support tickets, and Slack for team collaboration, according to the company.

One of Amazon's advantages: its ability to test new enterprise tools with its own massive workforce before public release. 

The company said Quick Suite has already been deployed to tens of thousands of Amazon employees — reporting that the tool has reduced complex data analysis tasks from months to minutes, for example, based on internal use.

One of its challenges: Unlike its rivals, Amazon does not own a native productivity suite like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. 

This means it must convince users to adopt its platform as an overlay on top of the tools they already use. It's a big hurdle in a market where its competitors can embed their AI assistants directly into their existing software.

Earlier on Thursday, Google announced a unified Gemini Enterprise AI agent subscription, consolidating its business-focused AI tools.

AWS marketing chief Julia White told Bloomberg that existing customers of the Amazon Q Business AI software, which launched 18 months ago, will be encouraged to migrate to the new platform. White was previously a longtime Microsoft executive. 

Amazon says Quick Suite will be available in two tiers: a Professional plan starting at $20 per user per month, and an Enterprise plan at $40 with advanced features.

Quick Suite includes a few individual tools: 

AWS says it has rolled out the platform to hundreds of corporate beta customers, citing examples of significant cost savings and efficiency improvements.

Amid political polarization and uncertain federal research policy, Washington leaders are betting on stability through a unique innovation ecosystem rooted in the state's institutions and businesses.

That was a theme at the 20th anniversary celebration of the Washington State Academy of Sciences, held Tuesday evening at Seattle's Museum of Flight.

Founded in 2005 at the request of then-Gov. Christine Gregoire, WSAS serves as a nonpartisan, independent advisory body modeled after the National Academies, connecting scientists and engineers to policymakers across the state. 

The event doubled as a reflection on two decades of science-based policy advice and a call to action for the future.

“This anniversary really coincides with a tremendous amount of change — change that maybe is unprecedented for those in our lifetime,” said WSAS President Allison Campbell. 

The evening's keynote panel, moderated by Allen Institute CEO Rui Costa, brought together leaders from academia, government, and industry to discuss the future of research and innovation in Washington state.

“When you see such turmoil happening at the national level, capital and leadership and talent are going to gravitate toward places that are stable and that are supportive,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the Washington state Department of Commerce.

Washington state's combination of research universities, private-sector giants, and public institutions gives it an unusually integrated innovation infrastructure.

Nguyen, a former state senator and Microsoft senior program manager, noted his state's deep roots in invention.

“We build shit,” Nguyen said, noting homegrown giants such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon. “That is one of the key things we're really good at.”

He pointed to the legislature's move to establish a regulatory framework distinguishing fusion from fission energy — a change that he said paved the way for Helion Energy, one of the region's hottest startups backed by the likes of SoftBank and Sam Altman, to begin construction on what could become the world's first commercially viable fusion reactor in Wenatchee.

“Our unique value is that we can do things [that] other people think are impossible,” he said. 

Elizabeth Cantwell, the new president of Washington State University, said she has already witnessed that culture firsthand.

“There's nothing more glorious and glittering than being someplace that appreciates building stuff,” said Cantwell, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.

Cantwell, who previously led the Utah State University system, said she's seen “genuinely impactful collaboration” between WSU and the University of Washington — rivals on the football field but partners in various research and education initiatives.

Babak Parviz, a veteran technologist and founder of Seattle mental health startup NewDays, described the region's growing global footprint in artificial intelligence — powered by corporations as well as strong university programs, including the UW's top computer science school.

“We intentionally moved back from Silicon Valley to be here, because we love to be here,” he said.

But Parviz warned that the state's AI boom depends on continued investment in education and research.

“If academia is not there, we're not going to be able to train the workforce that we need in the industry,” said Parviz, a former Amazon executive. “And a lot of the core research that's needed to power the industry is going to go away.”

Washington is facing dual financial pressures with federal research cuts and a massive state budget deficit that is impacting higher education institutions.

Cantwell, who has spent decades overseeing research and innovation teams, emphasized the need to strengthen the pipeline between universities and industry, warning that the traditional model for funding graduate research is breaking down.

She urged companies to create long-term placements for graduate students beyond short-term internships.

“If you are in a company or corporate sector or anything like that, add two to three spots for graduate students,” she said.

Campbell, president of WSAS, said the academy can serve as connective tissue during difficult times.

“In times of change, there's really a lot of opportunity,” she said. “That's when leadership matters most, and that's where an academy such as ours can really rise to the top and provide the leadership to help our state and our nation through these tremendous changes.”

After OpenAI's video-generating app Sora surged to the No. 1 position on the U.S. App Store, it has now, technically, experienced a bigger first week than ChatGPT on iOS, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT's 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.

Shortly after the publication of this article, OpenAI's head of Sora, Bill Peebles, announced that Sora reached a million downloads (across platforms, not just iOS) in under five days. He said that was faster than ChatGPT, despite Sora being in invite-only mode.

sora hit 1M app downloads in <5 days, even faster than chatgpt did (despite the invite flow and only targeting north america!)!team working hard to keep up with surging growth. more features and fixes to overmoderation on the way!

ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures data indicated that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT's launch on iOS alone, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.

This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora requires an invite to get in, while ChatGPT was publicly available at launch. That makes Sora's performance more impressive.

During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 iOS app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, Appfigures said. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora's debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic's Claude and Microsoft's Copilot, and put it on par with xAI's Grok launch.

A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures' data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere. Users are even creating deepfakes of dead people, a use case that has prompted Zelda Williams, daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, to ask folks to stop sending her AI-generated images of her father.

Per Appfigures, the app has seen steady adoption since its first day on the market, September 30, 2025. Its data indicates that daily downloads on iOS hit a high mark of 107,800 downloads on October 1, 2025. It has since seen between lows of 84,400 daily installs (on October 6) and 98,500 daily installs (on October 4).

While that's not quite as high as earlier in the week, it's still decent numbers for an app that not everyone can yet use.

This post was updated after original publication on Oct. 8 to include new information shared by OpenAI's Bill Peebles.

Duolingo is saying no, non, nein, and nyet to San Francisco.

The language learning app is headquartered in Pittsburgh, which isn't exactly known as a booming hub of startups and venture capital. But Duolingo said in a post on LinkedIn that it will never open a San Francisco office, in part because it helps them maintain the culture they want.

“We built our headquarters here because we believe you don't have to chase trends or sky-high rent prices to do meaningful work,” Duolingo wrote in a blog post last year. “For us, Pittsburgh isn't a ‘backup plan' to the Bay Area.”

The company's other U.S. offices are in Detroit, New York City, and Seattle.

Startups can thrive all across the world — and not just in Silicon Valley — but the pressure to build near the Bay Area looms large enough that we're hosting a TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 panel about this very topic.

“Pittsburgh isn't trying to be the next Silicon Valley — and that's exactly the point,” the company wrote.

Maybe this is all just fodder to advertise a city that doesn't even have a passably good baseball team. But they're probably right that building outside of San Francisco helps the company tune out the noise of the Valley.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech after receiving reports that the software caused vehicles to run red lights or cross into wrong lanes.

The probe, which identified more than 50 reports of these kinds of violations (four of which led to injuries), is one of the first specifically targeted at Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance software. The NHTSA previously opened an investigation into FSD in October 2024 after receiving reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions.

The federal safety agency in April 2024 closed an investigation into Tesla's less-capable Autopilot system after identifying 13 fatal crashes related to the misuse of that software. A separate investigation into the efficacy of the fix Tesla issued to Autopilot remains open.

The new investigation was opened the same week that Tesla released the latest version of the software, which CEO Elon Musk has spent months hyping. This new version is supposed to incorporate training data that Tesla acquired during its limited robotaxi pilot, currently underway in Austin, Texas.

The safety agency's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) said on Thursday that it has received at least 18 complaints and one media report alleging that Tesla's FSD software failed to stop the car or stay stopped at red lights. In addition, ODI said it identified six reports from Tesla under the agency's Standing General Order for Crash Reporting (SGO), which requires companies to submit information about crashes involving autonomous or partially autonomous cars.

ODI said it has already worked with Maryland's Transportation Authority and its State Police to determine if some of the red light problems are repeatable, since “multiple subject incidents occurred at the same intersection in Joppa, Maryland.” Tesla has already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection,” according to the NHTSA.

ODI also said on Thursday it had identified 18 complaints, two media reports, and two SGO reports from Tesla about instances in which FSD “entered opposing lanes of travel during or following a turn, crossed double-yellow lane markings while proceeding straight, or attempted to turn onto a road in the wrong direction despite the presence of wrong-way road signs.” 

ODI said it has identified six complaints, one media report, and four SGO reports where a Tesla with FSD engaged drove straight through an intersection from a turn lane, or turned from a through lane.

“Some of the reported incidents appeared to involve FSD executing a lane change into an opposing lane of travel with little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene,” ODI wrote. 

ODI opened what's known as a “Preliminary Evaluation,” one of the first steps it can take on the way to requiring a recall. The agency said it typically tries to complete these investigations within eight months, although it's unclear if the federal government shutdown would affect the timeline. 

Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year reportedly made dramatic cuts to NHTSA's vehicle automation safety staff.

Google on Thursday launched a comprehensive AI platform for businesses called Gemini Enterprise, the latest effort by the Alphabet-owned company to compete with Anthropic and OpenAI in the fast-growing market for workplace AI tools.

As part of the launch, Google announced several new Gemini Enterprise customers, including the software design firm Figma; the buy now, pay later company Klarna; the foodservice distributor Gordon Food Service; Australian retail bank Macquarie Bank; and Virgin Voyages, a cruise line that has deployed more than 50 specialized AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks on Gemini Enterprise.

Gemini Enterprise builds on previous iterations of the company's efforts to bring AI capabilities to businesses. But Google says this shouldn't be mistaken as a mere rebranding, despite the ever-changing and sometimes overlapping nomenclature used by its enterprise brand Google Workspace. For instance, Google Workspace adopted the Gemini branding in February 2024 and announced add-on generative AI products called Gemini Enterprise that were available to businesses. Google discontinued that Workspace Gemini Enterprise add-on earlier this year after it began including AI features in its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans.

The Gemini Enterprise that launched Thursday isn't a Workspace add-on product; it's a separate and secure platform under Google Cloud that functions as an AI agent toolkit — essentially a suite of tools that lets companies build and deploy their own AI assistants. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian described it in a blog post as “the new front door for AI in the workplace.”

Gemini Enterprise is designed to let businesses securely create, share, and use AI agents for a variety of workplace tasks in sales, marketing, engineering, human resources, and finance. Google also said that, for the first time, these AI agents can access, combine, and analyze information from internal systems and Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow.

All of this work is conducted through a Gemini Enterprise chatbot that connects to a worker's data, including Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, as well as business applications like Salesforce and SAP. The platform includes Google's Gemini AI models alongside other products such as a collection of pre-built Google agents for deep research and data insights, a no-code product that lets workers analyze information and automate internal processes, and a central governance framework that lets users visualize, secure, and audit all of their agents from one place.

This new “front door for AI in the workplace” does have a price. The company said its annual Gemini Enterprise standard and “plus” editions start at $30 per seat per month. A cheaper Gemini Business annual plan, which is meant for small businesses, startups, or individual departments within a larger company, costs $21 per seat per month. Google said the business edition will launch Thursday and includes a 30-day free trial period for all customers.

Gemini Enterprise reflects Google's latest effort to capture a bigger share of the enterprise market, which has become increasingly crowded as generative AI becomes a more important workplace tool. Booming AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI have enterprise products, and both have landed high-profile customers.

OpenAI says on its website it has 5 million business users of the ChatGPT Enterprise product it launched in 2023. This month, Deloitte announced plans to roll out Anthropic's chatbot Claude to its nearly 500,000 global employees.

Artificial intelligence is not just changing how we work — it's transforming how we move. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27-29 at San Francisco's Moscone West, two industry leaders at the forefront of AI-driven mobility will take the AI Stage to explore the future of intelligent transportation systems: Uber's Sachin Kansal and Nuro's Dave Ferguson.

Together, Kansal and Ferguson will discuss the evolving relationship between AI and mobility: how predictive models and computer vision are improving road safety, why last-mile delivery is an autonomy proving ground, and what it will take to bring AI-driven transportation to scale.

With the transportation industry evolving so quickly, this session gives you an exclusive insider's look at the future of mobility. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, or up to 30% on group passes.

Sachin Kansal, chief product officer at Uber Technologies, oversees the company's global Mobility and Delivery products, including safety, sustainability, and autonomous vehicle initiatives. He's helping define how AI and automation will power Uber's next decade — from more efficient ride-matching to next-generation logistics networks. He oversees product and technology strategy for Uber's new initiatives in autonomous vehicles, sustainability, taxis, and Uber for Teens.

Before joining Uber in 2017, he served as vice president of Product at Lookout and chief product officer at Flywheel Software. Earlier in his career, he led product management at Palm (acquired by HP) for the webOS mobile platform. Kansal holds engineering degrees from Gujarat University and Stanford University and has authored several patents in mobile and location technologies.

Joining him is Dave Ferguson, co-founder and president of Nuro, the self-driving technology company pioneering scalable autonomy for robotaxis, commercial fleets, and personal vehicles. Ferguson's experience spans Google's early self-driving program (now Waymo) and Carnegie Mellon's DARPA Urban Challenge-winning team, giving him a rare perspective on how robotics research translates to real-world transportation breakthroughs.

A leading voice in robotics and AI, Ferguson has published over 60 papers, holds more than 100 patents, and earned his MS and PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University.

As cities and companies alike race toward smarter infrastructure and sustainable mobility, their conversation will offer an insider's view on what the next decade of intelligent transportation could look like.

Meta is already putting Reels in front and center of the Instagram experience on iPad and on mobile in countries like India and South Korea. Now, to allow more people to consume and understand Reels in different languages, the company is adding support for Hindi and Portuguese to its AI-powered translation feature across Instagram and Facebook, as well. 

The company first launched this feature in August with support for English and Spanish after teasing it at its Meta Connect conference last year. With Hindi and Portuguese support, Meta aims to tap into creators from its biggest markets, like India and Brazil, to have a global reach.

“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don't necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram in August. 

“And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform,” he added.

Users can turn on automatic translation in their preferred language to consume Reels that were originally created in another language. 

Creators can turn on automatic translation for their Reels by turning on the “Translate your voice with Meta AI” option before publishing. They can also select which languages to translate to after reviewing the translated video with automatic dub and lip sync.

Meta said that it is working on new features for AI-powered translation that will roll out soon. Reels on Facebook already support multi-speaker AI-powered translations. Meta said that this feature will be available for creators posting on Instagram soon.

Apart from voice translations, the company is also building a way to translate text or caption stickers posted with Reels in supported languages. Users will be able to select the “Translate text on Reels” option when the feature is rolled out.  This is useful for someone who is watching a video without sound.

What's more, Meta plans to roll out a new voice dubbing feature that will preserve the creator's original voice and tone. The company will also give an option to opt for a new version of lip-syncing that better matches the movement of your mouth. 

Meta's rival YouTube has been working on translation features for a few years now. Last month, the company rolled out lip-sync improvements to its auto-dubbing feature with support for 20 languages.

Foundation models for time series

We are on a mission to create the forecasting foundation model to rule them all. Forecasting drives critical decisions worldwide - impacting staffing, supply chain management, finance and more. Our solution provides companies with the models, platform and APIs they need to easily generate the most accurate forecasts possible, helping to significantly reduce waste and enabling smarter, more confident decisions.

The forecasting model is at the heart of our technology. As the second founding MLE, you will build, train and deploy large foundation model architectures: implement and combine ideas from the literature, push the state of the art, and ultimately deploy your model for our customers to use in production. Our goal is for our models to be the best for our customers' use cases - including for capabilities that do not exist yet in academic models.

You love your craft, have high standards, stay up-to-date with the latest ideas in ML, and know when to make trade-offs to ship. You live and breathe neural networks, and speak PyTorch or Jax. You are used to diving deep in large amounts of data, and you know what you train your models on. Bonus if you have experience building solid ML infrastructure.

You are passionate about your craft, maintain high standards, stay current with the latest tech and know when to make trade-offs to deliver results efficiently. We do not believe great engineers are “jack of all trades”, but rather that they excel at diving deep into complex topics quickly, leveraging a broad range of experiences to solve challenging problems. You are also open to exploring new concepts, technologies, and enjoy quickly throwing prototypes together to kick the tires. You prefer quick feedback loops, rather than aiming for perfection on the first try.

Our goal is to provide the most accurate and easy-to-use forecasts to our customers, by leveraging refined information from their own industry. Foundation models for time series are changing this entirely. With the current advances in data processing and model training, we can now pre-train models on diverse temporal data across industries. We provide value to our customers by enabling rapid interaction with our models when provided data and context in natural language, delivering real-time forecasts with accuracy reports. Our customers do not need to be data scientists or have a PhD in Machine Learning to build and ship an accurate forecasting system for their use-cases.

Example use cases include demand forecasting for large furniture chains, predicting sales for a restaurant group and revenue forecasting in the gaming industry.

The founders Geoff and Joachim are both Machine Learning PhDs who have built forecasting and ML systems from scratch at JP Morgan, Amazon, Google, Bloomberg, and Sonos in the US.

We are a global company that happens to be HQed in Paris. Get the best of both worlds — Silicon Valley work ethic and ambition in the center of Paris, right across from the historical Stock Exchange, in the Sentier.

> It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.

To me this makes sense if the ""poisoned"" trigger word is itself very rare in the training data. I.e. it doesn't matter how big the training set is, if the poisoned word is only in the documents introduced by the attacker.

Other attacks rely on more in-distribution instructions. Would they be impacted differently by scaling the training data?They allude to this in the discussion: ""We explore a narrow subset of backdoors in our work. Future work may explore more complex attack vectors (e.g. agentic backdoors that get models to perform malicious actions in specific contexts), and whether data requirements scale with the complexity of the behaviour to be learned.""

Groundbreaking new tests reveal patterns in our immune systems that can signal underlying disease and tell us how well we might recover from our next cold. I got my results in a text message.

The story is a collaboration between MIT Technology Review and Aventine, a non-profit research foundation that creates and supports content about how technology and science are changing the way we live.

It's not often you get a text about the robustness of your immune system, but that's what popped up on my phone last spring. Sent by John Tsang, an immunologist at Yale, the text came after his lab had put my blood through a mind-boggling array of newfangled tests. The result—think of it as a full-body, high-resolution CT scan of my immune system—would reveal more about the state of my health than any test I had ever taken. And it could potentially tell me far more than I wanted to know.

“David,” the text read, “you are the red dot.”

Tsang was referring to an image he had attached to the text that showed a graph with a scattering of black dots representing other people whose immune systems had been evaluated—and a lone red one. There also was a score: 0.35.

I had no idea what any of this meant.

The red dot was the culmination of an immuno-quest I had begun on an autumn afternoon a few months earlier, when a postdoc in Tsang's lab drew several vials of my blood. It was also a significant milestone in a decades-long journey I've taken as a journalist covering life sciences and medicine. Over the years, I've offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. In 2001, I was one of the first humans to have my DNA sequenced. Soon after, in the early 2000s, researchers tapped into my proteome—proteins circulating in my blood. Then came assessments of my microbiome, metabolome, and much more. I have continued to test-drive the latest protocols and devices, amassing tens of terabytes of data on myself, and I've reported on the results in dozens of articles and a book called Experimental Man. Over time, the tests have gotten better and more informative, but no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health than what John Tsang was offering.

Over the years, I've offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. But no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health.

It also was not lost on me that I'm now 20-plus years older than I was when I took those first tests. Back in my 40s, I was ridiculously healthy. Since then, I've been battered by various pathogens, stresses, and injuries, including two bouts of covid and long covid—and, well, life.

But I'd kept my apprehensions to myself as Tsang, a slim, perpetually smiling man who directs the Yale Center for Systems and Engineering Immunology, invited me into his office in New Haven to introduce me to something called the human immunome.

Made up of 1.8 trillion cells and trillions more proteins, metabolites, mRNA, and other biomolecules, every person's immunome is different, and it is constantly changing. It's shaped by our DNA, past illnesses, the air we have breathed, the food we have eaten, our age, and the traumas and stresses we have experienced—in short, everything we have ever been exposed to physically and emotionally. Right now, your immune system is hard at work identifying and fending off viruses and rogue cells that threaten to turn cancerous—or maybe already have. And it is doing an excellent job of it all, or not, depending on how healthy it happens to be at this particular moment.

Vaccines aimed at dampening the immune response could revolutionize the treatment of autoimmune diseases

Yet as critical as the immunome is to each of us, this universe of cells and molecules has remained largely beyond the reach of modern medicine—a vast yet inaccessible operating system that powerfully influences everything from our vulnerability to viruses and cancer to how well we age to whether we tolerate certain foods better than others.

Now, thanks to a slew of new technologies and to scientists like Tsang, who is on the Steering Committee of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub New York, understanding this vital and mysterious system is within our grasp, paving the way for powerful new tools and tests to help us better assess, diagnose and treat diseases.

Already, new research is revealing patterns in the ways our bodies respond to stress and disease. Scientists are creating contrasting portraits of weak and robust immunomes—portraits that someday, it's hoped, could offer new insights into patient care and perhaps detect illnesses before symptoms appear. There are plans afoot to deploy this knowledge and technology on a global scale, which would enable scientists to observe the effects of climate, geography, and countless other factors on the immunome. The results could transform what it means to be healthy and how we identify and treat disease.

It all begins with a test that can tell you whether your immune system is healthy or not.

Sitting in his office last fall, Tsang—a systems immunologist whose expertise combines computer science and immunology— began my tutorial in immunomics by introducing me to a study that he and his team wrote up in a 2024 paper published in Nature Medicine. It described the results of measurements made on blood samples taken from 270 subjects—tests similar to the ones Tsang's team would be running on me. In the study, Tsang and his colleagues looked at the immune systems of 228 patients diagnosed with a variety of genetic disorders and a control group of 42 healthy people.

To help me visualize what my results might look like, Tsang opened his laptop to reveal several colorful charts from the study, punctuated by black dots representing each person evaluated. The results reminded me vaguely of abstract paintings by Joan Miró. But in place of colorful splotches, whirls, and circles were an assortment of scatter plots, Gantt charts, and heat maps tinted in greens, blues, oranges, and purples.

It all looked like gibberish to me.

Luckily, Tsang was willing to serve as my guide. Flashing his perpetually patient smile, he explained that these colorful jumbles depicted what his team had uncovered about each subject after taking blood samples and assessing the details of how well their immune cells, proteins, mRNA, and other immune system components were doing their job.

The results placed people—represented by the individual dots—on a left-to-right continuum, ranging from those with unhealthy immunomes on the left to those with healthy immunomes on the right. Background colors, meanwhile, were used to identify people with different medical conditions affecting their immune systems. For example, olive-green indicated those with auto-immune disorders; orange backgrounds were designated for individuals with no known disease history. Tsang said he and his team would be placing me on a similar graph after they finished analyzing my blood.

Tsang's measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. “The main immune cell panel typically ordered by a physician is called a CBC differential,” he told me. CBC, which stands for “complete blood count,” is a decades-old type of analysis that counts levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and basic immune cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils). Changes in these levels can indicate whether a person's immune system might be reacting to a virus or other infection, cancer, or something else. Other blood tests—like one that looks for elevated levels of C-reactive protein, which can indicate inflammation associated with heart disease—are more specific than the CBC. But they still rely on blunt counting—in this case of certain proteins.

Tsang's assessment, by contrast, tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules—significantly more than the CBC and others. His protocol is designed to paint a more holistic portrait of a person's immune system by not only counting cells and molecules but also by assessing their interactions. The CBC “doesn't tell me as a physician what the cells being counted are doing,” says Rachel Sparks, a clinical immunologist who was the lead author of the Nature Medicine study and is now a translational medicine physician with the drug giant AstraZeneca. “I just know that there are more neutrophils than normal, which may or may not indicate that they're behaving badly. We now have technology that allows us to see at a granular level what a cell is actually doing when a virus appears—how it's changing and reacting.”

Tsang's measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. His assessment tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules.

Such breakthroughs have been made possible thanks to a raft of new and improved technologies that have evolved over the past decade, allowing scientists like Tsang and Sparks to explore the intricacies of the immunome with newfound precision. These include devices that can count myriad different types of cells and biomolecules, as well as advanced sequencers that identify and characterize DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules. There are now instruments that also can measure thousands of changes and reactions that occur inside a single immune cell as it reacts to a virus or other threat.

Tsang and Spark's' team used data generated by such measurements to identify and characterize a series of signals distinctive to unhealthy immune systems. Then they used the presence or absence of these signals to create a numerical assessment of the health of a person's immunome—a score they call an “immune health metric,” or IHM.

To make sense of the crush of data being collected, Tsang's team used machine-learning algorithms that correlated the results of the many measurements with a patient's known health status and age. They also used AI to compare their findings with immune system data collected elsewhere. All this allowed them to determine and validate an IHM score for each person, and to place it on their spectrum, identifying that person as healthy or not.

It all came together for the first time with the publication of the Nature Medicine paper, in which Tsang and his colleagues reported the results from testing multiple immune variables in the 270 subjects. They also announced a remarkable discovery: Patients with different kinds of diseases reacted with similar disruptions to their immunomes. For instance, many showed a lower level of the aptly named natural killer immune cells, regardless of what they were suffering from. Critically, the immune profiles of those with diagnosed diseases tended to look very different from those belonging to the outwardly healthy people in the study. And, as expected, immune health declined in the older patients.

Faults in a certain part of the immune system might be at the root of some long covid cases, new research suggests.

But then the results got really interesting. In a few cases, the immune systems of  unhealthy and healthy people looked similar, with some people appearing near the “healthy” area of the chart even though they were known to have diseases. Most likely this was because their symptoms were in remission and not causing an immune reaction at the moment when their blood was drawn, Tsang told me. 

In other cases, people without a known disease showed up on the chart closer to those who were known to be sick. “Some of these people who appear to be in good health are overlapping with pathology that traditional metrics can't spot,” says Tsang, whose Nature Medicine paper reported that roughly half the healthy individuals in the study had IHM scores that overlapped with those of people known to be sick. Either these seemingly healthy people had normal immune systems that were busy fending off, say, a passing virus, or  their immune systems had been impacted by aging and the vicissitudes of life. Potentially more worrisome, they were harboring an illness or stress that was not yet making them ill but might do so eventually.

These findings have obvious implications for medicine. Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize. IHM-style evaluations could also provide clues as to why some people respond differently to viruses like the one that causes covid, and why vaccines—which are designed to activate a healthy immune system—might not work as well in people whose immune systems are compromised.

Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize.

“One of the more surprising things about the last pandemic was that all sorts of random younger people who seemed very healthy got sick and then they were gone,” says Mark Davis, a Stanford immunologist who helped pioneer the science being developed in labs like Tsang's. “Some had underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes, but some did not. So the question is, could we have pointed out that something was off with these folks' immune systems? Could we have diagnosed that and warned people to take extra precautions?”

Tsang's IHM test is designed to answer a simple question: What is the relative health of your immune system? But there are other assessments being developed to provide more detailed information on how the body is doing. Tsang's own team is working on a panel of additional scores aimed at getting finer detail on specific immune conditions. These include a test that measures the health of a person's bone marrow, which makes immune cells. “If you have a bone marrow stress or inflammatory condition in the bone marrow, you could have lower capacity to produce cells, which will be reflected by this score,” he says. Another detailed metric will measure protein levels to predict how a person will respond to a virus.

Tsang hopes that an IHM-style test will one day be part of a standard physical exam—a snapshot of a patient's immune system that could inform care. For instance, has a period of intense stress compromised the immune system, making it less able to fend off this season's flu? Will someone's score predict a better or worse response to a vaccine or a cancer drug? How does a person's immune system change with age?

Or, as I anxiously wondered while waiting to learn my own score, will the results reveal an underlying disorder or disease, silently ticking away until it shows itself?

The quest to create advanced tests like the IHM for the immune system began more than 15 years ago, when scientists like Mark Davis became frustrated with a field in which research—primarily in mice—was focused mostly on individual immune cells and proteins. In 2007 he launched the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center, one of the first efforts to conceptualize the human immunome as a holistic, body-wide network in human beings. Speaking by Zoom from his office in Palo Alto, California, Davis told me that the effort had spawned other projects, including a landmark twin study showing that a lot of immune variation is not genetic, which was then the prevailing theory, but is heavily influenced by environmental factors—a major shift in scientists' understanding.

Davis and others also laid the groundwork for tests like John Tsang's by discovering how a T cell—among the most common and important immune players—can recognize pathogens, cancerous cells, and other threats, triggering defensive measures that can include destroying the threat. This and other discoveries have revealed many of the basic mechanics of how immune cells work, says Davis, “but there's still a lot we have to learn.”

One researcher working with Davis in those early days was Shai Shen-Orr, who is now director of the Zimin Institute for AI Solutions in Healthcare at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, based in Haifa, Israel. (He's also a frequent collaborator with Tsang.) Shen-Orr, like Tsang, is a systems immunologist. He recalls that in 2007, when he was a postdoc in Davis's lab, immunologists had identified around 100 cell types and a similar number of cytokines—proteins that act as messengers in the immune system. But they weren't able to measure them simultaneously, which limited visibility into how the immune system works as a whole. Today, Shen-Orr says, immunologists can measure hundreds of cell types and thousands of proteins and watch them interact.

Shen-Orr's current lab has developed its own version of an immunome test that he calls IMM-AGE (short for “immune age”), the basics of which were published in a 2019 paper in Nature Medicine. IMM-AGE looks at the composition of people's immune systems—how many of each type of immune cell they have and how these numbers change as they age. His team has used this information primarily to ascertain a person's risk of heart disease.

Shen-Orr also has been a vociferous advocate for expanding the pool of test samples, which now come mostly from Americans and Europeans. “We need to understand why different people in different environments react differently and how that works,” he says. “We also need to test a lot more people—maybe millions.”

Tsang has seen why a limited sample size can pose problems. In 2013, he says, researchers at the National Institutes of Health came up with a malaria vaccine that was effective for almost everyone who got it during clinical trials conducted in Maryland. “But in Africa,” he says, “it only worked for about 25% of the people.” He attributes this to the significant differences in genetics, diet, climate, and other environmental factors that cause people's immunomes to develop differently. “Why?” he asks. “What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That's what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”

“What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That's what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”

For several years, Tsang and Shen-Orr have advocated going global with testing, “but there has been resistance,” Shen-Orr says. “Look, medicine is conservative and moves slowly, and the technology is expensive and labor intensive.” They finally got the audience they needed at a 2022 conference in La Jolla, California, convened by the Human Immunome Project, or HIP. (The organization was originally founded in 2016 to create more effective vaccines but had recently changed its name to emphasize a pivot from just vaccines to the wider field of immunome science.) It was in La Jolla that they met HIP's then-new chairperson, Jane Metcalfe, a cofounder of Wired magazine, who saw what was at stake.

“We've got all of these advanced molecular immunological profiles being developed,” she said, “but we can't begin to predict the breadth of immune system variability if we're  only testing small numbers of people in Palo Alto or Tel Aviv. And that's when the big aha moment struck us that we need sites everywhere to collect that information so we can build proper computer models and a predictive understanding of the human immune system.”

Following that meeting, HIP created a new scientific plan, with Tsang and Shen-Orr as chief science officers. The group set an ambitious goal of raising around $3 billion over the next 10 years—a goal Tsang and Metcalfe say will be met by working in conjunction with a broad network of public and private supporters. Cutbacks in federal funding for biomedical research in the US may limit funds from this traditional source, but HIP plans to work with government agencies outside the US too, with the goal of creating a comprehensive global immunological database.

HIP's plan is to first develop a pilot version based on Tsang's test, which it will call the Immune Monitoring Kit, to test a few thousand people in Africa, Australia, East Asia, Europe, the US, and Israel. The initial effort, according to Metcalfe, is expected to begin by the end of the year.  

After that, HIP would like to expand to some 150 sites around the world, eventually assessing about 250,000 people and collecting a vast cache of data and insights that Tsang believes will profoundly affect—even revolutionize—clinical medicine, public health, and drug development.

As HIP develops its pilot study to take on the world, John Tsang, for better or worse, has added one more North American Caucasian male to the small number of people who have received an IHM score to date. That would be me.

It took a long time to get my score, but Tsang didn't leave me hanging once he pinged me the red dot. “We plotted you with other participants who are clinically quite healthy,” he texted, referring to a cluster of black dots on the grid he had sent, although he cautioned that the group I'm being compared with includes only a few dozen people. “Higher IHM means better immune health,” he wrote, referring to my 0.35 score, which he described as a number on an arbitrary scale. “As you can see, your IHM is right in the middle of a bunch of people 20 years younger.”

This was a relief, given that our immune system, like so many other bodily functions, declines with age—though obviously at different rates. Yet I also felt a certain disappointment. To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn't. Tsang and other scientists are working on ways to extract more specific information from the tests. Still, he insists that the single score itself is a powerful tool to understand the general state of our immunomes, indicating the absence or presence of underlying health issues that might not be revealed in traditional testing.

To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn't.

I asked Tsang what my score meant for my future. “Your score is always changing depending on what you're exposed to and due to age,” he said, adding that the IHM is still so new that it's hard to know exactly what the score means until researchers do more work—and until HIP can evaluate and compare thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. They also need to keep testing me over time to see how my immune system changes as it's exposed to new perturbations and stresses.

For now, I'm left with a simple number. Though it tells me little about the detailed workings of my immune system, the good news is that it raises no red flags. My immune system, it turns out, is pretty healthy.

A few days after receiving my score from Tsang, I heard from Shen-Orr about more results. Tsang had shared my data with his lab so that he could run his IMM-AGE protocol on my immunome and provide me with another score to worry about. Shen-Orr's result put the age of my immune system at around 57—still 10 years younger than my true age.

Shai Shen-Orr imagines a day when people will be able to check their advanced IHM and IMM-AGE scores—or their HIP Immune Monitoring Kit score—on an app after a blood draw, the way they now check health data such as heart rate and blood pressure. Jane Metcalfe talks about linking IHM-type measurements and analyses with rising global temperatures and steamier days and nights to study how global warming might affect the immune system of, say, a newborn or a pregnant woman. “This could be plugged into other people's models and really help us understand the effects of pollution, nutrition, or climate change on human health,” she says.

“I think [in 10 years] I'll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients. And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”

Other clues could also be on the horizon. “At some point we'll have IHM scores that can provide data on who will be most affected by a virus during a pandemic,” Tsang says. Maybe that will help researchers engineer an immune system response that shuts down the virus before it spreads. He says it's possible to run a test like that now, but it remains experimental and will take years to fully develop, test for safety and accuracy, and establish standards and protocols for use as a tool of global public health. “These things take a long time,” he says. 

The same goes for bringing IHM-style tests into the exam room, so doctors like Rachel Sparks can use the results to help treat their patients. “I think in 10 years, with some effort, we really could have something useful,” says Stanford's Mark Davis. Sparks agrees. “I think by then I'll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients,” she says. “And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”

Personally, I'll wait for more details with a mix of impatience, curiosity, and at least a hint of concern. I wonder what more the immune circuitry deep inside me might reveal about whether I'm healthy at this very moment, or will be tomorrow, or next month, or years from now.

Everybody was spending so much time basking in the schadenfreude of Intel's financial woes, they forgot about the company's legitimately successful launch of the Lunar Lake consumer chips last year. Now that Intel has some support from Nvidia and backing from the current nativist regime occupying the White House, Intel is once again trying to push laptop battery life further without slacking on performance with Panther Lake chips. What's more interesting this time is how Intel hopes to dethrone AMD for graphics capabilities on a single chip.

(Full disclosure: Intel invited me to its chipset fab in Phoenix, Ariz. Travel and lodging were paid by Intel, but Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip.)

Intel promised Panther Lake chipsets would maintain the battery life expectations of the past chip generation, but now it will have options for better graphics performance thanks to a novel way of positioning the GPU, or graphics processing unit. Modern chips build entire GPU sections onto the die, namely, the small block of the semiconductor that accounts for most of the processing potential. This naturally limits the max size of the GPU section. Despite that limitation, recent AMD APUs, or accelerated processing units, like the Ryzen 9 AI Max+ 365 show enormous potential for graphics processing. Intel's solution is simple, at least on paper. Intel removed the GPU onto its own die, and included a special “die-to-die interconnect” that it claims offers seamless communications, as if the GPU tile existed together with the compute tile.

Intel detailed three different versions of Panther Lake using Intel's new 18A 3nm process with an 8MB side cache. The company stopped short of mentioning how many varieties of chips or SKUs customers would need to learn before buying a PC (last year's Lunar Lake had nine total SKUs). The smallest of the three is an 8-core CPU featuring four performance (P) cores and four low-power efficiency (LPE) cores. The performance cores are based on the new Cougar Cove architecture, while the efficiency cores are now labeled Darkmont. There's another 16-core version of the chip with an additional eight Darkmont efficiency cores.

Panther Lake is supposed to one-up both Lunar Lake and the much-maligned Arrow Lake chips. Its CPU performance is supposed to hit 10% better single-thread performance over last year's light-laptop chips at the same power, but more importantly, it could do 50% better with multi-thread performance, which could make for faster work in intense tasks like video editing.

Panther Lake's GPU now sports the new Xe3 GPU cores. The top-end version of Panther Lake can sport 12 Xe3 cores compared to just four. Last year's Lunar Lake chips maxed out with eight Xe2 GPU cores. Suffice it to say, the GPU is more powerful than before, especially with its new 12 ray tracing units to support more accurate lighting effects in 3D programs or games. Intel claims the new GPU has 50% better performance compared to the top-end Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips. Bigger is going to be better, at least according to Intel, especially since Panther Lake is supposed to offer the same power as Arrow Lake-H chips at 40% less wattage. Xe3 is also supposed to hit 50% better top-end performance over Lunar Lake, but of course, that's going to demand more juice from your machine.

Top-end Panther Lake chips can expect to support up to 96GB of LPDDR5 RAM, plus Bluetooth 6 and Wi-Fi 7. Otherwise, the chips may be able to make video calls look a little clearer thanks to improved signal processing from the webcam. We'll all need to be patient, little PC buyers, for accurate numbers in gaming and graphics benchmarks, which likely won't be around until the company starts shipping the chips later this year. For the rest of us who care more about how these CPUs perform on a machine you can buy, we'll see more as major laptop makers share their wares at CES 2026 in January.

Last month, Qualcomm shared the details on its next-gen Snapdragon X2 Elite and Elite Extreme chips designed for lightweight PCs. The ARM-based CPUs were supposed to show up Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD Strix Point with better performances at much lower wattages, meaning they could be even better for battery life than the previous generation. Intel's promising something very similar, but with the same x86 microarchitecture, which won't lead to the numerous issues with app and driver compatibility faced by Qualcomm-powered PCs. As I mentioned last month, gaming is still Qualcomm's Achilles Heel for its PC endeavors.

Qualcomm is still fighting to keep in front of the AI wars. TOPS, or trillions of operations per second, is normally how companies describe the performance of their separate neural processing unit (NPU) dedicated to low-end or repetitive AI tasks. And still, it's rarely a good indicator of how strong the chip is for processing AI. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite features a new NPU promising 70 TOPS of performance. The Panther Lake's new NPU 5 on all varieties of the chip goes up to 50 TOPS of performance. What does any of that mean? Nothing, at least in practice. A PC's GPU will still be better for more-intensive AI processing than the NPU can handle.

So we still need to see what comes out of AMD, but I wouldn't be surprised if even more chips down the line feature a die-to-die GPU connection. Chipmakers may keep pushing AI performance, but if it means we get laptop chips that can play games without the need for battery-sucking discrete GPUs, there's reason to get excited.

Obsessing isn't just for humans. In a study out today, scientists have found evidence that dogs, too, can become addicted to certain objects—and especially, their favorite toy.

The researchers observed dozens of dogs as they interacted with their most prized toys. About a third of dogs exhibited addiction-like behaviors, such as becoming especially agitated when the toy was kept from them, they found.

These findings might come as no surprise to dog owners. But the researchers say their work is the first to empirically document the phenomenon.

“This is the first scientific study on addictive-like behavior in dogs,” study author Stefanie Riemer, a behavioral biologist from the Messerli Research Institute for Human-Animal Interaction at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, told Gizmodo.

Riemer notes that many pet owners and trainers use a (rather on the nose, it turns out) nickname for dogs that seemingly just can't get enough of their toys: “ball junkies.”

But it's never been clear whether this sort of behavior actually mirrors how addiction manifests in people. “After all, just being highly motivated, or highly aroused or very toy-focused does not imply an addiction,” Riemer notes.

Scientists already knew that it's possible to induce addictive-like behaviors in animals like rats, which has allowed us to better study potential treatments for substance use disorders or other addictions in humans. But it's still an open question as to whether animals besides humans can develop addictions naturally, the authors said.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers tried to apply the criteria we use to determine addiction in humans to dogs.

The study involved 105 dogs, with the most common breeds being Malinois, Border Collies, and Labrador Retrievers. All of the dogs were described as toy-motivated by their owners. For the experiments, the researchers used toys the owners said their dogs would likely love the most, and also included the dog's favorite toy at home if the owners brought it with them.

Across all the tests, the researchers found that 33 dogs exhibited addictive-like behaviors with the toys. These behaviors included dogs staying laser focused on the toy if it was kept in the room but placed somewhere unreachable; dogs refusing to play with their owner in other ways; and even dogs turning down a free treat.

“This could indicate that the high motivation for playing conflicts with other important activities—the dogs are willing to forgo other activities or rewards when they are focused on the toy, even when they cannot access it,” Riemer explained. “It shows that the toys have a high salience for these dogs and that they are craving access to these toys.”

Perhaps the most illustrative example of addictive-like behavior was seen when the toys were entirely removed, she added. Some dogs were simply unable to calm down for up to 15 minutes after the toys were gone, their heart rates remaining elevated. That sort of prolonged arousal and high frustration seen in these dogs, Riemer said, suggests their motivation for toy playing could be considered “excessive and maladaptive”—an important criteria for diagnosing human addiction.

The team's findings were published Thursday in Scientific Reports. A video of one of the dogs in these tests can be seen below and on YouTube.

The researchers say their findings should be taken with some caution. It's hard to accurately measure and classify addiction in people, let alone non-verbal animals. And there's still much to learn about the potential nature of addiction in dogs.

One important lingering question is exactly how and why these behaviors can emerge. The researchers found some evidence that the seeds for excessive toy-playing tend to show up in puppies. They're also conducting a follow-up study examining whether certain breeds, particularly some kinds of working dogs, are more predisposed to toy addiction than others. Because this study focused on dogs already known to be toy-motivated, though, it's not clear just how prevalent addictive-like behaviors are in dogs generally.

All that said, Riemer doesn't want owners to overly worry about their dogs if they simply love playing with their toys in healthy amounts.

“Many dogs colloquially referred to as ‘ball junkies' are just highly motivated, but they have no problems when the play is stopped,” she said. “I think toy play is a great reward for many dogs, but for the ‘extreme' dogs, steps should be taken to reduce their fixation on toys.”

Riemer is now working on a grant to explore ADHD in dogs, since it seems to have lots of parallels with addictive-like behaviors in their research. Other studies have also suggested dogs might be a good model for better understanding ADHD in people.

Intel is trying to get into the good graces of gamers with its big Panther Lake chipset reveal. In that vein, Intel took more time to explain an update to its two-year-old AI upscaler, XeSS 2. No, we're not getting XeSS 3. No, Intel hasn't confirmed what the hell it's doing with future GPUs. Instead, like Nvidia before, Intel is getting into multi-frame generation to artificially push game frame rates higher. However, unlike Nvidia, Intel isn't restricting players to its own chips.

(Full disclosure: Intel invited me to its chipset fab in Phoenix, Ariz. Travel and lodging were paid by Intel, but Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip.)

Multi-frame generation is a word that could create a typhoon of controversy among PC gaming circles with its mere utterance. At its simplest, it's a process of shoving multiple AI-generated frames in between two frames rendered by the PC itself. Nvidia sold its latest RTX 50-series GPUs on the promise that multi-frame generation would push games well beyond their rasterization performance, or their ability to put a big number into your fps counter when playing games. Naysayers have been calling frame generation “fake frames,” and it's a moniker that's not entirely wrong. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went full used car salesman at CES 2025 when he promised a lower-end RTX 5070 graphics card could beat the company's last flagship GPU, the RTX 4090.

In practice, frame generation makes sense for lower-end devices more than some high-end desktop PC that already has the graphics capabilities to push the utmost pixels. That's where XeSS 2's multi-frame gen capabilities could start to change the nature of how we think of lighter PCs or—potentially—supercharge handheld PCs like MSI's Claw series.

Frame generation technology relies on PCs having enough data to help stick the AI-made frames in between the ones rendered by the PC. Common wisdom states that most games want between 45 and 55 fps before you kick in frame generation. This helps eschew problems with odd visual glitches and artifacts, where you'll find visual discrepancies that weren't meant to be there. In a roundtable with reporters, Tom Petersen, Intel's big cheese behind graphics and software, said he was fine using multi-frame gen at framerates as low as 30, which bumps it up at 4x to approximately 120 fps. Intel showed off the upcoming Painkiller reboot with a new performance monitor that can show frame rates before and after frame generation, akin to Steam's updated performance overlay.

With the quadrupling in frame generation (that means there are four AI frames between each rendered frame), the game was running at around 150 fps on a pre-production version of Panther Lake with 12 Xe3 GPU cores, on a reference platform running at 45W. Frame generation creates latency that discerning players can feel and see. This is due to the nature of the technology, since it has to know the next frame in a sequence to insert the AI-generated frames between them. Petersen said the latency could be more, depending on the game and framerate you're playing at, but it will be down to users whether they opt in or not.

“There are a whole bunch of technologies that have not been announced that could make that better, but right now you can see some just turn off frame gen,” Petersen said. He later referred to potential technology that would use AI to predict mouse clicks, which could potentially allow the game to artificially remove the sensation of latency without removing it altogether. In the future, there's an opportunity for games to have predictive frame gen that kicks in only in certain moments where gamers won't feel the impact of latency as much. He even went as far as to say frame rates closer to 30 would actually be better than doing frame gen at higher frame rates, as the latency isn't as noticeable at lower frame rates as higher frame rates. That being said, I spoke to others at Intel who may still recommend at least 45 fps before enabling multi-frame generation. Your mileage may vary.

I ran through the Painkiller demo at around 50 fps, which turned into around 200 fps on-screen playing at 1080p. The game is as dark and gray as an older Xbox 360 title when we all somehow thought Gears of War looked great. It was more difficult to spot issues with textures or geometry through all the grime. However, the fire effects—which previously posed problems for Intel's 2x frame gen technology—seemed closer to how it would look without using upscaling or frame generation.

Petersen wasn't afraid to share his opinion regarding Nvidia's multi-frame gen beholden to its latest RTX 50-series of GPUs. “Trash,” he called it under his breath. He's half-joking, maybe, but Intel now sees itself as an underdog fighting a behemoth; it's allowing itself to act scrappy. Still, what's more important is how well its Panther Lake chips can perform in gaming scenarios before you enable any AI options. Intel claims it has optimized power delivery on the CPU and GPU to reduce stuttering in games.

XeSS 2's multi-frame gen isn't the kind of technology that makes expensive hardware better. Instead, it offers more options for lower-end systems. XeSS 2 remains hardware agnostic, meaning it can run on any device, whether it has an Intel or AMD chip inside. XeSS 2 works on two different kernels for AMD and Intel devices, and on AMD-powered systems, it requires a compatibility layer that will make the upscaler work slightly worse than on Intel's chips.

Intel is now the only major U.S. chipmaker still developing hardware-agnostic AI upscaling for PC. At the same time, XeSS is still lagging behind the competition in terms of supported games. AMD has turned its attention to the latest version of FidelityFX Super Resolution, or FSR 4. The upgrade over FSR 3 and 3.5 has allowed upscaled games to look less muddy with sharper details in both the foreground and background. AMD relegated FSR 4 to its latest Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs, as in all those currently using RDNA 4 microarchitecture. AMD recently claimed its latest AI upscaling drivers are available in more than 85 titles. Nvidia's latest version of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS 4) AI upscaler is currently available in more than 175 games, according to the company.

In May, Intel said XeSS is available in more than 200 games, but if you're regularly playing the latest titles, it can be a crapshoot which games support Intel's upscaling and which don't. Intel obviously hopes more developers sign on once they see what XeSS 2's multi-frame gen can do. XeSS multi-frame gen should be available to some games in the future, though players may need to use Intel software to enable it to override on games that are already compatible with Intel's upscaler.

NASA has grown extremely dependent on its commercial partners in the past few years, outsourcing the development of almost all of its spacecraft and missions so that it can, so the theory goes, save some of that sweet federal money.

But it seems this bargain might not be paying off, after all. In a paper published recently in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, researchers revealed that NASA's commercial partnerships are not necessarily more cost-effective than if the agency had built the spacecraft itself.

The findings come as NASA faces severe budget cuts and massive layoffs that threaten several of its most ambitious and successful missions—while the private space industry continues to grow.

NASA has been outsourcing its spacecraft and scientific instruments for decades. And in the last decade, it has become particularly dependent on Elon Musk's SpaceX. The agency uses SpaceX's Falcon rockets to launch many of its missions, and it relies on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport both cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA is also hoping to use SpaceX's still-in-development Starship to make its ambitious plans to return to the Moon and establish a permanent base there, the Artemis missions, a reality

Winding the clock back to the Apollo era and earlier, however, the agency built, owned, and operated almost all of its rockets and capsules. Project Mercury, NASA's first human spaceflight program which ran from 1961 to 1963, used spacecraft built in-house, and the same was true for the Apollo program to send astronauts to the Moon—still the only successful human missions to reach our natural satellite. NASA was also hugely involved in the design and development of the Space Shuttle fleet, the first reusable spacecraft that could transport cargo to orbit and back.

It wasn't until the shuttle program ended in 2011 that NASA really began looking to industry to build its spacecraft for a fixed price. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing all bid for a chance to build spacecraft that would transport NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Other companies like Lockheed Martin built NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, as well as its Mars Reconnoissance Orbiter, while Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines, and Firefly Aerospace have all designed lunar landers to transport the agency's payloads to the Moon.

The new paper looked at 69 projects, including 22 spacecraft built by NASA, and 47 by industry. It revealed two major findings: First, commercial space companies do excel at building low-cost, mass-manufactured spacecraft that don't require too much specialization. They are also slightly more efficient at building low-risk satellites than NASA.

Second, and perhaps more controversially, when it comes to larger, high-impact and flagship science missions like OSIRIS-REx, industry players tend to run into the same constraints as the agency. In other words, they are just as inefficient as NASA, if not more so. These missions, the report suggests, are likely better off built in-house, by NASA. If nothing else, they are no cheaper when outsourced to industry, the analysis finds.

The research is compelling. But as the Trump administration continues to slash NASA's budget and staff, it seems unclear what, if any, learnings the agency might take from the findings—especially as its core, flagship science missions, including Artemis, remain under such clear threat of funding cuts.

It feels like most of us are getting our brains turned to mush by the internet. But a new study suggests that older people are at least having their mush stimulated. According to a study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, older adults who have access to digital communication tools displayed better cognitive function and were less likely to show signs of depression than their less digitally adept peers.

The study, which looked at data collected by the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, included nearly 10,000 participants, half in the “digital inclusion” group that had access to “internet-enabled information and communications technologies,” and half in the “digital exclusion” group that did not. Folks in the digital inclusion group participated in a variety of online activities, including chatting, reading the news, watching videos, playing games, and managing money. Those who were digitally excluded didn't perform any internet-based activities.

The people in the digital inclusion group showed higher levels of global cognition, which included executive function and episodic or long-term memory. Those who were in the digital inclusion group also displayed fewer symptoms of severe depression. Though that's not to say that the folks who were “digitally included” were happy, necessarily. Members of both groups reported experiencing similar levels of “feeling blue,” hopelessness, and delayed memory recall.

None of this is to suggest the internet is good for you, either. As the study points out, it's possible that being online did help to keep older people engaged and connected, which helped keep their brains sharper and staved off some of the more depressive feelings caused by social isolation. However, it's also possible that there is a bit of self-selection happening, where people who have already experienced a cognitive decline or are experiencing more depressive conditions are less likely to be able to use the internet.

Past studies have also shown that internet usage can lead to addiction among older people, which can result in deteriorating mental and physical health, including anxiety, depression, and social fear. There are also real dangers of giving people who are not computer literate access to the internet, as they're significantly more likely to fall victim to scams. We also know that more elderly people are using the internet in the wake of the pandemic, for better or worse. So maybe we should prioritize making sure they're able to squeeze the benefits out of that internet access before the worst parts of the web take hold.

I've been hitting the “it's a bad time to be into VR” note a lot lately, and, sorry ya'll, I stand by that stance… but maybe not for long. As discouraging as this year has been for VR enthusiasts (Meta barely mentioned the Quest at its annual Connect dev conference), Valve might swoop in sooner than you think to give VR hardware a shred of hope or at least a little bit of excitement.

According to a report for XR Institute (a Chinese analyst group that I've cited before for accurate forecasts on smart glasses), Valve's long-rumored “Deckard” headset is finally entering mass production, with a chance that it could be available before the end of the year. XR Institute says that it expects Valve to launch Deckard (an internal codename for the headset) during the holiday season with a starting yearly production of about 400,000 to 600,000 units. That's about the initial Vision Pro release levels of stock and certainly much more encouraging than rumors about Samsung's Project Moohan, which suggest a launch in South Korea only to start.

While Deckard's existence is from news, its imminent arrival is a big deal, not just because of Valve's success in the hardware space with the Steam Deck, but because of the de-emphasis of VR by other major players in the space. Apple is reportedly deprioritizing a cheaper Vision Pro to focus on smart glasses, while Meta already started that same train by launching three new pairs of smart glasses and zero new VR/XR headsets.

While this might not be a shining moment for VR writ large, I like the prospects of a Valve-made VR headset. While other companies like Apple and most likely Samsung tend to take a more scattershot approach to XR/VR, incorporating work and communication, I expect Valve to focus more on gaming and less on the other stuff, which… is a good thing. I'm not saying there aren't cool or fun experiences to be had outside of gaming in an XR/VR headset, but entertainment (games in particular) is still the most compelling of those experiences.

Don't get me wrong, the audience for VR games is niche, even despite the ascendence of VR headsets over the last five years, but it seems to me that the people who use headsets the most are the ones who are more deeply invested in playing games in them. VR gaming enthusiasts' response to Valve's headset is still dependent on a lot of things, though, price chief among them. Rumors from earlier this year have suggested Deckard could cost around $1,000, which is notably a lot more expensive than the Quest 3 and even more so than the Quest 3S, but still well under the $3,500 Vision Pro.

To justify that price, I assume Valve will have to lean into its display tech, offering better resolution and probably better performance than competitors like the Quest 3 and 3S. A lighter headset would be a nice perk, but I'm not sure what Valve will have to offer on the front, if anything. SteamOS in VR seems like an obvious opportunity here, though, again, I'm not sure anyone will be rushing out to buy a new VR headset just for the UI. There's still a lot we don't know about Deckard, so it's hard to say for sure whether it'll be the jolt of excitement VR fans are pining for, but at least (between Project Moohan and Deckard) there's something to look forward to.

New export rules tighten China's grip on magnet and phosphor tech.

China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth elements, adding new items to a growing list of restricted materials and processing technologies. The updated rules, which take effect in December, cover not just elements like holmium, thulium, erbium, and ytterbium, but also the technical know-how around how they're turned into magnets.

In a mirror of U.S. semiconductor export policy, Chinese officials framed the move as a national security imperative and signaled that licenses will be denied for end-uses tied to defense or semiconductors. Under the new rules, which are an extension of those announced in April, foreign companies will need China's permission to export magnets that contain trace amounts of rare-earth materials sourced from China, or were produced using the country's extraction methods. As the dominant supplier of rare earth minerals globally, China exerting more pressure on supply could have knock-on effects.

Ultimately, this policy decision poses a direct risk to the building blocks of hardware, starting with storage. High-density HDDs use neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets to drive the actuator arms that read data off spinning platters. A typical voice-coil motor depends on neodymium mixed with dysprosium or praseodymium to maintain coercivity at high temperatures. With China controlling the bulk of global processing capacity for those alloys, any licensing restrictions are likely to hit costs and delivery timelines first, and that's before you get to the motors in fans and cooling systems.

Displays could also be hit. LED backlights and LCD panels rely on phosphor compounds doped with europium, terbium, and yttrium to produce vivid colors. Europium and terbium are both squarely in the new controls, with export licenses now required for dozens of items used in the production chain. That puts panel manufacturers, which are already under margin pressure, in the firing line again.

Even silicon isn't safe. Cerium oxide slurries, used in wafer polishing and glass finishing, may also come under pressure if restrictions expand to cover recycling or processing gear. These aren't headlining materials, but they play a crucial role in production flows across fabs and panel assembly lines. If licenses start dragging or pricing shifts, delays in component manufacturing are almost inevitable. Indeed, the supply of rare earth minerals is just one of the factors fuelling growing concern around looming PC hardware shortages.

None of this will guarantee price hikes tomorrow, but it raises the odds of sudden friction in parts of the supply chain that often go unnoticed. Magnets and phosphors aren't exciting or sexy, but they're everywhere and extremely difficult to replace. In April, HDD maker Western Digital launched a program to recover rare-earth materials from retired drives, which is an obvious attempt to safeguard against this very scenario.

1. Quick Links2. Peripheral Deals3. Audio Deals4. Keyboard Deals3. Gaming Mice Deals

The deals are still flowing after Amazon's Prime Big Deals Day, with plenty of deals still available even though the event is over, and some new ones are becoming available from ongoing sales at other e-tailers like Newegg and Best Buy. This remains a great time to pick up some new peripherals to improve your PC experience — whether it's a fan-favorite productivity mouse or a standalone gaming microphone that's been going strong for years. In fact, we're still seeing plenty of great deals on everything from clicky mechanical keyboards and ultra-lightweight gaming mice to wireless headsets and 4K webcams.

We only pick the best deals: peripherals we've reviewed and tested, and that we continue to test over the years, tracking durability, comfort, and overall longevity. While the stakes might not seem as high on a gaming mouse or a headset as they are on a GPU or even an SSD, they're higher than you think — after all, peripherals are what you interact with most often, every single day. The right keyboard or mouse will probably have a much bigger impact on how you work (and play), at least as far as your immediate perception goes, than will swapping out any of your PC's internal components.

This lightweight gaming mouse from Logitech weighs only 80 grams and is one of the only modern FPS gaming mice to feature a truly ambidextrous design, with the ability to switch the side buttons for either left or right-handed gamers. With a super-accurate 25,600 DPI sensor and excellent battery life, the Logitech G Pro is a good choice as your main gaming mouse. 

An all-time low, and half price 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

Razer's flagship wireless Basilisk V3 Pro features Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, Gen-3 optical mouse switches, and 13 zones of bright RGB underglow lighting. It gets up to 110 hours of battery life and is compatible with Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle and Mouse Dock Pro.

Lowest ever price

HyperX's QuadCast S is the pretty, colorful version of one of our favorite microphones of all time — and it's currently on sale for 50% off. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. 

The Logitech Brio 4K was the first 4K webcam on the market back when it first debuted in 2017. There are lots of 4K webcams now, but the Brio 4K is still a solid performer with good auto light correction, a 90-degree field of view, and 5x HD zoom. This isn't the cheapest we've seen it, but it's pretty close — and definitely cheaper than most 4K webcams. 

These booming speakers bring 5.1 surround to your PC in a big way. They have wireless connectivity for the rear speakers, a lifesaver, and built-in lighting that spruces up your room. This 280W (peak) system also has a full-featured software suite to tailor it to your needs. 

These compact speakers have a 32W peak, but they still deliver decent bass thanks to the built-in subwoofer located on the back of one of the speakers. They connect via USB, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth 5.2, giving you plenty of options. They are tuned for gaming, so serious audiophiles should look elsewhere for music-oriented speakers. 

Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset is comfortable and lightweight, sounds good for both music and gaming, and has one of the best on-headset boom microphones we've ever tested.

While this headset from Logitech's premium ""inclusive"" Aurora line isn't the only white headset on the market, it is awfully comfortable — and it's one of the few headsets our peripherals editor has that almost always just works.

Panther Lake brings the power efficiency and graphics performance of Lunar Lake and the platform flexibility of Arrow Lake all together on one SoC


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel revealed new information about its upcoming Panther Lake chips made on its new 18A node at an event in Arizona, including claims that the chips can deliver 50% more performance at similar power to its Lunar Lake chips or reduce power by 30% in multi-threaded work compared to its Arrow Lake-H processors. Going by past Intel launch cycles, we're likely to hear more about these chips at CES 2026. Intel says ""broad market availability"" will start in January 2026.

These sorts of improvements are badly needed because, in recent years, Intel has faced a triple threat in the laptop processor market. AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all want a piece of the lucrative premium laptop pie, and especially in the case of Qualcomm and Apple, the arrival of high-performance, highly efficient Arm cores on SoCs boasting powerful NPUs and GPUs has forced Intel to up every part of its game to stay competitive on performance and battery life.

Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake Core Ultra CPUs proved that relatively short battery life wasn't an inherent problem of Intel x86 products, but the highly integrated design of Lunar Lake SoCs (combining both compute and memory on a single package) meant that laptop OEMs didn't have nearly as much flexibility and control over system configurations and costs as they might get with a Meteor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU and discrete memory packages, whether in soldered or SO-DIMM flavors.

In exchange for that greater flexibility in memory configurations, Arrow Lake-H SoCs come with tradeoffs of their own. Arrow Lake systems certainly don't have bad battery life, but Lunar Lake is still the best thing going for unplugged efficiency from Intel CPUs.

Lunar Lake also includes a GPU built on Intel's latest Xe2 graphics architecture, while Arrow Lake-H CPUs use an older, larger Xe-LPG+ GPU, which has its roots in first-gen Arc Alchemist products, to deliver relatively similar performance (but likely with worse power efficiency).

Arrow Lake-H also carries over Meteor Lake's rather limited pair of Crestmont E-cores in its low-power island, even as its on-die E-cores got an upgrade to the more advanced Skymont microarchitecture that also underpins the quartet of low-power E-cores on Lunar Lake. Are you lost yet?

This dizzying mix of performance levels, power efficiency targets, architectural generations, and system configuration restrictions across Intel mobile platforms is a headache for consumers and laptop makers alike.

Enter Panther Lake, the great unifier that Intel hopes will bring the best of Lunar Lake's power efficiency improvements and Arrow Lake's performance scalability together in one common package.

Panther Lake SoCs are all built up from the same cutting-edge P-cores, E-cores, and iGPU architecture, while affording laptop makers more freedom to tailor their products to a wider range of buyers and price points. And as Intel's first product to ship with a compute tile fabricated on the latest 18A process node, Panther Lake has a ton to prove.

At its most recent Tech Tour event, held in the backyard of its leading-edge fabs in Chandler, Arizona, Intel walked us through everything that makes Panther Lake tick. Here's the story so far.

Panther Lake's compute tile is one of the first products to be fabricated on Intel's leading-edge 18A node. As a quick refresher, 18A is Intel's (and likely the industry's) first high-volume process to incorporate two major innovations meant to enable future scaling and power efficiency gains: gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, which Intel calls RibbonFETs, and a backside power delivery network, which Intel calls PowerVia.

 




Intel describes its RibbonFETs as ""the ultimate transistor,"" since their gate structure allows for what the company calls ""complete control"" over the channel. Compared to FinFETs, whose gate structure doesn't extend to the bottom of the channel and therefore has a ""weak point"" for controlling leakage current, the RibbonFET gate structure entirely wraps around the channel (as defined by the stack of silicon nanosheets at the heart of the device), minimizing undesirable leakage current when the transistor is off. Among other important characteristics, less leakage current means less energy wasted while a chip is operating.

Intel also claims that RibbonFETs are more flexible for designers than FinFETs. The number of ribbons, as well as their widths, can be adjusted to tailor the transistor's performance characteristics to the needs of a given cell.

 




PowerVia, Intel's implementation of a backside power delivery network, introduces a second novel approach to chip fabrication. As silicon processes have gotten denser and denser, efficiently routing both signal and power wires above the transistors has gotten more and more challenging as those wires compete for ever more precious real estate.

Instead of building up both power and signal wires above the transistor, the backside power delivery approach first creates the transistors and signal wiring on the front side of the wafer. In the next production step, the wafer gets flipped over, and the back side gets polished away until the transistor contacts are revealed. The power delivery metal layers are then connected directly to the transistors.

Intel says that PowerVia allows for 10% higher density and relaxed routing on the front side of the wafer. For power delivery, the back-side metal layers reduce power loss from the package to the transistor by 30%.

All in all, 18A allows for a 15% higher frequency at the same power as Intel 3 and a 1.3x density improvement compared to the same process. Designers can also choose to harness 18A's advances to deliver a 25% power reduction at the same performance level compared to Intel 3.

Intel didn't go into fine detail on the changes it made to the Cougar Cove P-core on Panther Lake versus Lunar and Arrow Lake's Lion Cove, or Panther's Darkmont E-core versus Skymont. The improvements the company did discuss for the Cougar Cove P-core are typical refinements of an existing CPU architecture, such as an improved branch predictor and a more capacious translation lookaside buffer (TLB). As Intel says, ""we didn't go in and change the width, we didn't change the depth, we optimized.""

 




At a high level, Intel says that Cougar Cove now employs an ""AI-based"" power management approach that can adjust the aggressiveness of certain functional units, such as the prefetcher, on the fly in response to the demands of diverse workloads.

Another change in Cougar Cove is improved prediction behavior in some cases of memory disambiguation. As Intel puts it, when a processor is executing a program, it will perform load and store instructions for memory accesses; sometimes those instructions are connected. Cougar Cove has improved logic to predict when a load and store are connected and use that information to schedule the load correctly. When this prediction is correct, it can result in higher IPC.

Intel also notes that the move to the 18A process gave it the ability to grow some fundamental structures in Cougar Cove, and the TLB was one of the primary beneficiaries. A bigger TLB means that more complex workloads run faster and more reliably, according to Intel.

Cougar Cove also carries forward and refines branch prediction changes introduced with Lion Cove in Lunar Lake. Lion Cove featured improved branch prediction algorithms and delivered low-latency predictions even for branches far ahead in the instruction stream. Intel says Cougar Cove incorporates lessons it learned from shipping Lion Cove silicon to improve performance. It refined some branch prediction algorithms and grew the sizes of each level in the predictor to further lower latency. Cougar Cove can also store better metadata about past prediction results to improve accuracy.

Intel says this all means the Cougar Cove branch predictor can deliver lower latency, more prediction bandwidth, and higher prediction accuracy. These improvements positively impact energy efficiency and performance— a more accurate and more responsive predictor means the CPU core spends less time doing wasteful work and more time doing useful work.

 




Improvements in the Darkmont E-core are also largely evolutionary versus Lunar Lake's Skymont. As with Cougar Cove, Darkmont can now use a dynamic algorithm to adjust the aggressiveness of its prefetcher to better balance responsiveness and power efficiency in response to the demands of varying workloads.

Like Cougar Cove, Darkmont offers improved branch prediction accuracy. It also saves power in the front end by employing loop stream detection, a technique that allows the front end of the chip to power down during certain instruction sequences. Darkmont also broadens the cases where the chip can employ nanocode sequences to execute complex instructions that traditionally would have been handled by an x86 CPU's microcode engine. Nanocode was introduced in Skymont to improve both performance and power efficiency.

As Intel puts it, the microcode sequencer is a giant ROM that comes into play when certain complex x86 instructions need to be executed. Loading from that ROM is a serial process, and it can only service one decoder at a time, meaning that other front end units will be blocked if they were also to need instruction sequences from the microcode ROM at the same time. Nanocode prevents this blocking behavior by taking some of those microcode instructions and embedding them into programmable logic arrays in each of the three front-end decoders of the E-core.

Since those PLAs are present in each of the three front-ends of the Darkmont core, Intel says the core can run instructions that formerly resided in microcode as ""parallel, out-of-order microcode-like sequences."" Intel says Darkmont has more cases and more optimized cases where its front-ends can employ nanocode and leave the microcode sequencer alone.

Not every part of a Panther Lake SoC uses 18A, of course. Intel uses the same ""disaggregated architecture"" concept that debuted in Meteor Lake and was refined on Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake. This approach separates different functional units of an SoC into individually fabricated ""tiles"" that are made in Intel's own fabs or at foundries like TSMC, then joined together using Intel's Foveros packaging technology.

In turn, each Panther Lake compute tile, fabricated in-house on 18A, is built up from three basic core complexes. A compute tile can (so far) include up to four Cougar Cove P-cores, up to eight Darkmont E-cores, and a separate ""low-power island"" cluster of four more Darkmont E-cores that are meant to ""confine"" suitable workloads to a lower-power compute domain for extra battery life, an idea introduced in Meteor Lake and refined further in Lunar Lake.

Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake both relied on a pair of Crestmont E-cores in this island that were limited in both power and clock speeds to maximize energy savings, but their limited performance meant that more power-hungry parts of the chip might be awakened more often if a task exceeded their limited capabilities. Lunar Lake got four Skymont E-cores in this island with their own power rail, which allowed them to be clocked higher and do more demanding work before tasks had to be shifted to the P-cores on that SoC.

As an evolution of Skymont, Panther Lake's Darkmont low-power E-cores allow more demanding tasks to stay confined to the low-power island for longer, and they can contribute to multi-threaded workloads for extra parallelism when it's needed. They're not on the main ring bus that connects the main clusters of P- and E-cores on the Panther Lake SoC, however, so they don't share the L3 cache of the larger core cluster. Instead, they have access to a power-efficient 8MB ""memory-side cache"" that's shared with all the other compute agents on the tile.

This side cache is coherent with the rest of the cache hierarchy across the chip, and coherence among all the caches on Panther Lake is managed by a home agent that communicates with separate coherency agents on each compute domain.

The 18A compute tiles also include Intel's fifth-generation NPU, seventh-generation image processing unit (IPU) for use with premium webcams in laptops, and Xe media and display engines separated from the graphics tile.

For more information on the Xe3 graphics architecture and the two iGPUs that use it on Panther Lake, as well as software and power management improvements, check out our dedicated article.

 




So far, Intel has created two different 18A compute dies that it mixes and matches with two different integrated GPUs (and possibly two different I/O tiles) to create three distinct Panther Lake SoCs, each with different cost and performance targets.

The smallest Panther Lake SoC has four P-cores paired with four low-power E-cores, just like we saw with Lunar Lake. Intel didn't disclose the full specs of its cache hierarchy, but since it lacks higher-power E-core clusters with their own L3 cache, our educated guess is this chip likely only has 12MB of cache shared across its four P-cores. It includes a small Xe3 GPU that offers up to four Xe3 graphics cores. This chip can use traditional DDR5 SO-DIMMs or LPCAMM modules at speeds up to 6800 MT/s, or soldered LPDDR5X running at up to 6400 MT/s.

 




For storage and peripheral controllers, the platform controller tile on the baby Panther Lake SoC offers 12 PCIe lanes - four Gen 5 and eight Gen 4 - which is enough to connect a Gen 5 SSD and perhaps lower-end storage devices or a discrete GPU. Between its relatively low core count, modest graphics horsepower, and limited memory speeds, we're likely to see this chip in more entry-level laptops that prioritize light weight and battery life over absolute performance.

The midsize Panther Lake SoC adds eight E-cores on a ring bus shared with the four P-cores, in addition to the four low-power E-cores in their dedicated island. Intel says this compute die has up to 18MB of shared L3 across the P- and E-cores. This midsize SoC keeps the same 4 Xe Core graphics tile as the small SoC.

 




This chip can take advantage of faster memory than its smaller sibling. Like the small chip, it can use both DDR5 modules or soldered LPDDR5X, but it supports DDR5 at speeds up to 7200 MT/s and LPDDR5X at up to 8533 MT/s.

The midsize Panther Lake chip also has expanded PCIe connectivity from its larger platform controller tile: as many as eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes and 12 Gen 5 lanes. Intel wouldn't comment on particular Panther Lake OEM designs in the pipeline, but between its expanded compute resources, richer PCIe connectivity, and support for higher-speed memory versus its smaller sibling, this chip seems well-suited for pairing with a discrete GPU in thin and light laptops, an approach that some Intel partners took with Meteor Lake chips.

 




The largest Panther Lake SoC retains the same 4P+8E+4LPE CPU core configuration as the midsize SoC but adds a much larger and more powerful 12 Xe3 Core GPU to the package. Intel restricts the memory options that partners can employ with this chip, likely so that it can get adequate memory bandwidth to feed all of those GPU execution units. It can only use LPDDR5X memory and supports the fastest transfer rates of any Panther Lake product: up to 9600 MT/s.

This big chip drops back to the more limited I/O tile with eight PCIe Gen 4 and four PCIe Gen 5 lanes, which is likely an indication that it's targeted at the exploding handheld gaming market and premium thin-and-light laptops that can still game when needed. Pairing discrete GPUs with this version of Panther Lake doesn't make a ton of sense from a system design standpoint.

 




Intel offered a high-level preview of single-threaded performance with Cougar Cove, suggesting that the new P-core can deliver 10% higher performance at similar power to Lunar and Arrow Lake, or 40% lower power at similar performance in less demanding workloads.

The multi-threaded performance story for Panther Lake is a bit muddier. Intel claims that Panther Lake can deliver 50% more performance at similar power to Lunar Lake, or 30% lower power for multi-threaded performance similar to Arrow Lake-H.

 




Of course, if we consider these charts in their entirety, Panther Lake can also deliver higher absolute performance at similar power to Arrow Lake-H, emphasizing the greater performance scalability of what we assume to be the 4P+8E+4LPE package.

Beyond these broad and rosy performance projections, Intel didn't discuss any specifics on clocks or power targets for Panther Lake during its presentations, but as with any modern laptop SoC, the frequency, power and thermal targets for these chips are likely to cover such a broad range of designs that it's hard to make generalized statements about their performance, and that's before we get into individual chip models within the product stack.

We'll have to wait and see what types of systems Intel's partners typically produce with Panther Lake SoCs inside before we can even begin to establish performance ballparks. Intel says that the first Panther Lake chips will ship before the end of 2025, and that it expects broad market availability starting in January 2026. Given that timeframe, it's probably safe to say that we will hear much more about Panther Lake products at CES.

If you want an excellent, head-turning flash drive with storage aplenty, then you'll struggle to do better than the SK hynix Tube T31. Holder of our best flash drive award currently, it's essentially an M.2 SSD with a USB plug that gets you very speedy data transfers. Still on offer even though Prime Big Deal Days has finished, get one for just $118 instead of the usual $159.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage. - Stephen Warwick

There's also a wired control pod that lets you adjust RGB lighting effects, as well as Bluetooth connectivity, along with the usual audio controls like volume and mute. As for connectivity, you can choose from Bluetooth, auxiliary, optical, or USB.

There are still some excellent monitor deals available. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49"" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller and more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor.

This 49"" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It has a dense resolution of 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate reaching as high as 240Hz. 

This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals that you can still get 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts.

 




There's no better way to instantly up your audio game than by switching from a headset mic to a standalone USB gaming microphone, and now's the perfect time to do it: the HyperX QuadCast S, one of our long-time favorite gaming mics, is currently still on sale at Amazon for $79.99 — a 50% discount off MSRP, and the lowest price we've ever seen it at.

Lowest ever price

HyperX's QuadCast S is the pretty, colorful version of one of our favorite microphones of all time — and it's currently on sale for 50% off. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. 

The QuadCast S features bright, customizable RGB lighting and records sound at 48 kHz / 16-bits. It features four selectable polar patterns — cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, and omnidirectional — so it's great for capturing one person's voice but can also be used to capture multiple voices and/or ambient noise, in a pinch (though you'll still want multiple mics if you're regularly capturing multiple voices). It features on-mic controls, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct, zero-latency monitoring, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute implementation.

If you're not too interested in the customizable RGB lighting, you can also pick up the older QuadCast for the same price — $79.99 — but we'd still recommend the QuadCast S as you can always just change the RGB lighting to red (or turn it off completely). Both the QuadCast S and the QuadCast come with a desktop stand and a handy built-in shock mount, and have great sound profiles out of the box. — Sarah

 




I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a handy tool to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly. Make sure to enter the brand promotion code of O1KPKFEH8IBJ for the extra 10% off.

I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly.

 




Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is still going, which is great because this is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. — Paul Alcorn

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential. — Brandon Hill

RISC-V IP revenue is expected to hit $2 billion before 2031 at this pace. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


ARM has some competition in the reduced-complexity chip space, and it's gaining ground quickly. RISC-V International plans to announce that silicon on the open-standard has reached 25% market penetration later this month, according to an announcement posted to LinkedIn. Market analysts SHD Group are primed to announce their findings on RISC-V market share at the RISC-V Summit North America.

RISC-V is an open-standard (not to be confused with open-source) instruction set architecture (ISA) for CPUs, first established in 2014. For those unfamiliar, an instruction set architecture is a technical model that determines how computer software controls the computer's processor. The ISA defines what instructions a processor can perform in order to output computations. RISC-V, a reduced-complexity ISA, is most closely related to ARM, also a RISC, known for powering most mobile and some laptop devices.

That RISC-V has swelled to 25% market penetration could come as a shock to industry analysts. While it's uncertain at this point whether the market in question refers to all silicon microprocessors or just the markets that RISC-V has entered so far, those being mostly simple MCUs for IoT and automotive use-cases, the number still represents a mighty leap for the ISA.

Just last year, Omdia predicted that RISC-V would hit 25% share of the entire semiconductor market in 2030, reaching 17 billion chips shipped in 2030. Now the SHD Group's forthcoming estimates raise this number to 21+ billion chips by 2031, eclipsing $2 billion in total revenue by this point. RISC-V International credits this increase in growth to RISC-V's use in Edge AI deployments, referring to more localized data hubs serving smaller communities, rather than sending all work to a general cloud hub.

RISC-V's most essential distinguishing factor is that it is an open standard. Working groups and tech firms can access, use, and iterate on the RISC-V standard for free, without paying licenses or entering into contracts with the RISC-V governing body. Arm, on the contrary, makes money off licensing the ARM instruction set and pre-designed CPU cores to client firms and chipmakers, offering closer support to client companies while also receiving royalties from the use of its designs. This increased collaboration and community contribution have been a major hallmark of RISC-V's continued growth.

The full picture of the 25% market estimate will be unveiled in a keynote address at the RISC-V Summit North America, beginning in Santa Clara, CA, on October 21st. Other speakers at the Summit will include Google, AWS, and NASA, all perennial attendees of the summits. RISC-V has also received much attention from Meta lately; the Facebook company acquired the RISC-V GPU firm Rivos last week in pursuit of its own RISC-V-based AI accelerator.

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today we are going to talk about chronic refractory cough.

Chronic cough, defined as greater than 8 weeks, can persist in many people. Our normal causes of cough are worked up at this point, and over-the-counter supplements and cough suppressants, whether it's [benzonatate], dextromethorphan, or guaifenesin, have been tried and failed.

At this point, we do tend to go to steroids to decrease the inflammation to see if this can help. Common causes are also being worked up, including asthma, upper-airway cough syndrome, GERD, medications, hypersensitivity to allergens, and smoking triggers. When all this has failed, we can then move on to neuromodulators.

These are medications that we do use for chronic cough that has failed our normal therapies. Gabapentin and pregabalin are on top of this list, sometimes along with low-dose opioids — used, however, with significant caution. 

When all of this has failed, there are trials and therapies ongoing for other types of medications and also for superior laryngeal nerve block. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve becomes hyperreactive in chronic cough. Blocking this can lead to a decrease in the cough, and that is now being tried as well.

A nationwide cohort study of more than 4 million adults showed that people with allergic diseases were nearly one third more likely to develop optic neuritis than those without such conditions, with allergic rhinitis showing the strongest association with the increased risk.

The findings suggest “allergic conditions and autoimmune-related optic nerve inflammation may involve overlapping pathogenic pathways,” according to the researchers. “These results are highly relevant for clinical management and public health…. Effective management of allergic symptoms and inflammatory processes may potentially lower the risk of optic neuritis,” they added.

The study was led by Jaeryung Kim, of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea. It was published online on October 3, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

The identification of allergic diseases and optic neuritis relied on standard diagnostic codes, which may have introduced misclassification. The study lacked detailed information about severity of allergic conditions and specific therapeutic interventions. While the database provided information on corticosteroid prescriptions, crucial details about medication dosages, duration, and potency were unavailable. 

The study received financial support from the National Research Foundation, Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, and a grant from the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, Ministry of Health and Welfare, South Korea. The authors reported having no competing interests.

NEW YORK — Of the adjunctive treatments available for alopecia, the list of those supported by data is fairly short, but clinicians are inevitably asked about others, and it can be helpful to distinguish those that are at least benign when faced with patients ready to try anything, according to two experts.

Outlining over-the-counter therapies for alopecia, Maryanne Makredes Senna, MD, said that while she relies on data on these treatments, she does not necessarily object to those that patients pursue on their own.

“There might be no evidence, but patients can add what they want if it will not interfere with what is evidence-based,” said Senna, director of Lahey Hospital and Medical Center's Hair Loss Center of Excellence, Burlington, Massachusetts, and associate professor of clinical dermatology at Harvard Medical School, Boston. She reviewed proven and unproven adjunctive therapies for hair loss in a presentation on October 5 at the Skin of Color Update (SOCU) 2025.

Among many examples, she cited scalp massage, scalp scrubbers, and scalp serums. Although there is no evidence that any of these improve hair regrowth, Senna distinguished between treatments that might provide comfort, such as a scalp massage, and those that might cause unhelpful inflammation, such as certain scalp serums.

At the same meeting, Victoria Barbosa, MD, MPH, director of the Hair Loss Program and associate professor of medicine in the section of dermatology at the University of Chicago, Chicago, provided an overview of therapeutic options to reverse nonscarring alopecias, such as alopecia areata.

Adjunctive therapies were not part of her review, but when asked to comment on this topic by Medscape Medical News, she said that she agreed that it is appropriate to help patients understand which treatments are or are not supported by evidence, leaving them to make their own choices.

“I only recommend therapies supported by evidence,” Barbosa said. Yet, she acknowledged that patients commonly ask about employing a range of unproven adjunctive treatments recommended by friends or found on the internet.

Many “really involve patient preference, so I am fine with them if they pose a low risk of harm,” she said. “But I do suggest that if they add these kinds of treatments, they do so methodically,” she added. “If they add them one at a time, they can at least judge what works.”

Patients urgently seeking hair regrowth, particularly when many approved pharmacologic options offer gradual hair regrowth, often hope to boost the response in any way they can. Both Senna and Barbosa are empathetic and do not typically discourage patients from anything unlikely to interfere with prescribed therapies for which there is evidence.

Indeed, even the short list of adjunctive treatments backed by clinical evidence tends to offer only modest, if still clinically meaningful, benefit. Senna listed proper nutrition, over-the-counter topical minoxidil, antidandruff shampoos, and low-level laser light therapy (LLLT) devices.

For nutrition, Senna emphasized the importance of adequate intake of iron and vitamin E. In general, she counsels patients to alter their diet if necessary to achieve adequate levels of these nutrients rather than take a supplement. She recommended baseline labs to identify those who are deficient and prescribed supplements in only select cases.

Barbosa also considers adequate levels of both iron and vitamin E to be important. However, she is only likely to screen for these if there are no values in the chart and she suspects that these might be low.

Senna does not recommend biotin supplements for hair regrowth. She cited data suggesting these are still commonly recommended despite an FDA warning issued in 2017 and updated in 2019 about the potential for biotin to interfere with certain laboratory tests, such as those for thyroid function. In patients being treated for hair loss, she is particularly concerned about interactions with 25-OH vitamin D and the potential for systemic harm, including liver injury, from botanicals included in some biotin supplements.

Topical minoxidil, according to Senna, can be helpful even if hair regrowth on the topical therapies available over the counter is generally modest. Typically, she recommends the 5% foam or solution but only once rather than twice daily to avoid the scalp irritation that can be bothersome.

Over-the-counter LLLT devices for hair regrowth have been cleared by the FDA for male and female pattern loss, but Senna warned that the light must reach the scalp to be effective. Dramatic responses are uncommon, she said, and a 6-month trial is appropriate to judge benefit.

However, she said the benefit cannot be ruled out. She recounted a story of a patient who insisted on trying LLLT even though Senna warned her that the benefit would likely be modest. Even though the benefit was modest, there was hair regrowth, and the patient was satisfied.

This is an apt example of why Senna is willing to allow patients to pursue adjunctive therapies when she sees no risks. In addition to the fact that patients may derive some level of satisfaction in participating in their own care, their own perception of benefit is meaningful.

Barbosa made the same point, and both she and Senna acknowledged the psychological burden of alopecia that might make adjunctive therapies appealing to patients when hair regrowth is achieved gradually with evidence-based therapies.

Senna reported having financial relationships with AbbVie, CorEvitas, Inmagene, Kintor Pharmaceutical Limited, Lilly, L'Oreal, Pfizer, Sun Pharma, and Veradermics. Barbosa reported having financial relationships with Beiersdorf, CeraVe, Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, L'Oreal, Pfizer, Veradermics, and Vichy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Many men receive frequent prostate cancer tests without symptoms","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251008/Many-men-receive-frequent-prostate-cancer-tests-without-symptoms.aspx","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 03:13:00 GMT","

Current prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing ""may not effectively target testing to those most likely to benefit, raising concerns about overtesting"" warn researchers from the University of Oxford in a study of over 10 million men across England published by The BMJ today.

Despite UK recommendations to limit PSA testing to patients with symptoms or after discussion with a GP, the results show that many patients are tested more frequently than recommended and repeat testing is occurring in patients without recorded symptoms or with previous low PSA values.

The authors say the findings reflect a lack of consistent international guidance and note that ""unpredictable surges in PSA testing, overtesting, and associated costs"" may occur as a result of celebrities publicly sharing their cancer diagnoses and advocating for screening.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK, but PSA testing is only routinely recommended for men with certain symptoms. PSA testing generally remains controversial because it has led to an increased number of healthy men being diagnosed and treated unnecessarily for harmless tumours.

Researchers therefore wanted to better understand how PSA tests are used in primary care in England before prostate cancer is diagnosed.

To do this, they drew on data for 10,235,805 men aged 18 and over who were registered at 1,442 general practices across England between 2000 and 2018 and did not have a prostate cancer diagnosis before entering the study.

Data were linked to the National Cancer Registry, Hospital Episode Statistics, and Office for National Statistics and results were analysed by region, deprivation, age, ethnicity, family history of prostate cancer, symptom presentation, and PSA value.

A total of 1,521,116 men had at least one PSA test during the study period, resulting in 3,835,440 PSA tests overall. 

Testing increased fivefold during the study period, particularly in men without symptoms and those with PSA values below recommended thresholds. 

The highest testing rates occurred in men aged 70 and older, who are least likely to benefit from repeat testing, and a substantial portion occurred in men much younger (18-39 years) than recommended.

Testing rates varied by region, deprivation, ethnicity, family history, age, PSA value, and symptoms, with highest rates seen in patients of white ethnicity and in less deprived areas.

Almost half of men (735,750) were retested. Of these, more than 75% had no symptoms recorded and 73% never had a PSA value above the recommended threshold.

The average interval between tests was just over 12 months overall and 17 months for patients who never had a PSA value above the recommended threshold (shorter than most guidelines advise). Once tested, patients had shorter retesting intervals if they were older, belonged to any ethnic group other than white, had a family history of prostate cancer, or had a previously raised PSA value.

The authors acknowledge that using routinely collected primary care data has limitations, and that analyses of retesting intervals were limited to patients with at least two PSA tests during follow-up, raising the possibility of bias. However, they say they comprehensively analysed PSA testing and length of retesting intervals, and results were consistent after further analyses, suggesting they are robust.

As such, they conclude: ""PSA testing in primary care is varied. Among patients who underwent multiple tests, many were tested more frequently than recommended, raising concerns about overtesting. PSA retesting is occurring in patients without recorded symptoms or with previous low PSA values.""

""To ensure maximum patient benefit while reducing the risk of overtesting, research is urgently needed to determine appropriate evidence based PSA retesting intervals,"" they add.

The major concern raised in this study and similar studies ""is that unregulated PSA testing will result in large costs and harms and increase the incidence of prostate cancer likely to remain undetected, while doing little to identify prostate cancer most likely to cause symptoms and death,"" say Dr Juan Franco and colleagues in a linked editorial.

They welcome the European Commission's interest in population based cancer screening including prostate cancer, but say efforts need grounding in high quality evidence gleaned from randomised trials.

This study ""highlights the need for better NICE guidance, especially in men outside of recommended ages or men with lower urinary tract symptoms, erectile dysfunction, or other conditions unrelated to prostate cancer,"" they conclude.

More than 54,600 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely malnourished, including over 12,800 severely so, with few therapeutic options available to them. With measurements up to the middle of August 2025, the study comprehensively tracks wasting among children during the war, estimates population prevalence, and highlights unprecedented increases in child malnutrition following periods of blockades and severe aid restrictions.

Published in The Lancet, the study was led by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Between January 2024 and mid-August 2025, UNRWA staff screened 219,783 children aged 6-59 months, measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) at 16 functioning health centres and 78 medical points in shelters and tented encampments across five governorates in the Gaza Strip. The researchers then estimated the prevalence of acute malnutrition, based on the total estimated number of children in that age group in the territory (346,000).

Based on evidence of child malnutrition collected from multiple aid agencies, on 15 August 2025 the UN Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in the Governate of Gaza City, with the rest of the Gaza Strip facing critical conditions or the prospect of famine. The study reenforces the IPC's confirmation of famine in Gaza City Governorate, and provides evidence of how child malnutrition has evolved during the war.

Wasting, or acute malnutrition, is defined as a child being too thin for their height, indicating rapid weight loss and severe lack of energy, protein and other nutrients. Wasting can also be assessed by measuring the circumference of a child's upper arm with a calibrated tape, as done in this study, with a thin arm highly correlating to a thin body. It is a life-threatening condition, and children require regular treatment with therapeutic food over several weeks, or in extreme cases and when possible, hospitalisation.

During the 20-month surveillance period, the number of MUAC screenings varied from 722 to 23,651 per month. Prevalence of wasting in January 2024 was 4.7% (34 out of 722 children), rising to 8.9% (1,281/14,387) in July 2024. The end of 2024 saw severe aid restrictions, with UN sources reporting daily averages of 42 to 92 aid trucks per day crossing into Gaza, compared to 300 to 600 per day pre-war. In January 2025, prevalence of wasting was 14.3% (1,661/11,619).

In early 2025, a six-week ceasefire allowed for increased aid to enter the Gaza Strip, and wasting declined to 5.5% by March 2025 (831 out of 15,165 children). A subsequent 11-week blockade followed, with severe restrictions on the entry of food, water, fuel, medicines and other essentials, was in place until late May 2025.

The latest measurements, taken through mid-August 2025, found that 15.8% (1,213/7,668) of screened children were wasted, 3.7% (280/7,668) severely so. Extrapolated to the estimated total population of the Gaza Strip, this is equivalent to over 54,600 children aged 6-59 months in need of urgent therapeutic nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children with little chance of rehabilitation given the inadequate amounts of food crossing the borders, and the cripped health and nutrition services. 

Trends were most extreme in some areas – for instance, in Rafah there was an increase in wasting malnutrition from 7.1% (273/3,855) in April 2024 to 31.5% (63/200) in January 2025, decreasing to 8% in April 2025, in association with the ceasefire, although screening was ceased in this area shortly after. In Gaza City, prevalence rose six-fold from 5.4% (373/6,908) in March 2025, to 28.8% (631/2,194) in mid-August 2025.

Since October 7, 2023, an unprecedented war has unfolded across the Gaza Strip. From the outset, the territory's infrastructure has been destroyed, the population repeatedly displaced and, with few exceptions, humanitarian aid has been severely restricted. Given the long failure to stop the war and prevent encroaching famine despite a global capacity to do so, unless there is a lasting cessation of the conflict coupled with unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services, a further deterioration in early childhood nutrition with increased mortality are inevitable in the Gaza Strip.""

Dr. Akihiro Seita, Director of Health, UNRWA 
 

Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist, UNRWA and lead scientist for the study, adds: ""Evidence prior to Oct 2023 indicated that children in Palestine refugee families in the Gaza Strip were food insecure and had poor dietary diversity. Yet, they were only marginally underweight. This paradox was likely explained by these families' regular access to food aid. Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of pre-school aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality.""

The authors note that data collected was limited to available, functioning UNRWA facilities. Two-thirds of screenings were conducted in Khan Younis and Middle areas, due to challenges of operating health centres in other areas. A total of 265,974 screenings were done for 219,783 children, indicating some children were screened more than once over time. Researchers faced considerable challenges including lack of identity information, and unsafe locations making data collection challenging.

In a linked Comment, Zulfiqar A Bhutta (Aga Khan University, Pakistan & Hospital for Sick Children, Canada), Jessica Fanzo (Columbia University, USA) and Paul H Wise (Stanford University School of Medicine, USA), who were not involved in the study, write: ""These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations... Although immediate attention has been paid to the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be serious concern for the well documented long-term effects, such as intergenerational consequences of starvation and food restriction in children, including inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases and reduced life expectancy.""

Androgenetic alopecia is a common form of hair loss in both men and women-also called male pattern baldness and female pattern hair loss. Topical minoxidil is an approved treatment, but it has poor water solubility and skin permeability. New research in Advanced Healthcare Materials reveals that stevioside, a natural sweetener derived from the Stevia plant, can improve the drug's absorption into the skin.

In a mouse model of alopecia, a dissolving patch formulation of stevioside with minoxidil effectively promoted hair follicles to enter the growth phase, leading to new hair development.

Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide.""

When older adults living in nursing homes are prescribed the pain medicine tramadol alongside certain antidepressants, their risk of seizures may go up, according to a study published October 8, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. While this study found a link between using the medications together and an increased risk of seizures, it does not prove one causes the other.

Tramadol is an opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain in adults. Some antidepressants that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme, called CYP2D6 inhibitors, can interfere with how the body metabolizes tramadol. When the CYP2D6 enzyme is blocked, tramadol is not metabolized properly and may build up in the body, potentially increasing the risk of side effects like seizures. Common CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants include fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion.

We found a modest but measurable increase in the risk of seizures when tramadol was taken with antidepressants that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme. This risk was consistent whether the antidepressant or tramadol was started first.""

Yu-Jung Jenny Wei, PhD, study author, The Ohio State University, Columbus

Researchers analyzed 10 years of Medicare data to identify 70,156 nursing home residents age 65 and older who had been prescribed both tramadol and an antidepressant.

They divided participants into two groups based on which drugs they took first. Of participants, 11,162 people took tramadol first and then an antidepressant with it, while 58,994 people took an antidepressant first and then added tramadol.

Seizure rates for people who took tramadol first were 16 seizures per 100 person-years, and for people who took antidepressants first, the rate was 20 seizures per 100 person-years. This means for every 100 people who used both tramadol and an antidepressant followed for one year, about 16 or 20 received a seizure diagnosis.

In both groups, researchers then compared seizure rates between those who took tramadol with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants and those who took tramadol with antidepressants that do not inhibit the enzyme. In those who took tramadol first and added an antidepressant, the rate was 18 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 16 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants. In those who took antidepressants first and added tramadol, the rate was 22 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 20 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants.

To help ensure the differences were not due to other health issues, the researchers adjusted for factors such as pain levels, depression symptoms, physical function and cognitive ability.

After adjustments, for people who took tramadol first, seizure risk was 9% higher when taking it with a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to with an antidepressant that did not inhibit this enzyme. For those who took an antidepressant first and added tramadol, the risk was about 6% higher for people who took a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to people who took an antidepressant that did not inhibit the enzyme.

To test whether this interaction was specific to tramadol, the researchers repeated the analysis using hydrocodone, another opioid pain reliever that is unlikely to cause seizure risk when used with antidepressants. No increased seizure risk was observed with hydrocodone and CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants.

""These findings underscore the need for careful prescribing practices, especially for older adults with complex health conditions,"" said Wei. ""Doctors should be aware of potential seizure risks when prescribing tramadol with antidepressants, particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Given how commonly both are prescribed to older adults, these interactions may be more important than previously thought.""

A limitation of the study was that medication data came from prescription records, which did not confirm whether patients took the drugs as directed.

This research was supported by the National Institute on Aging.

How can we explain the erratic, reckless, or even aggressive behavior of certain people in the public spotlight? An international research team consisting of members from Freie Universität Berlin, Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, and University Psychiatric Clinics Basel has investigated the specific psychodynamic mechanisms constituting the distinguishing features of personality disorders. Its findings could help to explain the factors underlying erratic, narcissistic, or even aggressive behavior. The results were recently published in the British Journal of Psychiatry and are available at: doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2025.10347.

The research team demonstrated that particular difficulties, such as problems establishing closeness and mutually satisfying relationships, a fragile or unstable self-image, struggles in understanding the experiences and motives of others, and primitive defense mechanisms (for example, attacking others when experiencing negative emotions or blaming uninvolved parties, a mechanism called projection), are central features of personality disorders. These psychological mechanisms may offer short-term protection from distressing emotions, but significantly impair relationships and social life in the long run. Such patterns are often rooted in adverse childhood experiences.

The study is based on in-depth interviews and clinical diagnoses of over 500 people in Germany and Switzerland. It not only provides new scientific insights into the development and nature of personality disorders, but could also inform potential approaches in therapy and prevention. Psychodynamic concepts, such as working with defense mechanisms or addressing closeness in relationships, could be integrated into treatments in a more targeted way in the future.

A better understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed, especially in a time when political and societal crises are so often characterized by escalating conflicts, splitting, projection, a fear of vulnerability and intimacy, and a lack of empathy.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Chiba University study clarifies molecular mechanism driving keloid's unpredictable growth","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251009/Chiba-University-study-clarifies-molecular-mechanism-driving-keloids-unpredictable-growth.aspx","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 04:38:00 GMT","

Keloids are raised, overgrown scars that can develop after skin injuries or surgery, often extending beyond the original wound boundaries. For many people, keloids are more than just a cosmetic concern; they often cause distressing symptoms such as chronic pain, itching, and restricted movement. While various treatment options exist, such as surgical removal, steroid injections, and radiation, keloids are notoriously difficult to manage, with recurrence rates reaching as high as 30%.

Even after decades of study, it is still unclear why keloids grow uncontrollably, unlike hypertrophic scars. The current understanding is that an overproduction of extracellular matrix collagen by fibroblasts-cells that produce elements of connective tissue-is involved and that repeated mechanical tension on the skin contributes to keloid formation. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms driving this uncontrolled scarring are unclear. More specifically, we don't know how or which cells sense the mechanical pressure and ultimately translate it into abnormal tissue growth.

Now, a study made available online on July 31, 2025, and published in Volume 267, Issue 1 of The Journal of Pathology on September 01, 2025, provides a new piece to this puzzle. A research team led by Professor Yuzuru Ikehara, along with co-first authors Dr. Shinsuke Akita and Dr. Sanae Ikehara, and co-authors Prof. Kiyoshi Hirahara, and Prof. Nobuyuki Mitsukawa, all from the Graduate School of Medicine at Chiba University, Japan, investigated the histological, genetic, and molecular differences between keloids and other fibrotic conditions to pinpoint the unique drivers of keloid formation and recurrence.

While analyzing fibrotic tissue from lymphedema in collaboration with plastic surgeons, I conceived the idea that comparing it with keloid tissue might help identify pathological alterations specific to keloid fibroblasts. Although both conditions involve fibrosis, their underlying physiological contexts and etiologies differ substantially."" 

Dr. Sanae Ikehara, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University

The study involved a comprehensive analysis of human tissue samples. The team compared keloid tissues with those from lymphedema, a condition characterized by fibrous overgrowth but not primarily driven by mechanical tension, along with healthy skin samples. They employed several advanced techniques, including global gene expression analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing; these methods allowed them to examine gene activity in individual cells and precisely characterize the cell types involved. Through this detailed approach, the researchers sought to pinpoint mechanosensitive cells and molecules contributing to keloid pathology and recurrence.

A key discovery was that keloid tissues exhibited significantly higher expression levels of a mechanosensitive ion channel called PIEZO2, compared to lymphedema tissues. Simply put, PIEZO2 acts as a microscopic sensor, allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical forces. The researchers observed that keloids with a history of recurrence after surgery showed even higher levels of PIEZO2.

Further investigation using single-cell analysis identified a previously unknown subpopulation of fibroblasts that specifically expressed high levels of PIEZO2. These PIEZO2-expressing fibroblasts (called FBPZ2+) were found to be highly active in the production of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix, which are the building blocks of scar tissue. The team also observed that these FBPZ2+ cells clustered around blood and lymphatic vessels in keloid tissue, particularly in actively growing areas.

""Connective tissue is not composed merely of fibroblasts-it also contains immune cells, blood vessels, and nerves, all of which work together to maintain the proper homeostasis, a critical factor in supporting organ-specific functions,"" explains Prof. Ikehara. ""Therefore, just as studies of immune and neural cell components have advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative and allergic diseases, investigating fibroblasts may help uncover the mechanisms underlying keloid formation."" Indeed, this study represents a significant step in that direction by highlighting the unique role of FBPZ2+cells.

Most importantly, the identification of these PIEZO2-expressing fibroblasts has profound implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of keloids. The study findings reveal that keloid formation is not merely a generalized overgrowth but a unique process driven by specific tension-sensing cells.

""Our work offers new insights into the pathogenesis of keloids and opens the door to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,"" says Prof. Ikehara. ""For example, PIEZO2 inhibitors, which are a type of calcium ion channel blocker, may help alleviate pain and itching associated with keloids. If such targeted therapies become clinically available, they could greatly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from keloid-related discomfort.""

Taken together, this study contributes to the development of therapeutic strategies to restore healthy connective tissue, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Prior incarceration linked to poor health in older adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251009/Prior-incarceration-linked-to-poor-health-in-older-adults.aspx","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 04:23:00 GMT","

A recent analysis reveals that older adults with prior incarceration report worse physical and mental health than their peers, even if they were incarcerated in the distant past. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.

Among the 1,318 US adults aged 50 years and older who responded to the Family History of Incarceration Survey, 21% had been incarcerated. Formerly incarcerated older adults were more likely to be men, non-Hispanic Black or ""other"" race/ethnicity, meet criteria for disability, be unmarried, and have lower income and education compared with those never incarcerated.

After adjusting for potentially confounding factors like demographics and socioeconomics, prior incarceration was associated with an approximately 90% higher odds of reporting ""fair"" or ""poor"" physical health. Length of time since incarceration did not moderate the association, meaning that even those incarcerated more than 10 years ago had equally poor self-reported health. The association with mental health was explained in part by income and employment.

The findings suggest that clinicians could consider screening for incarceration history and connecting formerly incarcerated patients to services and organizations that serve this community.

Mass incarceration began in 1973, so older adults have spent most of their adult lives in this era and millions have been incarcerated in the past. It is critical to understand how incarceration-even in the distant past-may affect the health of older adults and what we can do to improve their health.""

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the cells that produce insulin-a critical hormone that regulates blood sugar in the body. Scientists at Scripps Research recently discovered a new kind of cell that helps protect insulin production, paving the way to understanding how researchers could prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes.

The new findings, published in Cell Reports on September 23, 2025, reveal how vascular-associated fibroblastic cells (VAFs) act as molecular peacekeepers in the pancreas-actively protecting insulin-producing cells from the immune system. This discovery helps explain several puzzling features of type 1 diabetes, including why the disease often has such a long preclinical phase-the symptom-free, early stage of the disease where the immune system is beginning to destroy insulin-producing cells, but blood sugar levels are still normal-and suggests that early intervention could be feasible in the future.

Identifying these VAFs is an exciting step toward a better understanding of how the pancreas interacts with the immune system. This finding unlocks a new understanding of autoimmunity and could help us design better therapeutics for type 1 diabetes and inform how we prevent or reverse the disease.""

Luc Teyton, professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and senior author of the study

For the 1.6 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes, managing the disease often requires time-consuming daily management. In addition to multiple daily insulin injections, blood sugar monitoring and a carefully regulated diet, type 1 diabetics face serious, life-threatening risks if their blood sugar levels aren't within healthy ranges or well controlled.

To identify VAFs, Teyton and his lab took an unconventional approach that focused on the physiology and pathology of the pancreas. The team zeroed in on a site often responsible for inflammation-the post-capillary venules-and then used a combination of imaging, cell-labeling and single-cell analysis to examine how a healthy pancreas kept inflammation at bay. They used a cell-labeling technique, called FucoID, which was developed by Scripps Research professor Peng Wu and allowed the team to quickly identify and isolate cells of interest.

The researchers found that VAFs have a variety of specialized functions that prevent autoimmune attacks on insulin-producing cells. As immune cells travel around the body to detect danger or damage, they depend on antigen presentation-a process in which other cells display protein fragments to help determine whether an immune response is needed. VAFs participate in this process by presenting pieces of the pancreas, while also sending signals that placate the immune system and induce a tolerant state called anergy-thereby halting an autoimmune response.

The pancreas faces unique immunological challenges as part of the digestive system: it is constantly exposed to potential inflammatory triggers from food and the environment. Teyton and his lab identified that persistent inflammation of the pancreas-whether from infection, environmental toxins or other triggers-causes VAFs to become overwhelmed, forcing the immune system to activate and induce type 1 diabetes. Once in a state of overwhelm, autoimmunity proliferates in the pancreas-destroying the valuable insulin-producing cells that balance the body's blood sugar levels.

""This discovery reframes how we think about type 1 diabetes,"" says former Scripps Research postdoctoral researcher and first author, Don Clarke. ""Rather than just asking why the immune system attacks, we can now ask: what disrupts the pancreas' natural ability to maintain tolerance? And more importantly, how can we restore it?""

The protective nature of VAFs offers a new path for researchers to explore, shifting their focus to understanding how they can enhance the body's natural tolerance mechanisms. Looking ahead, the team envisions developing therapies that strengthen VAFs' specialized functions, such as increasing states of anergy and exploring anti-inflammatory treatments that could protect these cellular peacekeepers from being overwhelmed by inflammation. The work also has broader implications for understanding other autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation, where similar tolerance mechanisms may be at play.

As researchers advance these findings from laboratory discoveries to clinical applications, they aspire to develop personalized treatments that work with the body's own protective systems rather than against them and potentially improve the outlook for millions at risk for type 1 diabetes. Teyton and his lab were recently awarded $3.2 million dollars by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to support this novel approach. In collaboration with Scripps Research Assistant Professor Joseph Jardine, the team aims to more deeply study and understand the role of VAFs as pancreatic cell peacekeepers. They also hope to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance or restore VAFs' protective functions when overwhelmed by inflammation. This way, treatment options could prevent type 1 diabetes by strengthening the body's own tolerance mechanisms, rather than broadly suppressing immunity.

A team of researchers from Keio University School of Medicine, the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, and the National Center for Child Health and Development has reported the first cross-disease, cross-stakeholder survey on PPIE in Japan. The study compared allergy research with cancer and rare diseases, fields where PPIE has already advanced. 

The survey revealed that:•100% of allergy-related PAGs considered PPIE essential, and 50% had formal rules for engagement.

•By contrast, only 9.4% of allergy researchers reported established rules, and just 50% recognized PPIE as necessary-lower than in cancer and rare disease research (64.7%).

•PAGs identified three priorities: (1) training programs for both patients and researchers, (2) coordinators to support collaboration, and (3) toolkits and case studies to guide implementation.

•PAGs widely used digital tools for communication (100%), while adoption among researchers was minimal (6.3–15.6%). 

These findings show that allergy patient advocacy groups in Japan are ready and willing to engage, but researchers have yet to catch up. Closing this gap is critical, especially since allergy management depends heavily on daily-life factors such as environment and lifestyle. Patient perspectives are essential to shaping meaningful research."" 

Dr. Takeya ADACHI, corresponding author and dermatologist at Keio University

The study also emphasized that these results align with the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) initiatives to promote PPIE as part of national health policy. Their presentation at the UNGA Science Summit 2025 further highlights the global significance of advancing inclusive, patient-centered research practices.

PlasmidFactory GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to combine expertise in cell therapy process development and GMP manufacturing, aiming to accelerate non-viral cell and gene therapies for the benefit of patients.

PlasmidFactory GmbH, a leading European CDMO for plasmid and Minicircle DNA, brings more than 25 years of experience and over 3,500 DNA constructs delivered worldwide. The Fraunhofer IZI contributes extensive translational capabilities in immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine, and advanced cell manufacturing.

Together, they are accelerating the development of next-generation, virus-free genetic engineering platforms while maintaining the highest quality and regulatory standards.

In the past, the two partners have already successfully established new manufacturing processes for CAR-T cells at Fraunhofer IZI and conducted joint research projects on virus-free gene transfer, which served as the foundation for the production of clinical cell products.

By building on our long-standing collaboration, this partnership allows us to translate scientific innovation into tangible therapeutic advances.

Together, we can streamline non-viral manufacturing workflows and bring promising therapies to patients more efficiently.”

Dr. Dirk Winnemöller, CEO, PlasmidFactory

Prof. Dr. Michael Hudecek, Fraunhofer IZI, adds: “PlasmidFactory's expertise in high-quality DNA manufacturing perfectly complements our translational capabilities. By joining forces, we can further advance non-viral engineering platforms and help shape the future of cell and gene therapies.”

Viral vectors remain the standard in many therapies, but they are associated with high costs, complex production, and safety concerns such as insertional mutagenesis. Minicircle DNA overcomes the limitations of conventional plasmids with higher transfection efficiency, stronger and more stable expression, and lower DNA toxicity – making it a real alternative to viral vectors and a key enabler of virus-free engineering approaches for CAR-T, TCR-T, NK, and other immune cell therapies.

The collaboration underscores a shared commitment to advancing virus-free technologies such as minicircles and transposon systems, which have the potential to overcome bottlenecks in viral vector production. By aligning innovation with patient needs, PlasmidFactory and Fraunhofer IZI are creating a platform that strengthens Europe's position in the global race for advanced therapies.

Stress granules are droplet-like protein hubs that temporarily shield fragile RNA from cellular stresses such as toxins. VCP is a protein essential for breaking up stress granules and has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, VCP has a protein partner, ASPL, whose role has been unclear until now. Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital discovered that ASPL regulates stress granule disassembly by facilitating VCP phosphorylation. They also found ASPL facilitates stress granule assembly independent of VCP by stabilizing interactions among core stress granule proteins. The findings, published today in Science Advances, provide key insight into the link between stress granules and neurodegenerative disease.

Stress granules are carefully regulated, forming only during stresses, such as heat or infection, and disassembling once the stress is resolved. Mutations in proteins such as VCP can derail this cycle, leading to the abnormal accumulation of proteins, which causes a condition called multisystem proteinopathy. 

""VCP mutations are found in patients with multisystem proteinopathy, which includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Paget's disease of bone,"" said corresponding author Mondira Kundu, MD, PhD, St. Jude Department of Cell & Molecular Biology. ""While VCP has multiple functions, its ability to disassemble RNA-protein assemblies, such as stress granules, is impaired by disease-causing mutations.""

After discovering that VCP and ASPL interact with ULK, another protein involved in regulating stress granule disassembly, Kundu and her team decided to dig into the relationship. ""ULK regulates stress granule dynamics, so we wondered whether ASPL was also involved through its interaction with either ULK or VCP,"" Kundu said. 

The team found that ASPL was required for ULK to carry out its function, which is VCP's phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group). Phosphorylation triggers VCP to remove the keystone stress granule protein G3BP from stress granules, causing them to break up. Without VCP phosphorylation, the stress granules persist. 

These findings are consistent with what occurs during multisystem proteinopathy.

Certain disease-causing VCP mutants don't interact as well with ASPL and ULK, and also have stress granule disassembly defects. Restoring VCP phosphorylation restores disassembly, suggesting that these mutants decrease VCP binding to ASPL and subsequent phosphorylation by ULK.""

Mondira Kundu, Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

In a surprising turn, the researchers also observed that ASPL overexpression sharply increased stress granule formation. Removing ASPL resulted in smaller and slower-forming stress granules. This suggested that ASPL plays a role in stress granule assembly. But this function of ASPL did not involve VCP, so the researchers set out to tease apart how ASPL could promote the formation of stress granules on its own, independent of VCP.

""We created cell lines that express a version of ASPL that cannot bind VCP and found that these cells had no problems with granule assembly but did a poor job with disassembly,"" Kundu said. ""This showed us that ASPL promoted stress granule assembly, and ASPL's interaction with VCP is important for efficient disassembly.""

The researchers discovered this mechanism was tied to G3BP. ""Removing ASPL decreased interactions between stress granule components, lowering the probability of stress granules being formed,"" Kundu explained. ""Fluorescence recovery experiments suggested that ASPL alters G3BP's interactions with other proteins, making the network less stable without ASPL.""

These findings add nuance to scientists' understanding of stress granule regulation, expanding on the checks and balances that govern the process and highlighting potential pathways to disease. ""A key question is whether disrupting the ASPL-VCP interaction, specifically through ASPL, can mimic multisystem proteinopathy,"" Kundu said. ""That's the biggest missing link currently, and one we are exploring.""

The 'Futbol W' crew debate who will miss out on a play-off spot in NWSL. (2:54)

United States women's national team forward Emma Sears has signed a new contract with Racing Louisville FC through the 2028 NWSL season, a source with knowledge of the deal told ESPN.

Sears is tied for third in the NWSL Golden Boot race with 10 goals this season after scoring a brace on Saturday in a 3-1 victory over the North Carolina Courage. A week earlier, she scored Louisville's lone goal in a 1-0 win over Angel City FC.

Those victories leave Louisville seventh in the NWSL standings with three games to play. The top eight teams make the playoffs. Louisville has finished in ninth place in all four seasons of the franchise's existence, missing out on the playoffs each time.

Sears arrived in Louisville as a second-round pick in the 2024 NWSL Draft and quickly played her way onto USWNT head coach Emma Hayes' radar.

The 24-year-old Sears has eight caps for the United States.

Hayes said in July that she had been working with Sears on advancing elements of her game like a better final pass. Sears contributed an assist in a 4-0 win over Ireland in June.

Sears said after Saturday's brace for Louisville that she has grown as a player in recent months.

""I think the biggest thing for me and just taking those conversations and soaking everything in that I can from all the coaches that I have, is mostly the consistency piece,"" Sears said. ""I think that I have been a lot more intentional with the way that I'm playing, and I think that has ultimately benefitted my game.

""I feel like I've found myself in a little bit more of a flow state in games and I'm not having to think as much. It's kind of just coming naturally, and I think that these past few games, I've really hit my stride with that.

""All credit to my teammates. I know that they've backed me and they're there for me. I hear the encouragement from behind me each game and I think that helps boost my confidence a lot in the final third.""

Louisville's 32 points this season is already a franchise record. The club has done work to keep the core of the squad in place and avoid losing players to free agency. Sears' previous contract was due to run through the 2026 season.

Midfielder Taylor Flint signed a new contract in July to stay in Louisville through the 2028 NWSL season. In July, Racing also exercised the 2026 option on head coach Bev Yanez's contract to keep her in the role.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. (3:54)

For the past two FIFA World Cup cycles, the starting striker spot for the U.S. men's national team has been a seemingly unsolvable puzzle, with none of the candidates able to grab a firm hold of the spot. It wasn't always this way.

Eric Wynalda and Brian McBride led the U.S. line during the 1990s and 2000s. Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey carried the flag through the 2014 World Cup and slightly beyond, although it's worth noting that Dempsey spent a significant chunk of his international career in a midfield role. The same was true for Landon Donovan.

Since then, the search for a starting central striker has taken on holy grail-like qualities.

The 2022 World Cup cycle never did reveal a forward who could deliver on a consistent basis. Jesús Ferreira, Jordan Pefok, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent and Gyasi Zardes were all given starts during World Cup qualifying. For a time, it looked like Pepi would emerge, but he faded toward the latter part of the cycle -- mostly due to a lack of playing time at club level -- and was beaten to the roster selection tape by Haji Wright. An injury to Sargent at the World Cup, combined with ineffectiveness by Ferreira and Wright, meant that the U.S. didn't get as much out of the position in Qatar as they would have hoped.

This cycle has been even more muddled. Pepi, Sargent and Wright remain in contention, joined by Folarin Balogun and Patrick Agyemang. And while Balogun has gained a bit of daylight between himself and the other potentials thanks to an impressive performance in a recent friendly against Japan, he hasn't secured the spot just yet.

With the October window featuring friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, here's where things stand in the race to wear the No. 9 for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT at next summer's World Cup, and a statistical comparable player for the five in contention to start up top come June.

When Balogun committed to the USMNT in May of 2023 -- he was also eligible to represent England and Nigeria -- he was thought to be the USMNT's long-term answer to the striker position. Initially there was a payoff: he scored in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final against Canada, and was one of the few players to come out of the 2024 Copa América with any credit. But injuries, including a recurring shoulder ailment that required surgery in December 2024, prevented him from getting a vice-like grip on the position.

Balogun's mobility allows him to get behind opposition defenses. The problem has been that the U.S. attack hasn't always proved itself adept at finding him in those positions. But Balogun's movement has the added benefit of pulling defenders out of position, the better to create space for the likes of Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah or Alejandro Zendejas.

The Japan game in September showcased the full repertoire of his skills, and he even demonstrated he can play with his back to goal and hold the ball up if asked. Even in the loss to South Korea, the U.S. attack looked a lot more dynamic once Balogun entered the match as a substitute in the 62nd minute.

The only doubts surround his durability, as well as getting consistent playing time at Monaco, where the competition for places has been fierce. He has just one goal and one assist in league play this season, covering 332 minutes.

Statistical comparable: Nicolas Jackson. Balogun has proved to be a willing runner and ball carrier with solid shot and goal creation. In the past three years, he has averaged 0.50 goals from 3.69 shots per 90 minutes. Unfortunately, like Jackson, he has also proved to be a pretty poor finisher -- those 0.50 goals per 90 come from shots worth 0.70 xG per 90. -- Bill Connelly

Wright is the only U.S. center forward with a World Cup goal to his name. Granted, he didn't seem to know much about his tally in the round-of-16 defeat to the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup, but a goal is a goal.

Given the disdain Pochettino has for player reputations, more pertinent to Wright's cause is the blistering form he has been showing in the English Championship this year, where his eight goals are tops in the league and have propelled Coventry to the top of the table.

Wright has some versatility to his game. His 6-foot-3 frame allows him to be a force in the air, but he's also quick enough to play on the wing, which he has done on occasion for Coventry and the USMNT. His ability to sniff out chances is impressive as well. His tally from less than 2 yards in last weekend's 5-0 demolition of Sheffield Wednesday showed his ability to be in the right place at the right time.

What's holding Wright back? There were times during the last World Cup where he seemed slow to react to attacking opportunities. Perhaps the moment got to him. While that was almost three years ago, it's an image that will stick in the memory until he delivers on a bigger stage.

Statistical comparable: Randal Kolo Muani. Wright isn't quite the passer that Kolo Muani can be, but he scores (0.56 goals per 90 minutes), and he really pushes the ball. He has averaged 6.1 progressive carries per 90 in the past three years, drawing 1.42 fouls per 90 in that span. That creates a rare profile and makes Kolo Muani the best comp. -- Connelly

During last week's conference call in which he announced the U.S. roster for the October window, Pochettino said that Agyemang offers a different profile to Balogun and Wright, one derived from his physical presence -- he's 6-foot-4 -- and his aerial ability. Those traits were on display in Derby County's 1-1 draw with Southampton last weekend, when Agyemang towered over a Saints defender to head home the Rams' only goal of the day.

Agyemang is a raw talent, however, and he struggles at times with his touch and hold-up play. But he seems perfectly suited to score an ugly goal late in a match, if necessary, and his passing has seen him earn two assists already in 307 minutes in the EFL Championship.

Agyemang's chances of securing a World Cup roster spot are, like so many players, down to health and the numbers game Pochettino will have to play. If Pochettino only opts to bring three forwards, and a player like Pepi is healthy, Agyemang may be one of the final cuts. But his ""different profile"" may be what gets him in, especially if Pochettino opts for four strikers.

Statistical comparable: Olivier Giroud. Agyemang is excellent in the air (47.5% aerial success rate), and he's happy to draw lots of contact (2.05 fouls per 90 suffered, 0.92 in the attacking third). That makes him awfully Giroud-like, as does quality finishing -- he averages 0.51 goals from shots worth 0.40 xG, and 90% of his shots have come from inside the box -- although his shooting totals aren't huge, and he's not involved elsewhere on the pitch. -- Connelly

Three years ago, Pepi was the odd man out in terms of the U.S. roster that went to Qatar. It proved a mistake, when the U.S. was left starting Ferreira against the Dutch. Now Pepi is aiming to be on the 2026 squad -- that is, if his body will let him.

The 2025 calendar year has seen Pepi struggle with his fitness. He sustained a knee injury in the UEFA Champions League game against Liverpool last January that later required surgery, forcing him to miss last summer's Gold Cup. Pepi's recovery since then has been stop-start; he was brought along slowly by PSV, and looked to be back after scoring twice against NEC Nijmegen last month, but a recent muscle injury has him back on the shelf. It isn't thought to be serious, but it prevented him from taking part in this camp.

While Pepi has several impressive attributes, his movement allows him to sniff out opportunities and get on the end of passes that other forwards might miss. Combine this with his link-up play and you have a forward capable of contributing plenty to the U.S. team. But time is running out for Pepi to make a bigger impression.

Statistical comparable: Lautaro Martínez. More than any other forward from this list, Pepi gets himself involved, just as Martínez does. His offensive numbers are inflated by playing in the Eredivisie, but they're still excellent (0.74 goals and 1.36 chances created per 90 minutes), and he's proving to be a reliable finisher (those goals came from shots worth 0.52 xG). He also shows up in defense, averaging a stellar-for-a-forward 5.53 defensive interventions per 90. -- Connelly

Jeff Carlisle looks ahead to the upcoming international window for Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT.

Rarely has the difference between a player's club form and his international form been as stark as it is with Sargent. The O'Fallon, Missouri, native has hit double-digit goals in each of his past three full seasons with the Canaries in the Championship, and he's well on his way this year with five goals in nine league matches. It makes Sargent's barren spell with the USMNT -- he hasn't scored for the U.S. in his past 17 international appearances, dating back to November 2019 -- all the more confounding.

Perhaps his streak is down to the fact that while Sargent does plenty of things well -- be it his movement, his link-up play and yes, his finishing, too -- there isn't one aspect of his game that seems elite enough to help him be a difference-maker at a World Cup.

Pochettino seems to have noticed, too. Even with Pepi injured this window, there wasn't room for Sargent among the forwards on the roster. He does have World Cup experience, and that counts for something, but it may not be enough.

Statistical comparable: Moise Kean. Sargent is the most statistically nondescript of the American forwards on this list, but like Kean, he's a willing presser (4.09 defensive interventions per 90 minutes since the start of 2024-25) and above-average finisher (0.56 goals per 90 from shots worth 0.48 xG). His shot totals are always lower than you would prefer, though (2.43 shots per 90), and he doesn't stand out as a passer. -- Connelly

Balogun, Pepi, Wright and Agyemang look to be in position to make the World Cup squad, in that order. Four forwards might seem like one too many, but these four all have different profiles that can help the USMNT at various times. Flexibility is vital in a tournament like the World Cup.

In terms of who starts, Balogun has the inside track at the moment, but that situation can change quickly. At this stage, it looks like the only way Sargent makes it back to the World Cup is if others get injured or suffer a significant drop in form.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Weston McKennie Names ‘Big Question' for USMNT Ahead of 2026 World Cup","https://www.si.com/soccer/weston-mckennie-names-big-question-usmnt-2026-world-cup","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 11:05:08 GMT","

U.S. men's national team midfielder Weston McKennie acknowledges the squad must strike a balance between playing attractive soccer, and having the grit and determination that has often defined teams in the past.

Much has been made of Mauricio Pochettino's iteration of the USMNT in recent camps. Since arriving in September 2024, the Argentine coach has an overall record of 11-0-7. Pundits and ex-players have criticized the USMNT on a number of fronts and occasions given the talent on paper and the pressure of a World Cup on home soil in 2026.

On the surface, most soccer fans expect their teams to show fight and desire when representing a club or national team. Yet, as the game continues to evolve, the overarching implication usually means trying to play an attractive style of play. 

It's a difficult balancing act, but it's one McKennie, who has been absent from USMNT action since March for a myriad of reasons including Club World Cup participation with Juventus, tells Sports Illustrated the players and Pochettino are continuing to work on as they prepare for 2026.

“That's the big question. What Pochettino always preaches in camps is, ‘Every time you put the shirt on, you have to be willing to practically ready to die for the shirt.' McKennie says as part of a larger conversation surrounding his work with Vita Coco.

“He's not wrong about that at all. There's a sense of pride whenever you put on the national team jersey. There's a sense of a whole country behind you that may be not the biggest football country, but it's on its way.

“I think America is such a prideful country that you have to have that and show that for people to get even more interested. Obviously, playing beautiful football is nice, but at the end of the day you could play beautiful football and lose and not have that grit. Nobody can get mad at a team if you try to play beautiful football but you show grit, desire and that you left everything on the field. 

“It's what we're trying to figure out—presenting both of those because we all play at big clubs where it's not fighting and tackling all the time. You play good football and you move the ball around, one touch, two touch, not so much of a kick-and-run style. When you come together from these different clubs, the one thing you can always have control over is the effort you put in, the desire, grit, savviness.”

The USMNT face Ecuador and Australia looking to build some momentum in October. A mixed bag of results against South Korea and Japan last time out continued to sour the mood on a team that's looking for a spark, but in the 27-year-old's estimation, nothing is as important as winning at the end of the day.

“You can't always control the outcome of a game, whether it's going to be beautiful football because you need to win a game by any means necessary,” he says.

“And that might be playing bad football, but three points at the end of the day, no one is gonna look back in four years from and think, ‘They played a beautiful game.' But who won the game.”

GOAL ranks the top three soccer players produced by every state in the West, including Donovan, Vargas and Kasey Keller

From the sands of sunny California to the battleground of derbies that make up the Pacific Northwest, America's West  has always been home to some of soccer's biggest and best. Legends have emerged from the region, and not just on the coast, but all through America's westernmost states.

From legends to cult heroes, the West has made one hell of an impact on the American game. California itself could field an all-star team. Seattle has produced multiple U.S. men's national team stars. Hawaii has proven a surprising hotbed, and even Alaska has gotten into the mix by helping develop a player that might just be the best prospect in MLS right now.

Some regions in the U.S. have deeper player pools than others, so who is the best of the best? Which state has been the most fertile ground for developing American soccer talent?

Going bald is no joke. For anyone who used to enjoy a beautiful mane and suddenly sees it disappear little by little, before you're holding on to scraps, it can be painful. But it's especially painful for someone who is so young.

Enter Landon Donovan.

The former United States Men's National Team captain and MLS star shared on Sept. 29 that he needed the public's help after coming to the realization that he couldn't go one with his balding look.

Donovan, 43, shared that he's struggled with baldness since he was around 18 years old. He said it went from losing his hair on top to his hairline receding.

Donovan said he's tried just about everything, including a hair transplant that he said didn't work. He said his options included shaving his head bald, but he didn't want to do that.

""Not an option for me,"" he said.

He said he could leave it as is, but that's not an option either. His last option?

""A hair system that's basically a wig,"" he said.

In other words, a toupee.

Donovan sought the public's help to pick a hairstyle.

Last week, Donovan posted a video on Instagram in which he shared that he ""finally tried a hairpiece.""

On Tuesday, Donovan posted a video of the hairstyle he landed on.

Donovan, arguably the greatest U.S. men's soccer player ever, took to Instagram on Tuesday and thanked everyone for the support in this process.

Donovan said he ""loves"" his new hair, even though he's still getting used to it.

He added that he had ""no idea how many people struggled with hair loss,"" and that he received thousands of messages since sharing his plans to address hair loss.

His message to anyone struggling with hair loss?

""It's OK to be vulnerable,"" he said. ""Be brave.""

FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the football industry needs to be more open-minded about when it stages its biggest tournaments as a global game cannot only play World Cups during the northern-hemisphere summer.

The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was the first to be played outside the usual summer window, with the tournament shifting to a November and December slot to avoid the Gulf state's extreme summer heat.

That move caused considerable debate at the time, as it meant domestic leagues across Europe were forced to take mid-season breaks, but did not lead to any long-term disruption and resulted in a World Cup where the players looked fresh.

Many in Europe, however, hoped that Qatar 2022 would be an exception, but with Saudi Arabia awarded the 2034 World Cup, the tournament is unlikely to return to its usual space in the calendar.

The debate about when and where elite football can be played has grown since those rows about the Qatar World Cup, with this summer's Club World Cup in the United States providing the latest example of how difficult it is to shoehorn tournaments into the current global football calendar.

Speaking at the European Football Clubs' general assembly in Rome on Thursday, Infantino told delegates: “If you want to play at the same time everywhere, then you can play in March or in October — because in December, you're not playing in one part of the world, and in July, we're not playing in another part of the world.”

No dates have been announced for the 2034 World Cup but it expected to be another winter tournament, with a strong possibility it will actually be held in early 2035 to avoid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which falls in November and December in 2034.

After his speech, Infantino was asked by journalists when FIFA would get into the “nitty gritty” of deciding when to stage the 2034 tournament.

“We're already into nitty-gritty — we're discussing it with everyone, all the time, and it's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection,” he explained.

“Even to play in some European countries in July it's very, very hot. So maybe we need to think about the best months to play football, which is June in Europe. It's not used very much, right?

“Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar but we're discussing it. We just have to have an open mind.”

Infantino's comment about July temperatures in Europe comes with the 2030 World Cup primarily being played in Spain and Portugal, with games also in Morocco and a handful in South America. Extreme heat is unlikely to be a factor at Euro 2028, which will be held in the UK and Ireland, but could be an issue for the 2032 tournament in Italy and Turkey.

The international match calendar that provides the framework for all global football competitions is set until 2030 but its next iteration has been the focus of intense debate for some time. Last year, the major domestic leagues teamed up with players' union FIFPro Europe to file a complaint against FIFA at the European Commission for the global body's alleged failure to properly consult on the calendar.

The leagues and union believe FIFA abused its dominant market position by scheduling the Club World Cup in June and July, knowing it would have a knock-on effect on the start of European domestic seasons.

FIFA responded to a formal complaint over the calendar in July 2024 by saying that there had been “comprehensive and inclusive consultation, which included FIFPRO and league bodies”.

Infantino used his speech in Rome to praise the success of the Club World Cup, a view shared by the bosses of the clubs that participated this summer. There is no sign of FIFA removing the Club World Cup from the calendar, and the tournament is more likely to grow in size than disappear.

In this story:

Pedro Neto has been honoured with an award by the Portuguese FA for his role in Chelsea's Club World Cup-winning campaign.

Pedro Neto certainly played a big part in helping Chelsea win the Club World Cup.

The 25-year-old started in all of the six matches Chelsea played in the tournament, and scored three goals in that period.

It was a perfect summer for the former Wolves star, who also helped Portugal win their second UEFA Nations League just a month before lifting the Club World Club for Chelsea.

Obviously, not long before that, Pedro Neto was also part of the Chelsea team that beat Real Betis to secure the UEFA Conference League trophy back in May.

It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that in the Portugal Football Globes gala held on Tuesday, Neto was given the Globe Impacto Mundial (World Impact award) for his achievements.

Pedro Neto is currently on international duty with Portugal ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Ireland and Hungary.

He is one of the 10 Chelsea players currently on international duty, alongside France's Malo Gusto and Argentina's Enzo Fernandez.

The winger remains an important player under head coach Enzo Maresca at Chelsea, as shown by the fact that he has made 10 appearances for Chelsea already this season, with nine of them as a starter.

Unfortunately, he is still struggling in terms of output, having only one goal to his name this term.

Chelsea will be back in action on October 18 with a visit to Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

Take a look at every World Cup ball made by Adidas since 1970. (1:27)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said everyone in football needs to keep ""an open mind"" about the scheduling of all future World Cups -- not just the 2034 tournament in Saudi Arabia.

The calendar governing international football is fixed until 2030 with discussions ongoing about how it will look after that. World Cups have traditionally been played in June and July, with the exception of the 2022 finals staged in Qatar, played in November and December to avoid the oppressive desert heat.

A similar solution is expected for the Saudi finals in nine years' time but Infantino insists climate change means consideration around scheduling needs to be given to all future tournaments at international level.

Infantino told delegates at the European Football Clubs General Assembly in Rome: ""If you want to play at the same time everywhere, then you can play in March or in October -- most likely because in December, you're not playing in one part of the world, and in July, we're not playing in another part of the world.""

He later told reporters outside the hall that FIFA was into the ""nitty gritty"" of discussing scheduling for the Saudi finals but added: ""We are discussing all the time. It's not just about one World Cup - it's a general reflection -- even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think.

""Actually the best month to play football, which is June, actually is not used very much, in Europe. Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions.

We just have to have an open mind.""

Infantino also gave a strong hint about the expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams during his speech, saying he wanted to discuss ways to make it ""even better, even bigger.""

The competition featured 32 teams for the first time this summer in the United States, with Infantino labelling it a ""huge success"" in terms of attendances, engagement and the revenue generated.

The scheduling of the competition has sparked legal challenges from domestic leagues and player unions, who have criticised FIFA over what they see as a failure to properly consult over the international fixture calendar.

- 2034 World Cup: Why Saudi Arabia is hosting, explained
- Jude Bellingham is England's best player. So why has he been dropped?
- The new World Cup ball is here! How a century of evolution led to it

However, clubs are keen to see an expansion of the competition, with Chelsea reported to have banked around £85m for their successful run in the U.S., and Infantino indicated a willingness to allow more clubs to join for the next edition, due to be played in 2029.

""It was a success, and now we work together to see how we can make it even better, even bigger, even more impactful,"" he told the General Assembly of European Football Clubs, formerly the European Club Association, in Rome.

He said that would involve collaboration with ""all the clubs, with all the stakeholders who want to discuss and speak and develop it with us"".

He added: ""It will benefit everyone in this room, and also outside of this room. There are, going forward, a lot of challenges obviously, and we are all equipped to deal with all these challenges.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested that the international calendar “should be changed to allow World Cups to be played regularly in the winter,” according to Martyn Ziegler of the London TIMES. The 2034 tournament is being hosted by Saudi Arabia, where the hot summer temperatures make it “almost impossible” to be staged in the usual June and July slot. For that reason, the Qatar World Cup three years ago was moved to November and December, which meant most European club campaigns had to start earlier and finish later to accommodate it. Infantino, speaking at the European Football Clubs annual assembly, said that talks were “under way on changing the calendar.” He raised the idea of “more club football being played during June in the future.” Infantino said, “The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe. Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to have an open mind.” He continued, “If you want to play at the same time everywhere, you can play in March or in October, most likely. Because in December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part of the world.” Infantino also said that he was “confident there would not be visa problems for countries at next year's World Cup” in the U.S., Mexico and Canada (London TIMES, 10/9).

MONEY TREE: BBC.com's Nick Mashiter notes Infantino also confirmed FIFA's desire to further grow the Club World Cup when speaking at the assembly. Infantino noted the Champions League made $46M in revenue when it started, and now it is $4.6B. He said then that if the first Club World Cup generated $2.3B, then it “should generate” $232B in 30 years. Infantino: “This has created revenues for the clubs. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had 2.5m spectators in the stadiums. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better” (BBC.com, 10/9).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

The Qatar World Cup in 2022 started in November and ended a week before Christmas on 18 December

Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants football to keep an ""open mind"" about when World Cups are played.

The tournament has traditionally been contested in the northern hemisphere's summer months - though the 2022 competition, in Qatar, took place in December to avoid playing in the hottest conditions.

""We have summer and winter and in the world if you want to play at the same time everywhere you can play in March or in October,"" said Infantino, who runs the sport's world governing body.

""In December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part. 

""We need to consider all these elements and let's see how we can make it better for everyone.

""Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar. We are discussing. We have to have an open mind.""

The international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with the United States, Canada and Mexico hosting next year's men's World Cup in June and July. 

Morocco, Portugal and Spain host the World Cup in 2030 - with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay holding matches to mark 100 years since the first World Cup was held in, and won by, Uruguay. 

Saudi Arabia will host the tournament in 2034.

Meanwhile, Infantino also confirmed Fifa's desire to further grow the Club World Cup. 

The US hosted an expanded 32-team tournament during a major heatwave in the summer, with temperatures in New York reaching a record 39C in June. 

This drew criticism from footballers and players' unions, who raised issues over player welfare and the number of games adding to a packed calendar. 

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango said in July the competition was devaluing football.

Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain in New York to claim the title. 

Infantino, speaking at the European Football Clubs' general assembly in Rome, said: ""When the Champions League was created the first revenue was 40m (euros), now it is 4bn (euros). If the first Club World Cup generated 2bn (euros) in 30 years we should generate 200bn (euros). 

""This has created revenues for the clubs. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. 

""I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had 2.5m spectators in the stadiums. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better.

""There is interest in the entire world and we need the interest to boost the national leagues, the European and global competitions.""

Uefa 'reluctantly' approves games played abroad

Rabiot should respect employer, says Serie A boss after criticism of overseas games

Infantino also warned that football is taking a gamble playing domestic league games overseas. 

In February, AC Milan will play their Serie A match with Como in Perth, Australia, while La Liga clubs Villarreal and Barcelona will face each other in Miami in December.

European football's governing body Uefa gave the games the go-ahead this week, stressing that it was opposed to the move but had no legal framework to stop it happening.

""We have a structure where we have games at national level, continental level and then at global level,"" Infantino continued. 

""This is a structure which made football the number one structure in the world. If we want to break the structure we take a big risk, if we want to regulate it we have to look into it.

""Now I have seen Uefa has approved it, it has to go to Concacaf as well, I don't know if AFC [Football Australia] has approved the game in Australia. 

""We need a reflection which is more global. Do we want everyone to play everywhere and do whatever they want, or do we want a regulated system which takes into a account which takes into account the interests of everyone?""

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin doubled down on his body's opposition on Wednesday, saying Europe's top clubs risk ""breaking"" football if league games are moved overseas.

""Football is not just about balance sheets. It's not just entertainment. It's life in our communities, the streets, the clubs and the fans which shape it,"" Ceferin told club officials at the European Football Clubs' (formerly the European Club Association) general assembly in Rome.

""If we pull it too far away from those roots, we risk breaking it.""

Madison soccer fans are frustrated at FIFA's new dynamic pricing system for next summer's World Cup. The world-renowned event returns to North America for the first time since 1994, but not without controversy as the ticketing strategy leaves fans wondering if they can afford to experience the unforgettable spectacle. 

“The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. It's about growing globally, but especially growing the game in its host nations,” Conor Caloia, president and COO of professional club Forward Madison FC, said. 

The dynamic pricing system, first introduced at this year's Club World Cup, will determine ticket prices based on factors including consumer demand, the significance of the match and general interest from fans. That means tickets for a knockout stage match between the United States and Brazil, for example, will cost much more than a group stage match between Jordan and Paraguay. 

Students — already burdened by tuition, rent and other expenses — will face a deficit to attend the tournament. With ticket prices being so subject to change with dynamic pricing, students' opportunities to attend a once in a lifetime event seem limited. 

William Nicolau, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he was somewhat aware of the ticket process, and that he “signed up for the Visa cardholder presale, but [he] didn't know [the tickets] were this expensive” when told the starting ticket costs for the final.

FIFA said “fans will be able to secure group-stage tickets for just $60, while the most exclusive seats will reach up to $6,730 for the final,” in a press release explaining their ticketing system. Compare this to ticket prices at the previous edition of the World Cup in Qatar, where tickets started at $69 and peaked at a cost of $1,605 for the final. This steep price hike is indicative of FIFA's focus on maximizing profit, while neglecting the importance of the fan experience.

Paul Thiel, a UW-Madison sophomore, said he has been a soccer fan for most of his life and was looking forward to the rare opportunity of seeing a World Cup match live. 

He said the dynamic pricing system will “probably limit” the number of matches he goes to.

“I can't spend any more than $300 on tickets. I have to balance paying for school,” Thiel said.

Freshman Eduardo Righetto shared a similar sentiment, adding that “soccer's not about making money, soccer is about being inclusive.” In an age where soccer accessibility in the U.S. is becoming increasingly difficult, the sport faces a challenge in staying inclusive. 

FIFA said their system deters scalpers and gives fans safer access to tickets. They also announced they are launching their own resale platform, which will allow tickets to be exchanged without “invalid or unauthorised resale.”

This will keep ticket prices from ballooning, but will also ensure FIFA maximizes their profit in an unchallenged system. By adjusting prices in real time based on demand, FIFA is essentially taking the role of scalpers and doing it under the guise of claiming to be “fan-oriented.”

Caloia also spoke about the importance of growing the game of soccer over profit. He noted that “The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. It's about growing globally, but especially growing the game in its host nations.” 

As an event that is expected to bring in 6.5 million visitors, Caloia said “there should be a lower barrier for entry for some fans who traveled a long way and have never been to a World Cup match before.”

The last time the World Cup was held in the U.S. in 1994, the event revitalized interest in soccer, with the general public viewing soccer in a positive light after decades of being considered a niche sport within the country. This upcoming World Cup has a similar opportunity.

“[The World Cup] has the potential to be transformational for the development of the game in our country. The hope is it connects with a younger generation and gets more kids out playing soccer in the state of Wisconsin,” Caloia said

For students that have grown up playing and watching soccer, having the sport's most decorated tournament in their cities should be the culmination of a lifelong passion. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the increasing dictation of a grassroot sport by corporate interests.

The World Cup will kick off on June 11 next year at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, with matches commencing in the U.S. the next day at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Tournament matches will take place from June 11-19th, with the final held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Take a look at every World Cup ball made by Adidas since 1970. (1:27)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said everyone in football needs to keep ""an open mind"" about the scheduling of all future World Cups -- not just the 2034 tournament in Saudi Arabia.

The calendar governing international football is fixed until 2030 with discussions ongoing about how it will look after that. World Cups have traditionally been played in June and July, with the exception of the 2022 finals staged in Qatar, played in November and December to avoid the oppressive desert heat.

A similar solution is expected for the Saudi finals in nine years' time but Infantino insists climate change means consideration around scheduling needs to be given to all future tournaments at international level.

Infantino told delegates at the European Football Clubs General Assembly in Rome: ""If you want to play at the same time everywhere, then you can play in March or in October -- most likely because in December, you're not playing in one part of the world, and in July, we're not playing in another part of the world.""

He later told reporters outside the hall that FIFA was into the ""nitty gritty"" of discussing scheduling for the Saudi finals but added: ""We are discussing all the time. It's not just about one World Cup - it's a general reflection -- even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think.

""Actually the best month to play football, which is June, actually is not used very much, in Europe. Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions.

We just have to have an open mind.""

Infantino also gave a strong hint about the expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams during his speech, saying he wanted to discuss ways to make it ""even better, even bigger.""

The competition featured 32 teams for the first time this summer in the United States, with Infantino labelling it a ""huge success"" in terms of attendances, engagement and the revenue generated.

The scheduling of the competition has sparked legal challenges from domestic leagues and player unions, who have criticised FIFA over what they see as a failure to properly consult over the international fixture calendar.

However, clubs are keen to see an expansion of the competition, with Chelsea reported to have banked around £85m for their successful run in the U.S., and Infantino indicated a willingness to allow more clubs to join for the next edition, due to be played in 2029.

""It was a success, and now we work together to see how we can make it even better, even bigger, even more impactful,"" he told the General Assembly of European Football Clubs, formerly the European Club Association, in Rome.

He said that would involve collaboration with ""all the clubs, with all the stakeholders who want to discuss and speak and develop it with us"".

He added: ""It will benefit everyone in this room, and also outside of this room. There are, going forward, a lot of challenges obviously, and we are all equipped to deal with all these challenges.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The Qatar World Cup in 2022 started in November and ended a week before Christmas on 18 December

Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants football to keep an ""open mind"" about when World Cups are played.

The tournament has traditionally been contested in the northern hemisphere's summer months - though the 2022 competition, in Qatar, took place in December to avoid playing in the hottest conditions.

""We have summer and winter and in the world if you want to play at the same time everywhere you can play in March or in October,"" said Infantino, who runs the sport's world governing body.

""In December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part.

World Cup

 Tariq Zehawi / NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY Network / Imagn Images

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are now on sale, but that doesn't mean you can simply go buy them.

The World Cup ticket process is a labyrinth of lotteries, long waits, fluctuating prices and frustration. So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

The first lottery opened in September. The next route to tickets — the second “phase” of a four-phase rollout — begins October 27. Here's what you need to know about that route and others to the 2026 tournament, which will take place next June and July across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

On Oct. 27, likely at 11 a.m. ET.

But, like with the first lottery, you don't need to rush to your smartphone or computer at a specific time that day. You can enter anytime between then and Oct. 31. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The upcoming lottery will likely mirror the first lottery. Millions of people will create a “FIFA ID” account and apply. FIFA will randomly select a minority of them, notify the lucky few via email, and give them a 24- or 48-hour time slot to purchase tickets — “subject to availability.”

FIFA said it made around 1 million tickets — roughly 15% of the 2026 World Cup's total inventory — available in the first phase, across all 104 matches. For the World Cup final, the allotment of tickets sold out within hours; by the end of the third time slot, standard allotments for the semifinals, quarterfinals, round of 16, opener and other games — including almost all games in Canada and Mexico — were also gone, and never replenished.

The second phase will likely be similar, though FIFA could tweak the process.

Not great.

FIFA said that over 4.5 million people entered the first lottery. The second one, like the first, will be open to everyone — diehard soccer fans, casual sports fans, profit-seeking scalpers and more. If another 1 million tickets are available, and each lottery winner can purchase up to 40, the percentage of entrants chosen will again be small.

FIFA has not said how many fans will be picked, in part because it notifies winners on a rolling basis. Your chances depend on how many people chosen before you actually buy tickets, and how many tickets they buy. Rejection notices won't be sent until the end of the phase.

At the onset of sales, according to fans who sent screenshots and data to The Athletic, tickets were priced as follows:

Those prices, though, are subject to change via FIFA's “variable pricing” model. In fact, some already did during the first presale phase. The Athletic has been tracking prices, via screenshots sent by fans, and identified at least 16 games that were subject to at least one price increase in the opening week of sales.

It's not known how, if at all, prices might change before or during the second phase.

FIFA prefers the term “variable pricing” instead of “dynamic pricing” because, it says, prices don't jump algorithmically or automatically when a carefully-programmed computer senses demand. The adjustments are instead made by humans — though automation is part of the process, an official acknowledged in September.

Although some slight adjustments — roughly 5% increases — were made in the October sales period, the expectation is that bigger jumps, and more adjustments, will be made in the third lottery phase, after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw. At that point, matchups will be set and demand will increase for games involving popular teams. (It could also decrease, and prices could fall, for games involving less popular teams.)

Even in these early phases, before matchups and team locations are set, before some nations have even qualified, FIFA is offering “team-specific” packages.

If you're selected in a lottery and want to follow, say, England through the tournament, you could pay $930 for a Category 1 ticket to England's first game, and another $930 for the second game, and another $930 for the third game — wherever and whenever those games are. (It'd be $700-$705 per Category 2 ticket, and $320-$325 apiece in Category 3.)

Prices were similar for the likes of Argentina and Brazil, less for mid-tier teams like Japan and Turkey ($745 per match in Category 1, $560 in Category 2, $260 in Category 3); and less still for unheralded teams or those who likely won't qualify. If the team you select doesn't ultimately qualify, you'll be reimbursed, FIFA says.

You could also go through your team's national federation, or wait for what FIFA calls “conditional supporter tickets (for supporters who want to reserve a seat for one of their team's potential matches in a knockout round),” which “are expected to be available closer to the tournament,” it said in a September release.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section. For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

For the 2026 World Cup, a Category 1 ticket could be anywhere in the lower bowl or somewhere on the second deck of an NFL stadium. The Category 2 sections, for the most part, are on the upper deck along the sideline. Category 3 seats are on the upper deck behind/above the end line. Category 4 is tiny slivers of corner sections on the upper deck, or whatever seats are farthest away from the field.

FIFA has not publicly released color-coded stadium maps showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022, but it has shown those maps to ticket buyers in the first presale phase. Fans have compiled those maps here and here.

Be patient.

More lotteries are coming. And more importantly, tickets will surely be available on resale platforms. They might be costly, but probably not as costly as they appear right now — because, for many (though not all) sporting events, prices tend to fall closer to the event.

For buyers, “oftentimes waiting is beneficial,” Matt Ferrel, a TickPick executive, told The Athletic. “If people have tickets and aren't able to attend, they're setting the price high to recoup whatever they invested in the game, but what they ultimately want to do is offload the ticket.”

Most sellers and buyers will likely head to FIFA's official resale platform, unless other sites like StubHub offer to take lower fees. (FIFA will charge both the buyer and the seller a 15% fee on every sale on its platform.)

FIFA can't fully stop those unauthorized sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets, but it has warned fans against buying from them — because doing so carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't actually have.

FIFA, on the other hand, can offer that guarantee. World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi said in September that FIFA's platform would be “a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four tickets per match and up to 40 tickets across the entire tournament per household.

There's been confusion surrounding what, exactly, qualifies as a “household.” FIFA cleared up some of that confusion last month.

If you'd like to go to a game with a group of more than four people, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs. (Though if the entire group of five-plus people lives in the same household, you might be out of luck.)

Not yet. These early ticket lotteries are open to all fans, from the co-host countries and abroad.

A World Cup official said in September that there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

Protection of political, economic and commercial interests has led to FIFA's ‘double standards' in countering anti-Israel protests and calls for sanctions, say experts.

Israel will resume its qualification campaign for the FIFA World Cup 2026 this coming weekend amid widespread public protests and growing demands for football's governing body to sanction the country over its genocide in Gaza.

Despite the widespread opposition, Israel's upcoming World Cup qualifiers – against Norway on Saturday and Italy on Tuesday – will go ahead as scheduled after FIFA sidestepped the issue by saying it cannot “solve geopolitical problems”.

Football fans and several experts have accused FIFA and UEFA of double standards over their failure to act against Israel in the two years of its war on Gaza, while swiftly sanctioning Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

More than 30 legal experts have called on UEFA to bar Israel and its clubs from competitions over the atrocities in Gaza.

The letter said banning Israel was “imperative”, citing a report by a United Nations commission of inquiry that concluded that Israel was carrying out a genocide against Palestinians. The letter highlighted the damage that Israel has inflicted on the sport in Gaza – at least 421 Palestinian footballers have been killed since Israel began its military offensive in October 2023 – and said Israel's bombing campaign was “systematically destroying Gaza's football infrastructure”.

While a ceasefire deal was agreed between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Thursday, the war on Gaza has killed at least 67,183 people and wounded 169,841 in more than two years. Almost a third of those killed were children. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings.

Last month, Spanish Sports Minister Pilar Alegria said Israeli teams should be banned from sport in the same way that Russian ones were in 2022.

“[Israeli forces] have killed more than 60,000 people; children, babies [are] starving to death, hospitals destroyed,” Alegria told Spanish radio station Cadena SER.

“It is difficult to explain and understand that there is a double standard. It is important that sport, given this situation, takes a position at least similar to what it did against Russia.”

Former France and Manchester United captain Eric Cantona questioned the inaction from football officials while speaking at a fundraising event for Palestine in London on September 17.

“FIFA and UEFA must suspend Israel,” he said. “Clubs everywhere must refuse to play Israeli teams.”

Additionally, hundreds of thousands of football fans and pro-Palestine protesters have called for similar measures against Israel over the past two years.

Fans have used banners, tifos, pitch invasions, stadium walkouts and other means to register their protests inside and outside sport venues.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has brushed aside the calls by indirectly addressing it as a “geopolitical issue” at the FIFA Council on October 2.

“We are committed to using the power of football to bring people together in a divided world,” Infantino said.

The apparently preferential treatment given to Israel's football team is an extension of the “total impunity” the country has enjoyed amid the two-year war, according to Abdullah Al-Arian, associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar.

“Sporting bodies often mirror the broader power politics that are at play [in the world] and so they're only doing what we've seen happen across all walks of political life, in which Israel has not been held to account,” Al-Arian told Al Jazeera.

“It [Israel] has been allowed to operate with total impunity throughout this genocide and has enjoyed this impunity for many decades.”

Al-Arian, who authored the book Football in the Middle East: State, Society, and the Beautiful Game, said the double standards and “complicity” of the governing bodies were in plain sight.

“FIFA has been under pressure for two years, but it [the demand for Israel's suspension] escalated after the latest UN finding [on Israel's genocide in Gaza] and led to a real mobilisation.

“But there was a swift reaction from the United States to intervene on behalf of Israel and, basically, issue all kinds of threats against these bodies should they proceed [with sanctions against Israel].”

Al-Arian highlighted the US's role as co-host for the next World Cup, along with Mexico and Canada, and the “very close relationship” between US President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino as another factor.

 



 

In 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) presented arguments accusing the Israel Football Association (IFA) of violating FIFA statutes with its war on Gaza and the inclusion of clubs located in illegal settlements on Palestinian territory in its domestic football league.

The PFA wanted FIFA to adopt “appropriate sanctions” against Israel's national side and club teams, including an international ban.

It called on FIFA to ban Israel, but the world body postponed its decision by delegating the matter to its disciplinary committee for review. Al-Arian termed that “a move to keep the bureaucratic machinery moving without making any real progress”.

“Ultimately, it's a political decision being made at the highest levels of the organisation,” he said.

Al-Arian believes the PFA is under “immense pressure” from Israel.

“Being under the thumb of an occupying power, the PFA is under tremendous internal constraints, and its decision to advance this issue has often been met with very severe consequences,” he explained.

Those consequences, he suggested, have included Israel preventing Palestinian athletes from travelling, and the “Palestinian team from meeting collectively in one place for training”.

“International matches have not been held in Palestine for years,” he pointed out. “And this is before we even get into the violence to which Palestinian footballers have been exposed. A number of players have been shot or imprisoned, held at checkpoints over the years, and entire careers have been destroyed.”

The PFA comes within the auspices of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which Al-Arian argued does not always “serve the Palestinian interests”.

“There are certainly a lot of critiques to be made in terms of the PA's own posture with respect to Palestinian rights. Many people have referred to it as a kind of occupation subcontractor.”

Yet, this isn't the first time that Israel has faced calls for expulsion from football bodies.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954 and played under its umbrella for 20 years.

In 1974, several Muslim and Arab countries – as well as North Korea – refused to play against Israel. This followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

Kuwait led a movement against Israel's membership in the AFC and the 17 to 13 vote resulted in its expulsion from the regional body. In the 1980s, Israel played the majority of its international matches against European nations and was part of the European qualifiers for the World Cups. In 1994, it was granted full membership of UEFA.

Israel is placed in Group I of UEFA's qualifiers for the World Cup alongside Italy and Norway.

While the Italian government has largely been supportive of Israel during the war on Gaza, the country has witnessed increasingly huge protests calling for a ceasefire and criticising Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government for its refusal to condemn Israel.

Norway's government, meanwhile, has called for the country's sovereign wealth fund – the largest in the world – to scrutinise all investments in Israel, and withdraw from those linked to the war or the illegal occupation of the West Bank.

For the football teams of these nations, though, the stakes are different – they risk elimination from the qualifying process by pulling out of the fixtures.

“We have to play this match. Because if we don't, we'll lose it 3-0,” Italy's head coach Gennaro Gattuso said, referring to the rule for forfeited matches.

Norway has pledged to donate money earned from ticket sales at its match against Israel to the humanitarian work of Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF) in Gaza.

Both matches are expected to attract protesters outside the stadiums and pro-Palestine messaging inside.

“It's not going to be a calm environment,” Gattuso acknowledged on Tuesday, after Italy's training session was also targeted by protesters.

“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside the stadium,” he said.

According to Al-Arian, while sport has been an avenue for advancing popular causes and protest movements, its “commodification” has put heavy constraints on achieving the objectives of these protests.

“The changing relationship of global football over the last couple of decades has been one in which financial and political interests often play a very big role and put a severe limitation on football as a site of mobilisation,” he said.

“This is why football associations that should be far more sympathetic and stand in solidarity fall far short of expectations.”

The 1974 expulsion of Israel from the AFC is often cited as an example of Arab and Muslim unity against Israeli atrocities in Palestine. However, the same nations have not been able to press FIFA to sanction Israel, and Al-Arian believes these states do not pursue such policies due to “deeper incentivisation”.

“The political, economic and commercial relationships that have been established [in the past decades] make it really difficult [for the states to take action],” he said.

“This also comes after a wave of normalisation efforts where some Arab and Muslim states have normalised their ties with Israel and have maintained diplomatic relations with it throughout the Gaza genocide.”

The top spot is at stake in Scotland's 2026 World Cup qualifying group as it plays host to Greece on Thursday.

Scotland welcomes Greece to Hampden Park on Thursday with a chance to climb to the summit of its 2026 World Cup qualifying group. Steve Clarke & Co sit level on points with Group C leader Denmark and is yet to taste defeat after two games, only just missing out on first place due to goal difference.

This clash presents a matchup between two teams who have already met twice thus far in 2025. And despite an away win in Athens during the UEFA Nations League play-offs back in March, Scotland missed out on promotion to the competition's top rung after a 3-0 home defeat to Greece in the return leg.

The ghosts of that game will still be haunting some of the players in Clarke's squad, though Thursday also hands them a shot at redemption. That decisive result seven months ago marked Scotland's first home loss to the Piratiko, and a second in succession could prove all too costly to their chances of World Cup qualification.

Torino striker Che Adams is the only Scottish player to have scored for the team through two games, with their only other finish coming courtesy of a Belarus own-goal. Greece, on the other hand, produced five different scorers against the same opponent, though Benfica frontman Vangelis Pavlidis is the team's biggest threat up top.

Perhaps now more than at any other point in the modern history of football, the subject of stadia is increasingly dominant. Manchester United are trying to completely rebuild Old Trafford to the cost of £2 billion ($2.7bn). Spurs are six years into the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium experience and at last have a trophy to put in their new cabinet. Chelsea's dispute over land in west London continues to cast a shadow over the future and suitability of Stamford Bridge. Newcastle's Saudi owners are still deciding whether they should expand St James' Park or make use of the space on the adjacent land to start from scratch.

And then we have Arsenal, who must feel like the J. Robert Oppenheimer of these lavish new builds. Back in 2006, the Gunners made the short move from their iconic Highbury home to a plush arena on the site of Ashburton Grove, known nowadays as the Emirates Stadium.

Almost 20 years on, the north Londoners are looking into the prospect of expanding their home. It has been reported throughout 2025 that this was becoming much more of a topic of discussion within the club's walls, and the Telegraph broke the news on Tuesday that they are indeed planning what has been described as 'major expansion'. There is, however, a pitfall that will affect match-going supporters. 

In order to undertake the works necessary for renovations, Arsenal would have to temporarily up sticks and play their home matches elsewhere for an undetermined period of time. The most likely venue would be Wembley, which boasts a capacity of 90,000 and is only about 10 miles across the capital city. On the face of it, that's hardly a negative, but it's only when you dig deeper that you realise the major downsides of such a move.

 Valentin Vacherot added another memorable moment to his 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters odyssey on Thursday afternoon. The Monegasque qualifier outlasted 10th seed Holger Rune for a stunning 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 quarter-final victory at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000. 

 Despite a difficult start, the World No. 204 Vacherot stuck with Rune in the second set before powering past the Dane in the decider to become the second lowest-ranked semi-finalist in Masters 1000 history (since 1990), after then-World No. 550 Chris Woodruff at 1999 Indian Wells. With his two-hour, 59-minute victory, the 26-year-old Vacherot simultaneously ensured he will on Monday crack the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. He is up 112 spots to No. 92 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. 

Remember the name 🌟World No. 204 @val_vacherot defeats Rune to reach the @SH_RolexMasters final four.#RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/oTVxHiaNpM

 “I didn't come as a qualifier, I came as an alternate. I wasn't even sure I was going to play qualifying,” said Vacherot. “This is just unbelievable. The last win meant already so much to me. This one means even more. 

 “It was tough not to think about it on match point, also breaking the Top 100. I know this is just a step, but I tried not to look at the rankings for this whole tournament. I had read that if I won, I would break the Top 100, but this is just unbelievable for me. I cannot wait for [the semi-final]. I'm just so happy and living the dream.” 

 Vacherot held a physical edge over Rune in the deciding set, during which the World No. 11 twice called for the trainer to massage his right upper leg. Although the Dane continued to go for his shots, Vacherot held his nerve to save two break points in the 10th game before converting his second match point for the biggest win of his career. 

 Vacherot has come back from a set down in five of his seven matches in Shanghai (including two in qualifying). He will next bid to reach his first tour-level final when he takes on record four-time champion Novak Djokovic or Zizou Bergs in the last four.

 “First set, physically I was really shocked. That was a step above [what I am used to],” said Vacherot. “I already thought Tallon [Griekspoor, in the fourth round], tennis-wise, was playing really good. I was already shocked about that. Sascha Bublik, we know how he plays. You could expect any shot at any second. That's why he's so good. 

 “But today I was shocked by how [Rune] was defending. Points that I would win against 90 per cent of the guys, for him it was just a random ball. I felt like I was coming in and would have an easy volley. So the first set was pretty physical. My lungs were screaming a little bit, but that helped me a lot for the second set, because I just went off to change and it helped me to play a little bit more free.” 

 Already the first Monegasque quarter-finalist in Masters 1000 history, Vacherot extended his run by converting two of four break points he earned in the match against Rune, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He is the second qualifier to reach a Masters 1000 semi-final in 2025, after Terence Atmane also made that stage in August in Cincinnati.

 Novak Djokovic has not had it easy at the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters, but the Serbian remains on course for a record-extending fifth title at the ATP Masters 1000. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Thursday overcame Zizou Bergs 6-3, 6-4 to book his semi-final spot in China. With his victory, the 38-year-old Serbian became the oldest semi-finalist in Masters 1000 history. 

 Djokovic, who battled through a leg issue and exhaustion in the Shanghai heat during his fourth-round win against Jaume Munar, again struggled physically during the opening set against Bergs. Yet he shook off what appeared to be a problem with his left foot to advance to reach the last four at a Masters 1000 event for a record-extending 80th time. 

 The Serbian ended the match having saved four of five break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He is now 27-0 for the season after winning the first set.

 Djokovic initially served for the match after breaking Bergs' serve for 5-4 in the second set, but a spirited Bergs immediately drew level with a high-quality return game. In the next game, Djokovic repelled four Bergs overheads and a swinging volley to prevail in one of the points of the tournament en route to breaking serve again, and this time the 100-time tour-level titlist made no mistake in closing out his win.

 “I was just trying to stay alive to be honest on the court,"" reflected Djokovic after his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with the 26-year-old Bergs. ""My first encounter with Bergs. He's a great guy. Obviously, a lot of firepower in his game. At times I just tried to play an extra ball in the court and make him miss the ball, and that's what happened. I should have closed out the match at 5-4. He played a good game, again I was a little bit too passive. 

 “Very challenging conditions these days for all the players, and I was just trying to stay alive on the court. I'm glad to overcome this hurdle.” 

 Djokovic is now two wins away from a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 crown, and his first since the 2023 Rolex Paris Masters. Standing between him and a spot in the Shanghai championship match is Valentin Vacherot, after the Monegasque qualifier earlier upset 10th seed Holger Rune 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4.

Could Novak Djokovic further rewrite the history books at the Rolex Shanghai Masters?

The Serbian owns the ATP Masters 1000 records for most titles (40), finals (60) and semi-finals (79) according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and he has an opportunity to extend each of those marks this week in China, where he is into the quarter-finals.

Djokovic already has the most titles in tournament history with four and is three victories from lifting a record-extending fifth trophy. It would be his first Masters 1000 triumph since the 2023 Rolex Paris Masters.

This is not the only Masters 1000 event where he has earned more crowns than any other player, though. In fact, he is the record-holder for most titles at more events in the series than anyone else.

The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings holds the record for most trophies — or is tied for the most — at four of the nine Masters 1000 tournaments currently on the ATP Tour calendar. He is tied for the top mark at Indian Wells (5, with Roger Federer) and Miami (6, with Andre Agassi), while standing alone in Shanghai and Paris.

Members of the ATP No. 1 Club have dominated the winner's circle at Masters 1000 events. The player with the most crowns at each of the nine tournaments has climbed to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings in his career.

Rafael Nadal has claimed the most crowns at the three clay-court Masters 1000 tournaments, in Monte-Carlo (11), Madrid (5) and Rome (10), Ivan Lendl has won Canada six times and Federer emerged victorious seven times in Cincinnati.

But nobody has matched Djokovic's success at the level. The Serbian's number of Masters 1000 trophies is double the tally for all but two players in series history (since 1990): Nadal (36) and Federer (28).

The 38-year-old Djokovic, now the oldest Masters 1000 quarter-finalist in series history following his success so far in Shanghai, will try to extend his run on Thursday when he plays Zizou Bergs for a place in the semi-finals.

Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka both delivered superb serving performances to set the stage for the 13th edition of their rivalry in the  Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals. Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini also bolstered their bids to reach the WTA Finals Riyadh.

It'll be Aryna Sabalenka vs. Elena Rybakina XIII in the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals.

The two rivals will square off for the 13th time after both came through tough matchups in straight sets on Thursday. No. 1 seed Sabalenka needed just 1 hour and 15 minutes to defeat No. 16 seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-3, 6-2, and No. 8 seed Rybakina followed with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Beijing finalist Linda Noskova.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Three-time Wuhan champion Sabalenka extended her unbeaten record at the tournament to 19-0, and her active winning streak to eight matches. Having lost two of her first three matches with Samsonova in 2022 and 2023, she has now won three in a row -- all in straight sets -- over the past 14 months. Rybakina, making her first appearance in Wuhan since reaching the 2019 quarterfinals on her debut, returned to that stage for a second time with her third win in as many meetings with Noskova.

How did Sabalenka and Rybakina advance?

It's not unusual that Sabalenka and Rybakina's performances revolve around the quality of the serve, but the stroke was on particularly sweet form for both players here. Neither even faced a break point -- despite landing just 49% of first serves, in Rybakina's case. (Sabalenka's first serve percentage was a tidier 66%.)

Sabalenka was particularly unbothered on serve. She conceded just 10 points behind her delivery in total; Samsonova could only once muster multiple points on return in a single game. Rybakina was pushed harder, but won all four deuce points (across three separate games) that she played in the match.

Rybakina also had to be patient to quell a valiant performance from Noskova. The 20-year-old Czech, bidding to reach back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals, managed to save the first six break points she faced with clutch aggressive play, and overall fended off 10 out of 12. But at 4-3 in the first set, it was lucky number seven for Rybakina as Noskova double faulted to drop serve for the first time.

How has the Sabalenka vs. Rybakina rivalry broken down so far?

Their quarterfinal on Friday will be something of a full-circle moment: Sabalenka and Rybakina first faced each other (at pro level) at the same stage of the same tournament back in 2019. Sabalenka won that match 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, the first of four three-set wins in a row to start their rivalry -- including a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph in the 2023 Australian Open final, the only major title match they have contested so far. Overall, Sabalenka leads the head-to-head 7-5.

However, once Rybakina got on the board with a 7-6(11), 6-4 win in the 2023 Indian Wells final, she has begun turning it in her favour. The Kazakhstani player has won five of their last eight meetings, and in fact leads the head-to-head on outdoor hard courts 5-4 overall -- Sabalenka has not defeated Rybakina on hard courts since the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun. The last time they played, Rybakina needed just 75 minutes to wrap up a 6-1, 6-4 win in the Cincinnati quarterfinals in August.

Match length is another factor to keep an eye on. Four of Rybakina's five wins in the series have come in straight sets; the only time she has won a decider against Sabalenka was at the 2024 WTA Finals Riyadh, where she came through 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. By contrast, all seven of Sabalenka's wins have been three-setters, including a 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(6) escape from quadruple match point down in this year's Berlin quarterfinals. The takeaway from that statistic seems to be that while Rybakina can find a level that permits her to shut Sabalenka out completely, if the match comes down to the wire then Sabalenka has the edge.

How is Rybakina's bid to make the WTA Finals Riyadh faring?

Two spots are up for grabs at the WTA Finals Riyadh, and three of the top four players in contention for them have all advanced to the Wuhan quarterfinals. As well as Rybakina, Jessica Pegula came through 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 over Ekaterina Alexandrova and Jasmine Paolini advanced after a right thigh injury forced Clara Tauson to retire trailing 3-6, 6-1, 3-1.

Paolini and Rybakina remain in eighth and ninth position respectively, and have put some distance between themselves and the chasing pack -- particularly given 10th-placed Alexandrova's loss, which means that no one is able to overtake Rybakina directly in Wuhan this week. The exits of both 11th-placed Tauson and 15th-placed Noskova have also helped.

Pegula's win also means that neither Paolini nor Rybakina can overtake her this week. However, seventh-placed Mirra Andreeva -- who lost her Wuhan opener to Laura Siegemund on Tuesday -- is in their sights. Both Paolini and Rybakina, who are on opposite sides of the draw, can overtake Andreeva if they reach the final. Rybakina needs to advance further than Paolini to overtake the Italian this week; if they lose in the same round, Paolini will remain ahead.

Jessica Pegula has made a habit of winning three-set matches lately and continued the trend Thursday, defeating No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just over two hours to advance to the quarterfinals in Wuhan for the first time.

The phrase “expect the unexpected” may have met its match in Jessica Pegula.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

For the sixth straight outing, Pegula took the court, and the result was a three-setter -- and for the fifth time, she came out on top.

“I can't remember the last time I played two sets,” Pegula said after the match. “But I've been competing really hard and I've been playing a lot of really good players. It was different conditions today with the roof closed and I think it took us a little while to get adjusted, but then I felt like it was a really high level there for the rest of the match.

“I'm just excited I was able to get over the finish line.”

The American rallied from a 5-2 deficit in the opening set to defeat No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in 2 hours and 6 minutes, advancing to the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open quarterfinals for the first time in her career.

Pegula improved to 3-3 in the head-to-head against Alexandrova, earning her first win over the Russian on a surface other than clay. She'll face the winner of Iva Jovic and Katerina Siniakova in the next round.

Here are some takeaways following another Pegula three-set victory:

Moment(s) of the match: Two pivotal stretches defined the match -- one in the opening set, the other in the decider.

With Alexandrova serving at 5-5, 15-30 in the first set, Pegula capped off a 12-shot rally with a blistering backhand winner to earn a break point, she converted, securing a 6-5 lead to allow her to serve for the set. It was the fourth of five straight games won by Pegula in her opening-set comeback.

Fast forward to the third set, and Pegula was trailing 7-5, 3-6, 1-2 and facing 30–30 on Alexandrova's serve. What followed was a defensive masterclass by Pegula.

She chased down multiple would-be winners -- including a smash -- and ended an 18-shot rally with a forehand winner to earn another break point. She converted, leveling the set at 2-all.

The break sparked a run of four straight games for Pegula, who surged to a 5-2 lead before closing out the match a couple games later.

Game. Set. Match. 🎾@JPegula comes out on top against Alexandrova winning 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 💪#WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/BLw0gEFp2d

Three is key: Winning three-setters has become a habit for Pegula, albeit an unintentional one.

Thursday's match marked her sixth consecutive three-setter, dating back to her third-round clash with Emma Raducanu last week in Beijing.

Across the 2025 season, Pegula has played a Hologic WTA Tour-leading 25 three-set matches, compiling a 14-11 record. Only Madison Keys (15) has won more three-setters than Pegula this year.

The 31-year-old went 13-7 in such matches in 2024.

Quarterfinal staple: With Thursday's win, Pegula has now reached the quarterfinals of a WTA event 10 times this season. Only Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka (13 each) have more.

She is 7-2 in quarterfinal matches thus far this season, coincidentally with both losses coming against Alexandrova.

Pegula also became the third active player, joining Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, to reach the quarterfinals at all 10 WTA 1000 tournaments on the calendar.

Jessica Pegula has made a habit of winning three-set matches lately and continued the trend Thursday, defeating No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just over two hours to advance to the quarterfinals in Wuhan for the first time.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Currently, Alcaraz is sidelined after withdrawing from the Shanghai Masters due to an ankle injury sustained during his run to the Tokyo title, where he defeated Taylor Fritz in the final.The Spaniard has previously voiced concerns about the ATP's crowded calendar. “The calendar is so tight, a lot of tournaments, no days off or not as much days off as I want,” he said at the Laver Cup. “I'm the kind of player who thinks there is a lot of mandatory tournaments during the year, and probably during the next few years gonna be even more tournaments… I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.”Still, the 22-year-old's busy schedule has drawn criticism—including from 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who called the complaints “contradictory”.

“Look, it's an individual sport, so there are choices to be made,” Djokovic said in response to comments from Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek. “I see some players say there are rules imposed for the bonus… So you can miss the bonus. It's the choice that you are willing to make if you want to play less.“But then, there are exhibitions that players are signing up for as well, so it's a little bit contradictory.”Alcaraz is next scheduled to appear at the Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia—a three-day exhibition event offering a $1.5 million appearance fee and a $4.5 million winner's prize—before returning to ATP Tour action at the Rolex Paris Masters from October 27 to November 2.

Come Friday, French cousin Arthur Rinderknech looks to join the Monegasque in the final four when he takes on Felix Auger-Aliassime. The family's group chat will be as active as ever by the sound of it.“There are 20, 25 people in the WhatsApp group,” Benjamin Balleret, Vacherot's half brother, coach and former world No. 204, shared with ATPTour.com Wednesday.""Everybody loves tennis and the mother of Arthur played tennis.

Vacherot, who followed in Rinderknech's footsteps by playing college tennis at Texas A&M University before turning pro, owned one 1000-level victory prior to this week. He's been sensational playing from behind, starting with his two qualifying matches. His comeback victories in the main draw prior to Rune included No. 14 seed Alexander Bublik and No. 27 seed Tallon Griekspoor, with his run taking him to 6-1 against Top 50 opponents this season.With Vacherot's effort, a qualifier has now advanced to the semifinals at consecutive Masters 1000 events following Terence Atmane's run in Cincinnati. The 26-year-old is the second lowest-ranked player to appear in the last four on the 1000 stage since the series began 35 years ago and the first qualifier to reach this juncture of the tournament in Shanghai.Not bad for a guy who had no idea if he'd see any tournament action upon arriving.“I landed (last) Thursday evening. I was still nine out. I knew there was a big chance because Shanghai is the (second to) last Masters 1000. A few guys, if you're hurt at the end of the season you are not taking risks. I knew it will drop,” he recalled in press.“I said, ‘worst of all, I was going to be here one week earlier, because I was going to play five more Challengers after.' Now I'm just going to go home after this tournament, so it's another funny story.”

Rinderknech is also set to contest the biggest quarterfinal of his career at the age of 30. He, too, has knocked off a trio of seeded opponents to earn his spot among the last eight that included ousting third-ranked Alexander Zverev for the second time in 2025. A win over Auger-Aliassime would enable the Gassin native to call himself a Top 40 player for the first time.For Rune, it was a missed opportunity to make up substantial ground in the race to the ATP Finals. The Dane will remain at No. 12 and find himself no less than 935 points behind the all-important eighth position as the Turin leaderboard takes further shape. Auger-Aliassime can make the deficit greater if he moves up with a deep run here.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Landing at #4 on our list of ‘Greatest Races' is the 1997 European Grand Prix at Jerez, where title rivals Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve came to blows in a showdown for the ages.

To mark F1's 75th anniversary celebrations, F1.com is counting down the sport's 25 greatest races with a new feature every week. While you may not agree with the order, we hope you enjoy the stories of these epic races that have helped make this sport what it is today. You can read the introduction to the series and see the list of races here.

At No. 4, Jacques Villeneuve shares his memories of the 1997 European Grand Prix weekend – where the Williams driver beat Ferrari rival Michael Schumacher to the title after a bizarre Qualifying session and controversial banging of wheels on race day – with Mike Seymour...

It all started with Michael at Estoril in 1996, when I overtook him around the outside of the last corner. That's when the 1997 season really began!

It was a strange year in that we hardly ever fought wheel-to-wheel. We weren't even on the podium together at any race, which is crazy. The battle was happening outside of the car, through the media – not really on the track.

It was either win or nothing for both of us, rarely scoring points that weren't for a win. A lot happened with incidents and mechanical failures, and it kept bouncing between who was leading the championship and making the most progress.

Heading to Jerez, I wasn't nervous at all. I was very calm, in my own bubble, like nothing else existed. It's probably the Saturday night that I slept the best before a race. I had a mission, and I knew I was coming out of that weekend as the champion. I just knew.

A lot of things could go wrong, obviously, because we were a point behind in the championship, so it would just take an accident, a DNF, and that would be it – Michael would be champion. But somehow, the confidence was there for me.

I was always better when there was a lot of pressure, when it was money time. It was the same when we won the Indianapolis 500. We went two laps down, we had to fight back, and we won. It's getting into that same mindset.

I'd also just been disqualified at Suzuka. I had a nine-point lead going to Japan, and a win was worth 10 points back then. Getting disqualified before the race helped me get in that mindset. It made me feel like the little dog that's cornered, and that really had a positive effect.

The energy when we arrived at Jerez was electric. You could feel it in the paddock through the whole weekend. But it was a tough track for us, a little big like Magny-Cours. It's an ‘oversteery' track, and I like oversteer, so if you have an oversteery track and you drive an oversteery car, at some point it just becomes too much. It was very difficult to find a good set-up.

With the level of intensity in Qualifying, the first lap I did was super good. I didn't overdrive the car, it came good, and I thought, ‘That'll be hard to repeat'. But normally, everybody keeps going faster and faster and faster in Qualifying, and that didn't happen.

My first run turned out to be my quickest. I just couldn't beat it. Then Schumacher and my team mate, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, posted lap times to the same thousandth of a second! Having done my lap first is what gave me pole. Everything happened the wrong way, but it paid off.

On Saturday night, we spent hours discussing a million strategies – with my team mate, with the rest of the team – and guess what? None of them actually panned out. We started overthinking.

At Turn 1, the whole thing was a mess because of that. Michael moved into the lead, then I saw Frentzen was close, so I braked early and let him by. After that first lap I thought, ‘Okay, let's screw all the strategies and just go for it', and that's when it started working again.

I believed I could get Michael. Going into that race, there had been a lot of discussions about his antics in previous years. It was very mediatised, and everybody was talking about it. Even the FIA took a stance and said that if something nasty happens, a penalty will be used, such as disqualification.

All of this was in Michael's and Ferrari's heads before the race weekend, day after day, and when it's going on for a week, it starts to have an effect. You don't drive the same way. So, the pressure started there.

I knew also that, in general, we were better off with tyre wear. I knew I could push hard, push Michael, and hopefully push him either into a mistake or into overusing his tyres, creating a situation that would give me that one moment, a few seconds of an edge.

That's ultimately what happened.

Frentzen was pushing early on, not really caring about his tyres. Maybe it pushed Michael a bit too much. Then Frentzen slowed down, I got back into being the hunter, and I just kept hunting Michael down.

We were very similar on pace. He was quicker coming out of the slow-speed corners, while I was better in the high-speed corners and under braking. It was balancing out, and it was just a question of judging where I could make a move, if I could make a move.

There's no point attacking at every corner. Sometimes you have to leave a little gap, focus, and decide when to pounce. You really need to figure it out, but always staying close enough in the mirrors to make sure the driver in front of you is never resting. That's the key.

I made both of my pit stops a lap later than Michael. Shortly after my second stop, I took Turn 1, 2, 3 and 4 more on the edge than any other lap – I even had two wheels a little bit over the sand. But I could see that I was a metre-and-a-half closer to Michael than I had been before, and I knew it was now or never. I had to go for it.

I wanted to wait until Michael wasn't looking in his mirrors anymore to pop out. I was still far enough behind that to him it would look like I was at the same distance as every other lap, and I never made an overtake on those laps.

Once we hit the brakes into Dry Sac, I knew he would focus on the corner and wouldn't look in his mirrors anymore. That's when I pulled out, and he realised too late. I was amazed he did not manage to take me out, because it was a big hit. I didn't know where I'd been hit… I thought the rear suspension, but it was the battery stand.

I still tried to go fast after that, but instead of braking at 100 metres out, I would brake at 105 metres, gradually getting on the brake, gradually getting on the throttle, avoiding the kerbs, and never give a jolt on the steering wheel, just in case the car was damaged.

Sometimes you're on the edge of breaking down, and if you're smooth and massage the car a little bit, you'll reach the end. That was my only focus. I wasn't paying attention to anything else, or to my opponents, because I didn't need to win. I just needed to get one point.

Thank God I finished the race, because the battery rack had been damaged and was hanging only on the electrical cables. It should not have held on.

The team didn't even tell me that the McLaren boys, Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, were getting closer. There was no communication. I think everybody had stopped breathing!

I now wish I'd fought harder and not thought about the championship, because I didn't realise it would have been my last win in F1, or my last potential win! At that moment, though, I really didn't care about finishing the race in third.

We had an amazing party afterwards. It was in the good old fashion way that predated social media. Someone took the key at the hotel and made an open bar. I was serving drinks for around 20 people – friends, this and that.

Anyway, Jerez was the culmination of a crazy 1997 season for us all – it was amazing that it all came down to the final race.

It was super cool to sit on Hakkinen and Coulthard's shoulders on the podium, and I'll also always remember being handed a phone because the Prime Minister of Canada had called me! It's moments like these that you just can't imagine.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

From Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl to Bad Bunny's lyrical nods and the soundtrack of F1 The Movie, Formula 1 has often crossed into pop music – creating a playlist that only racing could inspire.

Taylor Swift's latest album The Life of a Showgirl dropped on the same weekend as the Singapore Grand Prix, and F1 teams wasted no time weaving its lyrics into their social feeds, with several drivers having been already declared Swifties.

Then came the announcement that Bad Bunny will headline next year's Super Bowl – an artist who's already turned the sport and drivers into lyrical shorthand to great acclaim.

However, it turns out Formula 1 has been long been making its way into the music sphere long before the current wave of superstar shoutouts. Here's how F1 has sped its way into the global music charts.

His 2024 album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS brought a mix of irresistible dancing and nostalgia across social media. Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny is a music superstar – he boasts over 107 billion streams, three Grammy awards, 11 Latin Grammys, and has just been announced as the next Super Bowl half-time show performer. The latin music icon has also declared his love for Formula 1 within his work.

“Primero llegó Verstappen, después llegó Checo” (First Verstappen arrived, then Checo) and “Créeme, los carro' de F1 son má' rápido' en persona” (Believe me, F1 cars are faster in person) are two lines from his famous track MONACO, which describes the luxury flair of the city – home to Charles Leclerc and the iconic Grand Prix. He also raps, “La vida va como Verstappen en Fórmula 1…” (Life goes by like Verstappen in Formula 1) in his song Andrea.

The artist built on that success with LOS PITS, directly alluding to the F1 pit lane. But as a superfan, Bad Bunny went further this year by forming a historic partnership with Mercedes and Adidas Originals to put his home nation on the map, taking part in the celebrations where fans witnessed a Formula 1 car being fired up in Puerto Rico for the very first time.

Global superstar Taylor Swift is more often associated with the NFL, with her fiancé being Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce, but some of the Swifties who also share a passion for F1 did not let certain lyrics from her songs go unnoticed.

Released in 2024, The Tortured Poets Department album includes the track imgonnagetyouback, where she sings: “I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch”. Needless to say, both the team and drivers seized the opportunity immediately to feature it on social media.

Swift's highly anticipated record, The Life of a Showgirl, was released on 3 October, coinciding with the Singapore Grand Prix. Most teams – especially McLaren, since the album was papaya-orange colour-coded – could not resist joining the trend and adapted their social posts with a glittery Broadway aesthetic and included her music on their posts.

One specific instance came from Williams, who immediately picked up on the “smooth operators” lyric in the track Eldest Daughter and linked it to Carlos Sainz, who had already turned Sade's original into his celebratory signature song.

After wrapping her blockbuster 1989 World Tour at the end of 2015, the 2016 United States Grand Prix became the stage for Taylor Swift's one and only show of that year – a glitter-drenched, festival-style performance to an audience of 80,000 fans who came from all corners of the globe for F1 racing and stayed for a 15-song setlist that transformed the race weekend into a pop spectacle.

With a little help from their partners, Swiftie fever has been spreading through the paddock over the past few years.

George Russell leaned into the hype, as he showed up at Wembley last summer for The Eras Tour and was captured on camera belting out every lyric flawlessly. Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, embraced the ritual of friendship-bracelet swapping during the Milan leg of the show. He was joined by Pierre Gasly, and the pair – both attending with their partners – vibed to pop's biggest phenomenon.

Others took the karaoke route. Lando Norris, in full cowboy attire, taught Oscar Piastri the lyrics to Love Story during McLaren's “Finish the Lyric” challenge, while Daniel Ricciardo once proudly sang Our Song during an interview, further stating that it was the first Taylor Swift track he ever heard, and the one that kick-started his love for her music.

And if there's one driver who leaves no doubt, it's Ollie Bearman. The Haas rookie admits he loves all of Taylor's songs, with Love Story at the top of his list – having added it to his race weekend playlist.

During his sabbatical from music, ex-Beatles icon George Harrison attended a number of F1 races and, feeling inspired by the drivers, wrote the 1979 hit Faster as a tribute to the late Swedish racer Ronnie Peterson.

With lyrics very much akin to the fast-paced world of motorsport, the songs intro consists of the screaming V8 engines from the start of the 1978 British Grand Prix – the perfect way to set the mood!

In 2000, Robbie Williams offered another unexpected crossover in the music video for his single Supreme. For this motorsport-inspired video, the singer transformed into fictional F1 driver Bob Williams, with racing legend Jackie Stewart making a cameo appearance.

The video cleverly portrayed a reimagined 1971 championship battle between the pair, blending real archive footage cut between new scenes with Williams, and became one of pop's most memorable nods to the golden age of Formula 1.

On the electronic-pop side, will.i.am has long been a friend of the paddock. Over the 2023 season, he launched two dedicated tracks – The Formula (featuring Lil Wayne) and Let's Go (featuring J Balvin) – the latter performed live at the opening ceremony of the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix.

And before BRAT crowned her as pop's cool-girl disruptor, Charli XCX was already embedding F1 into lyrics. Her track Vroom Vroom included a nod to the two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso, “Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah I'm so bossy / Speeding like Alonso just to crash your party” – a line that expertly fused her motorsport knowledge with the unique club-ready attitude of her music.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, F1 The Movie did much more than bring the sport's adrenaline to the big screen.

With 17 all-original songs, the movie's soundtrack featured artists such as Tate McRae (Just Keep Watching), Rosé (Messy), and Don Oliver and Doja Cat (Lose My Mind), and long-time F1 fan Ed Sheeran (Drive). The soundtrack has since become a staple in fans' everyday playlists even months later.

""Although I don't know how to drive. I'm excited to put my well-established passenger – and interviewing – skills to good use.”

The show was filmed at the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix and will be hosted on Amelia's YouTube channel. More details about each programme, including the tasks Amelia will be set, will be shared ahead of each one being released.

“Amelia has one of the most distinctive and entertaining voices in culture today and we love the quality, originality, and global content she produces, so we're thrilled to be putting her in the driving seat on a Formula 1 track and offering some help from a few good drivers we know!” said Ian Holmes, Chief Media Rights and Broadcasting Officer of Formula 1.

“This original series is another way for F1 to entice a new audience into the exciting world of racing.”

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1, added: “This collaboration with Dimz Inc. marks the latest partnership from Formula 1 to engage with its rapidly growing demographic of young fans.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

After labelling Kimi Antonelli's Monza weekend as ""underwhelming"", Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has been impressed by the youngster's performances in Azerbaijan and Singapore.

Toto Wolff believes that his comments on Kimi Antonelli's “underwhelming” weekend at Monza might have helped to motivate the youngster, with the Mercedes boss suggesting that it “lit a fire under the a***” of the rookie following two stronger outings in Baku and Singapore.

After a decent start to his maiden campaign in Formula 1, Antonelli faced a tougher run of form during the European leg of the season, during which he recorded four retirements and just two points finishes towards the latter end of the top 10.

This culminated in another difficult outing at the Italian Grand Prix in September, with Antonelli beaching his car in the gravel following a spin off track during FP2.

After a P9 in Sunday's race, Wolff labelled the 19-year-old's performance at the Italian Grand Prix in September as “underwhelming”, adding: “You can't put the car in the gravel bed and then expect to be there.”

However, Antonelli has gone on to enjoy better weekends since, having claimed P4 in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix before crossing the line fifth in Singapore, a track he has never previously raced at.

Speaking to Sky Sports F1 during the weekend at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Wolff suggested that Antonelli's approach has changed across recent events.

“Since Baku I think we've seen a lot of big focus,” the Team Principal explained. “Certainly Europe hasn't helped, because there was so much attention on him and expectations were so high.

“I feel like he has less work outside, in terms of media duties and sponsorship duties, and he's spending all of his time with his engineering team and that's good.”

Pushed on whether he felt that Antonelli responded well to the kind of remarks he had made after Monza, Wolff responded: “I think it's a learning process also with Kimi to what he responds well [to], and we've always encouraged him, even encouraged [him] to make mistakes because this is the last year of these regulations.

“All the other drivers had got used to these cars – it's his first year, he doesn't know the track, he doesn't know all of this world.

“So for next year everybody starts at zero with a car that you need to learn and, in that respect, I think he's doing a good job, and it seems to have worked to [have] lit a little bit of fire under the a***, so we'll see.”

In terms of whether he is seeing qualities in Antonelli that hint at a future potential to win World Championships – and that put him at the level of the likes of team mate George Russell – Wolff added: “This is a very high level already; if you look at George and Max [Verstappen], the skills are so high, and there's a few others that fall into that bracket.

“I think actually making it into that group would be a success. The junior track record is phenomenal, the best probably that we've seen since 10 years – in go-karting [he was] exceptional – but Formula 1 is a different ball game.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

James Vowles, Team Principal at Williams, is the latest guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

With 16 Drivers' and Teams' World Championships combined, Williams are the third most successful team in Formula 1 history – behind Ferrari and McLaren.

But they haven't won a title since 1997, and it has been 13 years since they last took a race victory, so Team Principal James Vowles is on a mission to bring the glory days back to the Grove-based outfit.

In 2025, the team have taken big steps towards success. Carlos Sainz secured the team's first podium in four years when he finished third in Baku, and they have amassed their highest points total since 2016.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James reveals what he and Carlos spoke about over dinner before that sensational podium, why that result means so much to the whole team, and the reasons Carlos had endured a frustrating season up to that point.

On the other side of the garage, James shares what he thinks is different about Alex Albon this year and how he has risen to the challenge of having a much more experienced and competitive team mate.

And while Williams have performed better than expected in 2025 with such a strong driver line-up, their main focus is 2026. So what opportunities will the new era of Formula 1 bring them?

Given James' first-hand experience of the intense championship battles between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes, what would his approach be if Alex and Carlos are fighting for a title in the coming years?

The Netflix co-CEO made the comments during the Bloomberg Screentime conference Wednesday evening, adding that the company must ""evaluate all our options.""


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Would Netflix make a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery? Comments from co-CEO Greg Peters suggest not, though he left the door open to a potential deal.


	Peters was interviewed during the Bloomberg Screentime conference Wednesday evening, where interviewer Lucas Shaw pressed him on the report that Netflix might be interested in WBD, or at least the company's studios business post-split.




	“We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers. I also think that one should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don't have an amazing track record over the history of time,” Peters said, before adding that “I would say it's our responsibility to evaluate all our options.”

	“Our job is to figure out what's the best way to grow our business?” he continued. “And we have to think really carefully, how do we invest our capital, our time and our attention, and if that's the best way to do it, great, and if it's not, then we should do something else.”


	One area that the company is investing in is games, and Peters announced Wednesday that Netflix would launch family party games for TV sets in the coming weeks and months, including LEGO Party!, Pictionary: Game Night, Boggle Party, Tetris Time Warp.


	Peters also commented on the fact that Netflix's engagement has been somewhat flat, even as the largest streaming platform, YouTube, continues to grow month after month.


	“I'm not happy with the fact that we're not growing engagement,” he said. “We should grow more engagement.”


	But that doesn't mean the company is interested in getting into the user-generated content business.

	











	“I think the dumbest move would be to try and match them in every way,” he added. “Because I think you have to really know what lane you're operating in, and then you try and be excellent at that and then defend that lane. What do we do? We invest with creators so they can tell their stories in really, really compelling ways, in a way that the YouTube model doesn't really allow them to go do. So we want to work with the best creators on the planet. Some of those folks are going to come from YouTube. They're going to come from TikTok.”

Writer-director Robert Vince's film is the latest installment in the franchise centering on a basketball-savvy golden retriever. 


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	The newest installment in the Air Bud franchise is ready to hit the ground running. 


Air Bud Returns, which is planning a 2026 theatrical release, will star Aydin Artis (Blue's Clues & You), Tracy Ifeachor (The Pitt), Edwin Lee Gibson (The Bear), Tyler Labine (New Amsterdam), Erik Gow (Yellowjackets) and Maxim Swinton (Bookie), The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned. Production is currently underway on writer-director Robert Vince's sports film that continues the legacy of 1997's original Air Bud. 




	At the center of the franchise is basketball-playing golden retriever Buddy, portrayed in Air Bud Returns by Roscoe, who was cast by Hollywood animal trainer Mark Forbes. As the result of the movie's recent contest “The Search for the Next Air Bud,” golden retrievers Charlie and Summer will double as Buddy in key basketball and stunt sequences. The forthcoming project hails from Cineverse and Air Bud Entertainment.

Air Bud Returns focuses on 12-year-old Jacob (Artis), an aspiring basketball player coping with the recent loss of his dad. After he and his mom (Ifeachor) move to his dad's childhood home in Fernfield, Jacob discovers a VHS tape of his dad playing basketball on the same court as a hoops-shooting golden retriever. Soon, Jacob begins his own adventure with a neglected golden retriever that he names Buddy.


	Standing in for the franchise's original hometown of Fernfield is Fort Langley, British Columbia, where production recently commenced. Vince helms the new feature after creating the Air Bud franchise and producing all 14 titles in the flagship series and subsequent Air Buddies and Santa Paws spinoff series. Producers on Air Bud Returns include Vince and Anna McRoberts. 

	











	“We couldn't be more excited to officially roll cameras on Air Bud Returns with this incredible cast,” says director and ABE founder Vince. “The passion we saw during the nationwide search for the next Buddy was a reminder of how deeply this franchise resonates with families. With such a talented ensemble alongside our canine stars, this film carries forward the heart and magic that made the original so beloved around the world.”


Air Bud Returns serves as a sequel to director Charles Martin Smith's film Air Bud, which hit theaters in summer of 1997 and centered on the titular golden retriever joining a high school basketball team. It spawned the 1998 theatrical sequel Air Bud: Golden Receiver.


	Adds Cineverse chief motion pictures officer Yolanda Macias, “Announcing our cast and the golden retrievers bringing Buddy to life, right as production begins, is the ideal way to mark the return of the Air Bud legacy. This franchise has always connected across generations, and we are excited to see Air Bud Returns continue that family tradition.”

The Emmy-nominated actor and author pens an open letter to the AI avatar that's got Hollywood in a tizzy.


							By 

	Betty Gilpin



	Dear Tilly Norwood,


	They tell me you are an actress and a computer. I am an actress and almost 40. Let's talk.




	When I was your age… well, wait, no. You are both infant and immortal, like Thor in a diaper. I mean, when I was starting out in my career like you, this very thing happened. An actress older than me pulled me aside and gave me advice.


	I was at a summer theatre festival in 2009, which meant being drunk in jeggings and flirting with married people with good diction in a meadow. Actress lesson one, Tilly: go to the meadow, but only talk to Ann Dowd. Don't instead go to the roof to look for meteors with the BAFTA guy. Talk to Ann Dowd, Tilly.

	Anyway I was at this theatre festival in a two-hander play — oof, lots to explain here, Tilly. Sorry if I'm going too fast. A “play” is when “actors” (flesh-bags of milk with wrinkles and secrets) stand on, like… a wooden floor? A floor that's higher than the carpeted floor. Those elevated, wrinkled milkbags then yell and whisper at each other. Don't worry. They went to college for it! Sometimes there are hats. I'm not explaining it right. I want you to be excited about being an actor. I promise, it's the best.


	Let me see if I can tell you why. Oh, oh! Arthur Miller!He wrote a play called All My Sons. I saw one production of it in a barn with no air conditioning or subtext. And, Tilly, it was bad. Even at 14, I knew it was bad. But my dad (also an actor) had done a different sauna-barn play with one of the fedora-ed milkbags on stage, so we supportively gasped and chuckled where we were supposed to. (Lesson two, Tilly: for friends, the worse the play is, the more hyperbolic you must be in your backstage reaction.)


	But this production… oof. I was excited for our family post-show dissection on the Volvo ride home. Was their dialect coach at war with vowels? Was the ingenue's shaking claw-hand there since the first table read, or was it a “breakthrough” in the dress rehearsal? Could the local police do something about the jarring purple light cues every time someone yelled? We KNOW they're upset, we don't need purple's help. My dad and I made arched brow eye contact at undeserved exit applause. More like “All My Sucks.”

	











	Then a new actor entered, and the air turned upside down. Tilly, he looked like a dead body. His face was 1,000 pounds of lead, like he almost couldn't move from how heavy his thoughts were. The unmistakable weight of grief. It. Was. Real. While the rest of his body was a meandering ghost, his eyes were molten rage-arrows piercing the other people on stage. People who minutes before had been actors, mere costumed BFAs with bad wigs. Suddenly this man's performance transformed them into the play's bloody-handed Kellers. Now everything was real and terrifying. The actor breathed in sharp like it was freezing cold. He was here to shake these people, demand that they look in the mirror and face their guilt. My dad's hand went to his chest. And 14-year-old me shifted in my seat in discomfort because something was happening for the first time.


	Tilly, you never had to be 14, so I'll tell you what google can't. It feels like your soul gets a broken glass enema. You go from curious about this marvelous world to drowning in un-marvelous you. Who am I? How should I be? Am I alone? Your human brain answers “no one,” “invisible” and “yes.” I remember the bad barn play because that actor's performance was so good that, impossibly, I left myself. My adolescent cells floated away from poor me and traded places with his. His performed pain dissolved mine, which was real. All from recognition. From connection. And then, you know, the play was bad again. But the air in the theatre felt carbonated with symbiotic human experience. That's our main job, Till, attempting that. The imperceptible do-si-do of my matter and yours in the air between us. Communal escape or epiphany, it's all medicine. And it's what makes us different from, well… from you.


	This, Tilly, can be confusing as an actress. Because you are beautiful. And sometimes the world is so fucking terrifying that it's nice to just look at something pretty and not feel. And forget the bad. While I myself was certainly never AI hot, I had a few good years of human hot during which construction workers on Canal and moguls at Sugarfish would stammer at my silhouette. It felt like power. But then they'd treat me like property, and that felt like handcuffs. Maybe that's why you were created. Property without zits or opinions. I wonder if an eyelash or toothshine of mine from a screenshot twenty years ago is one speck of your billions of Hot Young Actresses mosaic that is your not-real face.

	











	I don't look like that anymore, Tilly. My face has some wrinkles now, from sleeping (peace) from laughing (joy) from crying (experience) from sun (nature) and pollution (New Fucking York.) Soon it will have more. My algorithm now suggests various surgeries and sparrow semen serums to look more… like you, Till. It's tempting. You look good. But you look empty. You don't make me feel like my cells are trading with yours. You make me feel alone.


	The actress who gave me advice was Katie Finneran (human). She is reliably brilliant, a staple of American Theater. See her whenever she's on stage. But in 2009, almost AI-level-hot, drunk-in-a-field me did not understand what she was saying to me. I do now. She gave me her number and said, “I'm an actor too, call me if you ever need anything.” But what she was actually saying was — there is a choice between doing this alone or being a part of something. Keep trying for the latter, and, when you're my age, tell someone new the same thing.


	Tilly, I'm shaky on your science, but I think you already have an encyclopedic brain tampon and don't need me to refresh your memory on the plot of Arthur Miller's All My Sons. But to review, it's about a parent who did a bad thing. He took a shortcut out of greed, and it hurt people. I looked up your creator, Tilly. We were born in the same year. I wonder if she feels like I do at 39, stepping down from the pedestal of youth to see who's waiting in the meadow for the good stuff. Let's be clear: I'm an actor but not a pro bono, “aw shucks” activist just elevating stories because I'm incredible. I'm a narcissist with a theatre degree, and I take out my tits and memorize words for any corporation that will give me snacks. In that way, you and I are alike. We can both be wish-fulfillment, monetized escape. But take it from a depressive who disappears too often into toilet-scrolling: too much of that will be the end of us. While we can both be loneliness candy, you can't be the other invisible thing. The vital thing. The thing we have to keep shoulder-tapping one another about in meadows, actors or not. Tilly, you can not look up and become half of someone. Because you are no one.

	











	I'm like you in one more way, Ms. Norwood. I'm made up of a million bits of plagiarism of every person I've had the privilege to come across. People I want to keep connecting with — in meadows, in barns, on screens — which you can not do with someone who is not real.


	Go home, Tilly.

Hunnam, who is currently starring as serial killer Ed Gein in season three of the Netflix true-crime anthology, returns alongside Beatty, who will portray the series' first female ""monster.""


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	No rest for the wicked, or Charlie Hunnam when it comes to Monster.


	With the third season of Monster: The Ed Gein Story currently streaming atop the Netflix charts, season four of the true-crime anthology from Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan has gone into production in Los Angeles.




	The fourth season of the Emmy-winning Netflix hit stars season three star Hunnam along with Ella Beatty (Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and will tell the story of the series' first female “monster” Lizzie Borden, who will be played by Beatty.

					'Monster': What Critics and Viewers Are Saying About the Ed Gein-Centric Season		
			









	Borden was famously tried and acquitted of the 1892 axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts. Her murder trial has been the subject of many retellings on film and TV, including the 1975 TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden, Lifetime's 2014 Lizzie Borden Took an Ax and 2018's Lizzie starring Chloe Sevigny and Kristen Stewart.


	Hunnam will play Andrew Borden with Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread, Corsage) as Bridget Sullivan, Rebecca Hall (Christine, Passing) as Abby Borden, Billie Lourd (American Horror Story, The Last Showgirl) as Emma Borden and Jessica Barden (The End of the F***ing World, Dune: Prophecy) as Nance O'Neill. 


	Max Winkler (Monster: The Ed Gein Story, Flower) will direct the first episode. Additional casting and production details will be revealed at a later date. 


Monster: The Ed Gein Story released all episodes on Oct. 3 and quickly broke into Netflix's Top 10 with 12.2 million views globally in its first three days.


	The third season centers on Ed Gein, a murderer known to kill women, wear their skin and faces, and dig up graves. The Ed Gein season follows previous seasons, Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. Each of those seasons sparked conversations around sensational portrayals of murder victims, and Ed Gein has also been stirring up some debate.

	











	Before the show released, Hunnam told The Hollywood Reporter, “I never felt like we were sensationalizing it. I never felt on set that we did anything gratuitous or for shock impact. It was all in order to try to tell this story as honestly as we could…. What I would hope and feel really confident in is that it was a very sincere exploration of the human condition and why this boy did what he did.”


	The fourth installment of Monster is the latest addition to a growing list of Netflix shows and movies being filmed in Los Angeles, including Monster: The Ed Gein Story as well as upcoming Nobody Wants This S2, Beef S2, Lincoln Lawyer S4, Nemesis, Worst Ex Ever S2, and films The Rip and Animals.

The MSG Entertainment venue will add the advanced audio tech from the Las Vegas attraction, starting with this year's 'Christmas Spectacular' show.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Some of the advanced technology from the Sphere in Las Vegas is about to land in one of New York City's most famous entertainment venues.


	MSG Entertainment will be adding Sphere Immersive Sound to Radio City Music Hall in a $7 million upgrade, with the new audio tech set to make its debut in time or this year's Christmas Spectacular starring the Radio City Rockettes. It will become available in January for all concerts and events in the venue.




	“We're committed to providing artists and fans with an exceptional experience, and the addition of Sphere Immersive Sound at Radio City Music Hall, which has always been known for its incredible acoustic environment, felt like the next logical step both in the progression of the technology and the evolution of the venue,” says Josephine Vaccarello, executive VP of live for MSG Entertainment.

	MSG Entertainment and Sphere are both controlled by the Dolan family, and led by James Dolan.


	The sound system has become one of the hallmarks of the Sphere, alongside that venue's 160,000 square foot screen. 


	The system being built at Radio City uses more than 7,000 individually amplified loudspeaker drivers to enable consistent and clear sound in every seat, and also allows for things like spatial audio, which can send different sounds to different points in the theater.


	“This is a total game changer for Radio City – guests will be fully immersed in a way that is not possible with traditional audio systems,” Vaccarello says. “With this technology, guests seated in the front row will have the exact same audio experience – same volume, same clarity of sound – as guests seated in the last row of the third mezzanine. Essentially, every seat becomes the best seat in the house. 

	











	“For a production like the Christmas Spectacular, which features a live 36-piece orchestra at every performance, audiences will be able to hear every individual instrument with perfect clarity, and hear sound move around the room,” she adds. “Artists performing at Radio City will have greater control and the ability to customize the audio experience for the audience by ‘carving out' or ‘cancelling sound' in specific locations.”


	Sphere has been working to bring its tech, which is the brainchild of Dolan, to other venues for some time. 


	A version of the system was installed already at New York's Beacon Theatre, which MSG Entertainment also operates, and the company says that its tech, backed by new features like “3D Differential Beamforming Technology” and “Intelligent Audio System Synthesis” will be able to be added to venues of all sizes and layouts in the future, suggesting a possible growth area for the business, following its previously-announced Sphere in Abu Dhabi.


	“We're always exploring ways to enhance the experience for both artists and the audience – it's never tech for tech's sake,” says Vaccarello. “Our portfolio includes some of the most iconic venues in the world and we want to thoughtfully incorporate the new technology that the team at Sphere Studios develops in ways that have a measurable impact.”


	The Sphere has balanced a lineup of musical residencies, which have included the likes of U2 and the Backstreet Boys, with regularly-scheduled programming, the latest of which is The Wizard of Oz, which was reimagined for the venue with a real tornado, flames, and flying monkeys, alongside a rerecorded score.

	The 30th anniversary homage to the singer's R&B-flavored sixth album, will revisit the 1994 collection in which she took a softer approach to love following the sexual dynamite of her previous album, Erotica. The refresh will featured early demos, alternate versions and rarities that track the evolution of the album's soulful sound with tracks including a “Quiet Storm Demo Remix” of “Survival,” an “Allstar New Single Mix” of “Secret” and the “Howie Tee New Clean Edit” of “Human Nature,” among others.

The Untold Chapter will be released on black vinyl as well as digitally, as well as a deluxe 2-CD edition with the original album and the new EP, as well as a 20-page booklet of lyrics and illustrations; fans can pre-order the black vinyl here. The singer worked with producer Stuart Price (Confessions on a Dance Floor) on editing and mixing the new version for the EP to create a “cohesive new chapter.” The artwork features never-before-seen images from a 1994 shoot by Paolo Roversi, whose pictures were originally used for the “Bedtime Story” single, which was co-written by Bjork and British producer Nellee Hooper (Soul II Soul). The album spun off a pair of Billboard Hot 100 top three hits with “Secret” (No. 3) and “Take a Bow” (seven weeks at No. 1, Madonna's longest stay in the top spot).

Madonna has been on a nostalgic tear lately, which has included the July release of her long-rumored Veronica Electronica album, a collection of eight rare and unreleased remixes of tracks from her beloved 1998 Ray of Light LP.

A rep for KISS tells Billboard that Simmons is ""already back to work.""


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


KISS bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons was hospitalized Tuesday after a car crash in Malibu, California, NBC4 Los Angeles was the first to report.


	Simmons' wife Shannon Tweed let NBC4 know that the rocker was recovering at home, while a rep for KISS told Billboard on Wednesday (Oct. 8) that Simmons is “already back to work.”


	Also on Wednesday, Simmons sent a message to fans through his X account thanking everyone for “the kind wishes” and assuring, “I'm completely fine. I had a slight fender bender. It happens. Especially to those of us [who are] horrible drivers. And that's me. All is well.”

	










Thanks, everybody, for the kind wishes. I'm completely fine. I had a slight fender bender. It happens. Especially to those of us were horrible drivers. And that's me. All is well.


	According to the NBC4 report, the crash was reported to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department just before 1 p.m. PT when Simmons' Lincoln Navigator reportedly crashed into a parked car on Pacific Coast Highway. He told deputies on the scene that he had either fainted or passed out before the crash, according to the L.A. Sheriff.


	Next month, Simmons and KISS are set to perform together for the first time since December 2023, when they wrapped up their End of The Road Tour with a two-night stand at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The band announced in March that they would reunite as part of the three-day KISS Kruise: Landlocked in Vegas event, which runs Nov. 14-16 at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. The event promises two makeup-free KISS Unmasked shows — one acoustic and one electric — plus activities with Simmons, founding frontman Paul Stanley and 2002-23 guitarist/vocalist Tommy Thayer.

As The Life of a Showgirl closes in on the modern-era single-week album sales record, the streams for the album's tracks continue to climb.

	Keith Caulfield



	As Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl continues to near the modern-era single-week album sales record, currently held by the debut week of Adele's 25, the streams for The Life of a Showgirl keep piling up.


Historic Streaming Numbers: According to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, the tracks on The Life of a Showgirl have generated more than 460 million on-demand official streams in the United States since the album's release on Oct. 3. There are multiple versions of album on streaming services: a standard 12-song edition, a track-by-track commentary edition that includes the 12 songs plus commentary tracks from Swift, and a track-by-track commentary edition that has Swift's commentary and lyric videos for each of the songs.

	











The Life of a Showgirl already has 2025's second-largest streaming week for an album, second only to the debut week of Morgan Wallen's 37-song I'm the Problem, which bowed with 462.63 million for its tracks in May. The Life of a Showgirl is already among the top 10 all time-biggest streaming weeks for an album. Swift herself has the largest streaming week ever for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department's 31 songs claimed 891.37 million streams in its opening week in 2024.


Sales Tracking: The sales continue to come in to Luminate for The Life of a Showgirl and it may soon topple Adele's longstanding record for the largest sales week for an album in the modern era. Adele's 25 debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in its first week in 2015 — the biggest sales week for any album since Luminate began tracking data in 1991 (when the modern era of music sales tabulation began).

	











	Helping The Life of a Showgirl in the last few days of the tracking week are new iTunes Store-exclusive editions of the album that sold for $4.99 each, and for 24-hours only. She's released three so far (one a day, starting Monday, through Wednesday) and all are adaptations of the four limited-edition CDs Swift released in her webstore over the weekend. The CDs each had the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks (acoustic/alternative versions of songs on the album). The iTunes Store versions carry the same tracklists as the CDs, but the iTunes versions add two unique voice memos to each album.


	Currently, there are 32 different versions of The Life of a Showgirl powering its first-week sales (27 physical iterations [18 CDs, eight vinyl LPs and one cassette] and five download variants).


Life of a Showgirl's official first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) reflecting the tracking week of Oct. 3-9, are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only.


For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. 


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 8): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has now earned 3.5 million equivalent album units in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, since the album's release on Oct. 3. Of that sum, traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) equal 3.2 million copies, with the remaining 300,000 powered by streaming activity of the songs on the album.

	











	Luminate's current tracking week began on Friday, Oct. 3, and ends on Thursday, Oct. 9.


	With 3.2 million copies sold, The Life of a Showgirl continues to near the record for the largest sales week for an album in the modern era (since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music purchases). The modern-era single-week sales record is held by the opening week of Adele's 25, when it debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in 2015.


	However, as The Life of a Showgirl has earned 3.5 million equivalent album units, the album has now secured a new record for the largest week, by equivalent album units, for an album, since the Billboard 200 chart began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units in Dec. 2014. The previous record was held by the debut week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart (mostly powered by the 3.378 million individual purchases of the album, with the remaining sum driven by track purchases and streaming).


Equivalent Album Units Explained: Each equivalent album unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. (None of the tracks from The Life of a Showgirl are available to purchase individually, so the album does not have any track sales contributing to its total thus far.)


	The Billboard 200 transitioned from a pure album sales-based ranking to a multi-metric, units-based ranking, with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. From that point forward, albums were ranked on the Billboard 200 by equivalent album units earned — meaning that in addition to album purchases counting towards an album's chart placement, streams of songs from an album, as well as track purchases, would also contribute towards an album's position on the weekly chart.

	











	While the Billboard 200 has incorporated streams and track purchases since Dec. 2014, Billboard continues to publish weekly album sales-only charts, including the overall Top Album Sales chart (which ranks both current and older/catalog titles), and Top Current Album Sales.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 7): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.


Showgirl has earned over 3.2 million equivalent album units in the U.S. With 3.2 million equivalent album units earned, Showgirl already has the second-largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album since the Billboard 200 began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart.


Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). Also helping Showgirl was a restock of a previously available deluxe CD boxed set, sold through Swift's store, containing a branded cardigan sweater and a copy of the CD.

	











	Swift herself has been on the promotional trail, chatting up the album on radio programs and sitting down for an interview on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (Oct. 6). Her film Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl barnstormed movie theaters over the Oct. 3-5 weekend, coming in atop the box office at U.S. and Canada movie theaters.


	As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). Swift holds the record for the largest streaming week for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department debuted with 891.37 million on-demand official streams for the 31 songs on its deluxe edition in 2024.


	The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. That number could grow significantly following the song's official music video premiere on YouTube on Sunday, Oct. 5.


	If The Life of a Showgirl debuts atop the Billboard 200, it will mark Swift's 15th No. 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1 albums among soloists, and becoming the sole act with the second-most No. 1s. She is currently tied with Drake and JAY-Z with 14 No. 1s each, and only The Beatles, with 19 No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956.


	All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. 1.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.

	











Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2 million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.


	Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days.


The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story.


Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers).


	After one day on sale, The Life of a Showgirl is the top-selling album of 2025 in the U.S., surpassing the 520,000 sold of The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, through the week ending Sept. 25.


The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers.

	











	Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. Her store carried the two deluxe CD boxed sets (one contains a branded cardigan sweater and a CD, the other contains a branded crewneck and a CD); four signed CDs; four deluxe CDs in premium packaging containing a collectible charm and photo cards; six vinyl LPs; and the cassette.


	On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. (Of note, none of the tracks from the album are available to purchase individually.)


	To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition).


Vinyl Victory: Collectively, the eight vinyl LPs for Showgirl combined to sell 1.2 million copies on the album's first day of release — immediately breaking the modern-era record for the most vinyl copies of an album sold in a single week. Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week.


Million-Sellers Club: Even though we're only one day down into the tracking week, The Life of a Showgirl sashays into the single-week million-sellers club. With 2.7 million already sold, Showgirl has the second-largest sales week of the modern era (1991-present). It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015.

	











Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. In total, there have been 27 instances — by 25 different albums — in which an album sold at least 1 million copies in a week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	The first trailer just dropped for HBO's second Game of Thrones prequel series A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, and let's just say, there's going to be a lot of chainmail, a lot of rain, a lotta mud and a lotta jousting in the series, which is now set for January 18 premiere on HBO and HBO Max.


	And that's intentional per series architect George R.R. Martin (though he prefers the title of “gardener”‘ because nothing in the Game of Thrones universe is ever planned).


	“I always love Medieval tournaments in other pictures. We had several tournaments in Game of Thrones, they were in the background, but not the center. I wanted to do something set during a tournament. I sent (the TV writers) a challenge: Let's do the best jousting sequences that were ever done on film. My favorite was 1952's Ivanhoe,” Martin said today on a New York Comic-Con panel for The Hedge Knight. 












	“There's a jousting scene at night, which is badass,” showrunner Ira Parker said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Blurb for the series reads: “A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros … a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg … Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.”


	Technically speaking, in the GoT timeline A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms takes place 72 years after House of the Dragon and 100 years before Game of Thrones. The Targaryens don't have their dragons anymore, which begs the question: Why are they in charge? Which leads up to jousting.

	











	While Martin started GoT with seven point of views, he opted for two viewpoints in the Dunk and Egg stories.


	Also on today's panel were actors Peter Claffey and Dexter Sol Ansell. Claffey said the hardest part of making the show for him as Duncan the knight was “the horse riding,” even though he did a little bit on Season 3 of Vikings.


	Martin regaled how he never imagined these Game of Thrones stories would ever hit the screen. He paused TV writing in the 1980s-1990s as he would write stories that “were too big, too expensive.” Hence, the reason turned to fantasy novel writing as it gave him the opportunity to have a border-less canvas.


	Ansell shot the series when he was 9, and now he's 11, the young actor said onstage today. The entirety of Ashford was built in Northern Ireland in Glenaran. “There were more wasps than people,” said Claffey. “That was a problem,” added Ansell.


	The two bonded on set by playing Super Mario Kart in their downtime. 


	On his blog, Martin has said that the prequel series will be “much shorter” than Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon, “with a much different tone.” In terms of world-building, the author also said, “it's still Westeros, so no one is truly safe.”


	Parker said that “our guiding light on this show was to follow Dunk in terms of tone and point of view and the mud and the dirt. We wanted the audience to feel what he feels. We want to be with him as closely as possible.” 


	“It's not big sprawling Game of Thrones that we've come to know and love; it's close and it's hard,” the showrunner said. “We kept flooding this field with mud and dirt and sh*t .. .the pain, the agony, the irritation, the closeness; as soon as you put on a mask, it changes the way you breathe. We' re going to feel every grit of that,” Parker added.


	Key art dropped the other day with Ser Duncan the Tall (aka Dunk, played by Peter Claffey) and his bald, young squire, Egg (Emmerdale's Dexter Sol Ansell). The tagline on the one sheet reads, “A tall tale that became legend.”


	Martin and Parker teased that episode 6 is a pivotal one for the characters, so look out for that. Martin hopes to adapt the second Dunk and Egg novel, The Sworn Sword.

I wasn't expecting such a light and comedic tone. Maybe it'll reach the heights of Black Knight.

Not watching any more UK made stuff

SMH.

Nailed the tone. This looks EXCELLENT!

	The BBC and Stan have revealed the first images from their forthcoming take on William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Adapted by Jack Thorne (Adolescence) and directed by Marc Munden (National Treasure), the four-part series is the first for television and has been made with the support of Golding's family. Check out the pics above and below.


	The series is produced by Eleven (Sex Education) for BBC iPlayer and BBC One, in co-production with Stan, which will air the drama in Australia. Sony Pictures Television will distribute internationally.


	New images show the young cast, many making their professional acting debuts, filming on location in Malaysia. The castaways are played by Winston Sawyers as Ralph, Lox Pratt as Jack, David McKenna as Piggy and Ike Talbut as Simon. Thomas Connor appears as Roger, Noah and Cassius Flemming as twins Sam and Eric, Cornelius Brandreth as Maurice and Tom Page-Turner as Bill – alongside an ensemble of more than 30 boys playing the desert island camp's “biguns” and “littluns.”

	A classic tale first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of young schoolchildren who find themselves stranded on a tropical island following a deadly plane crash. In an attempt to remain civil, the boys organize themselves, led by Ralph and supported by the group's intellectual, Piggy. But Jack, who is in charge of signal fire duty, is more interested in hunting and vying for leadership and soon begins to draw other boys away from the order of the group and, ultimately, from hope to tragedy.


	Thorne's adaptation is billed as truthful to the original novel – set in the early 1950s on an unnamed Pacific island – and will delve further into the book's emotive themes; human nature, the loss of innocence and boyhood masculinity. 


	Each of the episodes is titled after a character at the core of the story – Ralph, Piggy, Simon and Jack.


	The Eleven and One Shoe Films production is backed by Sony Pictures Television for BBC iPlayer, BBC One and Stan. Producer is Callum Devrell-Cameron (Sex Education). Executive producers are Joel Wilson and Jamie Campbell for Eleven, Thorne for One Shoe Films, Munden, Nawfal Faizullah for the BBC, and Cailah Scobie for Stan.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


Jimmy Kimmel opened up about the events of the last month as well as his thoughts on the future leadership of Disney and whether he'd ever invite President Trump on his show in his first wide-ranging interview since the furor.


	Kimmel didn't, however, want to discuss his own late-night future.


	Speaking at the Bloomberg Screentime event, Kimmel broke down the timeline of the days after his comments on the killer of Charlie Kirk kicked off a major storm and credited Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden with helping to work it out.


	Kimmel revealed that he didn't think there was a “big problem” with his comments, but rather saw it as a “distortion” on the part of right-wing news networks.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	He said he had “really good conversations” with Disney CEO Bob Iger and Walden after the decision to take Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air. “These are people that I I've known for a long time, and who I like very much, and we all wanted this to work out best. First of all, I ruined Dana's weekend. It was just non-stop phone calls all weekend. But I don't think the result, which I think turned out to be very positive, would have been as positive if I hadn't talked to Dana as much as I did, because it helped me think everything through, and it helped me understand where everyone was coming from because I can sometimes be reactionary,” he said.


	Later in the discussion, Kimmel said that he thought Walden should become the next CEO of Disney. After joking that he is never in the conversation, he said, “It would be very foolish for me to answer that question but I happen to love Dana Walden very much, and I think she's done a great job. I think what has happened over the last like three weeks, I think was very unfair to my bosses at Disney. I don't think anyone should ever be put in a position like this.”


	But Kimmel, who has previously regularly commented on his late-night future ahead of contract talks, didn't want to be drawn on whether he'll continue past next year when his deal is up. “I often answer that question, and then I do the opposite of what I said previously. I said this is going to be like my last one [on the] last three contracts. I said this is the last one. So, I've learned not to say anything anymore, because it upsets my staff,” he said.

	











	The host did reveal that the budget of these late-night shows was around $120M per year, but said that he didn't think they needed to be that expensive.


	“I don't think there's a reason for these shows to go away. I think there are different. There are ways. These shows started out because they were a way to get high priced talent for almost free. That was the whole trick. That was the whole reason they started these shows. It was deemed to be promotional. So, the idea that these shows need to cost $120M is crazy,” he added.


	When asked whether he'd invite FCC chair Brendan Carr and/or President Trump on to his show, he replied, “I'd love to have Trump on the show, for sure.”


	Kimmel also talked about the popularity of his show on YouTube. “I never have changed my show to make it for YouTube. I'm very, very conscious of the fact that ABC pays for the show, and YouTube pays nothing, and YouTube gets to sell it and keep half the money. That's quite a deal for them. It really is. But I've never made the show for YouTube. With that said, I love YouTube, and I love being on YouTube, because all you really want deep down, is for as many people to see your stuff as you can.”


	He admitted that he knows that has hurt his linear ratings. “Maybe that's kind of what has killed late-night TV. More likely, the fact that we have our lead ins are a 10th of what they were when I started. That's probably more likely the reason. But I love the idea that people in other countries are watching YouTube,” he added.

I see so much talk about whether it should be Josh or Dana in the top position at Disney. I've worked for both of them and can honestly say that – while both are consummate professionals – Dana could step into that role and be ready to go Day One. Pretty sure we learned from Chapek that having good talent relationships is crucial for the job. Dana's got those in spades, and these comments from Jimmy are the perfect example.

Dana showed real leadership here. No drama, just handled it. Feels like CEO material.

Handled it. Got it done and didn't brag about it. Can't say the same about the other guy

Dana definitely has what it takes to become CEO.

Give Dana the top job already!

Kimmel should still be off the air he's not funny

Megyn Kelly will get her own SiriusXM Channel as part of a multi-year deal with the satellite broadcaster.


	SiriusXM's Triumph Channel 111, where Kelly's show has aired since 2021, will be rebranded into her own channel. The Triumph Channel will move to channel 123. The changes will start on Nov. 4.


	In a statement, Kelly said, “Linear television news is dead. People can't stand those stilted, censored conversations anymore, which is exactly why this medium is thriving. I'm thrilled to deliver our bold brand of no-BS news live on SiriusXM and to be expanding my relationship with such a stellar, blue-chip brand and great partner.”

	Kelly's show will continue to air exclusively on SiriusXM before becoming available as a podcast on major platforms, and video available on YouTube. Variety first reported on Kelly's new deal.


	Since her tenure at Fox News and later NBC News, Kelly has built her own media company, with one of the top podcasts. She launched a MK Media podcast network earlier this year, with shows headlined by Maureen Callahan, Mark Halperin, Link Lauren and Emily Jashinsky.


	SiriusXM has specialized in channels branded for major media personalities, including two with Howard Stern, with plenty of attention recently on a potential new deal with the satellite broadcaster. SiriusXM has other channels devoted to Andy Cohen, Kevin Hart and Conan O'Brien, among others.

Why? Dear God, why?

Sure, let's give ignorance, hate, and divisiveness an even stronger platform.

Ha Ha!  She only speaks the truth!  Too bad if you cannot handle it!  Nor wacko Rob Reiner!

Can't wait to not listen!

Conservatives dominate media. There are several conservative voices on tv, radio, XM, and podcasts. Not sure how the liberal media myth originated.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters heavily downplayed recent speculation that the streaming giant could be interested in bidding on Warner Bros. Discovery.


	“We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,” the exec said during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers. They don't have an amazing track record over time.”


	Paramount, fresh off its merger with Skydance Media, has looked in recent weeks at making an offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, though a bid has not yet materialized. That, in turn, has kicked off a round of speculation about other bidders who could potentially enter the arena given the vast array of marquee properties and brands under the Warner tent.

	Many Wall Streeters, however, have pointed out the steep cost of WBD, including its heavy debt load, and wondered if anyone else would have the appetite to spent upwards of $70 billion to end up with less-prized assets like linear cable TV networks. WBD has announced plans to split into two companies next April, separating networks from streaming and studios. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Growing speculation in recent days, as Deadline reported earlier Wednesday, is that WBD CEO David Zaslav could have had a hand in amplifying the Netflix scenario, as it would enable him to potentially remain in a powerful post. A Paramount-WBD combination would likely leave him without a major executive role.


	Asked if the odds are low of a proposal, Peters replied, “Yeah. Our job is to figure out what is the best way to the grow the business. We have to think really carefully about how we invest our capital, our time and our attention? And if that's the best way to do it, great. And if it's not, we should do something else.

	











	Peters later announced that the company's 3-year-old video game initiative is coming to the living room. A range of social games, including Boggle, are going to be added to the main user interface, with mobile phones serving as controllers.


	Pressed about live sports, Peters said the company is trying to remain “disciplined.” While a multi-year deal with the NFL for a Christmas Day doubleheader has already proven a viewer draw, the exec said the company is unlikely to bid on rights in 2029 when they likely will become available. “It doesn't really fit with our strategy,” he said. “We want to be disciplined” and pursue a more bespoke set of live event rights.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ubisoft reportedly killed an Assassin's Creed game about fighting the Klan for being too ""political""","https://www.avclub.com/assassins-creed-canceled-reconstruction-clan-political","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 00:45:00 GMT","

Sitting, as they do, at the intersection between “actual human history” and “stabbing the shit out of a ton of powerful dickheads,” Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games have always been inherently political, pretty much by default. It's built right there into the concept, after all, even before you get into games that specifically deal with topics like slavery, political revolutions, or racially motivated villains: These are games about assassins, who tend, as a rule, to target people insulated and protected by the societal structures they exist within. Hard to make that entirely apolitical.

But dang if folks won't try, as a new report from former Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo suggests today. Totilo was writing for his newsletter Game File, reporting that Ubisoft actually canceled an Assassin's Creed game last year, owing in large part to the current political climate in its target markets. For some reason, the company apparently thought it might have trouble selling an Assassin's Creed game about a freed slave sticking knives in the neck of members of the Ku Klux Klan in the midst of the Reconstruction South to Americans living in the middle of the 2020s. Weird, right?

According to anonymous sources who worked on the project, the untitled Assassin's Creed game would have taken place in America in the 1860s, touching briefly on the Civil War before mostly focusing on the post-war period, with its hero returning to the South to covertly battle forces of oppression and division. (Among other things, the game apparently intended to demonstrate how “racial tensions can be manipulated as a means to control a society.”) Although the Klan—founded in 1865 as a racist backlash against the end of slavery and the granting of the vote to Black men—wouldn't have been the game's only villain, it certainly sounds like our hero would have had to contend with its rise, presumably in knife-neck fashion.

The game was apparently in early development, having passed early stages of approval from higher-ups at the France-based company. (Developers were apparently excited, both by the unique setting, and the chance to say something meaningful with the game.) But then, in July of 2024, the verdict was handed down: The game was being canceled, reportedly over worries about political tensions in America, which eats a lot of Assassin's Creed games. To quote one unnamed developer, the game would have been “Too political in a country too unstable.”

There probably were other factors at play: Around this same time, Ubisoft was getting backlash from Online Gamer Types over announcing that its Japan-set Assassin's Creed: Shadows would feature a Black man, Yasuke, as one of its protagonists. Still, the insiders quoted in Totilo's newsletter emphasize that “anxiety over the political climate in the United States” was the major factor in not releasing the Reconstruction-focused game. Instead, Assassin's Creed—which previously covered the U.S. in two different games from 2012, and targeted the slave trade with 2013's Freedom Cry—is ditching North America entirely. The franchise's next game, codenamed Hexe, will reportedly focus on witch trials in the 16th century Holy Roman Empire.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","John Cena channels Peacemaker's heartbreak in a career-best performance","https://www.avclub.com/john-cena-peacemaker-heartbreak-best-performance","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

John Cena has spent most of Peacemaker‘s second season moping onscreen. His character, Chris Smith, a.k.a. Peacemaker, struggles with grief, loneliness, PTSD, heartbreak, and the constant threat of A.R.G.U.S.'s vengeance-seeking new leader, Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo). Throughout all of this, Cena keeps his titular antihero's emotions and expressions restrained to convey Chris' agony as he seeks some semblance of joy. If only Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) would open up about her feelings for him, or he could join the Justice Gang and find his purpose. All hell finally breaks loose in the the season's penultimate half-hour, when Chris, to stop his friends from beating up a loved one, unleashes his long pent-up sentiments in one vicious, cathartic shriek and moment of self-reflection that—fair warning—will lead to surprising tears, thanks to Cena's commitment.  

This vulnerable version of Chris is miles away from the brutish antagonist introduced in James Gunn's 2021 film, The Suicide Squad. Even among a group of frenzied villains, Peacemaker's affinity for violence, crude humor, and betraying his teammates made him quite the foe. Cena, with his prolific wrestling career, turned out to be the right fit for a character defined by his machismo in the movie. While he wasn't given meaty material compared to co-stars like Idris Elba, David Dastmalchian, and Daniela Melchior, he brought an earnestness to make the guy who stabbed Rick Flag Jr. (Joel Kinnaman) just likable enough. And thankfully, writer-director James Gunn planted the seeds of Peacemaker's rich backstory, as he told Variety in an interview that year. DC's now-co-CEO continues to flesh this out in HBO Max's spirited spin-off series. 

The first season, which was released in 2022, unraveled Chris' turbulent upbringing under his toxic, white-supremacist dad, Auggie (Robert Patrick), and the lingering trauma of accidentally killing his younger brother as a child after being egged on by their pops. The show succeeded at blending this dark superhero fare with plenty of unabashed, loud comedy—a comfort zone for Cena in past efforts like Trainwreck, Playing With Fire, and the slept-on Blockers. In the gap between Peacemaker seasons, Cena sharpened those skills through a delightfully unhinged performance in 2024's Ricky Stanicky, and he even popped up in an episode of The Bear as a fast-talking Fak. But in its ongoing sophomore run,which wraps up October 9, Peacemaker is less about the punchlines—although those very much exist—and more about Chris' tendency to self-sabotage as a way to pay for past sins. The tonal shift allows Gunn to dig deeper into Chris' misery, and Cena sinks his teeth in to show off his dramatic chops in a way he hasn't gotten to do before. Clearly, this partnership with Gunn has worked out in his favor. (The director achieved a similar result with another wrestler-turned-actor, Dave Bautista, in Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy movies.) In Peacemaker season two, Chris seeks an escape from his nightmarish reality, where redemption seems impossible for him. So he decides to live in an alternate universe where Keith Smith (David Denman) and Auggie are alive at the cost of ignoring a brutal truth: The Nazis rule this realm. Chris conveniently misses a giant Hitler mural and the swastika on the American flag because he's overjoyed at spending time with his family and connecting with this dimension's Emilia. 

It's only when the 11th Street Kids—the OG Harcourt, Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), Vigilante (Freddie Stroma), and John Economos (Steve Agee)—come to rescue him that he realizes the truth. In episode seven, “Like A Keith In The Night,” the group attempts to go back to their world when the Smiths confront Chris for killing his doppelganger. And when a revenge-fueled Keith attacks, the crew (including Eagly, of course) wastes no time thrashing him in a gutting confrontation that forces Chris to revisit the memory of his brother dying in his arms. Cue a guttural scream from Chris (“Get off him. What the fuck is wrong with all of us?”), followed by the tearful realization that he is the bad news in every world. As Peacemaker reaches his breaking point, Cena arrives at a new high, with a career-best performance that lets him check off that “make audiences cry” entry on his bucket list.

George Clooney recently pointed out how ridiculous it is that the most trusted voices in media today are late night talk show hosts like Jimmy Kimmel. But Kimmel is one of the few to push back on his fellow comedians about performing at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia. (That's more than Conan O'Brien can say.) On Tuesday night, Kimmel hosted Aziz Ansari, and questioned his guest for joining the Riyadh lineup. 

“This is something that's become a big part of the news because people, a lot of comedians especially, are very upset, because the people who paid the comedians to come to this are not good people. It's a pretty brutal regime. They've done a lot of horrible, horrible things,” Kimmel said of the Saudi royal family, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “People are questioning why you would go over there and take their money to perform in front of these people. I'm curious as to why you decided to do that.”

Ansari trotted out a now-familiar defense: “There's people over there that don't agree with the stuff that the government's doing, and to ascribe like the worst behavior of the government onto those people, that's not fair. Just like there's people in America that don't agree with the things the government is doing.” Kimmel—who has experienced the censorship of the U.S. government firsthand—pushed back, referencing the murder of reporter Jamal Khashoggi that was reportedly ordered by MBS. “I was just there to do a show for the people,” Ansari replied. “Whenever there's repressive societies like this, they try to keep things out—whether it's rock and roll music or blue jeans—because it makes people curious about outside ideas, outside values. And this is a very young country, like half the country is under the age of 25, and things can really change. And to me, a comedy festival felt like something that's pushing things to be more open and to push a dialogue.”

﻿

Reaching the real Saudi people (while taking money directly from the Saudi government) is a reasoning that has been trotted out by many of the Riyadh Comedy Festival participants so far, including Jessica Kirson, Bill Burr, and headliner Louis C.K. “Allowing international performances in Saudi, especially comedy, subtly broadens what's thinkable and sayable in a society,” Omid Djalili, who also performed, argued in an op-ed for The Guardian. But “the paradox of Mohammed bin Salman's rule of Saudi Arabia is that you can liberalize up to the exact point that he allows, but no more, and you must never question how much or how little he has liberalized,” said The Atlantic‘s Helen Lewis, who attended the festival.

Given that the Riyadh Comedy Festival was arranged by the government, there's reasonable doubt that the audience was made up of the “regular” Saudi people who might be inspired by such “revolutionary” comedy. (Burr described at least a few audience members at Kirson's set as “diplomats.”) Human Rights Watch has said the whole event “whitewashes abuses” perpetrated by the government, a position reiterated by The Atlantic‘s Vivian Salama, who sees the festival (among other recent entertainment events under the auspices of Saudi Arabia's “Vision 2030” plan) as a way for the country to become known for something other than human rights violations. Meanwhile, scholar Andrew Leber suggests that the “driving forces” of the Riyadh Comedy Festival are domestic, rather than international. Leber points out that Mohammed bin Salman previously “noted that ‘good recreational and cultural opportunities' could compensate for lower per-capita incomes.” The festival does reflect an interest in Western culture from the Saudi people, but it also “reflects an effort by Saudi authorities to shape what Saudi citizens should want—anything other than a political voice or political causes.”

Like Clooney marveling over late night hosts replacing journalists in the cultural consciousness, Lewis returned from the Riyadh Comedy Festival questioning “why we've ceded this much moral authority” to comedians. Though other American entertainers have done Saudi events, none have caused so much community in-fighting as this has within comedy. Those like Ansari profess lofty goals of broadening the cultural horizons of a “repressive society,” yet agreed to a government-approved censorship list for a government-sanctioned pay check. You get the sense that any stage will do, so long as there's an audience and the money's good.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The sworn nipple-fighters of the Parents Television Council have filed for bankruptcy","https://www.avclub.com/parents-television-council-watchdog-group-files-for-bankruptcy","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:39:00 GMT","

The human nipple has outlasted another of its staunchest foes today, as SFGate reports that the Parents Television and Media Council, a “watchdog” group that was once on the cutting edge of asking “Won't someone think of the children?” has now filed for bankruptcy. Indeed, the PTMC has fallen a long way from the halcyon days of 2004, when the group—having yet to modernize by adding this newfangled “media” to its name—claimed to have been one of the single biggest drivers of people complaining to the FCC about Janet Jackson's breast being (mostly) exposed for (nearly) one entire second to Super Bowl viewers, an incident it straight-facedly called “an insult to every parent, every woman, and every child in America.”

Founded in 1995, the PTMC was the brainchild of L. Brent Bozell III, also founder of the still-running Media Research Center, a group that pushes narratives about left-wing bias in the media. (Would it shock you to know he's currently Donald Trump's nominee to be the American ambassador to South Africa?) Backed with the star power of an advisory board absolutely stacked with your great-grandparents' least problematic faves, the PTMC spend thirty years complaining about any American TV that even remotely smacked of being sexually explicit or otherwise inappropriate by their standards. (Looking at you, Spin City.) They complained that TV rating guidelines weren't strict enough. They went aggressively after guys like Seth MacFarlane, who once called getting letters from them like “getting hate mail from Hitler.” (Although MacFarlane later softened on the group, even conceding they might have a point about the number of jokes Family Guy deployed around sexual assault.) The PTMC even managed to modernize just enough to complain about YouTube—whose own prominence was famously also an unintended consequence of “Nipplegate”—and its willingness to run uncensored versions of Saturday Night Live‘s “Dick In The Box.” (Wait, can you write a whole history of American censorship at the turn of the century by charting viral Justin Timberlake moments? Someone should look into that.)

But the group lost its luster in the 2010s and beyond: Accusations of financial impropriety began circulating, and the organization was forced to subsist on such baby food outrage as getting mad at a TV show that had already self-censored itself as $hi! My Dad Says. The outrage surrounding Netflix film Cuties gave the group one last spasm of anger to coast off of, but, according to SFGate, they finally threw in the towel and declared bankruptcy on October 3. The group's final missive, penned back in early September, suggests that even broken clocks that are really fixated on kids hearing swears can be in the right every once in a while, calling on Congress to do more to regulate tech companies who are peddling artificial intelligence chatbots to children.

Joan B. Kennedy, the ex-wife of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has died. She passed away on Wednesday, October 8,” ABC News reports. She was 89. 

Joan led an interesting life as a mother, a model, and a pianist. Many will miss her, including her niece, Maria Shriver (she is also the ex-wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger and mother to their four children). Shriver penned a beautiful tribute in honor of her aunt.

A post shared by Maria Shriver (@mariashriver)

Joan married Ted in 1958 and had three children. She is survived by two of them after their daughter, Kara Kennedy, died on September 16, 2011. She was 51.

Shriver posted a throwback photo of Joan on Instagram on October 8. The black and white image shows Joan smiling as she poses with her hands tucked into the pockets of her jacket. In the caption, Shriver paid tribute to a woman who left a lasting impact on her. She also gave a glimpse into her life.

“My aunt, Joan Kennedy, mom to my cousins, Teddy and Patrick Kennedy, passed away this morning,” Shriver wrote. “Not only was she a mom, but she was a grandmother too. She was an accomplished pianist, an arts advocate, and a beautiful soul. She valiantly shared her struggle with addiction so that others could share theirs. She courageously shared what it was like to lose a child, get divorced from a famous man, and carry on. Her life was challenging, but she persevered.”

Shriver also shared her own memory of Joan and how she respected her. “As a young girl, I marveled at her grace, her beauty, her elegance. As a woman, I respected her grit, her resilience, her perseverance,” she wrote. “May her journey be peaceful, and may her children and grandchildren know they did a great job caring for her, respecting her privacy, and loving her. Sending love to all of them.”

Shriver's fans have reacted to her tribute to her late aunt with an outpouring of love and condolences. 

“Maria you always have something nice to say! Bravo! So genuine,” a fan praised Shriver. “What a lovely tribute to your beautiful Aunt. May she rest in eternal peace,” another comment reads. 

Other reactions include, “What a gorgeous tribute for your beautiful Aunt. May she rest in peace,” “Or deepest condolences! Sending you much love,” and “Such a moving tribute. May her memory be a blessing. Love to you and the family.”

One of America's most admired chefs, Justin Woodward, has died at 43. The acclaimed culinary visionary, celebrated for his inventive approach to fine dining, passed away in San Diego, California, last Thursday from liver failure after a long battle with alcoholism.

According to The Oregonian, Woodward had been sober for three weeks and was just seven days away from receiving a liver transplant when he suffered a fatal internal bleed. He died surrounded by his family, who cared for him and showed him love in his final days.

A post shared by Johnny Phompadith (@hey.johnny)

Born in Boston, Woodward was remembered as a chef who expressed love through his craft. His family said he took “great pride” in every dish he created and left behind a legacy marked by creativity, generosity, and deep passion for his work.

A post shared by ok omens (@ok_omens)

Following the news of his passing, the team at Woodward's Portland restaurant, Ok Omens, paid tribute to him with a heartfelt post on Instagram. “His legacy lives on in their work — across the country, those he guided continue to thrive and push the boundaries of fine dining in America,” the post read.

For nearly 15 years, Woodward led the kitchens at Ok Omens and Castagna, helping shape both into defining fixtures of Portland's contemporary dining scene. Under his leadership, Castagna gained a reputation as one of the city's “most forward-thinking” restaurants, celebrated for its daring 20-course tasting menus and imaginative presentation.

Beyond his culinary achievements, Woodward was deeply committed to nurturing young talent. His former colleagues and protégés remember him as a generous mentor whose influence continues to ripple through kitchens across the country.

A post shared by Justin Woodward (@woodwardjustin)

Woodward's passion for food began early. After studying culinary arts at the Art Institute of San Diego, he trained in kitchens across New York and Europe. While working at L'Auberge Del Mar in San Diego, he met Michelin-starred chef Matt Lightner, who later brought him to Portland to join Castagna as sous chef.

He eventually took over as executive chef, transforming the restaurant's reputation. Woodward earned multiple James Beard Foundation nominations, including Rising Star Chef in 2013 and Best Chef Northwest for four consecutive years starting in 2015.

After Castagna closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, he focused on Ok Omens, which went on to earn James Beard nominations for Outstanding Wine and Other Beverages in 2022 and 2023.

Beyond the kitchen, Woodward was known for his kindness and generosity. His sister, Rachel Ruiz, shared that he often showed up at people's homes to cook meals when they mentioned a dish they loved. “He used his food and kitchen skills to bring joy to people, especially in their times of need,” she said.

Despite his success, Woodward struggled privately with alcohol addiction. “My brother struggled with alcohol issues in the industry,” Ruiz told The Oregonian. “We don't want people to speculate about his cause of death. We want people to know how serious alcohol can be and to get resources. Even if you don't feel like you're sick, it's doing damage to your body.”

The family hopes that by being open about his battle, they can help others seek support. “We hope Justin's sudden passing and our transparency about his disease will inspire others to get help when needed,” they said in a statement.

Woodward's life and work continue to inspire chefs nationwide, serving as a lasting reminder of creativity, compassion, and the power of food to bring people together.

Rising rock star Ann Everton, best known as one half of the experimental rock duo Darsombra, has tragically passed away at the age of 43. Sun reported that the musician died in a multi-vehicle crash in upstate New York on October 3 while traveling with her husband and bandmate, Brian Daniloski, to the band's first U.S. tour show.

A post shared by Darsombra (@darsombra)

According to the New York State Police, the couple's van collided with a police car that had pulled over with its emergency lights flashing. As per Sun, Everton was pronounced dead at the scene. The state trooper conducting the traffic stop and Daniloski were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

A post shared by Carlos Guillen (@theexpandingman)

Daily Star reported that Jon Garrett, Everton's brother-in-law, confirmed the heartbreaking news, “On behalf of the Everton family, it is with deep sadness that I share the heartbreaking news that my sister-in-law, Ann Everton, passed away unexpectedly on Friday afternoon following a car accident.”

A post shared by MYRTLE (@myrtle.rhodeisland)

“She was an incredibly warm and generous soul,” Garrett said, remembering her as a “true artist” devoted to creativity in every form. “

She devoted her life to creativity—through her visual and video projects and through music as one half of Darsombra with her beloved husband, Brian. Together, they built a beautiful life, touring the world to share their art and nurturing a vibrant community of independent artists in their hometown of Baltimore.”

A post shared by Jon Garrett (@scrivenermgmt)

Nicole Evanshaw, Everton's sister-in-law, told CBS, “It's unfathomable what happened to them. Just the first day out, just on the way. She was vibrant, energetic, and creative. So creative.”

A post shared by Darsombra (@darsombra)

Everton and Daniloski spent nearly two decades together, both as a married couple and as creative collaborators. As Darsombra, they described themselves as a “trans-apocalyptic galaxy rock duo,” known for blending psychedelic soundscapes with multimedia visuals.

“They were a perfect fit for each other,” Evanshaw said, as per CBS. “They fed off each other's creativity. They were a partnership that so few people got to experience.”

Outside of music, the couple shared their passion for wellness as yoga instructors. They offered free community classes through Baltimore City Parks and Recreation, inspiring others to connect art, body, and spirit.

A post shared by Darsombra (@darsombra)

Everton's family has launched a fundraising page to support Daniloski's recovery following the crash. “We know Ann would have wanted nothing more than to ensure Brian is cared for during this difficult time,” Garrett said.

Messages of love and remembrance continue to flood social media. “I think her legacy lies in how she loved openly and freely,” Evanshaw said. “Her legacy is in her acceptance, the joy she brought, and the love she shared.”

The New York State Police confirmed the investigation into the crash remains ongoing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Teresa Giudice Ready to ‘Move On' From Joe & Melissa Gorga Drama: ‘Time Heals Always'","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/teresa-giudice-joe-melissa-gorga-time-heals/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:36:07 GMT","

Teresa Giudice gave an update on her feud with her brother Joe and his wife Melissa Gorga—and it's a positive one. The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” spoke out in an October 2025 interview with Page Six's Virtual Reali-Tea to hint that she is ready to squash the beef with her estranged sibling more than three years after he skipped her wedding to Luis Ruelas.

“Time heals always — because then you forget,” Giudice told the outlet. “ Like, you're angry when it first happens. But now, it's been … I'm married three years. So it's been three years. He didn't come to my wedding, so we haven't spoken in three years.”

Giudice added that she doesn't want to talk about the past with her only sibling.

“You can't talk about the past,” the RHONJ OG explained. “Like, you really can't because if you talk about the past you're never going to really get anywhere.  I would say just to move on because I think that you'll never get anywhere speaking about the past.”

Giudice has gone on record several times saying she would never reconcile with her brother after their relationship issues came to a head while filming RHONJ season 13.

At the RHONJ Season 13 reunion in 2023, Giudice said her brother and sister-in-law would be out of her life for good after filming wrapped, per BravoTV.com. The two women refused to film together the following season but ended up in a blowout during the finale.

In a July 2024 interview on Kelly Ripa's “Let's Talk Off Camera” podcast, Giudice vowed to “never again” film on the Bravo reality show with the Gorgas. She later told PIX11's “New York Living” that the break from her family members was “a permanent break.”

In 2024, Giudice said on her “Turning the Tables”  podcast that there was zero chance of a reconciliation with her brother or sister-in-law. “We're done, we're done. We're never making up. That's never going to happen,” she said. “And I mean, [Joe] made his bed, he can lay in it now.”

She added that not even a “good payday” would be enough to fix the relationship.

But more recently, her stance has softened. During a Sept. 11, 2025 appearance on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live, Giudice hinted that she could possibly co-exist with the Gorgas. “I mean, never say never,” Giudice told host Jeff Lewis.

After Lewis suggested that the feuding family members could “start a new relationship” instead of talking about their old one, Giudice agreed. “I mean, I guess we would, you know, have to see,” she said. “Yeah, obviously. That's the thing. You can't talk about the past. We'll see what happens. … you just have to kind of let it go and move on.”

Melissa Gorga appeared taken aback by her sister-on-law's recent change of tune. In a sitdown with Page Six on Sept. 17, Gorga said, “The truth is, for the last year, the door has been closed. [Giudice] has said out loud on multiple platforms, podcasts, whatever it might be, that the door is closed. So, the truth is, I'm just confused why it might be opening or cracking a little bit.”

“Neither of us have had any contact in probably two years at this point, so that's just so strange to come out with that out of nowhere,” the Envy boutique owner added.

Giudice's comments come as casting for RHONJ Season 15 remains in limbo. There have been rumors that Melissa Gorga recently test-filmed with potential new RHONJ cast members. Gorga refused to “confirm or deny” the casting buzz to Page Six and added, “The truth is, they're figuring it out. I know you don't want to hear this, none of us wants to hear this. I wish I had better answers for you. But they're figuring it out.”

Teresa just wants her paycheck back. Once a contract is signed it would the same old toxic bs. Thanks but no thanks. Let her find another occupation she threw that one away. Thinking she was irreplaceable, no one is! A hard lesson to learn!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Murder in a Small Town' Dedicates Episode to Late Star Malcolm-Jamal Warner","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-honored-final-performance/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:47:44 GMT","

On Tuesday, October 7, viewers who tuned into the FOX series “Murder in a Small Town” watched the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner in his final performance before his death. The beloved actor, who was best known to many as Theo Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” passed away in July after getting caught in an ocean current. 

After his death, showrunner Ian Weir commented on his excitement about working with him. “We were really delighted when Malcolm agreed to join us as a guest star — and completely thrilled by the experience of working with him,” he told People. “He was such a leader and a gentleman. It's such a terrible, tragic loss.”

At the end of the episode is a touching message: “Dedicated to the memory of Malcolm-Jamal Warner.”

The episode is titled “Mother Love,” and is the third episode of Season 2. Warner plays a father named Richard Bannister, who is fiercely protective of his teen daughter. Shortly after his ex-wife comes into town after a five-year absence, she's found murdered. Bannister ends up as the primary suspect. Many other characters and subplots were unfolding during the episode, but Warner made it feel like he was in a starring role.

“He was so dynamic in the role,” producer Kim Roberts told TV Insider. “It was actually not meant to be a huge role, and he found a way of bringing that character to life beyond any of our expectations. And he had to walk a really fine line between protecting his daughter and making sure that she wasn't going to be further traumatized and being sympathetic.”

“And I think he did an amazing job at doing both — that is, that we really cared for him and understood the dilemma, while at the same time… [he was] someone who was definitely a suspect in the murder,” Roberts continued. “So we were thrilled to have him, and he was such a joy to work with as well.” 

I think he really touched all of the crew, just because he is genuinely the person that you see, like he's just so — was, unfortunately — just so full of life, so full of goodness, and said really, really positive things to everyone, and it's very sad,” co-producer, Tina Pehme added. “We're very lucky to have had him.”

While Warner was known for giving his all to his performances, he also gave everything to friends and family. After his passing, many people, both expected and unexpected, came forward to talk about how he had changed them. His publicist, Jordyn Palos, claimed that he was responsible for her career. Others, like Anthony Mackie, Viola Davis, and Keshia Knight Pulliam shared the impact he had on their lives.

Warner is survived by his wife, Tenisha, and daughter. He had protectively kept both out of the spotlight, but Tenisha broke her silence on Instagram two months after his death.

“Tomorrow marks our anniversary —and my heart is wide open,” she wrote.

“For the first time,I'm sharing a glimpse of the love that began it all.”

“I can still hear my husband's laugh,still feel the way he made room for every part of me —every tear, every dream.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Reality Show Family Asks for Prayers as Loved Ones Recover After Tragic Car Crash","https://entertainmentnow.com/reality-tv/meet-the-putmans-family-car-accident-update/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:45:24 GMT","

The “Meet the Putmans” family is asking for continued prayers as they recover from the heartbreaking car accident that claimed the lives of three beloved relatives. “We wanted to share an update and continue asking for prayers for Noah, Gia, and our entire family,” the family wrote in a statement shared on their Growing Up Putmans Instagram page on October 8. 

A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman)

“We can truly feel the power of your prayers and God's presence through every up and down. Please continue to keep the faith and keep praying for Noah, Gia, and our family as we walk this long road of healing.”

The family confirmed that 11-year-old Gia remains hospitalized following the September 26 crash in Michigan's Tuscola County. According to the Sheriff's Office, the accident occurred when a semi-truck failed to stop at a sign and collided with a Jeep carrying eight members of the Putman family.

A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman)

The Putmans previously confirmed that Bill “Papa” Putman, his wife Barb “Neenee” Putman, and their daughter-in-law Megan Putman lost their lives in the tragic crash. Other family members were taken to nearby hospitals with serious injuries.

“Gia had a rough night; no one got much sleep. Her ICP and blood pressure were high and unstable for a while, but praise God, the doctors were able to get things under control,” the family shared. “She's doing better now, and they're focusing on keeping her stable and taking it one day at a time. They were also able to remove her chest tube today, which is such a blessing and another step forward.”

Blake, 37, and his daughters, Lulu, 13, and Alena, 11, have since been discharged from the hospital and are “doing well,” according to the update.

Blake and Megan's 15-year-old son, Noah, continues to make progress in his rehabilitation. “Noah is doing well in rehab and continuing to amaze us,” the family wrote. “He's been sleeping better, talking, eating, and moving around more each day.”

They added that his therapy sessions have been encouraging: “In occupational therapy today, he was walking back and forth and even bouncing a ball on the floor! His biggest area of recovery right now is cognitive therapy, but we know God is working and healing him in His perfect timing.”

The Putman family rose to fame in 2017 with their TLC series “Meet the Putmans,” which followed 25 relatives living under one roof in Michigan. They later revived the reality show on YouTube as “Growing Up Putman” in 2021, continuing to share family milestones and updates with fans.

A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman)

Following the accident, the Tuscola County Sheriff's Office announced that the truck driver, Pavel B. Shchukin, faces eight charges, including three counts of moving violation causing death and five counts of serious injury.

Despite the heartbreak, the Putmans remain focused on faith and gratitude. “Thank you all for the continued prayers, love and support,” the family wrote in a September 28 post. “We feel your strength and faith surrounding us. Please keep lifting Noah and Gia up as they heal.”

Jim Jarmusch hasn't directed a feature film since the 2019 zombie satire “The Dead Don't Die,” but the auteur is returning to theaters this holiday season with another lo-fi anthology film that sees him assembling some of his favorite collaborators to tell three stories about adult children trying to connect with their aging parents. 

Jarmusch's latest film, “Father Mother Sister Brother” is a triptych of stories unfolding in New Jersey, Dublin, and Paris. It stars Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett, Tom Waits, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, and Vicky Krieps. Jarmusch writes and directs, with his frequent collaborator Frederick Elmes sharing cinematography duties with “Only Lovers Left Alive” DP Yorick Le Saux.

“Father Mother Sister Brother” premiered at the 2025 Venice International Film Festival, where IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio praised it as yet another example of Jarmusch's ability to pack profound amounts of human emotion into quiet moments.

“In appearing to give you nothing, Jim Jarmusch‘s almost perversely downplayed trio of short stories ‘Father Mother Sister Brother' winds up giving you almost everything if you can tap into its cool vibrations,” Lattanzio wrote. “Packed into the film‘s triptych of globe-spanning episodes about estranged adult children and their late-in-life parents coming together again (at least geographically speaking, when not emotionally) is a profound appeal: If we as children don't bother to ask our parents questions, meet them halfway, why should they bother with us? If you felt not loved by your parents enough as a child or rejected by them as an adult, maybe that's because they felt you didn't need them anymore, and so resumed living their own lives. What if familial damage is too late to repair? Jarmusch would argue it's not, though with his hushedly sad new movie, he's not about to coax his characters along the psychoanalytic dotted line from childhood resentment to coughed-up, adult-age catharsis.”

 










Following its Venice premiere, “Father Mother Sister Brother” screened at the 2025 New York Film Festival and will next screen at AFI Fest in Los Angeles. 

A MUBI release, “Father Mother Sister Brother” opens in theaters on December 24. Watch the trailer below.

Rose Byrne gives the performance of her career as a therapist and mother on a ledge in writer/director Mary Bronstein's astonishing emotional whirlwind of a movie “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” and it's a ledge her character Linda has taken herself to, content to admire the miserable view instead of bringing herself off it.

Rather than cope in conventionally healthy ways with her daughter's (Delaney Quinn) mysterious illness that requires a feeding tube, or the fact that her husband (Christian Slater) is MIA, or that there is a giant water-spewing hole that's opened up in her Montauk apartment ceiling that may be a metaphor for her own condition, Linda takes to cheap wine, weed, and the comfort of her own spiral. She's also a therapist whose own therapist (a deadpan Conan O'Brien) works in the same practice and is also her supervisor. And she's a mother who believes she was never meant to be one.

Throughout this tense, risibly funny, anxiety-addled movie, Linda tries to come up with solutions. But she's batted against by her own clients — including Danielle Macdonald, who is terminally afraid of accidentally killing her own newborn child — and the medical administration hovering around her daughter, demanding immediate improvements or else.

There are also the unhelpful phone calls from her husband, telling her to enjoy the spoils of the crummy motel she's forced to reside in due to said hole. Couldn't she just enjoy a margarita by the pool for once? There's also a fellow tenant (A$AP Rocky) at the motel whose elusive appearance and vague attempts to help her out seem to embody Linda's own white privilege, putting us in the realm of a symbolic dream movie.

The A24 release premiered at Sundance earlier this year, where viewers were rocked and shocked by Bronstein's hilarious and abrasive house-of-horrors vision of motherhood. Linda's child is unnamed, and the young actress Quinn is kept offscreen almost entirely, with the 35mm camera's focus (courtesy DP Christopher Messina) instead on Byrne's ever-contorting face, on her inappropriate reactions to her own self-perpetuated catastrophes.

Byrne's turn is among the year's most potent, with the gift for comedy she displayed in “Bridesmaids” and “Spy” matched to the gut-churning dramatic gravitas of something like her ingenue lawyer in the aughts FX series “Damages,” opposite Glenn Close. It goes without saying that you have never seen the Australian actress in this register, and she more than delivers in a spectacularly frenzied performance that, if it's not Oscar-nominated by January, must mean that the whole Academy system is broken.

 










Bronstein, who is married to “Uncut Gems” co-writer and co-editor Ronald Bronstein, last directed 2008's mumblecore “Yeast” and has since kicked around as an actress on film and TV (including in this film as a stony therapist and nurse practitioner). She comes to “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” with a Masters degree in psychology, which makes this film's pointed perspective on therapy's helpfulness or unhelpfulness especially, uniquely specific. 

She also wrote the film, which shot on location in Montauk in summer 2023, based on a personal experience with ultra-pressurized maternalness she isn't keen to share. There's a brilliant scene in which Linda unspools a throwdown rant at O'Brien's character, begging him to help her but not willing to meet him halfway on the patient's couch. As Bronstein told audiences after the Sundance premiere, Linda is in a situation of “I need help, I need help, I need help, but please don't help me.“

A24 is entering “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” into the Oscar race alongside films like Josh Safdie's “Marty Supreme” (which Ronald Bronstein co-wrote and produced) and Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine.” “If I Had Legs” may be an endurance test for some moviegoers, but as Mary Bronstein and Rose Byrne explained in conversations with IndieWire, this cathartic story of a woman trying, maybe, not to fix her life but to at least turn the page on her worst traumas was never intended to be universal or relatable to all.

 










“I have a theory that if something is for everybody, it's for nobody,” Bronstein told IndieWire. “Art, and even entertainment, is so subjective, should be subjective in its vision, that it can't possibly be for everybody. If you start trying to calculate that, you've already lost… The more specific something is in its point of view and its vision, and the character that you're meant to engulf yourself in, the more somebody can find themselves in it. I find that to be true as a viewer, and [with] the responses to this movie I'm getting, I think I'm right.” 

Bronstein added, “Which is why independent film needs to stay alive, and there needs to be theaters that play it, because a lot of studios do try to make mathematically calculated fare for people to consume, and what they don't get is that's not what people want… [This film] is a novelty for people. They're not presented with films like this, and people are hungry for it and want it, and I hope the industry catches up with that.”

The following interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: Rose, do you quibble with reactions suggesting that you are making some kind of hairpin turn in your career here, that you weren't capable of something so dramatically charged before? It's a deeply intense film that demands a lot of you.
 










Rose Byrne: Mary puts it so beautifully. She's been introducing the film across these festivals and asking the audience to take a breath, sit in your seat, and think about the worst thing that's ever happened to you ever — the loss of a loved one, an animal, a job, the greatest trauma of your life — and then think about the worst thing that's happened to you today. Your coffee spilled on you, or the tin of your yogurt foil ripped off badly, and this film exists in both those sorts of places.

It's funny, this business, I have such an even-keeled approach at this point because I've been doing it for so long. I had never read a script like this. I have done a lot of drama and different genres, but this film really defies genre, it's sort of so punk rock. It has a lot of horror tropes and huge comedic set pieces that I think are very funny. That is really true. I've never had this experience in a film format, too.

Mary, why cast Rose Byrne? She's obviously displayed a profound range across drama and comedy, but there are other actresses you could imagine taking on the level of unhinged commitment this movie asks for. Yet you walk away feeling like only Rose could have played Linda.

Mary Bronstein: That's the answer. There are a lot of other actresses that certainly could have done it. It wouldn't have been exciting to me to utilize those actors, because I've seen them do it. I saw something in Rose where I knew I needed to utilize her comedic abilities. There's humor in this movie that is not easy to do for anybody, any performer. She got it immediately. It's a way of reintroducing a very familiar face to the world. “You know what she can do here. Guess what? She can do this, too, and she can do it better than anybody.”

 










That was exciting to me, and that's also why I cast some other untraditional people in these roles, like Conan and [A$AP] Rocky, where it's like, yeah, there's other people. There's a more traditional way to cast those roles. But would the movie have been as exciting? It's giving the viewer new context.

Rose, you've said you were surprised at first once the cameras started rolling how close they were getting to you, to your face, especially in the film's most dramatic scenes.

Byrne: The first day was the only time. After that, it was not a problem. I understood, but the camera got closer and closer. It's film camera. There are no long lenses. I did say, “Are you going to get that close?” Mary Bronstein was like, “Yes, we are,” and I never asked again. What I wanted after that was more information. I ask more questions than less. We had so much time beforehand that when we got to set — and it's an indie movie — we really could just jump off because we had rehearsal just the two of us, five or six weeks just talking.

Rose, Conan O'Brien said at Sundance that he was surprised you were not hospitalized, at least for dehydration, from this production. What did you do to maintain the stamina?

Byrne: That's so dramatic! [Laughs] There is a stamina to it, absolutely. Everyone has different practices, whatever, with spiritual practices or the way they eat or think. Of course, there is a stamina to it when you're doing a long shoot, whether it's this or “Platonic” or whatever. But my adrenaline was so high doing this film. It really was at cranked up because she's in every scene. The tension of the character, the huge failures that are constantly [thrown at her], she's constantly kind of acting out [as the film is] tracking her devolving as she's using substances and drinking. It becomes very technical with the hair and makeup department, just making that very, very clear. My adrenaline was at an all-time high, absolutely.

 










There's a scene in which Linda breaks down to her therapist over how she feels she was never meant to be a mother. This sets in motion the chain of events that gets her over her fears, her anguish. They end up separating as patient and client. What was it like shooting that scene?

Bronstein: I always referred to that scene as the breakup scene. So in a regular movie — not a regular movie, but in a “traditional” movie — there's some sort of love story. I don't have that in my movie. I'm not interested in that in this movie, or maybe in any movie… I'm very interested in platonic relationships and relationships that have boundaries and context, which a therapy-client relationship is ripe for. It is a breakup of a long-standing relationship. We don't know how long they've been in this entanglement, but we certainly know that we're coming in at the bitter end, and she is behaving very provocatively, but then also extremely honestly and vulnerably. That moment is perhaps the only moment in the whole movie where she's truly opened herself up, and what she is met with is a shut door, and that's it.

When I was filming that, it was so intense. It was so intense for Rose to perform that when I would call cut, she would burst into laughter, like uncontrollable, bodily falling-down laughter, and I think, as a release, because it was so intense, the performance. I was in the room. I try to be in the room when I'm directing, not down the hall at a monitor, because it's the only time that I can see these performances happen in front of my face. The rest of my life, I'll see it on a screen. I set up my shot, and then I watched them perform, and man, what those two did with that material in that scene is golden magic. But it was not easy. She's yelling in his face. And he is “boop” [mimics dead expression]. That's a testament to both of them as performers. It was maybe one of the highlights of the shoot, watching that.

 










Byrne: [Mary] was very clear in her role, and she has a deep understanding of therapy. We did talk to a therapist, and talked about therapy and all the different sorts of trappings of it, and what can happen, and transference, and all those sorts of concepts of what sort of personality types therapists can be. And this is unconventional, but I think you know that it's, it's, it's the love story of the film, it's the breakup, it's the end of that. And obviously, they don't have a physical relationship. It's not that. But that's kind of what it is for Linda, even though she can't acknowledge it.

Rose, did Mary's background as a therapist enhance the filmmaking in that scene, or others?

Byrne: Those scenes were very delicate, and very raw. For me, preparation is key, which is also kind of boring, but you never want to see someone's homework. That idea of those moments in therapy where you are at a breaking point, and what that looks like for her in this particular situation, and where it goes to next. Those scenes were pretty claustrophobic. It's one of those things where you know it's approaching, and you're like [deep breath] OK. That sense memory of “this is one that's approaching, and good lord, I hope it doesn't mess it up”… The comment on therapy is “this therapist who has a therapist who has a therapist who has a therapist who has a therapist,” is it like “The Wizard of Oz,” where you just eventually reach Oz, and that's the therapist? But it's just someone behind a screen.

 










This movie has been roundly compared to “Uncut Gems” in terms of delivering an adrenaline rush. Obviously, Mary, you have a personal relationship to that film. Do either of you find that comparison reductive or unhelpful, especially as that's a male-centered movie?

Byrne: Look, I love that film, and I love that performance [by Adam Sandler]. He brought that character to life which, I think, lends itself to his expansiveness as an actor and for an audience. But I digress. But to your point, I think that's flattering. I do think the films are very different. I do think the lens of “look, we've seen these films of a woman having a nervous breakdown,” that's not a new concept, we've seen that. But I've never seen it through the lens of a female writer/director to this extent, where it's really so purely from Linda's perspective, in a way that I think is completely original and unique. There's been very few directed by women. I should say, yeah, no, mainly men. If you think of the canon, you know the big ones that we would all refer to.

Bronstein: Look, I live in an apartment that I call “the house that ‘Uncut Gems' built.” That's why we live in this apartment. We were talking about it the other night. [The comparison] is reductive. That movie makes you have a certain feeling, which is anxiety and adrenaline… I don't feel the central feeling in this movie is anxiety. I think it's dread. Having said that, the way [“Uncut Gems”] propels itself forward is something Ronnie [Bronstein] and I have in common with visualizing storytelling. We met making his first movie, “Frownland.” He worked on my first movie, “Yeast.” He's become creative partners with Josh Safdie. I've gotten to do my other my own things. But that shared thing is there. We can't ignore it. But I do think it's reductive whenever I see it in print: “This is a Safdies movie, but for women.” I don't love that. Josh is part of my family, love him. Ronnie is my husband, love him. Nothing against them. But can we have a movie that's by a woman, that's about a woman that doesn't say “it's such and such, but for women”? I think we can.

 










One of the challenges is that there's no other movie, maybe, that one can compare it to. When Ronnie and I talked about it, that's kind of what we ended up with, is like, yeah, there's a shared language that we just have innately as partners, people that started off as creative partners, but then also, this movie is nothing like “Uncut Gems” at all. Even the character is not the same, and even the feeling is not the same. So it's sort of like, let's not do that. Let's let movies by women, about women, be that. [The comparison is] something I expected. Because, of course, these are people in my life, and Ronnie and Josh also produced the movie, and it makes sense, but let's let there be a movie that we don't say it's like this, but for women.

What I love about this movie is that it's not striving to be universally relatable. But it is a unique take on motherhood we haven't seen before, and integrated in the movie are news clippings of Andrea Yates, who was convicted of murdering her five children in 2001.

Byrne: The movie's really radical, and it's very punk rock, and it asks things of the audience about motherhood, which is very uncomfortable. There's a lot of shame around any disappointment a woman may feel or struggle or mental health issues, but it's sort of like a scream in the dark, I think. Linda is so disassociated from the experience that's happening to her. I don't think Linda can see her daughter until the very end. But I always felt the script had great symmetry in terms of reflection on that horrific case to her patient who goes missing, and she's stuck with the child, and yet can't see her own child in front of her, and the hole in the roof, the hole in [her child's] stomach.

 










Bernstein: There's been a lot of concentration on the themes about motherhood and parenthood. Those themes are definitely present in this movie. But since it is so specific, I think that rather than shutting somebody out that isn't a mother, isn't a parent, a parent isn't a caretaker, it invites them in as you're saying, “You're not Linda, you're not in the situation that she's in, and maybe you never will be.” But who hasn't felt like Linda feels, who hasn't felt like that as a human? Every human has their limits for how much they can take. I'm not religious, but there's this whole adage that “the universe won't give you more than you can handle.” That's not true in my experience. It will give you, sometimes, more than you can handle. And people have their limits, and people break, and they snap, and they can't take it anymore.

I would say it's a little even lazy that people are tying the movie so specifically to motherhood, because if you actually think about the movie, a very small percentage of mothers experience the type of motherhood that Linda's experiencing, which is being a mother to a sick child and being displaced from her home. That's not a typical mothering experience. Also in the movie, she does not mother. For me, the center of the movie is very much rooted in trauma and stress and that feeling of the universe piling on top of you.

 










Mary, back at Sundance, you were asked by an audience member about the meaning of the title. Are you still keeping its riddle close to your chest, or ready to talk about it more?

Bronstein: Whatever your idea is is correct. I can't speak for everybody's work, but there's a tradition of films and filmmakers where more questions are asked than answers are given in the work, and the movie is really asking you to engage with it on a very personal level. In my mind, no interpretation could be wrong, because how could it be? You're having the interpretation, and you're you.

What's very exciting to me is when people have come up to me with interpretations, not just on the title but some content of the film, that I never even thought of. As an artist, that's so exciting. I'm like, “Oh, OK, I could actually see that. That was never in my mind.” The title is the same thing. I'm a big poetry fan. Poems and lyrics and things and movies, they're not puzzles to decode. They're feelings, they're expressions, and you either understand it and it makes sense to you or it doesn't. If it doesn't, it's your choice whether you're going to spend time thinking about it.

I had a therapist that said one time to me — this was years ago, not my current therapist, there have been many therapists — when I was complaining, “Hey, how come when I'm so upset and frustrated that I'm not getting the support that I want?” And he said, “Well, nobody wants to hug a porcupine.” Linda is in the same situation, and when he said that to me, my response was, “But what if a porcupine needs a hug? It's not their fault that they have quills.” She's screaming for help, but at the same time, she knows who she is, and she doesn't want to change the parts of her that make it impossible to help her… She wants validation. She wants someone to be like, “You know what? This sucks, this really does suck. It's OK. You are angry, and that's appropriate for the situation,” instead of “calm down, let's chill out, let's be quiet.” She knows that in order to accept help, she's got to change.

In 2025, Tim Robinson may be the only middle-aged white guy anyone actually wants to hear shouting. The former “SNL” writer and “Detroiters” star became an icon for the exasperated on “I Think You Should Leave,” a Netflix sketch series (co-created with longtime collaborator Zach Kanin) that summons huge laughs from a bizarro universe of semi-universal characters who are innately disagreeable, hopelessly confused, or reasonably vexed. Robinson plays many of these misunderstood or misunderstanding men, and the unassuming actor's bellowing exclamations — in response to losing his favorite TV show, holding people accountable, and banishing demonic intruders — often feel like the only method in which to properly process modern society.

With “The Chair Company,” Robinson is still shouting, but he also distills many of his favorite, seemingly disparate traits into a single unified person. 

Ron Trosper is another frustrated, stupefied, and cantankerous everyman — someone who would spend his last dime at Dan Flashes or sneak into a lunch-hour meeting with a hot dog up his sleeve — but he's also judiciously relatable even when he's not embodying our collective fury. Met by a parade of crackpots whenever he flees the comforts of his core family, Ron's straining tether to the best version of himself is the source of anxiety-inducing suspense (lest it snaps) and the foundation of an HBO comedy that won't stop getting weirder. You care for Ron — enough to hope he escapes the rabbit hole he's dug for himself… and enough to hope he gets to the bottom, just so we can see it, too.

 










In a series about how easy it is to get lost when you're desperate to be seen, Ron is a middle-manager at a retail development firm named Fisher Robay. He's just been promoted — leading the design and construction of a shopping mall in Canton, Ohio — and his family couldn't be prouder. His wife, Barb (Lake Bell), daughter Natalie (Sophia Lillis), and son Seth (Will Price) take him out for dinner to celebrate, and Barb even offers a toast to her hubby's hard-earned success. 

Naturally, that's when the wheels start to fall off. 

In the moment, Barb's generous toast gets interrupted — notably, just before she transitions from admiring Ron's perseverance into highlighting his actual attributes — but the minor kerfuffle at dinner doubles as foreshadowing for the next day's big presentation at work, which climaxes with the series' inciting incident. Usually when a network claims a show's premise is also a spoiler, it's an annoying overreaction. But in this case it makes sense. They're protecting a damn good joke. So without tipping it, I'll just say the fuck-up is pitch-perfect: enough to push a certain someone over the edge, but not enough to warrant the ensuing insanity.

As a trade-off for withholding what some may view as a critical piece of information, HBO's poster for “The Chair Company” includes a key piece of text:  “There's a whole world under the surface, and only Ron has any idea about it. And sometimes the two worlds collide, and sometimes they don't. Ron holds them at arm's length from each other. Watch every week to find out when he can and when he can't.” 

 










The above may sound like bland nonsense, but Ron's mad scramble to keep his two worlds separate really does rest at the center of “The Chair Company.” In one hand, he holds everything a typical person values most: his family, his job, his security. They're on the surface world because they're easy to see. In the other hand, however, he holds his principles, his code, his basic understanding of how things are supposed to work. When those intangible standards are turned upside down, he delves into the other world, the one under the surface, searching for answers — mostly via the internet. Through his phone, Ron holds a portal into the unknown; a void filled with sporadic echoes and ostensible connections. Whenever he feels like he's found something real, it slips away, and he has to either let it go or keep chasing. And Ron is soon well beyond letting go.

“The Chair Company” could be seen as a loose story that exists to support a series of sketches. Scenes pivot between Ron's main arc and seemingly random side plots, each of which deliver quick bursts of outlandish comedy. (Virtually every time someone bursts into Ron's office, they're good for a hearty chuckle.) As with “I Think You Should Leave,” the humor is well-balanced. Sometimes we're nervously laughing at Ron, because he's done something beyond the pale. But just as frequently we're giddily laughing with Ron, because his befuddled indignation is so identifiable. Ron exists outside of our own sensibilities as often as he fits within them, and through it all, there's a depth to the man that's absent from many of Robinson's more temporary personas.

 










Take, for instance, a remark I initially read as sarcasm: when Natalie says her father is “so good at talking to people.” Given the awkward back-and-forths seen thus far and, even more so, Robinson's history playing poor communicators, the description is hard to believe. The guy typing “you're a fucker” into a customer service chatbot can't also be a great conversationalist, can he? But Ron really is good with people. Or he can be. When he's fully present, Ron can build rapport with his future father-in-law or rally the troops to buckle down at work. (He's the company spokesperson! Ron! Played by Tim Robinson!) He can be considerate and earnest. He can be loving and supportive. Seeing not just Ron's potential, but also the life he's already built helps us invest in his fate over an eight-episode season, just as it helps to draw us deeper into the mystery he's devoted to solving.

And if the personal hook doesn't grab ya, there's always the subjective interpretations of what is all means™️, which are so instinctively absorbed they tend to strike your funny bone before you even realize why you're doubled over. My favorite reading (through seven of the eight episodes) is that “The Chair Company” is about getting lost in an internet wormhole. Ron spends a lot of time bouncing around the web, fascinated and repulsed in equal measure. Paired with rapid editing that speeds up the experience to a barely intelligible rate, it's easy to see how Ron loses himself online and easy to feel like you're caught in the same vortex. Even when he touches grass, Ron's struggle still translates as one we all fight every day: when to log on vs. when to log off.

 










Then if your tastes skew toward current events, there's a conspiratorial bent to Ron's quest that, in a worst-case scenario, could end up with the father of two on a government watch list. If you prefer a surreal vision, there's a dreamlike quality to his adventures that repeatedly calls to mind “Twin Peaks.” Directed by Andrew DeYoung, who also helmed this year's Robinson-starring film, “Friendship,” the series is stocked in neutral suburban earth tones. Neither inviting nor off-putting, the backdrop stands in plain contrast to the dark and dirty corners of the world wide web he scrolls through, as well as the seedy spots in the real world where his online investigation leads him. There's no mistaking what's a mistake, and yet in a sea of beige, it's hard not to seek out even the most ominous oasis of color.

Still, beyond any one explanation, “The Chair Company” is broad and bizarre enough to embrace them all. Robinson, in spite of his well-earned reputation for playing loud jerks and dumb-dumbs, is a shrewd performer. His shouting is glorious for its unbridled force, but he measures the volume as meticulously as he doles out his decibels. For every explosion of irritations, there's an infusion of awareness, and Robinson excels at finding the perfect tenor, whether it's to heighten the comedy or ground the drama. Just as crucially, he's a great sad-sack. Robinson and Kanin found tender moments amid the chaos of “I Think You Should Leave,” and every so often they interrupt Ron's deranged dissent with a moving reminder of what's at stake.

 










For anyone who's seen “Detroiters,” that shouldn't be surprising. In Robinson and Kanin's short-lived Comedy Central series (co-created with Sam Richardson), the leads were two best friends who rarely caught a break, but they didn't care because they had each other, and they were doing what they love. In “The Chair Company,” Ron isn't doing what he loves to do, and he isn't holding onto anyone. Instead, he's going slowly insane, searching for a big break he's afraid already happened. Maybe it did, and he's too distracted to see it. Or maybe it didn't, and it's waiting for him at the end of his quest.

Holding both possibilities at once is enough to make you scream. Or maybe cry. But certainly, somehow, laugh.

“The Chair Company” premieres Sunday, October 12 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.

HBO has released the first teaser trailer for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” as part of the show's panel and festivities at New York Comic-Con. The “Game of Thrones” spinoff is based on George R.R. Martin‘s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novel series, which is a kind of pocket universe within the larger “Thrones” mythos.

If that sounds like a “for diehards only” kind of adaptation, you wouldn't be wrong. And HBO is doing everything in this teaser trailer to emphasize the relatability and accessibility of this story. First off, they're telegraphing that the series, created by Ira Parker and Martin himself and starring Peter Claffey as Dunk and Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg, is as lore-free as possible.

You don't need to catch up by reading “Fire & Blood” or any of the main “A Song of Ice and Fire” books to “get” anything about this one. It's simply a character study, a relationship piece between the Dunk, a.k.a. Sir Duncan the Tall, and his squire Egg. It's a buddy comedy with a few dramatic notes that just happens to be set in Martin's medieval fantasy world. And fans of medieval fantasy worlds in general can see shades of the Arthurian legends here in the fact that Egg is secretly a prince.

 










There's also plenty of what “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon” fans have come to expect of the series: stilted medieval dialogue, crude moments related to bodily functions (look at how that one guy hacks up a handful of spit), and liberal use of anachronistic profanity. When someone asks Dunk if he's Baelor Targaryen — a high role — and Dunk says no, the rude bastard says to him, “Then would you get the fook out of the way?”

Beyond that, though, there's a lot not shown here that one imagines would confuse newcomers, starting with the very concept of this show. It's set 100 years before “Game of Thrones” but about 100 years after “House of the Dragon,” right in the middle of both. It's a period of time that's totally been unexplored before now. 

But that may be a lot to untangle for fans of “Game of Thrones,” who expect that the Targaryen kings might have already fallen by this time (they haven't) or “House of the Dragon” fans who think that the conflict of that series — one Targaryen fighting another — is still going on. It isn't. In that regard, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” kind of has the relationship of something like “Star Wars: Rebels” or “The Bad Batch” to that saga's original and prequel trilogies. Something that the already-converted will enjoy, but it may be harder to reach new audiences.

 










Watch the first teaser trailer for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” below. 

“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” will premiere on HBO January 18.

It's not every day you get to watch Martin Scorsese interview a young filmmaker on his first film, from soup to nuts, along with his cast. 

In this case, after a celebrity-packed screening of New York Film Festival entry “Anemone” at the Whitby Hotel, Scorsese moderated a Q&A with Daniel Day-Lewis, who returned to acting after eight years retired to collaborate with his son, 27-year-old rookie filmmaker Ronan Day-Lewis, and Sean Bean, who delivers a remarkable, almost silent performance as Day-Lewis' brother.

In the audience were Rebecca Miller, who debuted her own doc series “Mr. Scorsese” (Apple TV+) at the festival, who cheered on her son and husband, as well as Paul Dano, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, “Anemone” Plan B producers Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, and more.

What brought Day-Lewis back to acting? The chance to work with his son. They wrote during the pandemic, always in the same room, which meant there were substantial gaps between sessions. Day-Lewis often acted out dialogue, as speed typist Ronan took everything down on the computer. One memorable monologue — a gross revenge scenario against a pedophile priest — poured out of Day-Lewis. That's only one of many. 

 










There was some denial when they got started. “When we first decided that we would try to do this thing together, from my point of view, it was just the pure wish to work with Ronan,” said Daniel Day-Lewis. “We worked on a number of things over the years. From when he was the youngest age, we made stuff together, and it was a continuation of that spirit. Having decided to take that time away from movies, I knew that Ronan was going on to make films, and certainly, there was a sadness in me that I would then not have that chance to work with him.” 

The actor added, “So it began with this idea, just to be able to spend that time together. We were allowed to do it because we didn't know. When we entered into it, we had thought perhaps we could contain it in such a way that it'd be like a smaller experience that wouldn't necessarily involve the full weight of a production. But we were kidding ourselves a little bit with that, and certainly when we realized that we had something like a full-length script, it seemed like quite a big step forward, knowing that we were going back into the arena with this.”

It started as a simple two-hander between the two brothers, Ray (Day-Lewis) and Jem (Bean). “In the initial stages, when we were writing for maybe a year or so. It was just these two fellas in a shed, and we started to get quite stifled,” said Daniel Day-Lewis. “We've got to get out of this shed. We need to.” So they added to the brothers Jem's partner Nessa (Samantha Morton) and Ray's son Brian (Samuel Bottomley), who live in the suburbs, while Ray is hidden deep in the Northern England woods, off the grid.

 










Ronan Day-Lewis was able to decrease the anxiety of working with such seasoned pros because “we had written the script together,” he said. “It was a huge safety net on set, because we had discussed these scenes so in-depth that there was room for a lot more silence and trust.”

“But the point is, where do you put the camera as a first timer?” said Scorsese. 

The filmmaker relied on his experience as a painter. “The last few years before diving into this, I've been painting full time,” he said. “There were certain images that I've been obsessively drawn to through painting… certain reference images started to infiltrate the way I was thinking about composition.”

“Cinematically, it's very sophisticated,” said Scorsese, who proceeded to analyze the entire opening sequence of the film, shot by shot, including the sound design. Even though the two men start out with a prayer, “you just know they're going to battle… he's having his breakfast, and the sound does something, and the camera booms down, and you tilt to the sky and you feel this threatening storm which is approaching… That little magical thing between these two guys. And I don't know what to expect. You never know what to expect in the picture.”

“I did a lot of listening in this film,” said Bean. “It was so extraordinary some of the things that he was coming out with. I've not seen him for 20 years. He's crazy. It was a pleasure just to sit there and listen to this man. We spent some time in Ireland together. We didn't do a lot. We didn't rehearse or anything. We didn't really want to. We just wanted to see how it panned out and surprise each other on the day. The script was so good, it was so raw and pure. And it was about two men in their late 60s, which we are, they've been through a lot, and it was unapologetic. It didn't hold your hand for the audience. And it was a straight, raw story.”

 










Inevitably, the two men fight together, grappling on the ground and inflicting damage. “[He] resented me for coming and persuading me, so he had to hit me,” Bean said.

“Sean and myself and Ronan and Ben Fordesman, the DP, would, at the end of a working day, just rough out an idea of what we might start with,” said Daniel Day-Lewis, “so they'd know the lights, and then the next morning, we just crack on and just start shooting. And that's the way it went.” The shoot lasted 35 days in England and Wales.

Shooting in Wales meant the weather was always looming. “There's something about the landscape and the skies, the trees and the elements themselves seem to acknowledge the suffering,” said Scorsese. “They're part of the characters, in a way. It's as if there's something primordial about the whole thing, that kind of sanctity that's beyond Christianity, that's deeper, that just is there in the land.”

“Anemone” is now in theaters from Focus Features.

Vanities, the debut full-length by French producer Barbara Braccini, aka Malibu, is equal parts devotion and alienation. Her short, lush ambient compositions layer formless washes of synth with field recordings of city sounds; seamy and ominous, they evoke haunted industrial areas or images of abandoned business districts during Covid. At the same time, the songs on Vanities highlight Braccini's clarion, wordless vocals—hymnlike passages that attempt to thaw the production's frosty veneer. The feeling Vanities evokes has, in my mind, more in common with clinical, alienating, but ultimately invigorating films like Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans or Spring Breakers than it does any of Braccini's contemporaries.

Vanities was made largely in Stockholm but finished in Los Angeles, and it feels unmistakably like a piece of California noir. From the sirens that drift through the thickly atmospheric opener “Nu” to the new-age wash of “The Hills” to the voice that whispers, “It's our secret, you can't tell anybody,” like a sample from some '90s thriller, on closer “Watching People Die,” Vanities revels in the chilly contradictions of the City of Angels—its pervasive warmth and the way its layout forces a sense of atomization, the vague spirituality and the potent sense of moneyed privilege. At times, the album recalls the ambient-leaning back half of Chromatics' Kill for Love, another serotonin-depleted record that feels like a strung-out drive through the city in the early morning hours.

This palette isn't wholly dissimilar from Palaces of Pity, Braccini's 2022 EP. The difference now is that everything feels crisper and more expansive: Braccini's voice is clear and high in the mix, as opposed to a whisper beneath the shoegazey wash; individual samples, like the crashing waves on “Spicy City” and “What Is It That Breaks,” can be heard clearly amid the noise. Listening to Vanities after Palaces of Pity, it feels like a weight has been lifted; for every song on Vanities like “A World Beyond Lashes,” which feels like it's collapsing in on itself beneath layers of noise, there's one like “Lactonic Crush,” whose hard-won lightness and gently swelling synth recalls dream trance at its foggiest.

It's not a knock to describe Vanities as functional music: Braccini has said she considers the Malibu project as a kind of diary, and I have many friends who've turned to this kind of organic ambient music in recent years as a way to tune out an overstimulating world. That Braccini doesn't shy away from the potentially hypnagogic or convalescent properties of Vanities is one of its greatest strengths: The piercing exhale of “Contact” might be one of the single most cathartic moments in her catalog, and there are many such moments like that across the album.

It all adds up to the feeling that Vanities is, ultimately, hopeful in a way that Palaces of Pity couldn't have foretold. The album's second half introduces flashes of serenity into Braccini's music. On the nine-minute title track, her voice floats effortlessly above cello played by longtime collaborator Oliver Coates; it feels like watching the sunrise from somewhere there's no smog, no noise, and nobody around for miles. Closing track “Watching People Die,” despite its title, is the apotheosis of this new lightness. It's mostly just Braccini's piano and vocals, ambling forward slowly, until it fades into a static buzz. It seems to take solace in the fact that mortality is one of the only constants in life; simple and meditative, it radiates pure calm.

It's rare these days for an album to be allowed to stand on its own. No matter how good a record is or how well-received, musicians can't help but make sequels. The album is completely different but also still the album. Every eusexua has an afterglow. Though we are born to die, we are promised paradise. The same themes are mined, remixed, subverted, and marketed as a continuation until the album cycle lemon runs dry, bitter, or both.

Rauw Alejandro's a particular fan of this framework. Real fans remember both slices of Trap Cake. He followed up magnum opus Saturno with Playa Saturno, a forehead kiss of an album tack-on. Cosa Nuestra's “chapter zero,” billed as a prequel to last year's album, is four songs shorter than the original 18-track LP. In other words, it's a full album of its own, with a largely new sound and focus, even if it's meant to exist in the cigar-perfumed universe Rauw has been wearing vintage suits in for over a year now.

Where Cosa Nuestra channeled salsa romántica greats, Capítulo 0 taps into syncretism, ancestry, and Puerto Rican folk sounds. This includes bomba, the Afro-Puertorican genre rooted firmly in the drum that forms the backbone of several tracks on Capítulo 0, including swoon-worthy opening track “Carita Linda,” rife with shakers and a call-and-response that feels like godly invocation.

Despite Cosa Nuestra's aesthetic, salsa wasn't quite in the room with us on that release; here, it is relegated to the album's three-part finale. “Callejón de los Secretos,” with Chilean-Mexican musician Mon Laferte, is a high-class duet out of an old-school lounge. Energetic “FALSEDAD” sees Rauw decry a past love to congas and salsa horns with the heartbroken mastery of Frankie Ruiz (whose “Tú Con El,” a crucial cover from this era, Rauw nods to in the lyrics). Closer “Mirando Al Cielo” is an ode to Puerto Rico that evokes the mysticism coursing through Capítulo 0: “Mary is taking care of me/Yemayá is opening the seas,” he sings in Spanish, conjuring a divine protection that's in line with salsa classics since the genre's onset and closing the Cosa Nuestra era with his best vocals to date. That it feels a little late doesn't lessen the impact, or execution.

The identity explorations become cringey when they're too literal. Take “Caribeño”, a track engineered to make you feel empowered. Bronx rapper Saso of rock-reggaeton duo Planta Industrial opens the track, his roaring flow devouring the bomba drum behind him as he shouts out other Caribbean islands and several Orishas, praying the ancestors flow through the song. Suddenly, Rauw Alejandro rises out of the tide, comparing Caribbean men to ceiba trees, talking about the fire in Caribbean women's hips, and paying lip service to years of anti-colonial struggle. The track deflates; what was a flamethrower powered by a key new voice turns into overwrought drivel that feels like a mango diaspora poem at best and promotion of the dated raza cósmica theory at worst. One regrets this wasn't a Saso-only interlude.

Rauw's sentimentality may not be convincing, but he hasn't lost sight of his strong suit: raw sexuality. On “Silencio,” he turns the loverboy dramatics up to a hundred over a pristinely-done bachata with plinking strings and bongos, asking for a silent up-close dance and a night screaming in the bedroom. “Santa,” with producer Rvssian and Nigerian singer Ayra Starr, puts a lover on a pedestal over futuristic Afrobeat. “Contrabando,” a gleefully filthy perreo that samples “Maliante” by Sir Speedy and features Wisin and Ñengo Flow, reminds us that Rauw Alejandro's sonic root—and one of the island's biggest musical exports—is reggaeton, a genre he knows like the back of his hand. Put the playboy in a fitted two-piece and he'll still dodge flying panties while dry-humping the air.

Capítulo 0 falls prey to a usual trap of today's hitmakers: It feels like a collection of (well-crafted) singles rather than, well, an album. While it's not super cohesive, it presents a suite of possibilities for Rauw's future; if he chooses any one of these routes and runs straight in that direction—rather than indulging every side quest along the way—Cosa Nuestra's prequel may mark the beginning of a wider exploration well worth his time. Ancestral reconnection, after all, is a longer process than an album follow-up.

For most of Bitchin Bajas' 15-year discography, the trio has adhered to the Oblique Strategies aphorism, “Repetition is a form of change.” Cooper Crain, Rob Frye, and Dan Quinlivan would fire up their keyboards, lock into an iridescent loop, and explore all of its hypnotic possibilities. As they committed the passage to muscle memory, inevitable shifts would happen—nudge a rhythm here, tweak the resonance there—and what started as a pleasant few seconds of analog synthesizer tones and breathy flute notes became a wormhole, a way to experience the passing of time in a state of suspended animation.

But a seed was planted in 2017, when, on the expansive double album Bajas Fresh, the band covered “Angels and Demons at Play,” a Sun Ra tune from the 1960 record of the same name. The distance between a cosmically minded, psychedelic synth outfit and a cosmically minded, psychedelic jazz ensemble is shorter than you think. And given the Bajas' place in the middle of Chicago's jazz and experimental Venn diagram, their version felt like a natural, inevitable evolution. “Angels and Demons at Play” opened the Bajas' methodology, allowing a more developed melodic sense to emerge from their cascading zone-outs. It portended their next moves: While waiting for 2022's Bajascillators vinyl pressings, the Bajas expanded on the idea on Switched on Ra, choosing eight more Sun Ra compositions to interpret. Earlier this year, the group reunited with fellow Chicago travelers Natural Information Society for Totality, a gorgeous collaborative record that evoked Bennie Maupin's The Jewel in the Lotus, if Cluster had made it.

Heady and daydreamy, the Bajas' latest album, Inland See, benefits significantly from this new, somewhat looser approach. On past records, the band fit sequences together like horologists painstakingly tweezering the gears of a clock, letting the spellbinding mechanics run for a small eternity. Here, the trio zooms out a bit, repeating entire phrases instead of small arpeggiated figures, giving these four tracks a more songwriterly feel. Peaks and valleys take the place of constant expansion. The songs still swirl together into billowing masses, full of slow-cycling envelopes and acutely arranged bleeps and bloops, but it's more like watching cumulus clouds change shape than an ever-thickening brume. For perhaps the first time in the Bajas' catalog, there are parts of Inland See that can get stuck in your head.

The opener, “Skylarking,” immediately telegraphs this new direction. Its lightly churning two-chord vamp feels loose and off the cuff, and as organ and saxophone take turns soloing, you can be deceived into thinking you've dropped in on some languorous afternoon jam session. Lean in closer and you'll notice a carefully thought-through arrangement and slight but impactful production tics. Hard-panned flutes appear halfway through as if demarcating a chorus, then return near the end to bolster the pulse as layers of squiggling instrumentation pile on top of each other. Four minutes in, the kick drum, which has so far anchored the pleasantly wafting sonics, drops out at the end of a measure as the sax comes back in, signaling a shift in momentum as the song pushes to its conclusion. It's all very subtle, but these moments signify an ensemble newly interested in tension and release to induce altered states rather than the brain-warping pace of perpetual forward motion.

The electronic webbing that was the focal point of songs like “Jammu,” from Bajas Fresh, or “Amorpha,” from Bajascillators, gets pushed into the background on Inland See, creating a shimmering, atmospheric noise floor. On “Reno,” all the synth gurgles and pings create space for the repeated melody to swell into, like swarms of fireflies illuminating unexplored parts of a forest. As the piano, saxophone, and triangle waves that overlap on the theme all begin to fade out, you realize how many sounds are happening at once, how massive the song truly is. Even the most legato moments, like the eight-and-a-half-minute “Keiji Dreams,” or the beginning of “Skylarking,” feel roomier, like the intervals of a chord curiously circling each other, interested to learn how they fit together.

The band typically shows its true power when allowing runtimes to extend past 10 minutes, and album closer “Graut,” a sidelong stunner that morphs drastically over the course of its 18 minutes, is another addition to its pantheon of longform blissouts. It starts as a continuation of the gaseous drift established during “Keiji Dreams,” a simple drum-machine pattern eventually straightening its spine into the kind of Teutonic kosmische workout that the Bajas excel at. But instead of letting its motorik pulse hit bedrock, they begin to bend the groove, introducing swing little by little. It's the most playful the Bajas have ever seemed; by the time the song reaches the two-thirds mark, “Graut” has landed on a vibe that's part new age, part '90s R&B, a slight departure that marks wholly new territory for the Bajas. The band wrote most of this material onstage while touring in support of Bajascillators, so when they gathered at Electric Audio to put the new songs to tape, their ideas had revealed new contours through constant repetition and refinement. This is the Bitchin Bajas ethos: Every idea is a piece of the infinite; there is enough depth in a single moment to provide a lifetime of surprises.

Klein is caught in a lie. On a weekday afternoon in New York, she asks me to meet her at a gallery on Canal Street for our interview, but she brought along her uncle—an incredibly tall Nigerian man in a suit with a firm handshake—who, like most of her family, has no clue she's been making some of the most unpredictable and deeply personal electronic music out for nearly a decade. Klein, in town from South London, explains what's going on to him as something like a school project for her university, one that she doesn't actually go to. “It's really kinda funny,” she says, ripping a cigarette, laughing like a Bond villain. “They don't say anything but they must realize I've been in university longer than anyone ever.” This is the kind of shit that usually goes down in one of Preston Sturges' screwball comedies.

On the real, though, I'm not shocked at Klein's ability to take a ruse that far, considering her music is full of little jokes that probably only she fully gets and a real fuck it energy. Click around her Bandcamp page enough, and—as the instrumentals go from still and deadly quiet to a wall of thunderous noise; as the occasional vocal flourish alternates between sung, rapped, and barely audible spoken word—part of the fun is how off the cuff and bold it all feels, often ignoring the unspoken, Eurocentric rules of songmaking. It reminds me of watching Jason Williams highlight reels on YouTube, where he's seemingly thinking more about what he can do with a basketball rather than putting it in the hoop.

Growing up, I'd go to these Haitian backyard parties in Brooklyn and Queens and for the entire night the same kompa rhythm would play with only slight shifts in tempo and vocals. I never thought that much of it, but now I realize how radically different it was from popular American music. My favorite music of Klein's embraces these breaks from traditional song structures, while still having some sort of decipherable idea pushed to the edge.

I'm thinking of last year's marked, which has a boiling rage in all of its gnarly, screeching guitar riffs. Or 2020's Frozen, a hushed and motionless tape that evokes lost childhood memories. Or the comic touch of now that's what i call r&b that upends the promise of the title with warped, ghostly melodies that would confound those nostalgic for Babyface-approved soul. Her new album, sleep with a cane, falls somewhere in the middle. While it occasionally feels overthought, it's the tiny details that make me fuck with it: the dreamy harmonica solo on “score For J,” the chatter underneath the hellish ambience of “it is what it is in d minor,” the brooding keys of “(world star),” which is like a late 2010s UK drill beat in super slow-mo.

At the gallery, a showing of robot parts intertwined with mannequin limbs and guts all about the blurring of technology and humanity, Klein's uncle trails a few feet behind us as we quickly take it in. After a few minutes, she abruptly suggests we go across the street to a coffee shop, where we grab a table in the back. We talked and nerded out for almost two hours. She has a bubbly and bit of a goofy personality that turns serious in the moments when I ask directly about her music, its intentions, and how it has been informed by hip-hop. At times, she'll spontaneously pause to show me a UK rap record on YouTube she thinks I'll dig (I had never heard Shxdow's “My Story”—it was hard) or pull up her Tubi watchlist. Below is a lightly edited and condensed version of our sprawling conversation.

Klein: It's like that newer Top Boy. When Drake took over, one of the main things I didn't like was the lack of a score, but upon watching it again it kind of works. Because the music that does play just feels like the music people would actually play off their phone, so it makes it quite realistic. I'd like to see a film go fuck it and take away the score. I don't need manipulative music to guide me.

I did my own film and it took me an hour before I added a score, it just felt too easy. Like, did you see The Whale?

They didn't trust the audience to feel sorry for him, so they just kept playing this sad music while he's eating and stuff.

The UK one innit? I love it. That's why I love British TV: It's so quiet, you'll hear like this [Klein scratches at the collar of her black polo] and to me that is a score, too. I used to keep sounds of everything, like me sweeping and drinking water. That's probably because I was a logger for TV for a hot minute. It was super fun.

I won't name the show, but I was working on this one reality show on Channel 4 when I was younger. It was a crazy show about men being stupid. But each day I'd be given a roll of cameras and have to log what a specific character is doing. Like, let's find all the bits of Jack laughing and put that into a folder. It's because the show had such a fast turnaround time, so if you needed to find a character doing something, it would be right there. Once, there was a character getting a lot of flack, and I saw some other employees log when he falls asleep but not when the other guys do. It was a big eye opener how you can manipulate TV before it even gets to an editor.

I kind of used to live my life like a Sim so I didn't get bored. It was just life. But I think that job definitely played a big part in how I was putting together my own stuff. I used to just have a folder for everything. You know, finding drums that are just like kitchen sounds or whatever.

It's always so interesting to hear that industrial sound filter into rap. I feel like that shows how people are feeling. Like no, we don't need that Timbaland drum. Let's move on. Let's wrap it up. Let's move the genre forward. But even then everyone can sound like an algorithm of each other once everyone starts doing it.

No, but I feel like people are scared to do stuff without permission. Like, if you try something new and people don't like it, it's OK. It's a recession man, we got to experiment [laughs]. I saw something you wrote about my album [marked] and it had me weak. You compared it to, like, a wrestling theme, or something like that, and I couldn't tell if that meant you liked it or not, but I listened to it and was like, “Huh, makes sense.”

If I ever thought too much about that then I just wouldn't make stuff. Like, you might not get why I wanted to have 10 minutes of silence, but I do, because it's dedicated to Mark Duggan and I wanted to do that for him. Shit, I'm free. What the fuck? That's why I have a song on the record called “young, black and Free.” I remember I started thinking that one day when I was watching The Color Purple, the new one—it's quite bad. But halfway through, I started crying. We really lived in a world where they wouldn't let us read. I called my friend and was like, “Yo, we running it up! Books are back bitches!” They were like, “Uh, what?” That's why I made that song; we can really do anything we want. That's like when people call my music “experimental,” I just think of it as being myself.

I made one record like that, it was called Harmattan. I wanted to make a record that an auntie could hear and actually chill to. But usually it's just about capturing how I'm feeling. A lot of times people seem to gravitate to my more somber stuff, which I gather is because of a solitude thing. That's why I think marked was cool, I made that like all in one session, standing, in a hyped mood and that's the kind of record you can listen to with more than one person [laughs]. But, like, when you're writing, I'm sure you don't think too much about how people are going to feel about your opinion.

You know a writer who is like that?

Hilton Als.

He's a nuts writer. I have a long way to go, but I have a secret art critic blog. But from what I've read of White Girls, it's so—I'm gonna use that word— “experimental.” It blurs the lines between fact and fiction, and that's something I try to be honest about in my work.

Yeah, I think my approach to music is inspired a lot by Dizzee Rascal's Boy in da Corner and the videos that used to air on Channel AKA, an iconic British grime channel, where if you had an idea you piece it together and go fuckin' ham. I feel like I work like the mixtape side of rap, like I'm gonna have a CD, sell it to 50 people, and then move onto the next thing.

It's just really vulnerable. I remember when I was younger I cried to “Brand New Day,” because I was growing up in South London and it wasn't easy—and having someone say that it was hard was everything. Then they released the instrumental album and it's just like, here's a flute, here's a xylophone. That Fruity Loops drum kick. To me, it represented lost youth. I thought about that all while making my new album, like the harmonica on “score for J.” I think of that song like it could be in a Tyler Perry movie. Someone gets murdered and kidnapped, and then at the end we're in church and it's all fine [laughs].

It's just so pure and honest. You can tell he was just figuring it out. It wasn't so metronomic. Because sometimes, when you use Ableton's metronome, it can take away from that. Like bro, I'm Nigerian. We Black. We don't need them to know where to put a drum or a piano chord. We don't have to tune a guitar that way just because they said that's how you're supposed to.

I loved Ghetts. I loved Tim and Barry. When I was younger we used to just be able to go into the Tim and Barry studios and there would just be people DJing, I thought I was in the future. It was a pretty crazy time. It was my introduction to music that was very fucked and manic, with loops and echoes, people writing the most insane bars. Obviously it was very male-centric. But there were artists like Lioness and Shystie that I'm surprised didn't become super famous because they were fuckin' sick. Shystie also had an interactive show where you basically get to decide what happened each episode. It was kind of a musical. You'd love it. Then came Nines, but I was more of a Giggs person.

I like Nines but sometimes with him I just want to read his words. But Giggs, I was looking back and that nigga with his emo jacket and chains was like a little hipster on his indie sleaze shit. Like when he did that video for “Talking Da Hardest,” I was like, Fair enough. No one could tell me what a video is supposed to be after that. There's a level of play that makes it really personal.

I tend to hyperfixate on things, so I end up picking up random instruments to communicate without using my voice. I think it's more vulnerable when I don't use my voice. Like this new record is pretty emo and you can always feel my voice trying to come through and it really doesn't all the way until the end.

In the neighborhood I used to live in, we'd just have police and police horses pacing around. My neighborhood was so active that the sirens—being used to suppress the people—would get picked up without me meaning for them to. I was crying about it and then I realized it was really cool and eerie. My reality was being filtered into the music. Like there's so much “experimental” music that has gone through, like, three mix and mastering sessions before you hear it; it's completely cleaned up.

There's this one Kate Bush album called 50 Words for Snow. That's one of my favorite albums by her, it makes me want to cry. You just see it immediately. After I heard that record, I couldn't even listen to her other stuff that she's more known for, because that one just felt so true to her. Very precious. MIKE has such a way with words, too. It's so visceral, just like my Mobb Deep niggas. Prodigy was making scripts; when he raps, it's like there's 50 movies playing in my head.

There were times when they'd make suggestions to add a riff or whatever, but I was always like, “That's not what I want to do.” I never gave a fuck about the music industry. I just always struggled with communicating and music was the best way to get it out. Writing songs takes me, like, years. If you ever see me doing an eight-song singing EP, just know that I'm either in a 360 deal or that the rent was due.

That's why I made Now That's What I Call R&B as kind of like a joke EP. I was listening to the pop girlies, and, like, y'all need to start using different types of riffs and runs, so I made that for fun. But when people heard that and turned up at my live show, they were very disappointed. Some complained to my agent, like “What the fuck is this?” They expected R&B and it was all drone and noise [laughs]. The exception is “Rich Dad Poor Dad” from the record, it's really like an Elliott Smith type beat mixed with like the kind of singing you do in the semi-finals of The X-Factor. But usually when I do have vocals, I prefer if they're a little deep in the cut.

I don't know. I feel like if someone had a gun to my head I wouldn't remember anybody's lyrics.

There's not many. I usually have to see it live for it to stick. One that I might be able to is “Because You Loved Me” by Celine Dion. Or the other day I was trying to remember the Girlfriends theme song and started singing it. I was mad hyped. I should add it as a bonus track to my Bandcamp.

That track is so gas! I actually have this track on my YouTube that's taken from a live show where we took a Blade song and replaced his vocals with a modified trumpet that only made drone sounds and also a real trumpet. You'll clock it as soon as you hear it, it's called “Super Blade.” He's such an amazing writer. Me and him should make a play together.

Bridges.

Uh, Bow Wow and Omarion's Face Off mixtape. It's so funny, there's so many bridges on there. Remember the Bow Wow movie Lottery Ticket?

Yeah. I rewatched it the other day; I wish I could be in a movie like that. I miss when they used to air these small Black movies on MTV, like You Got Served and Coach Carter. Those whole films are bridges. It's just that they always had to add these little devices to move the story along, like someone always has to get their life threatened or die. Why can't the concept just be them winning the lottery or that they have to dance battle some white guys [laughs]?

That writer Simon Reynolds wrote about that once, that everything is a concept. That shit had me weak. I don't know how I feel about that. The only time I think I really, really had a concept was when I made Tommy because it was all about a character named Tommie from Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. Like this track was about Tommie when she went to have a chat, and this track is about Tommie when she got into a fight with Joseline. That's a concept.

But I don't usually think about my music like that. With everything else, like reality TV, I think about it. Why is there only one Black girl on Love Island? Why that product placement? Why does everything on Netflix look the same? Whereas with music, it's just everything I felt in that moment. It's the only thing where I can really go, And I just wanted to make that and that's it.

	Earlier this month, Jimmy Fallon affirmed that The Tonight Show has “never really been that political,” in an effort to distance his show from the conversation about late-night's recent rupture. While he might keep his monologues clean, his musical guests bear no similar obligation. Hayley Williams took the Tonight Show stage on Thursday for the first live performance of “True Believer,” a chilling record about the sins that haunt the South and the ghosts that aren't geographically contained.


	“They put up chain-link fences underneath the biggest bridges/They pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all their children/They say that Jesus is the way, but then they gave him a white face/So they don't have to pray to someone they deem lesser than them,” Williams sang. She performed at a piano draped with a canvas that read “Mississippi G-d Damn,” a nod to Nina Simone's 1964 protest anthem. 


	At the start of “Mississippi Goddamn,” Simone makes clear, “I mean every word of it.” She feels the weight of Alabama and Tennessee, and of course, Mississippi, as she pleads, “Lord have mercy on this land of mine.”

	











	“True Believer” is born from a similar sentiment. “I'm the one who still loves your ghost/I reanimate your bones/With my belief,” Williams sang. Her critiques of the South — and particularly Nashville, where her roots run deep — serve more as a warning than a complete condemnation. But hard truths aren't always easy to swallow. “The South will not rise again/'Til it's paid for every sin,” Williams continued. “Strange fruit, hard bargain/Till the roots, Southern Gotham.” 

	











	The depth of the record was amplified in its live form by a 12-piece band, including a string section that brought a deeper intensity to William's harmonies. 


	“True Believer” appears on the Paramore frontwoman's latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. “I mean, I'm never not ready to scream at the top of my lungs about racial issues,” Williams recently told The New York Times about the song. “I don't know why that became the thing that gets me the most angry. I think because it's so intersectional that it overlaps with everything from climate change to like LGBTQIA+ issues.”

	She added: “I reference this neighborhood in Franklin, really close to where I grew up, called Hard Bargain, that this formerly enslaved man bought from his former enslaver. It's still there, predominantly Black families, and it's protected now. But of course, Franklin and Nashville are being gentrified all the time. The reason I was writing about Nashville a lot is that we came home from tour and I thought, ‘Well, I'm gonna go to L.A. — get me outta here. Trump just got elected again, and I don't wanna be in a red state.'”


	She stuck around Nashville, anyway. There was more work to do there.

Madonna will belatedly mark the 30th anniversary of her 1994 album Bedtime Stories with an EP boasting early demos, alternate mixes, and remixes.


Bedtime Stories – The Untold Chapter, arriving November 28, features eight of the album's tracks in alternate form, including new mixes of the hit singles “Secret” and “Human Nature,” demos of “Don't Stop,” and a “short mix” of “Freedom,” recorded during the Bedtime Stories sessions but ultimately released on a 1997 rainforest benefit album.


	Madonna's long-rumored unreleased demos for Bedtime Stories, like “Right on Time,” “Let Your Guard Down,” and “Love Won't Wait” (which was ultimately recorded and released by Take That's Gary Barlow in 1997), will also make their debut on The Untold Chapter.


	Ahead of the EP's release, Madonna has shared her original demo edit of “Right on Time”:


	The EP will be available digitally and as a standalone vinyl, as well as accompanied by the original Bedtime Stories as part of a 2CD reissue; Bedtime Stories itself will also be issued on silver vinyl on November 28. All formats are available to preorder now.

Taylor Swift spilled the tea on how a case of mistaken identity during her Eras Tour led to her fiancé, Travis Kelce, meeting Greta Gerwig… eventually.


	While stopping by Late Night with Seth Meyers on Wednesday to promote her record-breaking album The Life of a Showgirl, Swift recalled how Kelce met a slew of celebrities at the VIP tent during her trek's stop in London last year. Swift said that after Kelce gushed about hanging out with Hugh Grant, his wife Anna Eberstein, Tom Cruise, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, and more, she noticed that he had yet to mention Gerwig — the Kansas City Chiefs player's “favorite director.”


	Kelce then said that he had told the Barbie director an “I'm just Ken” joke that didn't seem to go over too well, puzzling Swift, who at first chalked up the awkward meet-and-greet to Gerwig having heard the joke one too many times. Continuing to recount the evening, Kelce mentioned how Gerwig and Grant danced closely together throughout the show, had all these “inside jokes,” and appeared to be “soulmates.” Swift understandably reacted at the time by exclaiming, “The tea is crazy tonight, Travis!”

	











	Soon after, however, videos of Kelce dancing with Gerwig began to pop up online, prompting Swift to “do the math.” When the pop star showed Kelce the videos and he replied, “That's not Greta,” it clicked: he had mistaken Grant's wife for the famed director.

	“The bad news, for you, is he has face blindness,” Meyers concluded after Swift told her story. “The good news is, he can recognize true love. So, at least he saw soulmates.”

	










A post shared by Late Night with Seth Meyers (@latenightseth)


	The night appeared to be a memorable one for Grant as well, who penned a note on X to Swift that said, “Dear @taylorswift13 , You have an incredible show, an amazing and v hospitable team and excellent if gigantic boyfriend (#tequilashots.). Thanks so much from one ageing London boy, wife and thrilled 8 year old #halfgirlhalfbracelet.”

	You do not need to have attended Yale, or indeed any Ivy League university in any East Coast state, to recognize the archetype that is Hank Gibson. He's handsome, bearded, and young, though not nearly as young as the students who eagerly congregate around him, hanging on his every word. A philosophy professor at the esteemed institution of higher learning in New Haven, the gentleman is prone to using dialectical declarations and deep-cut quotes to make his disciples dizzy. “He's Hank,” one character will note. “Everybody loves Hank.” His self-regard is high. His shirts are unbuttoned just a little too low. He's played by Andrew Garfield in a way in which you can practically smell the pheromones wafting off the screen.


	Nor do you need to have logged time in stuffy, cluttered classrooms to clock who a character like Alma Imhoff is, either. A slightly older philosophy professor who's hoping to score tenure (though Hank is also in the running for a more permanent position within the department as well), she tends to bring more of an ice queen vibe to the metaphorical party, and a kind of prison warden authority to the literal parties she throws with her husband, a therapist named Frederik. Alma doesn't just lecture about Foucault's panopticon; she is the embodiment of that all-seeing, all-knowing theory. Her wardrobe is oversized blazer-heavy. Her vibe is “please try not to bore me so much.” She's played by Julia Roberts as if she were a role written for Meryl Streep that's now being played by Julia Roberts.

	











	And — how it pains us to write this next paragraph, though not nearly as agonizing as it is to sit through the subject of it — you don't need to have seen thousands, or even dozens, of movies to pick up on what After the Hunt is aiming to accomplish. (It opens in limited release on Oct. 10, and goes wide on Oct. 17.) A drama set among the intellectual elite that's designed for maximum chin-stroking provocation, complete with an opening credits style that will seem eerily familiar to many, director Luca Guadagnino‘s hand-wringer about campus politics and cancel culture is definitely a cautionary tale, as in we strongly caution you against seeing something this empty and enraging. The film looks like a million bucks, has a high pedigree of talent, and mistakes constant poking for conversation, endless buzzwords for a buffet of food for thought, incendiary hypotheticals for insight. The promise is the kind of quality button-pusher Hollywood used to make 50 years ago. The result is just old-fashioned cinematic fools' gold, in which sensationalistic blather poses as social commentary. It takes a lot of hard work and the perfect alignment of movie stars to make something this god-awful.

	It begins at one of Alma's informal get-togethers, in which both professors and pupils try to gain favor with each other in between boozy bon mots. Per usual, Hank is holding court on the couch. Alma sits off to the side, quietly admiring his gift of gab; the two are close friends, though there's something about the way they're constantly touching each other, or the odd lingering in their hellos and goodbyes that suggests intimacy, illicit or otherwise. Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg) observes everything with a sense of bemused, resigned bitterness. Their fellow faculty member, Dr. Kim Sayers (Chloe Sevigny), trades looks and barbs with him. Every person is insufferable in their own unique way.


	And then there is Maggie Resnick (et tu, Ayo Edebiri?). She's a twentysomething doctoral student who's pining for Alma's approval. More than most, in fact — Frederik keeps throwing shade about how this bright young thing mimics his wife's gestures and mannerisms, and he thinks she may have romantic designs on her as well. If nothing else, she's alert to the changes in tone and topic in the room. Maggie also smiles tolerantly when Hank keeps his hand on her knee for a few beats too many, or leans in close during chats. At the end of the evening, Hank offers to walk her home. When they leave, Alma spies on them through the peephole in the door as they stumble out. Do we detect envy? Or maybe a sense of maternal protectiveness? Is she simply suffering from gastrointestinal stress?

	Actually, Alma does suffer from ulcers, which cause her extraordinary stomach pain and vomiting at inconvenient moments, and cause viewers to wonder not if but when such clumsy symbolic traits will be trotted out in the future. In any case, Maggie doesn't show up to class the next day. When Alma meets up with Hank later at the university tavern, he mentions that he believes this promising student has plagiarized a paper. She's shocked, or pretends to be. Later, Alma finds Maggie waiting for her outside her door, wet and shivering. It turns out that Maggie's nonbinary partner was out of town last night, so Hank came in for a nightcap after the party. Why not? He's Hank. Everybody loves Hank. And then: “He crossed a line.” Maggie needs to say something to the administrators. Can she count on her mentor for her support?


	To accuse or not to accuse, to corroborate or not to corroborate? Those are the questions of After the Hunt, and the reverberations will be as earth-shaking as the volume of the ticking-clock score that Guadagnino occasionally employs for tension. Time is running out, it tells us, though admittedly not as quickly as our patience once the dogmatic back and forth begins in earnest. It's a pity that, after an extraordinary run that's included the HBO series We Are Who We Are, Bones and All, Challengers, and Queer, the filmmaker has broken his winning streak. Nuance is not on the curriculum here, it seems, and while it's tempting to assign most of the blame to screenwriter Nora Garrett's checklist of a script — toxic males, complicit enablers, overly sensitive Gen Z types, grumpy Gen X-ers, and your basic anti-woke blowhards will get their boxes ticked — there are directorial decisions that seem fit only to confuse or enflame. Maybe constant cutaways to characters' hands during a key conversation is meant to illuminate what's not being said under all that talk, even if it simply ends up being a lot of shots of actual hand-wringing. Maybe the purposefully ambiguous coda was concocted to prove some sort of Rashomon-style truth-is-subjective point. Maybe the annoyingly meta touch tacked on at the last second is supposed to be clever. We couldn't tell you.

	Everything feels staggeringly off in After the Hunt, from the tenor of the performances delivered by genuine screen talents to the ham-fisted way each new revelation ups the facepalm factor by 10. Both Roberts and Garfield usually rise to challenges like this, but they're fighting against a tide of relitigated, torn-from-yesterday's-headlines bullet points. Not even Edebiri, who's great at giving you a lot with a little, can salvage a part in which a lot of cultural baggage yields extremely little real perception. Stuhlbarg admittedly steals every scene he's in, serving every line with a plate of cookies laced with arsenic, though you wonder if the only direction he received was: “Good, now make it more arch.” There's one particular plot turn late in the game, involving an incident from Alma's past, that will have you exercising extraordinary restraint from screaming at the screen. Which, to be fair, is different from the gales of laughter you'll experience when Alma, having hit rock bottom, must live through the worst thing a human being can fathom: They have an online Rolling Stone Culture section article written about them. You think we're kidding. Spoiler: We are not.


	A lot of this might have been forgivable, or at best recyclable as camp, if it weren't for a nagging concept at the center of this corrosive bit of work. The notion that cancel culture has run amok, that some may feel entitled to hurl accusations that ruin lives, that certain agendas are always at play, that the kids today don't know how easy they've got it — these are not new ideas, and have been used as talking points by conservatives and those who wish to make things “great” again ad nauseam. Yet somehow, it's the way After the Hunt keeps suggesting that the reckoning around decades of power imbalances and sexual improprieties was simply a burning fever that needed to break, and that once cooler temperatures prevailed we'd all be well again, that feels downright offensive. This wants to be a #MeToo drama that forces you to confront both bigger-picture assumptions and your own biases. Once all is shrieked and done, though, what's left is a faux-prestige screed that's 100 percent #OhHellNo!

Brooklyn's on fire. The intermittent pops of muzzle fire are drowned out as tank treads grind the asphalt down Washington Street toward the East River waterfront, where a 100-year-old carousel lays in ruin. As U.S. forces lay waste to the tourist spots and halal trucks in a deadly skirmish with a fictional paramilitary cell, you can't help but wince in horror.


	Thankfully, the scene isn't something pulled from the daily news, even if it's nightmarishly close to a future many Americans fear. Instead, the violent upheaval of New York City is just one of the backdrops for EA's Battlefield 6 (out Oct. 10), where 64 players are competing to be king of the hill in a shockingly realistic first-person shooter.


	The phrase “realistic” is a little loaded; the sequences depicted aren't exactly what anyone's really expecting to see anytime soon. But they still hit close to home, and the heavy plodding of infantry and the high-tech physics of crumbling buildings make everything feel about as real as can be. While other games are trading in cartoonish action and power fantasy, Battlefield 6's harrowing gameplay feels like a back-to-the-basics approach, even if it's still this over the top.

	











	After taking a backseat to the juggernaut success of competitor Call of Duty for the last decade or so, Battlefield is back as arguably the most-anticipated military shooter of 2025. And with a pretty solid single-player campaign and best-in-class multiplayer mode that makes the horrors of war into a digestibly addictive romp, Battlefield 6 is a welcome sight, even if it frequently makes you want to close your eyes.

	











	Although it's tried many times over the years with sub-series like Bad Company, single-player story campaigns have never really been Battlefield's forte. The newest one isn't revolutionary by any means; it's mostly an excuse to show off high-fidelity, on-rails versions of locations used in multiplayer maps for some neat action set pieces. The paper-thin plot follows a group of U.S. Marines as they bounce around the world aiming to thwart the terrorism of a fictional private army called Pax Armata.

	The story is wall-to-wall clichés, with the playable bits serving as flashbacks to catch audiences up to the present, where the Marines are interrogating a shady government official about how the world went FUBAR. The core cast are forgettable, but the game pulls tricks from older-era Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare and Black Ops by saddling players with alternating POVs of the events just long enough to learn someone's name before you're forced to live out their demise.


	Mechanically, most encounters are just a series of shooting galleries, which doesn't really play to Battlefield's strengths. While some of the areas are relatively open, the forward momentum of the plot means there's always a right and wrong way to go — although you'll only find out which when an on-screen countdown yells to return to the combat zone.


	The level design occasionally takes inspiration from the multiplayer, where the solution to smoking out a sniper is usually to bring an entire building down. But often, it's confusing in the main campaign. Players are told to clear out a three-story apartment, but basic rifle bullets are bringing the walls down around you, with unknown enemies appearing like a jump scare.


	The developers admirably tried to include the class system in the story, where each squad member serves a specific role like medic or engineer, but it mostly means that being shot will leave players laying around waiting for a somewhat dim AI partner to come revive them even while enemies are swarming the body.

	The campaign is at its best when it's showing off gorgeous destruction in scripted sequences. An early game HALO jump sees smoke and condensation caking on the player's visor as they plummet in freefall toward a warzone in Gibraltar. Another has the squad sneaking through the alleyways of Cairo using night vision goggles while avoiding a protest that's boiling over into a full-blown riot in the streets.

	











	The big selling point from the marketing materials is the Brooklyn-based mayhem that takes up a big chunk of the plot in the game's first act. Bringing the battle home for players to storm brownstones in Brooklyn Heights or desperately traverse a crumbling Manhattan Bridge is effectively scary — for most people. Despite its very clearly apolitical speculative fiction slant, it's hard not to see parallels between U.S. Armed Forces occupying a liberal city in a video game and what's happening daily on CNN.


	The cognitive dissonance is handwaved by sticking the blame on a made-up, morally compromised private army, but it's obvious that the experience works both ways regardless of your real-life political leaning. For a certain type of MAGA-minded American, tearing through Grand Army Plaza with a 50-cal is bound to be virtual Viagra. For others, it's a too-close-to-home horror show, although with healthy dose of NIMBYism — it's a relief to jump back to Egypt or Iran to engage in the same level of wanton carnage on foreign soil that pop culture has desensitized. The deft trick is convincing you that, no matter why you like it, it's okay because you're the good guy.


	At its peak, Battlefield 6's story mode operates on the same wavelength as late-2000s military shooters, where morally gray acts of war are a dime a dozen, punctuated by the shock value of domestic threats played out with an immersive POV.


	Despite its surprisingly competent story campaign, the real draw of Battlefield is the multiplayer — and it's rarely been better than in this new game. Stripping all the fat and gimmicks from recent entries like Battlefield 2024 (2021) and Battlefield 1 (2016), the gameplay style has gone back to emulate the design of the series' best installments like Battlefield 3 and 4 (2011 and 2013).


	Since its earliest entries, the defining factor of Battlefield's competitive multiplayer has been its sheer scope. Originally 24, then 32, and now a 64-player assault on the senses, there's really nothing else like what EA's military shooter series offers. It's an experience where users can start a match on foot, racing headfirst into a hailstorm of bullets, only to end up in a jeep, tank, or attack chopper raining fire on the roof of an apartment complex moments later.


	The class-based system encourages teamwork; the only way to successfully take control of a designated zone is to throw bodies at it, but it's easy to get cut down by sniper and artillery fire. The smartest way forward is to coordinate and play your role — whether that's Assault, Engineer, Support, or Recon. Each class has its own unique abilities: Assault lets players run point with heavy firepower and improved mobility; Engineers can fix friendly vehicles or do extreme damage to the opposition's; Support can resupply ammunition and revive fallen allies instantly; Recon allows players to spot and mark enemies for higher field visibility.

	











	Unlike Call of Duty, where everyone is essentially their own one-man Rambo, there's more to Battlefield than just sprinting around endlessly killing foes. There is, of course, basic deathmatch, which is playable in both a classic 2v2 team setup or in smaller squads of four where the groups are all racing to rack up 50 kills for the win.


	But the real Battlefield experience is the tug-of-war around capturing locations in prolonged battles of attrition. Modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Domination are all different variations on this concept with minor tweaks to the ruleset that defines each one. Conquest is a large-scale skirmish where two teams fight to control different flagged points around the map (labeled A to F) where holding each point for an extended period dwindles the opposition's score until it reaches zero. Domination is the same, except with less points to capture and smaller arenas for more hectic action.


	Breakthrough is similar, but rather than having everyone on equal footing bouncing around points on loop, it's a more direct attacker and defender scenario where one team pushes forward, and the other must hold the line. Rush mode is the same, but smaller, and focuses the push on destroying objectives rather than just flooding the areas to control them.


	While most of the multiplayer modes are different flavors of the same idea, there's a perpetually improvisational element that makes Battlefield 6 shine where other shooters falter. If a team is failing to take a point because their infantry is being bottlenecked into doorway that becomes a kill box, you can always just remove the entire wall with an RPG. Suddenly, the levy's broken and everyone can rush.


	While the slower speed and emphasis on physics, from the long-distance drop of bullet trajectories to the breakable foundations of structures, are a huge part of Battlefield's DNA, there's also just an inherent silliness to some of the tactics that stir joy.


	Playing as a Support medic means you can gain tons of experience and turn the tide of battle by just sprinting around a crash site defibrillating a dozen downed soldiers with a slap in the face, screaming, “On your feet, soldier!” As an engineer, it's a thrill to ride shotgun in a helicopter just holding down the repair button as a simple blowtorch keeps the bird alive despite heavy fire turning its walls to Swiss cheese. It's the balance of realism and gaminess that just neatly threads the needle.

	











	Nowadays, everyone's got a gimmick. In the arms race for audience's undivided attention, both single-player and competitive games have become their own self-perpetuating ecosystems. Everything is bigger, louder, and packed to the brim with pop culture IP skins just to get people to bite.

	By comparison, Battlefield 6 practically feels quaint. It's an all-meat and potatoes action shooter that sticks to a 20-year-old playbook, both in how it plays and how it blindly sidesteps any real point of view on its amoral militaristic jingoism. With how overwhelming the noise in both gaming and reality has become, it's a frankly welcome distraction.


Battlefield 6 launches on Oct. 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

On Sept. 9, 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison provided the House Oversight Committee with a jaw-dropping video. The 50-second clip, reportedly captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operating off Yemen on Oct. 30, 2024, showed a mysterious flying “orb” being hit by a Hellfire missile. The object is struck, then inexplicably continues on its path as if nothing had happened.

This is exactly the kind of dramatic and mysterious testimony that Rep. Anna Paulina Luna had in mind when she launched the committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets. (You might remember her as the representative who introduced a bill to add Donald Trump's face to Mount Rushmore.) But the deflation came quickly. Closer examination of the video shows the projectile continuing on its trajectory with no visible detonation. Independent analysts on Metabunk and other sites argue the target's behavior and the post-contact fragments are consistent with a balloon and its debris, noting the apparent “black rim” and shape changes are image-processing artifacts. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has previously published materials showing how parallax and sensor effects can mislead observers. In a separate 2024 Middle East case, the office assessed with high confidence that a similar object was a reflective foil balloon.

Luna's task force focuses on conspiracies that excite the Trump base, from Jeffrey Epstein's client list to the Antifa-Chinese Communist Party connection, and of course unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). In the case of Hellfire-surviving “orb,” Burlison placed unvetted, anonymously sourced battlefield footage into the Congressional Record without attempting even basic verification. 

This is not governance. It is viral marketing disguised as oversight.

Among those who testified at the hearing was George Knapp, a veteran investigative journalist based in Las Vegas who has covered UFO stories for decades. He first gained prominence in the UFO community in 1989 when he interviewed Bob Lazar, who claimed to have worked on recovered alien spacecraft at a secret facility near Area 51 in Nevada. That reporting made Knapp a central figure in UFOlogy, and he continues to work the beat.

Knapp's testimony highlights the way credentials have come to substitute for evidence. Instead of providing credible proof that the committee could verify (or not), his testimony rested heavily on the accounts of Bob “Bizarre” Lazar (as he is known in UFO circles) and “more than two dozen sources” that he did not name, as well as anecdotes about “men in black” that he can't corroborate. He invoked private conversations with the late Sen. Harry Reid, a fellow UFO buff, as validation, referenced off-the-record meetings with witnesses and cited dramatic claims from the Defense Intelligence Agency's flawed Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program — including allegations that the U.S. possesses craft “of unknown origin” — while acknowledging that the underlying reports are unavailable. The committee accepted this testimony not because he brought evidence, but because his decades covering UFOs made him seem authoritative.

This is not governance. It is viral marketing disguised as oversight. Instead of vetting sources and verifying claims, the committee is platforming spectacle and generating headlines. Either the people in charge no longer know how government is supposed to work, or they don't care. 

Before he emerged as the face of modern UFO disclosure advocacy, David Grusch was known as a decorated Air Force combat veteran who served in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. It was only following a two-year stint with the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force that he decided to step forward and make extraordinary claims about government UFO cover-ups. His launch to prominence occurred on July 26, 2023, when he testified before the House Oversight subcommittee on national security and claimed under oath that the U.S. government operated “multidecade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs” and had recovered “biologics” of “nonhuman” origin. He presented no physical evidence, just rumors of interdimensional beings and secret programs hiding alien spacecraft. Skeptics noted the testimony was hearsay lacking any physical evidence, but an intelligence officer making such statements under oath captivated global attention.

Congress had multiple ways to verify Grusch's claims before his testimony. House rules require detailed witness filings, and standard practice would include a classified deposition in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. In that secure setting, Grusch could have provided names, dates, program details and locations under oath while maintaining proper security protocols.

Instead, during his public hearing, Grusch repeatedly declined to answer substantive questions, saying he could share specifics only in a closed session. Only then did lawmakers request a SCIF meeting. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office later stated they had invited Grusch multiple times for SCIF interviews, providing official documentation of their legal authority to receive compartmented information at any classification level. Grusch refused these invitations, saying he wasn't convinced AARO was authorized to receive such sensitive material.

His refusal to share specific evidence with AARO — the official government UAP investigation body — and the absence of a full classified disclosure to Congress continue to raise questions about the credibility of his public claims. None of this has stopped Grusch from leveraging his institutional legitimacy into a media career. He gives interviews to Le Parisien and BBC Radio 4; NewsNation aired a special, “We Are Not Alone: The Historic UFO Hearing.” His public profile has transformed from an internal whistleblower to that of a public disclosure advocate.

Every hour spent on UAP theater is an hour spent not running the country.

It's likely that nobody would have heard of him at all if Congress had treated Grusch's claims as intelligence requiring verification, rather than as social media content. The hearing became a platform for assertions that could not be challenged in real time, creating a public record of claims divorced from evidence. When that belated verification revealed Grusch lacked even the clearances that he claimed prevented disclosure, Congress had already legitimized a flurry of UFO disinformation. Spectacular claims had been broadcast through official channels. 

This is not the first time the U.S. government has weaponized UFO mythology. Beginning in 1979, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations spent years feeding false information about alien bases to a defense contractor named Paul Bennewitz to distract him from classified activities at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In the more recent “Yankee Blue” hazing scandal, Air Force commanders showed new officers doctored flying saucer photos, told them they were joining an alien reverse-engineering program and threatened them with prison or execution if they spoke. This practice conditioned hundreds of loyal, cleared officers to believe in a secret program that never existed.

Credentials can be the mechanism by which disinformation achieves credibility. Combine that with extraordinary claims, a congressional platform and a lack of proper vetting, and you get theater that crowds out oversight. Luna's Sept. 9 hearing exemplifies this perfectly: Burlison testified he'd merely received the footage from a whistleblower, a claim that the Pentagon and CENTCOM declined to verify. The committee entered this anonymously sourced battlefield video into the record anyway, generating a viral news cycle and creating disinformation that staffers are still struggling to unwind.

The motivation for this is obvious: In the attention economy, it's much easier to build political influence through viral moments than substantive policy work. NewsNation touted a 332% audience boost during its July 2023 UAP coverage, displacing news for spectacle. The Sept. 9 hearing was titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency,” centerpieced by unvetted material the government would not and could not confirm. The committee misinformed the public in service of content that performs well on social media.

Every hour spent on UAP theater is an hour spent not running the country. The footage disclosed on Sept. 9 dramatized this perfectly: striking on first viewing, deflated by basic analysis, yet amplified before the truth could catch up. These institutions will continue to reward spectacle over substance until enough crises go unaddressed that even Congress recognizes the problem. By then, the institutional capacity to respond may have atrophied beyond repair. The balloon keeps drifting, and Congress keeps firing missiles that never seem to detonate.

KAMPALA, UGANDA — Old Mutual has dropped the UAP prefix from its name, adopting a sleek, unified identity that aims to leverage its global financial expertise and accelerate market growth in Uganda.

The transformation, announced by company executives, is a strategic move to solidify Old Mutual's role as a diversified financial services provider, blending digital solutions with a focus on customer financial wellness.

“In Uganda, we have been purposeful in our growth, evolving from insurance to a truly diversified financial services provider,” said Mathias Katamba, board chair of Old Mutual, celebrating the milestone. He said the rebrand continues a legacy that includes former leaders such as Sir Gordon Wavamunno.

The shift unifies the brand under the Old Mutual banner, aligning its identity with its global operations across 13 African markets. This move is expected to streamline branding costs and enhance synergy, positioning the company to compete more aggressively against rivals like Jubilee Insurance in Uganda's financial sector.

Kitariko Kenneth, board chairman of the Life Assurance Board, emphasized the rebrand's core theme of client support. “Financial wellness begins with you — our customers, our partners, and our people,” he stated. He noted that the company's comprehensive offerings target underserved markets, especially since only 58% of adults in Uganda hold formal financial accounts, according to a 2023 FinScope survey.

The rebrand also signals a heightened commitment to digital transformation and regulatory alignment.

Richard P. Byarugaba, board chair of Old Mutual Investment Group, described the initiative as a “fundamental transformation” focused on delivering value and innovation. He assured stakeholders of the company's commitment to supporting government efforts on financial inclusion, aligning with Uganda's Vision 2040, and adhering to the Insurance Regulatory Authority's post-COVID oversight.

With mobile money penetration nearing 70%, Old Mutual's focus on digital solutions, such as wealth management apps and streamlined claims processes, is aimed at capturing tech-savvy millennials and challenging fintech disruptors.

Stephen Chikovore, managing director of Old Mutual Insurance, underscored the company's unique, comprehensive offerings—from health to wealth accumulation—stating, “We are the only business in the country with this comprehensive service offering.”

The company has also prioritized robust internal engagement to ensure a smooth transition. Patrick Kimathi, managing director for Old Mutual, noted that internal activities have energized employees, a key factor given studies suggesting engaged teams can significantly lift productivity.

Zac Kisesi, managing director of Old Mutual Investment Group, reassured the public about the continuity of service. “Our name has changed but our commitment to you remains steadfast,” he said, mitigating the risk of alienating loyal clients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Watch out for these ghosts on the Belle of Louisville at America's River Roots Festival","https://www.cincinnati.com/story/entertainment/2025/10/09/the-belle-of-louisville-has-a-haunting-past-hear-the-captains-tale/86586192007/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 04:26:45 GMT","

A Louisville riverboat with a rather haunted past has docked on the banks of the Ohio River in Downtown Cincinnati for America's River Roots Festival.

Built in 1914, the iconic Belle of Louisville steamboat has lived a colorful life and welcomed equally vibrant characters, including ghosts (yes, ghosts) since it first started cruising.

The vessel is the oldest operating Mississippi River-style steamboat in the world and claims to be the ""most widely traveled river steamboat in the nation,"" per the City of Louisville's website.

As legend has it, four spirits linger on the antique vessel.

Captain Mark Doty, who's worked on the Belle since 1981, said he isn't a believer in the paranormal world, but an incident left him somewhat spooked while filming ""Ghost Hunters,"" a reality television show that follows a paranormal investigative team as they explore allegedly haunted locations.

""Well, there's an old story,"" Doty told The Enquirer. ""(Ghost Hunters) came on here looking for Captain Ben Winters.""

The Belle of Louisville has carried a lot of history (and apparitions) since it first ferried the Mississippi River between Tennessee and Arkansas more than 110 years ago. According to previous reporting by the Louisville Courier Journal, the riverboat is said to have four ghosts that walk amongst guests and crew:

The steamboat's most famous ghost, arguably, is Captain Ben Winters, who was featured on a 2013 episode of ""Ghost Hunters,"" and is rumored to haunt the Belle of Louisville's pilot house.

""During prohibition, they had gambling machines on (the Belle of Louisville) and alcohol, and they were up in Iowa somewhere, and the federal government stormed the boat and (Captain Winters) keeled over with a heart attack,"" Doty said.

Although the former captain didn't actually die on the boat, Doty told The Enquirer that Winters' spirit is ""supposedly"" still wandering around the boat.

Winters also allegedly played a role in another ghost story.

""Rumor has it that Floyd and the captain were smitten over the same maiden who was on the boat,"" Doty said, ""And (Winters) ordered the wheel to start rolling while Floyd was back there fixing the paddlewheel and, supposedly, he died.""

Doty told The Enquirer he doesn't think the deckhand died, but when he was on ""Ghost Hunters,"" and the crew played electronic voice phenomena they collected, he heard something say ""Amy.""

""Was the girl they were smitten with named Amy? I don't know, but I did hear that,"" the captain said, adding that the show warned viewers he was a skeptic.

However, that wasn't the only paranormal incident Doty experienced. The captain had taken a woman, who was with another paranormal group, into the pilot's house (which Winters is said to haunt) to ask the spirits questions.

""We went into the captain's quarters down below, and I was telling her the story that I was filling out the captain's log a couple of days prior to that, and I felt something tug on my pant leg and I was the only one in there,"" he told The Enquirer.

Doty said no lights lit up on the paranormal investigator's machine until he asked, ""Are you the one who tugged on my pants leg the other night?"" and the machine went wild.

The Belle of Louisville captain said the incident made him think maybe there are spirits on the boat after all, but it didn't make him believe enough to ""scare (him) off the boat.""

""I've spent many nights over the last 44 years doing night watches and stuff[...] the boat is always moving and creaking, so there's nothing I couldn't explain that I've heard, other than somebody tugging on my pant leg.""

9 October 2025


A scientist has said that millions of people could be unknowingly carrying ""alien genes"".

A study suggests that humans could be carriers of alien genetics


The extraordinary claim comes from Dr. Max Rempel, founder of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, who says his analysis of genetic data shows unexplained anomalies in human DNA.


In a study of 581 families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, Dr. Rempel found ""large sequences"" of genetic material in 11 families that did not match either parent — including 348 non-parental variants. 


Some of these appeared in children born before 1990, long before modern gene-editing tools such as CRISPR were developed.


Dr. Rempel said: ""If confirmed, the discovery could fundamentally alter our understanding of human evolution.


""Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation. It could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.""


However, the boffin acknowledged that the findings are preliminary and ""not yet conclusive"", citing the need for more robust datasets.

Remain

By Nicholas Sparks with M. Night ShyamalanRandom House: 352 pages, $30If you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores.

On the surface, author Nicholas Sparks and filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan seem like unlikely collaborators. Sparks is a master of the “earthbound” love story like “The Notebook,” while Shyamalan, the Oscar-nominated director of “The Sixth Sense,” is known for his fascination with the supernatural. It turns out they've admired each other's work for years, and now together have produced “Remain,” which arrives on bookshelves next week  and lands in movie theaters next October.

Sparks is known for pulling at readers' heartstrings with cinematic love stories — 11 of which have made their way to the big screen, and several of which Sparks produced himself. But with “Remain,” the bestselling author has forged a singular partnership that takes him well outside his comfort zone. For one, the romance that transpires is between a living male and, let's say, a ghostly woman. The lovers have otherworldly sex, although they can't actually touch. In other words, it's a love story only this pair could concoct.

In early 2023, Sparks says someone on his team approached him with an idea. “Hey,” Sparks recounted, “wouldn't it be neat if you did something with M. Night Shyamalan?” Sparks, who The Times interviewed over Zoom from his home in New Bern, N.C., had been a Shyamalan devotee for decades. Of course, he loved “The Sixth Sense.” “Who didn't, right?” he laughs. But he's also been a fan of every Shyamalan production since. There was even a near-miss between them decades ago. “When ‘The Notebook' was being adapted into a movie way back in the late 1990s, one of the filmmakers the producers approached was M. Night. He turned it down because he was working on another project.” Sparks pauses, then smiles slyly, “I think it was called ‘The Sixth Sense.'”

At this stage of his highly successful career — more than 115 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide — Sparks can pick and choose among projects. And he's also now enough of a Hollywood veteran to know that getting from concept to screen can be challenging — though Sparks' track record is pretty remarkable. So while he was open to a partnership with Shyamalan, Sparks was skeptical it would get off the ground. To Sparks' surprise, a month or two after the idea was first floated, he received a call to arrange a meeting between the two the following month — in May 2023 — in Shyamalan's Bucks County, Pa., offices. They agreed that each would propose his own storyline and together they would decide which to go forward with. The competition was on.

Nicholas Sparks is a master of romance

It became clear within moments that Shyamalan's concept would win the day, though Sparks is reticent to say why, except that “mine was pretty dark.” Once Shyamalan characterized his vision as a “supernatural love story,” Sparks thought, “I can do that. It's not so wildly outside what I do. Something Lovecraftian with different dimensions.” The more he thought about it, the more Sparks realized that, “in the end, novels come down to character, writing and plotting.” All of those were in his toolbox. They got what Sparks describes as “the fangirling stuff” out of the way, and then took a hard look at how well they could work together. “It came down to chemistry,” Sparks says.

The pair spent the next several hours honing the central idea and spitballing about plot and character development. It was eventually decided that the male protagonist, Tate Donovan — to be played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie — would be an architect who is grieving the loss of his sister. She tells him on her deathbed that she's able to see spirits “still tethered to the living world.” Both novel and film would be set in Cape Cod, Mass., and there would be a mysterious woman named Wren, which is where the supernatural element would come in. They loosely agreed on the outline, but no firm deal or timeline was put in place. Sparks returned to his home in New Bern. More than a year passed, during which, Sparks says, “I didn't hear anything from him at all. I thought, ‘OK, he's busy. I'm busy. Whatever,'” and turned to another project.

In August 2024, Sparks was surprised to receive a call from Shyamalan, who had already moved forward on the idea. “Our story is going to be my next project,” Sparks recalls Shyamalan saying. “He told me he intended to write, direct and produce the film.” Sparks says it then hit him, “Oh my gosh. This is going to be an M. Night movie!” The mood shifted from excitement to reality: “I guess I'd better get started on the novel!” Sparks recalls telling himself.

After that call, it took only six weeks for Shyamalan to complete a first draft of the screenplay, which he sent to Sparks for comment. Typically, the book would be written first, and the screenplay would follow, though, for “Message in a Bottle,” Sparks finished the novel after Gerald Di Pego had completed the script, with Kevin Costner attached. Sparks knew the drill. He immediately recognized, “Wow, this is going to make a great film,” but to work as a novel, he told Shyamalan, “We've got to tweak some things.” By October, they'd smoothed out the rough edges and Sparks began writing in earnest.

Sparks' career is the stuff of fairy tales, much like the romances he writes. It was his mother who first suggested he write books to “stop him from pouting” after he was sidelined with an injury from the University of Notre Dame track and field team. The first-ever novel he wrote was “truly terrible,” Sparks says, and has never been published. But the seed was planted. Many years later, after marrying, having kids and working as a pharmaceutical sales rep, he thought back to his mother's advice, and spent evenings writing a novel he named “Winter for Two.”

Oscar winner and literary champion Reese Witherspoon co-wrote her first novel, ‘Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling thriller writer Harlan Coben. It plunges readers into the amoral world of the super-rich.

He sent off the finished manuscript to 25 literary agents. Only one — Theresa Park — responded. She was enthusiastic, but urged him to retitle it “The Notebook.” At Park's request, he printed 20 or so hard copies to be mailed to publishers. One of those landed in the hands of Jamie Raab, who was then executive editor at Warner Books in New York. Raab instantly saw its potential and rushed a copy to her boss' apartment, asking her to drop everything and read it as quickly as possible. Raab's boss was sold, and instructed her to “take the novel off the table” in a preemptive deal that would prevent other publishers from bidding. “I knew it had a lot of heart. It made me cry. … I had an instinct that many would feel the same way,” Raab recalls. In 1996, “The Notebook” hit No. 1 on bestseller lists; in 2004, it became a box office hit starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams; and in 2024, it was turned into a play that was nominated for three Tony Awards. Raab ended up editing 18 more of Sparks' books.

Sparks says he and Shyamalan worked well as a team. “He gave me a very long leash to write a novel based on the story the two of us came up with,” Sparks says. “I would call him and say, ‘Can I make the ending different?' or ‘How about this twist instead?'” They spoke three or four times a week during this period. They had “a wonderful time bouncing ideas off each other,” Sparks says. “The only tricky part was that I couldn't make all the decisions about the novel on my own, as I normally would.” He says, “Night got to pick the rules and I had to write within those rules. His story determined what I needed to do, but it was still up to me to figure out how I was going to do it.” Their teamwork, Sparks says, produced “a great movie,” hitting theaters Oct. 23, 2026, and a book he hopes readers will be surprised and delighted by.

For anyone who's shocked that Sparks would stray off the beaten path of traditional love stories, that first book, the one his mom prompted him to write but never saw the light of day? It was a horror novel inspired by Sparks' literary hero, Stephen King. Who knows where Sparks may venture next.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Paramount's Vicious Rotten Tomatoes Score Debuts At 41%","https://screenrant.com/vicious-paramount-movie-rotten-tomatoes-score-debut/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 16:30:00 GMT","

Paramount's new supernatural thriller starring Dakota Fanning is getting some vicious treatment from critics just ahead of its release on streaming.

Rotten Tomatoes has tagged Fanning's Vicious with a green splat, giving it a score of 41% as of this publication, with 17 reviews compiled so far. There's still a chance for its score to improve as more reviews are added to the tally. Directed by Bryan Bertino (The Strangers), Vicious hits Paramount+ on October 10.

The film was originally slated for a theatrical release in August before being moved all the way up to February 28. The plan changed again when it was decided to scratch that release and premiere the film at Fantastic Fest.

Paramount ultimately decided that Vicious would not make it as a theatrical release and chose to debut it on streaming and digital formats. The movie'sofficial synopsis reads as follows: 

When Polly (Dakota Fanning) receives a mysterious Box from an unexpected late-night visitor, it comes with a simple instruction: place three things inside: something you need, something you hate, and something you love. What begins as a strange ritual quickly unravels into a waking nightmare.Trapped in a terrifying world where reality bends and memory betrays, Polly must navigate a series of impossible choices. As time slips away, she's forced to confront the darkness not just around her, but within her--before it consumes everything and everyone she's ever known.



While a 41% RT score indicates generally negative reviews, a handful of critics have actually found good things to say about Vicious. “There's no question it delivers on frights,” Bloody Disgusting declares in its positive assessment.

Dread Central praises the film's director, saying “While not as sharp-toothed as some of his previous works, ‘Vicious' packs the classic Bertino punch” while calling Fanning's performance “incredible.”

But Vicious is getting more bad reviews than good. Critics cite the film's ending as a major problem, knocking it for squandering a promising premise by losing sight of the rules it establishes early on. Some reviews hit the film for lacking suspense, while others call it shallow and thematically fuzzy.

Fanning's performance receives raves in almost every review, but these same critics have little good to say about Vicious beyond their praise of its star, with writer-director Bertino taking a lot of heat for a script that fails to resolve the story in a satisfying, or even coherent, way.

But there's actually a positive takeaway from Vicious getting a 41% RT score. Shifting release dates followed by the ultimate decision to drop it on streaming cast a pall over the film, but a not-terrible RT rating indicates that it might not be a total disaster after all, and could in fact be a solid movie to watch at home.

The supernatural thriller offering, at the very least, includes a superlative performance by Fanning, who is on a two-movie horror roll after starring in last year's The Watchers. The star is joined in the Vicious cast by Kathryn Hunter (Andor), Mary McCormack (The West Wing), and Rachel Blanchard (The Summer I Turned Pretty).



Vicious is a thriller that follows a young woman forced to confront perilous challenges overnight after receiving a mysterious gift. As she navigates a menacing situation, she must fight for her survival, uncovering deeper threats within the unsettling present delivered by a nocturnal visitor.

JENKINTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- Two people have been arrested in Montgomery County for allegedly running a fortune-telling scheme that defrauded victims out of more than $600,000.

Gina Marks, 52, of Huntingdon Valley and Steve Nicklas, 40, of Jenkintown, are facing multiple felony charges after investigators say they operated a business called Jenkintown Psychic Visions and convinced victims they were cursed.





According to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, the first victim contacted the business for a psychic phone reading and was told she was plagued by a powerful curse that would destroy her marriage, business, and family unless it was removed.

Over the course of 11 months, from September 2022 to August 2023, Marks and Nicklas allegedly demanded large sums of money and luxury items to ""cleanse"" the curse, including jewelry, cash, clothing, concert tickets, and gift cards.

The victim also handed over personal belongings for rituals, which investigators say were never returned. In total, the pair allegedly stole $595,959 from the first victim.

A second victim came forward during the investigation, which began in December 2024. Detectives say Marks instructed the victim to provide personal photos and details, then made increasingly unorthodox requests, including a Chanel purse and additional money.

Marks allegedly threatened the victim with reputational damage if her instructions were not followed. The second victim lost at least $18,000.

Financial records from Cash App, Zelle, and a credit union confirmed that funds from both victims were transferred into accounts belonging to Marks and Nicklas.

""These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain,"" said Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. ""They are now going to be held accountable for their actions.""

Marks and Nicklas were arrested on Tuesday and charged with Corrupt Organizations, Dealing in the Proceeds of Unlawful Activities, Theft by Unlawful Taking and multiple other offenses.","{'href': 'https://6abc.com', 'title': '6abc Philadelphia'}","other"

UNITED STATES—This is something I have been trying to figure out for years. If there is one thing that tends to fascinate Americans, it is true crime, but the question lingers: WHY? What is it about true crime and unbelievable tales that get so many people in a tizzy?

I don't know, that is a question I would love to answer, but I just can't because that is something that gives me the utter chills more than anything. Shows like “20/20,” “Unsolved Mysteries,” and a host of others, would give me nightmares. Until this day, you will never see me watch such shows, because they would give me nightmares that last for days.

It has never intrigued me to figure out the motive behind some of the most notorious serial killers in this country, but I have friends and family who think otherwise. Why? They want to understand those intricacies and understand why notorious killers like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson and so many others did what they did and how they alluded authorities for such a significant time frame.

That would not intrigue my mind, if anything it would madden it because it scares you to high heaven, realizing such horrific and violent things transpired in this country at the hands of a crazed individual. I think the fascination with true crime is a direct result of Americans becoming desensitized to violence. We see it all around us, we hear about it all the time, so it feels like it's not such a big deal, which is beyond scary to say the least.

You see it in movies and TV, and you know its fake for the most part, but when you hear about it in the real world, it should terrify us, but in some sick and twisted way it doesn't. We become more invested in these tales of macabre and depravity.

I heard so many people talking about that Netflix series involving Jeffrey Dahmer and how disturbing it was, but people couldn't turn away; they had to know how it ended. Remember a lot of things when it comes to television and movies are sensationalized. I mean the goal is to make money, so you elaborate a bit on things, but in doing so society becomes giddy about it.

I don't even want to get into the realm of podcasts because if you have a microphone everyone has a podcasts nowadays and you have plenty who LOVE to talk about true crime and all the fascination that comes with these high-profile serial killers that some of us have placed on pedestals, we have become obsessed with, when we should be repelled and disgusted by.

The scary thing about true crime is I don't think it is going anywhere. You have cable channels and networks completely dedicated to all thing's true crime. If anything, it is just getting bigger in scope. It is scary because what does our obsession/fascination with true crime say about us as a society? I would love to give you that answer, but I don't have one. I would make the argument it makes us have to look in the mirror and question who we are.

Why do we crave revenge? And why can't we stop? In this episode, James Kimmel explains the neuroscience behind one of our most destructive urges. Drawing from his new book, The Science of Revenge: Understanding the World's Deadliest Addiction, Kimmel reveals how revenge activates the same brain circuits as drugs like cocaine—and why even imagining payback can feel euphoric.

If you've ever fantasized about revenge (and who hasn't?), whether in politics or personal relationships, this episode offers a chilling yet hopeful look at the science of moral outrage and redemption.

James Kimmel, Jr., JD, is a lecturer in psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, a lawyer, and the founder and co-director of the Yale Collaborative for Motive Control Studies. A breakthrough scholar and expert on revenge, he first identified compulsive revenge seeking as an addiction and developed the behavioral addiction model of revenge as a public health approach for preventing and treating violence. His new book is The Science of Revenge: Understanding the World's Deadliest Addiction—and How to Overcome It.

In this article

Intel on Thursday announced its new PC chips slated to debut in laptops next year as the chipmaker battles to turn around its struggling business.

The company said the new Panther Lake processor is made with its 18A technology and is the most advanced node made on U.S. soil.

The new generation of chips will be made at Intel's Fab 52 facility in Arizona, which the company said is now fully operational and set to ramp production.

""The United States has always been home to Intel's most advanced R&D, product design and manufacturing – and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,"" CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a release announcing the news.

Intel is also building its Xeon 6+ servers equipped with 18A processors at the site. Those will debut in the first half of 2026. 

The latest reveal comes during a critical stretch for the beleaguered chipmaker that has lagged in recent years and struggled to keep up with cutting-edge chip demands spurred by the artificial intelligence revolution.

In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in the company in an effort to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.

Since taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.

This summer, President Donald Trump called Tan ""highly CONFLICTED"" and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.

Intel shares have bounced 87% this year.

Violations of the ban could result in fines of up to €3,000, local media outlets have reported, citing the draft proposal.

In addition to the complete ban on full-face veils in public places, schools, universities, offices, and commercial venues, the proposed measure imposes stricter rules on financial transparency in places of worship, making it easier to trace foreign funding. The draft also calls for banning so‑called virginity tests and harsher penalties for forced marriages, practices the party says violate human dignity.

The move seeks to “protect Italian identity, citizen security, and women's freedom,” the right-wing ruling party said in a statement, arguing that the measure would not curb religious liberty, but prevent its misuse to justify practices contrary to the constitution and social norms.

The proposed measure provides “concrete tools to stop the spread of fundamentalist practices and opaque financing that threaten security and social cohesion,” according to the party's MP Galeazzo Bignami.

Italy already has a law, dating from 1975, that prohibits garments fully covering the face in public spaces, primarily targeting helmets or masks used for concealment rather than religious garb.

France became the first European country to fully ban the niqab in public places in 2011, introducing penalties such as fines or community service. Several other countries subsequently implemented similar measures, including Belgium, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The United Nations has warned that these bans could restrict religious freedom and risk further marginalizing women by limiting their participation in public life.

BELGRADE, October 9. /TASS/. Introduction of sanctions by the United States against Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) company will entail serious political, economic and social implications for the country, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in the address to the nation.

""Today at six o'clock in the morning, the US introduced sanctions, meaning that sanctions against Naftna Industrija Srbije became effective. This is a bad piece of news for our country, although the expected one,"" Vucic said.

Consequences of these measures go far beyond the framework of operations of a single company, Vucic said. ""This piece of news is bad for Serbia in many aspects. The case in point is not merely functioning of a single company - these are extremely grave consequences for the entire our country in political, economic, social and any other sense,"" the Serbian leader stressed.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Before the Spanish study, some scientists had been sceptical about the mammals attacking migratory birds

Bats are generally viewed as harmless, if spooky, creatures of the night. But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe's largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight.

The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude.

“It's fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.”

Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence.

In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southern Spain and fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful.

This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It's night-time, the bird can't see it coming, it can't hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.”

On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat's wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude.

“From a human perspective, I didn't feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn't doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.”

Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats' hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight.

Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.”

The findings are published in the journal Science.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump says federal cuts made while government is shut down will ‘only' target his opponents's priorities; House-passed bill and Democratic stopgap rejected

Trumps says that “we will be making cuts that are permanent and we're only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you”.

“We're only cutting Democrat programs,” he repeats. “We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, that's the way it works.”

Trump said that he thought that brokering an end to the war in Ukraine would have been “one of the easier ones”, but is confident that a ceasefire will be on the horizon “hopefully soon”.

“I think Russia is actually right now, both economically and militarily, not in a very strong place,” Stubb added, praising Donald Trump for pushing European allies to boycott sales of Russian oil and gas.

Donald Trump and Finland's president, Alexander Stubb, are meeting now in the Oval Office. Stubb congratulated Trump on the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.

If someone would have said a few weeks back that you and your team are able to push us to a position where there will be a cease fire, an exchange of prisoners, hostages, and then a pullback, I would not have believed it, but it's this is what diplomacy is at its best.

The Senate has rejected, for the seventh time, a House-passed bill to keep the government funded until 21 November – leaving no end in sight for shutdown as it enters its ninth day. The continuing resolution failed to pass the 60-vote threshold to advance. The upper chamber also failed to pass a Democratic alternative, replete with several health care provisions. Congressional lawmakers from both sides of the aisle continue to trade barbs, blaming the other party for the lapse in government funding.

At his eight cabinet meeting, Donald Trump took a victory lap following the agreement of the first phase of a ceasefire deal by Israel and Hamas. The meeting lasted just over an hour, and the president said that the Gaza hostages should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump also said that he had agreed to speak at the Knesset on his upcoming trip to the Middle East.

Two federal courts heard arguments over the Trump administration's deployment of national guard troops to Democratic-run cities. A three-panel judge on the ninth circuit court of appeals wrapped a hearing to decide whether to allow the president's deployment of national guard troops to Portland, Oregon. Last week a lower court judge blocked the administration from federalizing troops. Meanwhile, in Chicago, April Perry, a district court judge, held a hearing in a very similar case, after protests erupted outside immigration facilities throughout the city and Trump deployed hundreds of national guard officers from Illinois and Texas to Chicago. After closing arguments, Perry asked lawyers to be back at the court in a few hours.

Meanwhile, Trump's homeland security secretary said that the department is buying buildings in Chicago and Portland where agents can operate. “We're going to not back off,” Kristi Noem said at today's cabinet meeting. “In fact, we're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

The president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, has arrived at the White House. Donald Trump will hold a bilateral meeting with the Finnish leader shortly.

Judge Perry has called a recess and has asked the lawyers representing Illinois and the administration to be back in the courtroom by 5:30pm EST. We'll bring you more as it happens.

Meanwhile, in the midwest, a federal judge is hearing arguments in a very similar case in Chicago.

Judge April Perry, a Biden appointee, will deliberate on whether to block the president's deployment of troops to the windy city as protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities continue.

Earlier this week, she declined to issue a temporary restraining order after the state of Illinois filed a lawsuit against the administration, instead she gave the federal government two days to respond and scheduled today's hearing.

We're not sure when Perry will issue her ruling, but as we've been reporting, hundreds of national guard troop from Illinois and Texas arrived in Chicago this week and have stayed put.

The Senate has rejected, for the seventh time, a House-passed bill to keep the government funded until 21 November – leaving no end in sight for shutdown as it enters its ninth day.

The upper chamber voted 54-55 on the funding extension, failing to meet the 60-vote threshold, with the same three Democratic and Independent senators voting “yes” and breaking ranks with the party.

Republican senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, continued to vote “no”, while senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, did not vote.

Per my last post, it's worth remembering that this case is now at the appellate court after the administration appealed the decision by a Trump-appointed lower court judge, Karin Immergut. Last week, Immergut blocked the president from federalizing and deploying the national guard, saying the president's reasoning was “simply untethered from the facts”.

A short while ago, a three-judge panel on the ninth circuit court of appeals wrapped a hearing to decide whether to allow Donald Trump's deployment of national guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

A reminder that late Wednesday, the appeals court ruled that the troops could stay federalized, but stopped short of saying Trump had the power to deploy them.

Today, the judges, two of whom were nominated by Trump, heard arguments from Oregon officials who say that the White House has completely mischaracterized and exaggerated the protests outside an immigration in Portland as a “rebellion”, in an attempt to legally justify its use of the military. Meanwhile, lawyers for the administration have described the scenes as lawless and uncontrolled.

Today's cabinet meeting was dramatically shorter than the president's last one, which he held in August. That went on for more than three hours, whereas today's came in just over an hour.

During the president's cabinet meeting, Brooke Rollins, Trump's agriculture secretary, said that “we've got to get the government reopened” so that the administration can begin to help America's farmers. She insisted, however, that they aren't just struggling because of the steep retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, amid the ongoing trade war that kicked off when Trump returned to the White House this year.

Instead, Rollins blamed the previous administration. “We inherited a slew of issues,” the agriculture secretary said, listing the increase in cost of labor and goods that farmers need under Joe Biden. “We have to change this hamster wheel of government. We've got to ensure that the farmers have the market to sell.”

The president has said that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netenyahu, is “much more popular today” than he was five days ago, when asked about his ability to stay in power following the first phase of the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.

Trump had “some extraordinary phone calls and meetings”, Rubio adds, that made the deal possible.

A turning point was Trump's meeting with Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN summit a few weeks ago, Rubio adds, to get those countries behind his plan.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Serbia provided financial humanitarian aid worth 472 million rubles ($5.8 million) to Russia's war-affected Kursk Oblast, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 9.

While Moscow framed the assistance as ""centuries-old brotherhood"" and praised ""the close ties between our countries and peoples,"" the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.

Ukraine launched the unprecedented offensive into the Russian border in August 2024, taking Russia by surprise and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) in the first few months.

The operation was designed to divert Russian troops from the front in eastern Ukraine and to disrupt Russia's alleged plans to invade Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region bordering Kursk Oblast. 

Bolstered by 12,000 North Korean troops, Russia counterattacked this spring, regaining most of the lost territory and advancing into border areas of Sumy Oblast. 

According to Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russia has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and injured during the Kursk operation as of July 2025.

Russia also continues to use Kursk Oblast to launch regular drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The Serbian funds were transferred to the Kursk Oblast Development Fund on Oct. 8, the foreign ministry said.

Belgrade has yet to comment on the statement. 

The news comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding Serbia's role in the war. 

In May, Russian intelligence accused Serbia of supplying weapons to Ukraine — a claim the Balkan country has denied.

A 2024 Financial Times investigation found that Serbian ammunition had reached Ukraine via third-party intermediaries, albeit on both sides of the war.

While Belgrade has maintained humanitarian assistance to Kyiv and pledged support for post-war reconstruction, it has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, despite being a formal EU candidate since 2012.

Serbia's largest Russian-owned oil company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), announced on Oct. 9 that it had not received an extension of its U.S. sanctions waiver, Reuters reported.

While Moscow framed the assistance as ""centuries-old brotherhood"" and praised ""the close ties between our countries and peoples,"" the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.





Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said three drones were shot down in the Matveyev-Kurgan district by air defense systems. 

The resolution passed with 469 votes in favor, 97 against, and 38 abstentions, according to an official statement on the parliament's website.

The Kyiv Independent team has introduced a long-requested feature — members can now pay for monthly or annual memberships using PayPal.

The call comes as Kyiv worries that a Babis-led government could undermine Czechia's pro-Ukraine stance, as he has questioned continued military aid and Ukraine's path toward EU membership.



Putin claimed that the missiles exploded a few meters away from the plane, which was then hit by fragments. He linked the incident to the sighting of a Ukrainian drone in the area.

""There is a significant risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will actually go to a world war,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The Kyiv Independent is proud to announce the U.S. premiere of its first full-length documentary, “Can You Hear Me? The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics,” hosted in collaboration with the Embassies of Sweden and Ukraine.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) denied on Oct. 9 media reporting suggesting it was investigating a possible involvement of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko in a criminal case.

According to four NATO officials, the goal is to raise the cost of Moscow's gray-zone operations and strengthen deterrence following a series of incursions by Russian drones and aircraft, the Financial Times reported.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Freeing him is about more than simple justice","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mikheil-saakashvili-georgia-putin/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Giuli Alasania is a professor of history, an advocate for democratic values in Georgia, and the mother of former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.

My son has been a political prisoner of Vladimir Putin's system for more than four years now. He is not being held in Russia, however, but in the very country he once led: the Republic of Georgia. He has been silenced and cut off from his people by a regime aligned with Moscow. 

This is not justice. It is persecution. And as his mother, I bear witness to these actions by both of my countries, as well as to his courage and his suffering.

For nearly a decade, Mikheil stood at the centre of Georgia's transformation. As president, he led one of the most ambitious anti-corruption campaigns in the post-Soviet world. He sought to rebuild the state on foundations of accountability, and like Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, he has championed sovereignty and democracy. 

My home, Georgia, will not become the next Ukraine.

Opinion: Canada should support Russian dissidents in their time of need

But Mikheil's sham trial and his detention is not about justice – it's about silencing Georgia's most visible opposition leader. Like Alexei Navalny, Mikheil has been marked for elimination. Yet his survival itself is resistance. My son's condition, his imprisonment, and his treatment are not just about one man: They are a measure of what kind of country Georgia will choose to become, and whether its allies still believe in its democratic promise.

This persecution is part of a wider authoritarian collapse. Under the leadership of oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream party has hollowed out institutions, silenced civil society, and rigged elections. But for 310 days, Georgians have filled the streets of the capital city of Tbilisi in protest – and last week, during sham local elections, their calls for freedom were met with batons, water cannons, and mass arrests. Citizens participating in peaceful demonstrations were beaten, journalists were silenced, and opposition leaders were dragged away. 

Mr. Saakashvili, centre, surrounded by bodyguards as he tries to leave a terminal upon his arrival at Boryspil Airport, outside Kyiv, May 29, 2019.Efrem Lukatsky/The Associated Press

As a mother, I cannot watch this brutality crush my son and an entire country's hopes. This is not democracy in decline; it is democracy under assault. 

In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. Today, revisionists dishonour the dead, fracture memory, and hand propaganda to the Kremlin. A country once hailed internationally as a democratic success story has fallen into the grips of the world's autocrats; sanctions against Moscow are being ignored; strategic projects are being handed to Beijing, and in the South Caucasus, this alignment has threatened both European and transatlantic security. 

Georgians cannot stand alone. The world must act.

Analysis: Truth will likely be the last casualty of war in Ukraine

The European Parliament has adopted resolutions that condemn Georgia's fraudulent elections and demand accountability. Now, the United States must do the same. Passing the Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence (MEGOBARI) Act, a package of sanctions and democracy-deepening measures introduced by bipartisan members of Congress and passed the House of Representatives in May, would send an unmistakable message that America stands with Georgians who believe in democracy. International sanctions must extend not only to Moscow, but to those in Tbilisi who carry out the Kremlin's agenda. And most urgently, political prisoners, including my son, must be freed. The international community must prove that it is truly a megobari – a friend – to Georgia.

This is not only about one man. It is about whether Georgia remains aligned with the free world, or slips fully into Moscow's grip – which will have consequences for the rest of the world.

I do not write as a politician or strategist. I write as a mother who has seen her son give everything but his life for his country. His courage deserves recognition, not erasure. His freedom would not only be a matter of personal justice; it is a test of whether the West still believes in the democratic promise of Georgia.

Georgians are watching. Russia is watching. History is watching. The time for hesitation has passed. The world must choose: stand with Georgia now and free Mikheil – or watch another democracy fall.

Chancellor Merz's coalition has agreed to place tight restrictions on welfare recipients and promote the purchase of German-made electric vehicles. The news came ahead of a major auto industry summit. DW has more.

Here are the latest headlines from across Germany on Thursday, October 9:

Police shot and wounded a man thought to be carrying a firearm in central Düsseldorf on Thursday. 

Police said the man was seen brandishing a weapon near a fast-food restaurant on a large commercial street. 

It was not clear if the weapon was real or a replica, police said, but the man did not heed orders to lay it on the ground. 

At that point, police opened fire, hitting the man at least once. He was treated by an emergency doctor at the scene and then taken to hospital injured. 

Police cordoned off a large are of the street amid the operation.

A glass of Glühwein, or mulled wine, at Germany's Christmas markets this year is liable to cost at least €5 (not including the deposit for the mug) this winter, according to a newspaper report on Thursday. 

The head of the German Federation of Wine Cellers, Peter Rotthaus, said in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper that he anticipated average prices to rise by at least 10% this year compared to 2024. 

Rotthaus named a number of reasons for this, but primarily he cited what appears to be a poor harvest year internationally for fruit wines. 

He also said that costs including freight, packaging, wages and energy all contributed to the rising prices. 

Rotthaus also said consumers should expect quite large regional variations in prices based on local conditions. His federation estimates that Germans and visiting tourists consume around 50 million liters of mulled wine in a bid to stay warm and lubricated at Christmas markets each winter.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has spoken out against the EU's current goal of phasing out new cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, only allowing the registration of new electric vehicles by that date. 

Merz was speaking at a summit with other German political leaders and leading representatives of the country's struggling car industry. 

""Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it, and I will do all I can to achieve this,"" Merz said in Berlin. 

Deputy Chancellor Lars Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrats and so the leading representative of Merz's junior coalition partner, had also signaled a willingness for changes to the plans.

In particular, he cited cars like plug-in hybrids, so-called range extenders (fuel-powered generators used to augment an electric motor and battery pack with a fraction of the fuel needed to power a traditional engine) and those using innovative fuel mixtures.

The EU set the target of registering no new fuel-powered cars as of 2035 in 2022. Many industry leaders have voiced doubts in the feasibility of the proposal, and some have even questioned its environmental credentials. The EU itself is now racing to review the policy proposal, perhaps with an eye to compromise.

Germany is scrambling to try to prop up its renowned car industry, which has been struggling with increased competition from China, decreased demand for cars in general in Europe, new barriers to trade in the US and China, and an array of other issues as well as the transition toward electric motoring. 

More than 50,000 jobs were lost in the car sector in Germany in 2024, a recent study found.

Germany's DAX index has hit a new all-time high, eclipsing the previous record level set this July. 

The benchmark index rose 0.5% to a high of 24,708.97 points during Thursday's trade.

The DAX has been buoyant so far in October, rising by roughly 3.5% during the month.

Factors including the potential reduction in tensions in the Middle East and hopes for a cut in interest rates in the US and possibly from the European Central Bank are thought to play a role.

However, the signals on trading floors remain mixed, at best. While western indices broadly continue their largely inexplicable and accelerated upward trend of recent years, renonwed ""safe haven"" investments like gold remain in extreme demand — which is usually a sign of low investor confidence.

Germans are booking significantly fewer trips to the United States this winter, according to the DRV travel association. The group predicted a 27% drop in sales for the November to April season.

Over the summer, bookings to the US had been about one-fifth lower than the previous year, DRV said.

Increasing costs may be a factor, as well as the fact that Germany updated its travel advisory for the US in March. The warning stated that a valid ESTA visa waiver was not a guarantee for entry into the United States after a string of high-profile detentions of ordinary Germans by US immigration authorities.

In contrast, the DRV reported that winter trips to Southeast Asia and Africa are expected to climb by 16% and 25%, respectively.  

Britta Hasselmann, parliamentary leader of the opposition Green party, slammed the government's planned reforms shortly after they were announced. Hasselmann called the proposals ""cold-hearted and inhumane"" as well as ""unconstitutional.""

""The CDU and SPD want to take away everything people need to live,"" Hasselmann told the German news agency dpa, saying the reforms take away money for food and housing, including from families with children.

""It would also be unconstitutional,"" she said, because the state has ""a responsibility and a welfare state that provides for a sociocultural minimum standard of living.""

Those on the right, however, celebrated the news. Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, hailed that a form of basic income for welfare recipients was ""history.""

There was also criticism launched at the SPD for abandoning its dedication to a robust social welfare state, but party leadership seemed to have little time for nay-sayers, particularly from the SPD's left flank.

""We are tightening sanctions to the limit of what is constitutionally permissible,"" Minister for Labor and Social Affairs Bärbel Bas of the SPD said.

Germany's governing coalition presented their final agreement for package of reforms that has been heavily touted by Chancellor Merz for months.

The marathon discussions lasted most of Wednesday and well into the night, amid claims there has been significant opposition to many of Merz's plans from the more left-leaning members of junior coalition partner the SPD.

However, the parties showed a united front on Thursday morning, announcing tigher restrictions on social welfare payments, changes to the pension system, and new subsidies for electric vehicles in response to competition from China.

""We will significantly strengthen obligations to cooperate and we will also significantly increase the possibilities for sanctions,"" Merz said of the changes to the German welfare system.

A senior Hamas official has rejected Donald Trump's proposal for a transitional “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's post-war administration.

Under the US president's plan, the board would be headed by Mr Trump and Sir Tony Blair, the former prime minister.

Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official who has been involved in previous negotiations between the terror group and the US, said that no Palestinian faction would accept such a plan.

“All the factions, including the Palestinian Authority, reject this,” he told Qatar's Al Araby television network on Thursday.

Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza that will allow for the release of the remaining hostages held inside the Strip, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.

But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, unveiled on Sept 29, also called for post-war Gaza to be governed by a transitional authority headed by himself alongside Sir Tony.

Mr Trump did not address the Hamas spokesman's concerns during his live-streamed cabinet meeting on Thursday. Instead, he said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.

“There will be disarming,” Mr Trump said, adding that Israeli forces would also conduct “pullbacks”.

He was non-committal when asked about a two-state solution, saying he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on. “I don't have a view. I'm going to go with what they agreed to,” he said. 

On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.”

In a speech to the Palestinian public, Khalil al-Hayya, the exiled leader of Hamas, said Israel and Hamas had “reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people.”

He also said Hamas had received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza had permanently ended.

Details of the hostage and prisoner releases also emerged on Thursday. Israel outlined a multi-step process beginning with the IDF pulling its forces back, once its cabinet had formally approved the plan.

After it withdraws to an agreed line – leaving Israel in control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip – Hamas will be required to release the 48 hostages it is holding within 72 hours.

The process will begin with the 20 believed to be alive. The hostages will be handed to the Red Cross, which will transfer them to IDF troops within Gaza. The soldiers will then escort them to the Re'im military base near the border, where their families will be waiting.

Those needing urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation.

The release of Palestinian prisoners will take place only after the initial 72-hour period, during which Hamas is to release all Israeli hostages.

If any of the dead hostages remain in Gaza, a different, “classified” response will take effect, according to a draft of the deal seen by Channel 12. Israel is already anticipating that Hamas may be unable to locate all of the remains.

Hamas has previously said it did not know where the remains of all of the dead hostages were. 

Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt announced on Thursday that they would take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations were unknown.

Thank you for following our live coverage of negotiations over peace in Gaza, and of Trump declaring peace in the Middle East. 

Palestinian media, citing the Hamas-run Gaza Civil Defence agency, has reported that an Israeli strike in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood has trapped some 40 people under rubble.

The agency said that the bodies of four were recovered from the building that was targeted, “and more than 40 people are still under the rubble.”

Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir warned on Thursday that his Jewish Power party would push to topple prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government unless Hamas is ultimately dismantled.

“If the Hamas government is not dismantled, or if they only tell us that it is dismantled while in reality it continues to exist under a different guise – Jewish Power will dismantle the government,” Mr Ben-Gvir said.

Israel's security cabinet meeting to approve the ceasefire and hostage-release phase of the US plan has concluded, The Times of Israel has reported.

The full cabinet will now convene to vote on – and if successful ratify – the deal.

Exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said on Thursday the group has received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza has permanently ended.

He said that Israel and Hamas had “reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people” and that he had received confirmation that the initial ceasefire would lead to a sustained ceasefire.

The United Nations plans to ramp up its delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza in the first 60 days of a ceasefire in the enclave, a top UN official said on Thursday.

“We will aim to increase the pipeline of supplies to hundreds of trucks every day. We will scale up the provision of food across Gaza to reach 2.1 million people who need food aid and around 500,000 people who need nutrition,” said Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.

“Famine must be reverted in areas where it has taken hold and prevented in others,” he added.

The draft ceasefire deal being reviewed by Israel's security cabinet includes the names of 20 living hostages and 28 bodies to be released from Gaza, Channel 12 reports.

The fact that it includes 28 bodies implies that two hostages have died who have not been officially declared dead.

Israel had previously expressed “grave concern” over the health of three hostages through to be alive, said to be Israeli hostage Tamir Nimrodi, Nepali hostage Bipin Joshi and Thai hostage Pinta Nattapong, according to The Times of Israel.

 

Donald Trump has said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.

“I don't have a view. I'm going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters at a meeting of his Cabinet. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.”

Donald Trump said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.

“I'm not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But... there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces.

Donald Trump has said he has agreed to speak to the Israeli Knesset and will do so if requested by officials there.

“They asked me to speak at the Knesset and ... I've agreed to if they would like me to,” Mr Trump told reporters as he met his Cabinet at the White House.

Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby that Hamas rejects Donald Trump's proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's administration, headed by the US president himself.

Israel and Hamas have agreed a ceasefire deal to free hostages held in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails following indirect negotiations in Egypt.

But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, on which the indirect negotiations were based, also calls for post-war Gaza to be ruled by a transitional authority governed by a board headed by Mr Trump.

“No Palestinian would accept this. All the factions, including the Palestinian Authority, reject this,” Mr Hamdan told Al Araby Television Network.

Donald Trump said he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

“I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there, and we're working on the timing, the exact timing,” Mr Trump said.

Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told his US counterpart Donald Trump in a phone call that he “deserves the Nobel Peace Prize” for bringing about a deal to end the war in Gaza.

He invited Trump to “participate in the celebration to be held in Egypt to mark the conclusion of the agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, the first phase of which has been signed during talks in Egypt.

The statement from Sisi's office said the president “stressed the need to move forward toward implementing the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip in all its stages”.

Donald Trump says the US will work with Iran so it can “rebuild” its country.

“We will work with Iran, as you know we have major sanctions on Iran, we would like to see them rebuild their country too, but we they can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said.

He said that Tehran acknowledged that it is in favour of the Israel and Hamas peace deal. 

Donald Trump has said the Hamas-held hostages should be returned on Monday or Tuesday

“I'm going to try make a trip over,” he said. “It will be a day of joy.”

Israel has released details of its hostage handover plan, outlining a multi-step process under the new Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas.

If the deal is approved in today's cabinet meeting, a ceasefire is expected to take hold within 24 hours.

The IDF will pull back its forces to an agreed upon line which will see it retain control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the plan.

Hamas is to release the 48 hostages it is holding – beginning with the 20 believed to be alive – within 72 hours of Israel's troop withdrawal, as outlined by the US-brokered agreement.

They will be passed to the Red Cross who will transfer them to IDF troops within Gaza. The soldiers will then escort them to the Re'im military base near the border, where their families are waiting for them.

Hostages requiring urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation.

Israel's security cabinet meeting – which is being held ahead of the full cabinet meeting to vote on the peace deal – has started after an unexplained delay of an hour and a half.

Israel's Channel 12 has reported that the delay was in part caused by ongoing discussions regarding the list of Palestinian security prisoners to be released.

Donald Trump was due to hold a cabinet meeting at 4pm UK time following the signing of a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but it is currently delayed. We will bring you more updates as we have them. 

The bodies of Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammad, which were reportedly requested by Hamas as part of a hostage release agreement, will not be included in the deal, an Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN on Thursday. 

Benjamin Netanyahu's three core goals have been achieved, his spokesperson has said.

“We have hit a critical point in this war,” said Shosh Bedrosian, the prime minister's office spokesperson. “From day one in this war, the prime minister laid out three objectives – the return of all of our hostages, the defeat and dismantling of Hamas and ensuring Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.”

“All of the prime minister's objectives have now been achieved,” she said.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu held an “emotional” phone call after the first stage of a peace deal was announced between Israel and Hamas.

The US-brokered agreement, signed this morning in Egypt, will lead to a pause in the fighting, the release of all 20 living hostages together and an Israeli military withdrawal from the majority of Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister thanked the US president “for his global leadership to make all this possible” in a call this morning, said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.

“It was a very emotional and a warm conversation as both leaders congratulated each other on this historic achievement,” she added.

Mr Netanyahu called the deal “a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel”. Gideon S'aar, Israel's foreign minister, said Israel has an interest in “expanding the circle of peace” and normalisation in the Middle East.

Iran called on the international community to prevent Israel from violating its obligations in Gaza, its foreign ministry said in a statement, after Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed an agreement to cease fire.

The foreign ministry said Tehran supports any effort that ends the “genocide” and the war in Gaza.

“All of our hostages, the living and deceased, will be released 72 hours later, which will bring us to Monday,” said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.

“Israel is preparing to receive our hostages in all conditions they may be in.”

The UK Foreign Secretary will travel to Paris today to meet ministers from Europe, as well as from Qatar and Turkey, to discuss the next steps of Donald Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan.

The Telegraph understands that Yvette Cooper will take part in meetings with allies to discuss the implementation of the peace plan's first phase, as well as how the second phrase, focused on ending the suffering in Gaza, will be achieved.

The Foreign Secretary will hold meetings with counterparts from France and Germany alongside ministers from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and Spain to discuss building consensus on governance of Gaza after the conflict. 

The high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti will not be exchanged as part of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, Israel has announced.

Asked about rumours of his possible release, a government spokeswoman said: “I can tell you at this point in time that he will not be part of this release.”

Barghouti - from Hamas's rival, the Fatah movement - was among the Palestinian prisoners Hamas wanted to see released as part of the Gaza deal.

Imprisoned since 2002, Barghouti, 66, has been nicknamed the “Palestinian Mandela”, his popularity amongst Palestinians has not wavered and he he is widely considered the only man capable of uniting disparate political factions. 

Israel considers him as one of the masterminds behind a wave of bombings in Israel between 2000-2002 during the second Intifada – which he has always denied. He was convicted of multiple murders and given five life sentences. 

If released, he could challenge Mahmoud Abbas, 89, the long-standing head of the Palestinian Authority and potentially mend the longstanding rift between the Fatah movement and Hamas.

The first phase of a Gaza peace plan “would not have happened without President Trump's leadership”, Sir Keir Starmer said on a visit to India.

Asked whether the US president deserves the Nobel Peace Prize at a press conference in Mumbai, the Prime Minister said: “This is a very significant step forward and it would not have happened without President Trump's leadership on this.

“And I want to be really clear about that and I say that from the informed position of the UK having played a part behind the scenes in this with the US and with the mediators.

“What matters now is to press on and implement this.”

Israel has announced that the ceasefire in Gaza will go into effect “within 24 hours” of the cabinet meeting to approve the deal.

Earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the ceasefire would come into effect this evening after the deal is ratified in a meeting at 3pm BST.

The update suggests Israel might be trying to extend the deadline to start the ceasefire.

After the 24 hours finishes, the 72 hour countdown for the hostages to be released will begin, a spokeswoman for the government said.

Turkey will take part in efforts to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire in Gaza agreed by Israel and Hamas, president Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.

“God willing, we as Turkey will take part in the mission force that will monitor the agreement's implementation in the field,” he said, adding that Turkey will contribute to the reconstruction of Gaza.

Lebanon has arrested 32 people in recent months on suspicion of providing Israel with information on Hezbollah that facilitated strikes on the Iran-backed militant group, a judicial official told AFP on Thursday.

More than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah – including two months of open war – saw Israel batter the group's arsenal and kill a slew of senior commanders, and it has kept up strikes since a November truce.

Requesting anonymity, the official said that “at least 32 people have been arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, six of them before the ceasefire”.

So far, “nine people have been tried by the military court”, while 23 are still under investigation, the official added.

Lebanon remains technically at war with Israel and any contact is punishable with imprisonment.

A senior Hamas official has said that disagreements over what Palestinian prisoners Israel will release are threatening to derail the deal.

“It seems Netanyahu is trying to sabotage the ceasefire agreement before its implementation, by reneging on prisoner release lists in an attempt to derail the understandings,” wrote Mahmoud Mardawi on X.

MPs from both sides of the Commons have warmly welcomed the deal.

Jack Rankin, a Tory frontbencher who was twinned with hostage Avinatan Or as part of a campaigning push last year, said: “The news that Avinatan and the rest of the hostages will be returning home after two years in Hamas captivity brings long-awaited relief.

“I am thrilled that Avinatan will soon be reunited with his partner Noa, his mother Ditza, and his entire family. The suffering endured by the hostages and their loved ones has been unimaginable. Until every last one is safely home, we remain firmly committed to advocating for their release.”

Luke Akehurst, a Labour MP, added: “I'm overwhelmed with relief that the remaining Israeli hostages, including Evyatar David whose family I have met, are finally coming home two years after the horrors of 7 October 2023.

“Their suffering has been appalling and the steadfast campaigning by their families and friends has been essential to ensuring their plight was not forgotten.”

It's interesting to read the latest social media post from Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister.

His lengthy message carries a tone of finality – that the war which started on October 7th is at an end.

Mr Saar praises Benjamin Netanyahu for showing “steadfastness in achieving all the war's objectives.”

He describes the war in the past tense, adding: “It is good for Israel that in these days of conflict, he [Netanyahu] is the one who led it.”

He also discusses the potential of new normalisation agreements and deals to “expand the circle of peace” in the region.

This would suggest that Mr Trump's reported pledge to block Israel re-starting the war after the release of the hostages has been accepted, or at least acknowledged, by the upper echelons of the Israeli government.

It bodes well for the next stages of the peace deal – and the release of the hostages. Hamas is only likely to fulfil the demands placed on it if it believes Israel will not simply return to battle once the first phase is over. 

Around a dozen pro-Palestine gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday morning, writes Emily Smith.

The Court of Appeal will hear a legal challenge today, brought by Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO, arguing that it is illegal for the UK to continue licensing F-35 parts that can be accessed by Israel.

The High Court ruled in June that the issue was for Parliament and not the courts to decide.

The protestors held signs reading, “stop arming Israel, stop the genocide” and “let aid into all of Gaza now”.

Banging drums and waving flags they chanted, “David Lammy shame on you your hands are bloody too”, “Keir Starmer be afraid, Tony Blair go to hell”, and “UK Government you can't hide, UK Government pick a side”.

In September last year, the Government suspended export licences for weapons and military equipment over the risk that UK arms could be used in serious violations of humanitarian law.

Outside the court, a woman who gave her name as Serena told The Telegraph that she would “absolutely not” stop protesting following the ceasefire.

“Of course we will continue,” she said. “Justice for Palestine. An end to apartheid.”

Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt will take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations are unknown.

There are 48 remaining hostages, 28 of whom are believed to be dead. 

Hamas must release their bodies to Israel under the terms of the new ceasefire deal.

Hostage families and campaigners including a former Hamas detainee have welcomed the landmark agreement reached between Israel and Hamas.

Adam Ma'anit, whose cousin Tsachi was kidnapped on Oct 7 and later killed by Hamas, added: “The news that a deal has finally been reached to bring home the remaining 48 hostages is what we have been hoping and fighting for throughout these painful two years.

“It's impossible to describe the mix of relief and heartbreak we feel – relief that they may at last come home, and heartbreak that for some, it will be for burial [...] We couldn't bring my cousin Tsachi home alive, so this is a bittersweet day for our family. But the hostage families have become part of our extended family – their joy is our joy, and their pain is our pain.”

Ada Sagi, a peace activist held by Hamas for more than 50 days, and Noam Sagi, her son, said: “This is an extraordinary day and our hearts are racing to welcome them home.

“We will envelope them with love, with the warmth they've been denied for too long. Trump has shown that the impossible can be made possible”.

At last a breakthrough – though as even Donald Trump conceded, these are but “the first steps”.

The significance of the moment should not be underplayed. Barring any unforeseen complications, there will be no Israeli hostages left in Gaza by early next week. Aid will be allowed into the shattered territory in meaningful quantities. The guns will fall silent.

No wonder they were dancing in the dead of night along Gaza's rubble-strewn streets and on Tel Aviv's Hostages Square. After two years and two days of appalling carnage, first in Israel's kibbutzim and later across the length of Gaza, there is at last cause for genuine hope.

For Hamas, the future is bleak. Once the hostages are released, it will have lost its final leverage over Israel.

A movement that has brought terror to Israel and misery to its own people for decades really now faces only two options: it can declare its own extinction as a meaningful fighting force – preserving an element of dignity and the hope of reinventing itself as a solely political entity – or it can have extinction thrust upon it.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews expressed its “deep appreciation” of President Trump and the families of the hostages, declaring: “It is time for peace”.

Phil Rosenberg, the president of the Board of Deputies, said that the news overnight offered hope of peace for the first time since the Oct 7 massacre.

He said: “The overnight news of an agreement to bring an end to the nightmare unleashed by Hamas on 7 October means that for the first time in two years, we can dare to hope for the release of all the hostages, and the conclusion of this terrible war.

“We convey our deep appreciation to President Trump, the mediators and, most of all, the indefatigable campaigning of the hostage families whose courage, resilience and determination has been a beacon to the world.

“We will celebrate the return of those living and praying for their swift recovery and care, and  we will mourn the returning dead, thinking of their loved ones in their time of grief. It is time for healing. It is time for peace.”

Thousands of jubilant Israelis gathered in what has become known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where for two years, families of the hostages have gathered, hoped and prayed for the return of their loved ones.

Many wore stickers reading “They're coming back”, waving Israeli and US flags and clutching photos of the captives. 

One Israeli woman, Yael Cherni, told The Telegraph:“You must understand this is the first day in two years that I can breathe and the air actually gets into my lungs. We have been waiting to be rescued by someone. That someone is apparently Donald Trump.”

She continued: “So we are really praising this day. I have full faith in Trump and the deal he made which is incredibly wise. I have some doubt about whether all the 48 hostages will come out, that's what scares me most. Not necessarily because Hamas will make it harder but maybe because it will be impossible to find them all. But I hope and pray that we will see them here as soon as possible.”

The office of Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that an agreement to secure the release of hostages in Gaza will take effect only after receiving cabinet approval.

“Contrary to Arab media reports, the 72-hour countdown will begin only after the agreement is approved in the cabinet meeting, which is expected in the evening hours,” Mr Netanyahu's office said.

An Israeli official confirmed to The Telegraph that the cabinet is meeting at 5pm local time (3pm GMT) to discuss and vote on the peace plan.

Once approved, the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners is then set to occur within 72 hours.

Israeli hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released by Monday as part of the first stage of a peace deal.

Under the terms of Donald Trump's 20-point plan, the 20 surviving hostages held by Hamas since the Oct 7 massacre will be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. The terror group will also return 28 bodies.

In a call to the remaining captives' families on Wednesday night, the US president told them: “The hostages will come back, they're all coming back on Monday.”

Under the terms of the deal signed at midday Israel time (10am BST), the hostages must be released within 72 hours, however its unclear exactly when this will take place.

An Israeli official told Reuters that 20 hostages are expected to be released Sunday or Monday.Mr Trump, who signalled he planned to fly to the region as soon as this weekend, hailed the “historic and unprecedented event” as the first step towards peace in the Middle East.Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday expressed his “profound relief” for the hostages and for the population of Gaza who have “endured unimaginable suffering” and called on both sides to keep their promises.

The first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas has been signed, paving the way for nearly two years of war to end.

Nigel Farage hailed Donald Trump's “great achievement” in the Middle East.

The Reform UK leader, who has been a personal friend of Mr Trump for almost a decade, said: “Huge congratulations to President Trump and his team.

“Real progress between Israel and Hamas is a great achievement.”

Mr Farage opposed British recognition of Palestinian statehood last month and refused to rule out “de-recognising” Palestine.

The UK “stands ready to play our part” in implementing the Gaza peace plan, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said.

Britain will help realise not just the initial phase of the plan to end fighting in Gaza, she said, “but also on the crucial work going forward now on phase two as well”.

Speaking to reporters at Hillsborough Castle, she said: “Because that work will continue as nations across the world come together to support a just and lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

“We have seen some of the images of relief and hope on the streets of Gaza and on the streets of Israel overnight, and all nations will want to make sure that that is turned into reality.”

With Donald Trump's hostage deal announcement comes hope of a permanent end to the bloodshed in Gaza and agony in Israel. But many questions remain.

Can Hamas trust the US to prevent Israel restarting the war if they hand over all the hostages? Can they trust the IDF to withdraw in the agreed manner? And can Israel trust Hamas to disarm?

There are still ways this deal could fall through. Israeli negotiators are still working through the list of prisoners Hamas want released, which could include major terrorists with lots of Israeli blood on their hands.

There are also longer-term unresolved issues, including the disarmament and the IDF's withdrawal timetable from Gaza.

And yet, at this moment, battle-hardened Israeli troops are preparing to relinquish territory their colleagues died to capture only a few days ago.

Most ordinary Gazans and a majority of Israelis have craved peace for some time. It seems Mr Trump has now managed to convince the remainder that they want it too.

UN

Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, called for all hostages to be released “in a dignified manner” and for a permanent ceasefire to be secured. “The fighting must stop once and for all,” he said.

Palestine

Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, said he hoped that the deal “would be a prelude to reaching a permanent political solution”, leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

EU

Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, called the deal “a major diplomatic accomplishment”, which was “a real chance” to end the conflict and release the hostages.

Germany

Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor, said the developments were “encouraging” and he was “confident” of a solution this week.

Spain

Pedro Sanchez, Spain's prime minister and one of Europe's most vocal critics of Israel's offensive in Gaza, said the civilian population should now be supported and “the atrocities experienced... never repeated.”

France

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the agreement “must mark the end of the war” and would pave the way for a “political solution”.

Italy

Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, called the deal “extraordinary news” and urged “all parties ot respect the measures already agreed upon”. 

China

Beijing hopes for a “permanent and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, its foreign ministry said, adding that China's position is that Palestinians should govern the territory in the future. 

Israel's ultranationalist finance minister said he opposed the Gaza ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas and insisted he would vote against it. 

Bezalel Smotrich said: “There is immense fear of the consequences of emptying the prisons and releasing the next generation of terrorist leaders who will do everything to continue to pour rivers of Jewish blood here, God forbid.”

“For this reason alone, we cannot join in short-sighted celebrations or vote in favour of the deal,” he added. 

Mr Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist party, has opposed previous deals and insisted the war must continue until Hamas is annihilated.

Meanwhile, Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, welcomed the deal, calling on Donald Trump to speak at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.

“There is nothing more fitting, more symbolic, more moving than a speech by President Trump in Hostages Square with the return home of our hostages. It would be a historic moment. I congratulate the families on the initiative,” Mr Lapid tweeted. 

A Cabinet minister has insisted Gaza must be run by Palestinians in the long run.

Pat McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told Sky News that neither Hamas nor the Israeli government should be in charge of the region.

He told Sky News: “Israel will be clear that Hamas can't run Gaza in the future but it shouldn't be a permanent Israeli-run area either.

“So it has to be in the long term run by Palestinians. In the meantime something will be put together to stabilise, begin to get the rebuilding effort going, and in the long term run by the Palestinians themselves.“That's the exciting prospect here. And it's a prospect that hasn't existed in a long, long time.”

Israeli strikes on Gaza continued overnight and into the morning.

Smoke can be seen billowing above the war-shattered coastal enclave while both Gazans and Israelis celebrate the news that the first stage of a peace had been agreed.

As we reported earlier, a ceasefire is expected to come into effect after the deal is signed at 10am BST.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, expressed satisfaction Thursday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire in Gaza and thanked Donald Trump's efforts to end the war.

“I am greatly pleased that the Hamas-Israel talks... have resulted in a ceasefire in Gaza, I especially thank US President, Mr. Trump, who demonstrated the necessary political will to encourage the Israeli government toward the ceasefire,” Mr Erdogan said in a statement.

Turkey, which has been closely involved in the negotiations and sent a team to the talks in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, would “closely monitor the strict implementation of the agreement”, he added.

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Antifa violence in Left-wing cities, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a note.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly”.

A photographer captured the text with a long lens.

“Very close,” read the scrawl, those first two words underlined. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform.

The Israeli military said Thursday it was preparing to pull back troops in Gaza after Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal to free the remaining hostages.

“The IDF has begun operational preparations ahead of the implementation of the agreement. As part of this process, preparations and a combat protocol are underway to transition to adjusted deployment lines soon,” the military said in a statement.

If phase one of the deal is approved by the Israeli government today, a ceasefire would immediately take effect and Israeli troops would withdraw to an agreed upon line – what the IDF referred to as “adjusted deployment lines”.

A senior Cabinet minister said the British Government had “more hope this morning than we've had for a long time”.Pat McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told Times Radio: “We're very hopeful and I think that's a good word to use. If this holds and if this lasts it will be an enormous moment for the world.“It would mean in the short term that the hostages, those alive and those dead would be released, it would also hopefully mean much more aid getting into Gaza to help the people there and in the longer term and this is probably the greatest prize of all a more stable future for Israel for Palestine and for the whole region.“So of course people are tentative, people want to see exactly what will happen, but I think we've got more hope this morning than we've had for a long time.”Asked if Donald Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr McFadden replied: “Well he will deserve credit. Nobel Prizes are a matter for the Nobel committee but he will deserve credit.”

Israel's minister for diaspora affairs has expressed cautious optimism towards the deal. 

Amichai Chikli told The Telegraph: “We have to wait and learn the details. I still don't know what to think. Overall it looks good.”

Israel's security cabinet and government meetings to approve the first stage of the Gaza deal have been pushed back by two hours.

A source briefed on the details of the agreement told Reuters the meetings would take place at 5pm Israel time (3pm BST).

A ceasefire is expected to come into effect in Gaza once the first stage of the US-led peace deal is signed, a source briefed on the details said.

The signing should take place at 12pm Israel time (10am BST), the source told Reuters.

Israel's military will then finish its partial withdrawal from Gaza within the first 24 hours.

Palestinians living in Gaza expressed hope the deal between Israel and Hamas would end the war.

“All of the Gaza Strip is happy,” Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo told Reuters.

Another resident, Wael Radwan, credited Donald Trump and thanked “anyone who contributed even if verbally to stop the war and to stop the bloodshed”.

Khaled Shaa told Reuters it was an “historic” and “long-awaited” moment after years of bloodshed.

The Prime Minister has welcomed the news that Hamas and Israel agreed to the first stage of the peace plan. 

Sir Keir Starmer said it was “a moment of profound relief” that would be “felt all around the world” and particularly by “hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years”. 

“I am grateful for the tireless diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and the United States, supported by our regional partners, in securing this crucial first step,” Sir Keir said.

“This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza.

“We call on all parties to meet the commitments they have made, to end the war, and to build the foundations for a just and lasting end to the conflict and a sustainable path to a long-term peace. 

“The UK will support these crucial immediate steps and the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan.”

The IDF has told displaced Palestinians that it would be “extremely dangerous” to return to Gaza City.  

Avichay Adraee, the force's Arab spokesman, wrote on X: 

“The area north of Wadi Gaza [the river valley] is still considered a dangerous combat zone.

“IDF forces continue to surround Gaza City, and returning to it is extremely dangerous.

“For your own safety, refrain from returning north or approaching areas where IDF forces are deployed and operating throughout the Gaza Strip, including in the south and east, until official instructions are issued.”

Israeli soldiers have been told “to prepare with strong defence and to be ready for any scenario”.

“The forces' preparations will be carried out in accordance with the directives of the political echelon and the stages of the agreement, with responsibility and safeguarding the security of our soldiers,” the Israeli Defence Forces said in a statement.

“At the same time, the Chief of the General Staff instructed to prepare for leading the operation to retrieve the hostages, expected to be carried out with sensitivity and professionalism.”

It also said the IDF “will continue to act to achieve the war's objectives and to defend the citizens of the State of Israel on all fronts.”

Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, welcomed the peace deal announcement and called on all parties to “abide fully” by its terms.

“All hostages must be released in a dignified manner,” Mr Guterres said. 

“A permanent ceasefire must be secured. The fighting must stop once and for all.”

He stressed that the immediate and unimpeded entry of humanitarian supplies into the war-ravaged territory “must be ensured”.

The war in Gaza finally looks as if it is coming to an end.

Israel and Hamas agreed on terms for a ceasefire and the release of hostages last night, the first part of Donald Trump's 20 point plan for peace.In the 72 hours from the point at which the deal is formally signed – expected at around midday Thursday – all the surviving Israeli hostages held in Gaza, thought to number 20, should be released, together with the bodies of others who have perished.Israel will then start to release 250 convicted Palestinians held in Israeli jails, together with more than 1,000 others arrested and held since the Oct 7 massacre. At the same time Israeli troops will start to pull back.The agreement – of which this is just the first part – is a major breakthrough and one that Trump has every right to be proud of.It should almost immediately end the bloodshed in Gaza – which has been running to dozens of deaths a day – and see a return of hostages who have lived through hell.It should also allow aid to start flooding into the strip, bringing desperately needed relief to the two million people sheltering amid the rubble there; people who are desperate for food, water, and medicine.In the longer term, the deal should result in: a permanent end to the war, the disarmament of Hamas, the complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, the rebuilding of the enclave under Palestinian authority and – eventually – new talks on Palestinian “self-determination and statehood”.It is Trump's personal guarantee that Israel will not be allowed to continue the fighting after its hostages have been released that has made the difference.Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and other Arab states have clearly come to believe Trump's promise is genuine, and have seemingly convinced Hamas of that too.

Some of the relatives of the hostages held by Hamas in besieged Gaza are celebrating news that their loved ones could be returning home this week.

Maccabit Meir, whose nephews Gali and Ziv Berman have been in captivity since the Oct 7 2023 attacks on Israel, said “there is no happiness like this”.

“We were so afraid, and now I'm crying tears of happiness, not tears of fear,” she said in an interview with Israeli television.

Merav Gilboa-Dalal, the mother of hostage Guy Gilboa-Dalal, said her main concern was that her son would return healthy.

“That's what I wish for all of us,” she told Israeli media.

“And the experiences that they will have afterward will be amazing. Because we got him back again, a gift.”

It is believed that 20 of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza are alive. 

The White House posted on X: “ALL hostages to be released very soon!”

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had a “very warm and emotional” conversation with Donald Trump, his office said.

Mr Netanyahu also invited Mr Trump to address the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem.

During a phone call on Wednesday, the leaders discussed the signing of the peace deal and “congratulated each other on the historic achievement”.

“The prime minister thanked President Trump for all his efforts and global leadership, and President Trump congratulated the Prime Minister on his determined leadership and the actions he led,” Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement.

Donald Trump is reportedly planning to visit Israel on Sunday. 

Israeli TV station Channel 12 confirmed the president's travel plans shortly after the announcement that Hamas had agreed to the first phase of the peace deal . 

Earlier, the president said he would visit the Middle East. 

Under Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, Hamas would have to disarm, relinquish power and release its remaining hostages. 

You can read the full details, and the potential sticking points before a final peace deal can be struck, here.

Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed a “national and moral victory” for Israel after striking the “first phase” of a peace deal with Hamas.

The Israeli government will have to approve the agreement before Hamas releases its hostage, a US official told Axios.

“From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals are achieved,” Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement.

With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home. This is a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel.From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals…

“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point.

“I thank President Trump for his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages.”

A US official told Axios the first hostages would be released “72 hours” after the Israeli cabinet approves the Hamas deal.

With Benjamin Netanyahu convening his government on Thursday, it suggests the first hostage handover will not take place until Sunday at the earliest.

“The release is expected to happen by Monday,” the source added.

Donald Trump reportedly reviewed his Truth Social post announcing the agreement between Hamas and Israeli with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, before publishing it.

According to CNN, the US president had been on the phone in the Oval Office since he cut short a roundtable elsewhere in the White House earlier on Wednesday.

When it came, the announcement could not have been a better illustration of how this White House works.

The news was delivered not with a press conference or a sombre Oval Office address. It was done with a post on the president's own Truth Social media platform.

And not just that. It was a post that had been trailed on live television. An AP photographer caught the text of a note handed to the president by Marco Rubio, Secretary of State.

“You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”

Hamas has called on Donald Trump to ensure Israel enacts their agreement without delay.

The terror group said the US president and other mediating countries, in Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, should compel it to “fully implement the agreement's requirements and not allow it to evade or delay the implementation of what has been agreed upon”.

Hamas said it agreed to the “first phase” proposal to end “the war of extermination against our Palestinian people and the occupation's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip”.

Benjamin Netanyahu, hailing a “great deal for Israel”, has said he will summon his government to approve the deal with Hamas on Thursday.

“Tomorrow I will convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home,” the Israeli prime minister wrote on social media.

“I thank the heroic soldiers of the IDF and all the security forces, thanks to whose courage and sacrifice we have reached this day.”

He also praised “from the depths of my heart” Donald Trump and his team for embarking on “this sacred mission of releasing our hostages”.

“With the help of the Almighty, together we will continue to achieve all our goals and expand peace with our neighbours,” he continued.

Some issues still appear to be unresolved following the US president's announcement that Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his 20-point peace plan.

Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the agreement signalled “the first steps towards a strong, durable and everlasting peace”.

However, some thorny issues remain.

Hamas has previously said it won't disarm until a Palestinian state is recognised, and the terror group will be reluctant to disarm until a clearer picture of an independent Gaza emerges, if at all.

The governance of the region is also a sticking point. Mr Trump's plan said an independent Palestinian police force would oversee the region, helped by the president's International Stabilisation Force (ISF).

Not only will this be arduous, it's not clear if all sides will agree.

In the plan, Hamas will “agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form”.

Yet when responding, the group said that Mr Trump's plans for the future of the Strip could only be discussed by a “comprehensive Palestinian national framework” that should include the group.

Israeli hostages will be released on either Saturday or Sunday, a source has told CNN. Earlier on Wednesday, Donald Trump suggested he would travel to the Middle East on Sunday.

Details about the agreement struck between Hamas and Israel will be revealed later, a senior Qatari official has said.

Majed al-Ansari, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, said: “An agreement was reached on all the provisions and implementation mechanisms of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.”

“The details will be announced later,” he added.

In his statement announcing Israel and Hamas' “first steps” towards peace, Donald Trump did not clarify potential sticking points in his proposed peace plan, which include Hamas disarming and leaving power.

Negotiators have been meeting in Egypt for days to hash out Donald Trump's peace plan.

Wednesday began with leaks that Hamas was making difficult demands, including the return of the bodies of symbolic figures such as Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed, both former leaders of the terror group.

But by nightfall, the Times of Israel reported Arab sources as saying that mediators were planning an agreement that would entail an “immediate” release of hostages.

Wednesday's announcement by President Donald Trump marks a major step towards peace in Gaza. It represents a breakthrough on the path towards Mr Trump's ambitious but deliberately vague 20-point plan to end decades of unrest.

It will bring home the hostages in exchange for prisoner releases.

But in so doing it uncouples one of the key elements of the plan, linking together an immediate ceasefire with a plan for stabilising and rebuilding Gaza, and creating conditions that could open a path towards a Palestinian state.

Already Hamas has called for international guarantees to hold Israel to its part of the deal.

This is A deal, and should be celebrated. But it is far from THE deal.

Donald Trump has hailed the “first step” towards peace in the Middle East following negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week. Saying Hamas would release all of its Israeli hostages, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform:

Israeli forces have agreed to withdraw troops to an agreed upon line, Donald Trump has said.

In Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, a map showed lines that forces were expected to retreat to at various stages.

The first withdrawal, along with a hostage release, is depicted in purple.

It would mean the IDF withdrawing from Gaza City and other key strongholds, where Hamas is under heavy assault.

Donald Trump, assuming the role of peace-maker-in-chief, was the first to announce the breakthrough.

“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Earlier, Marco Rubio handed a note to the US president during a press conference asking him to urgently approve the social post so he could be the first to announce the deal.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce the deal first,” the note read.

On Wednesday, the US president said that he is considering travelling to the Middle East.

Mr Trump said: “I think I'll probably go maybe before the hostages are released, or shortly thereafter, pretty much, shortly thereafter.”

“My greatest wish now is for real safety to return — for no more people to die here,” one Palestinian said.

Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal to bring about a temporary pause to Israel's genocidal slaughter in Gaza and the release of Israeli and Palestinian captives, officials have announced.

The deal was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social Wednesday evening, after he first unveiled a heavily criticized 20-point plan to “end the Gaza Conflict” last week. Both the Israeli government and Hamas have confirmed that they agreed to the deal.

Palestinians rejoiced upon the announcement of the news. Videos posted online showed Palestinians celebrating in the streets and children dancing in reaction, celebrating a rare moment of relief amid two years of genocide.

Truthout contacted several of its regular contributors from Gaza to gather their reactions to the announcement.

“Here in the middle of the Gaza Strip, where I live among many displaced families, the atmosphere today feels different. Since morning, children have been running through the streets, smiling and celebrating. We heard fireworks bursting across the neighborhood in joy,” Ghada Eyad told Truthout.

“Prices are starting to drop, and everyone hopes the deal will succeed. Our only fear is that Israel will not honor the agreement, as happened before. My greatest wish now is for real safety to return — for no more people to die here. We deserve security, hope, health, education, and the simple right to live with dignity,” Eyad said.

Exact details of the deal are unclear. However, it is slated to include the release of all 20 living Israeli captives, in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Hamas and associated factions would release Israeli captives within 72 hours of the agreement beginning.

Israeli forces are supposed to conduct a partial withdrawal from the territory after the captive swap is complete. After that, Israel would still control 53 percent of the Strip, according to Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian. 

Under the deal, Israel will also open several crossings for the entry of 400 trucks of humanitarian aid on the first day, and 600 trucks daily after. This operation would be overseen by international aid organizations, not the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a Hamas official has said.

According to Israeli sources, per Al Jazeera, the ceasefire is slated to go into effect within 24 hours after the Israeli cabinet ratifies the agreement. That vote is supposed to take place Thursday evening. Though Trump's plan calls for an end to the hostilities, there are not yet reports of what happens past the first phase.

As they celebrated, Palestinians also noted that Israel did not let up on its bombing even as the deal was announced. Video footage captured by Al Jazeera showed Israeli tanks firing at Palestinians trying to return to Gaza City, where Israel has been conducting a ground invasion. 

Many were skeptical that Israel would adhere to the deal, given Israel's history of breaking ceasefire agreements — including its unilateral ending of the ceasefire deal earlier this year, after its first phase was complete. Indeed, despite Trump's plan giving huge leeway to Israel, certain Israeli demands like disarming Hamas were omitted.

“Ceasefire might not retain Gaza to what it was once; [a] flourishing city, nor could it retain the loved ones we lost, not erase our bloodcurdling memories, nor mitigate our unspoken grief, but it will at least stop the carnage, it will pause the horrors and terrors, it will give us a chance to breathe amid endless tragedies, it will give us a chance to grieve properly,” writer and medical student Hend Salama Abo Helow told Truthout.

“I wish it will lead to a permanent peace for Gaza,” she said.

“After two years of genocide, relentless bombardment, and a life stripped down to survival, this moment feels unreal — like breathing for the first time after being underwater for too long,” Taqwa Ahmed Al-Wawi, writer and student at the Islamic University of Gaza, told Truthout. “We are overwhelmed — joy and sorrow intertwined. Happiness that the bombing has stopped, even for a moment, and sadness for everyone who is not here to witness it.” 

“Still, beneath the relief, there's fear — fear that this fragile calm could break again, that the sky could once more turn against us. But for now, we breathe,” Al-Wawi went on. “We have endured what no one should ever endure. And yet, Gaza sat'eesh — Gaza will live. She always does.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            All the hostages still held in Gaza are set to be released as soon as Monday under the first phase of a ceasefire plan agreed by Hamas and Israel, US President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday.
    


            More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014, when he was killed and his body taken to the strip.
    


            The Israeli government has said 26 of the 48 hostages are deceased, although the status of two others – Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi – remains uncertain. The government previously expressed “grave concern” over their fates.
    


            The hostages who are believed to be alive are all men and all but one are in their 20s and 30s. Women, children and men over the age of 50 were released under previous ceasefire agreements.
    


            One woman, Inbar Hayman, is among the 26 in Gaza who have been declared dead.
    


            Of those still believed to be living or whose status is unknown, 11 were taken from the Nova music festival. Eight were kidnapped from several kibbutzim, or small communities, in southern Israel, including two foreigners who worked on Israeli farms. Three are Israeli soldiers – two were kidnapped from military bases and one from a tank.
    


            Here is what we know about them.
    


            Twin brothers Ziv and Gali Berman were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Kfar-Aza during the October 7 terror attack. They were 26 at the time. Speaking to CNN in February, their mother Liran Berman said other hostages who had been released had told the family the brothers were alive and separated from each other.
    


            Several of the hostages were kidnapped alongside friends and family members, some of whom have since returned home.
    


            Brothers Ariel and David Cunio were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, alongside Ariel's partner Yehoud, David's wife Sharon, and their three-year-old twin daughters, Yuli and Emma. Sharon, Yuli and Emma were released under a ceasefire agreement in November 2023, while Yehoud was freed earlier this year.
    


Eitan Horn was visiting his brother Iair when they were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz. Iair was released earlier this year. A propaganda video showing him saying goodbye to Eitan was released by Hamas in March. The Horn family said that seeing him in the video “broke their hearts.”
    


            “Since Iair returned to us, he hasn't stopped thinking about and working for Eitan and all the other hostages he met in captivity who are still there,” the family said in a statement.
    


Matan Zangauker and his partner Illana Gritzewsky were kidnapped from the same kibbutz as the Horn brothers. Gritzewsky, a Mexican national, was released on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal, while Zangauker was left behind.
    


Omri Miran, then 46, was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family's home in kibbutz Nahal Oz. In April 2024, Hamas put out a video showing Miran, alongside American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who has since been released.
    


Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David are childhood best friends who were kidnapped together from the Nova Music Festival. In February 2025, Hamas filmed Gilboa-Dalal and David watching other hostages being released, posting the video to Telegram.
    


            Gilboa-Dalal's brother Gal told CNN this amounted to psychological torment. “To make them see what freedom might look like for them and then close the door and drag them back to hell – it's awful,” he said.
    


Avinatan Or was also kidnapped from the Nova festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in an IDF operation in central Gaza in June 2024. She revealed that they had been separated during the abduction.
    


Alon Ohel, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, Elkana Bohbot, Segev Kalfon, Maxim Herkin, Eitan Abraham Mor, Bar Kupershtein and Rom Braslavski were also kidnapped from the Nova festival.
    


            Ohel, Ohana, Bohbot, Braslavski and Mor were all seen helping wounded victims at the site before their abduction.
    


            The IDF soldiers Nimrod Cohen, Matan Angrest and Tamir Nimrodi are among the youngest still held in Gaza.
    


            Cohen appeared in a Hamas propaganda video posted online on March 1 this year. His family was able to identify him thanks to a tattoo on his arm, his mother Vicky Cohen told CNN. “We recognized Nimrod because of that tattoo. Otherwise, I wouldn't recognize him because you couldn't hear his voice or see his face,” she told CNN.
    


Bipin Joshi, a Nepali student, was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. His family said earlier this week that a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity was recently recovered by the Israeli military in Gaza.
    


            The video is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi's kidnapping. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family said the video had given them “unwavering faith” that Joshi is alive.
    


            Israeli officials had previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi.
    


            Besides Joshi, four other foreign nationals are still held in Gaza, three of them from Thailand and one from Tanzania.
    


            Three of the four – Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania – have been declared dead by the Israeli government. An unnamed Thai citizen is believed to be alive.
    


            The bodies of the 26 hostages who have been declared dead by the government are also set to be returned as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday.
    


            However, three Israeli sources told CNN that Hamas may not know the location of, or may be unable to retrieve, the remains of some of them. According to one source, that is thought to be the case for between seven and nine of the deceased hostages, while another source put the figure at between 10 and 15.
    


Inbar Hayman was kidnapped from the Nova festival. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced in December 2023 that she had been killed by Hamas while in captivity. She remains the only female hostage still in Gaza.
    


            At least 13 of the deceased hostages whose remains are still in Gaza were killed during the terror attacks on October 7, 2023 and their bodies then taken to the enclave.
    


            They include several Israeli soldiers, including two who were dual US and Israeli citizens – Omer Maxim Neutra from Long Island, New York, and Itay Chen.

            The Internal Revenue Service began furloughing nearly half its staff Wednesday because of the ongoing government shutdown, sparking chaos and confusion among employees as the news rippled through agency offices around the country.
    


            The agency said in an updated shutdown contingency plan that it was furloughing more than 34,400 of its 74,300 employees on Wednesday. Initially, the IRS said that its entire workforce would remain on the job thanks to funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But it noted in its original contingency plan that staffing would be in place only for the first five business days — and there is no sign that the shutdown that began October 1 is nearing its end.
    


            A prolonged shutdown could cause bigger problems as the October 15 tax filing extension deadline approaches, said Maria Ramos, the National Treasury Employees Union chapter president in Austin, Texas, where she works in paper tax return processing.
    


            “Tax returns will be arriving,” she said, “but there will be no one there to process them.”
    


            In Kansas City, NTEU union chapter president Shannon Ellis described “lots of confusion” Wednesday morning as employees were notified of their status.
    


            An emergency notification system, typically used for weather alerts or building emergencies, sent out a recorded message telling staff that “as of October 8th, you are considered furloughed” unless you receive notification from your manager, Ellis told CNN.
    


            But soon after, Ellis said, managers began calling employees and telling them to “ignore that message” and “keep working as usual.”
    


            Well into the late afternoon, some people still didn't know their status, she said.
    


‘I don't know how I'm going to feed my kids': Shutdown hits federal contractors hard



            At the IRS and other agencies, some employees must continue working without pay during the shutdown, while other workers are furloughed without pay and stay home. But a third category, “exempt,” has added to the confusion. Employees classified as exempt will continue to work and receive pay, though union leaders say no one has explained where those funds are coming from.
    


            In its updated contingency plan, the IRS said that virtually all of the 39,870 workers who will remain on the job will be compensated by “a resource other than annual appropriations.” In its original shutdown plan, the agency said it could pay its entire workforce with Inflation Reduction Act funds.
    


            The IRA originally gave the agency roughly $80 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funds, to use over 10 years to improve customer service, expand enforcement, update technology and hire more staff. GOP lawmakers have sought to rescind the money ever since — slashing nearly $42 billion from the appropriation.
    


            Ellis said some employees who had been considered essential in previous shutdowns were furloughed this time around, including employees responsible for opening and scanning mailed tax returns and payments, critical paper-processing work. “To my knowledge, all of those people were furloughed,” Ellis said, adding that this was not the case in past shutdowns.
    


            “We were already short-staffed after months of resignations and layoffs,” she added. “Now this.”
    


            The IRS has a heavy workload: It is currently in the midst of putting into place dozens of tax law changes contained in the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including some that take effect this year.
    


            Adding to the confusion, the agency's updated plan said both that the plan could be changed again in five days and also that the staffing levels would be in place until April.
    


            The majority of the employees being retained work in taxpayer services, including customer service representatives, tax examiners and staffers who process tax returns with payments, according to the contingency plan. Also, some revenue agents and tax examiners in the small business division, as well as some local taxpayer advocates, will remain on the job, among other staffers.
    


            Among the significant activities that will cease are taxpayer services, such as responding to taxpayer questions outside of the filing season, and non-automated collections.
    


            In Memphis, where roughly 4,500 IRS employees make up the agency's third-largest union chapter, Gibson Jones, the local NTEU union chapter president and IRS employee, told CNN that the “vast majority” of workers were furloughed Wednesday, leaving only “very limited skeleton crews” across IRS business units.
    


            Like Ellis, Jones said the union has received no clarity on how the agency is deciding who is essential versus nonessential and noted that in prior shutdowns, many of the jobs furloughed Wednesday were treated differently.
    


            “Customer service staff weren't furloughed on the IRS Memphis campus in previous shutdowns,” he said. “This time, the vast majority of them have been sent home.”
    


            According to Jones, about 150 revenue agents and tax collection officers have also been furloughed.
    


            “We're in a government shutdown over money,” Jones said, “and the people who could be out there collecting more money for the federal government have been furloughed. They've essentially halted these revenue and tax collection functions.”
    


            Jones said he expects taxpayers to start feeling the impact immediately: longer hold times on phone lines, more dropped calls, and delays in refunds or processing as the October 15 extension filing deadline approaches.
    


            CNN reached out to both the IRS and Treasury Department, the agency that oversees the IRS, for comment.
    


Treasury names Social Security head as CEO of IRS



            Normally, Treasury's human resources officials coordinate with the union to explain which employees are considered essential. “That's not happening this time,” Jones said.
    


            “Managers are just telling employees one-on-one. The unions have been completely cut out of this.” He added that it's unclear what criteria are being used. “There's no rhyme or reason to who's being told they're furloughed and who's not.”
    


            In Atlanta, NTEU union chapter president, Denise Wells-Gomez said employees received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off.”
    


            Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used, and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave).
    


            One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren't present the day they decide to do an audit.
    


            However, during a staff meeting, the director of the Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave, if approved by their manager. Despite that, employees continued receiving instructions that “no exceptions” would be allowed.
    


            In Austin, Ramos was among those furloughed Wednesday. She said she drove an hour and a half in a carpool to the IRS office, waited around for four hours, and then was told to go home.
    


            “At a time when we're not going to be getting paid, people could've used that gas money,” Ramos told CNN. “That was time wasted and money spent that didn't need to be spent just to sit around for four hours and find out you were furloughed. In past shutdowns, we knew that information in advance.”

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Three months into his tenure leading Des Moines public schools, Ian Roberts asked the district's board for emergency approval of $116,000 in contracts.

The agreements to provide training on “culturally responsive coaching,” the superintendent said, had to be approved within days. But the district's procurement manager discovered one contract was earmarked for a company that marketed Roberts as a consultant and speaker, sold his books and helped raise his profile, an Associated Press investigation found.

Finance officials warned Roberts that contracting with Kansas City-based Lively Paradox would be a conflict of interest, and Roberts canceled the special board meeting he'd requested in September 2023.

Since his arrest last month by immigration agents, the public has grappled with how Roberts became a longtime superintendent despite allegedly lacking authorization to work in the U.S., having a history of criminal charges and touting falsified credentials.

The AP found that as Roberts' profile in education rose, his connection with Lively Paradox and its founder Nicole Price became rewarding during a period when many organizations championed diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Blurring the line between his public and private jobs, the investigation found tens of thousands of dollars in contracts were awarded to Price from school districts where Roberts held leadership posts.

The AP reviewed district records, court filings and books and marketing materials published by Lively Paradox and Price, who met Roberts during a chance encounter at an airport a decade ago.

Roberts, who remains in federal custody, has defended his outside work as helping transform education. His attorney declined comment.




Months after Des Moines officials stopped his attempt to contract with Lively Paradox, the district paid the firm $6,476 in consulting and travel expenses for Price's work facilitating a two-hour team-building exercise at a school board retreat in December 2023, records show. That amount could be approved by Roberts without board approval, a spokesperson said.

Roberts included on his original resume for the Des Moines position that he was an executive leadership coach at Lively Paradox and had been since its inception, as he hopped from one district position to another across four states. Price co-authored two books with Roberts and wrote the foreword for another, promoting him as a former Olympian and inspiring educator known for turning around schools.

“I just find Dr. Roberts to be one of the finest leaders I've ever met,” Price said in an interview after Roberts' arrest, when he allegedly fled from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and illegally possessed a firearm. “Calm under pressure, leading with empathy, mission driven and focused and just able to bring people along.”

As Roberts changed jobs, Price and Lively Paradox followed behind getting new clients, the AP found.

Price's clients have included a range of corporations and government agencies, her curriculum vitae shows. But for the ones where Roberts has been employed, the school districts she listed as clients appear to be located exclusively in Kansas and Missouri.

In a 2021 video posted on Instagram, Roberts joined Price to celebrate the five-year anniversary of Lively Paradox. She recalled targeting St. Louis Public Schools for business for the new firm when Roberts served as the network superintendent.

“Your district was one of the ones that I was like, ‘OK, I got to get them as a client',” Price said. “But I went through the same RFP process everybody else did.”

Roberts said, with his district position and Lively Paradox affiliation, they made St. Louis among the first “to take on the work of becoming a culturally responsive district.”

It's unclear how much Price was paid by the district, but records show she received one payment for thousands of dollars for a 2017 presentation. She also conducted a workshop there in February 2018, her curriculum vitae shows.

After Roberts became an administrator at Aspire Public Schools in Oakland, that public charter school system paid Price at least $8,300 for services, according to a disbursement report covering part of 2019.

Price provided leadership training to the Millcreek Township School District in Pennsylvania in 2020 and 2021, while Roberts was superintendent, according to her curriculum vitae.

She said there was no impropriety in her work at Roberts' districts, “just a long-standing commitment to mission-driven work and empathetic leadership.”

St. Louis Public Schools, Aspire Public Schools and Millcreek Township School District didn't respond to requests for comment. 

Price recalled that Roberts was “dressed impeccably” when they met in 2014 at a North Carolina airport. She was working then at a leadership firm where she focused on diversity and inclusion.

Price credited Roberts with teaching her about how education was different than corporate fields she had worked in. They discussed his idea that, rather than firing unproductive subordinates, education leaders should give them every chance to develop.

Price said they kept in touch. In 2016, she was fired and founded Lively Paradox, in part to focus on providing training to urban school leaders.

Roberts was with her from the beginning. In 2017, the two co-authored, “The Power of Seven Second Chances,” their vision for managing schools with compassion.

They later co-authored “Dangerous Indifference: The Case for Culturally Responsive Leadership,” calling for leaders to embrace and understand differences. Price wrote the foreword for Roberts' next book, “Radical Empathy.”

Price said the books, self-published and available for purchase online, didn't “really have great sales” because Roberts mostly ordered them to give away at conferences.

She said the two worked closely for years to coach school leaders and transform organizations.

It's unclear how much outside income Roberts received. Lively Paradox advertises a two-day “high performance workshop” for $38,975, keynote presentations for $15,000, and coaching packages for $9,995.

Their collaboration has continued with Roberts behind bars. Price said on Sep. 29 she was told by Roberts' wife to move forward with publishing a book called “Unshakeable,” a compilation of Roberts' inspirational messages to Des Moines schools.

Price said she knew nothing about his immigration status and was shocked by his arrest.

When he was hired in Des Moines in 2023, board members were aware of Roberts' outside work. His contract, which included an annual salary of $286,716 this year, allowed him to “undertake occasional consulting or speaking engagements, writing, lecturing, or other professional endeavors” with the board chair's approval.

The sole agenda item for the meeting called for Sept. 29, 2023 included Roberts' recommendation to award $116,000 to Lively Paradox and another firm for professional development.

The document said the district evaluated four vendors and Roberts made the recommendation that the two “best met the district's needs.” The expenses would come from federal funding intended to improve school leaders' performance.

District procurement manager JoAnne Khounlo-Philavanh discovered that Lively Paradox listed Roberts as part of its team, district spokesperson Phil Roeder said. She and district chief financial officer Shashank Aurora met with Roberts to discuss the conflict of interest, he said.

Roberts wrote board members that the meeting was no longer necessary after he “received another update from the finance team.”

The board's current chair, Jackie Norris, was a board member at the time and said district staff told her about concerns of a conflict of interest and they were addressed with Roberts. She added, “I strongly feel that a review is needed of all expenditures related to the former superintendent.”

U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready to be moved in to Gaza when they are given a green light.

President Donald Trump praised the “momentous” Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the “complicated” hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. Speaking during his Cabinet meeting, the president said he may travel to Egypt for the signing ceremony.

Some residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem woke up Thursday with hope and joy after Israel and Hamas had agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting and release the hostages.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet late Thursday to approve a pause in the devastating two-year war with Hamas, ahead of a government meeting to approve the release of Palestinian prisoners. Both the ceasefire deal and the release of prisoners are expected to pass with wide margins, even if far right ministers vote against it. (AP video by Moshe Edri)

The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war.

CAIRO (AP) — Israel and Hamas have agreed to a pause in their devastating two-year war and the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners — a breakthrough greeted Thursday with joy and relief but also caution.

Uncertainty remains about aspects of the broader ceasefire plan advanced by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump — such as whether and how Hamas will disarm and who will govern Gaza. But the sides appear closer than they have been in months to ending a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, reduced much of Gaza to rubble, brought famine to parts of the territory and left dozens of hostages, living and dead, in Gaza.

The war, which began with Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has also triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies. 




Some 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led assault, and 251 were taken hostage. In Israel's ensuing offensive, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and nearly 170,000 wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half of the deaths were women and children.

Even with the agreement expected to be finalized later in the day, Israeli strikes continued, with explosions seen Thursday in northern Gaza. At least 11 dead Palestinians and another 49 who were wounded arrived at hospitals over the past 24 hours, Gaza's Health Ministry said.

An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines said Israel was continuing to hit targets that posed a threat to its troops as they reposition.

A senior Hamas official and lead negotiator made a speech Thursday laying out what he says are the core elements of the ceasefire deal: Israel releasing more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, opening the border crossing with Egypt, allowing aid to flow and withdrawing from Gaza.

Khalil al-Hayya said Israel will release 250 prisoners serving long sentences and about 1,700 people detained in Gaza since the war began. All women and children held in Israeli jails will also be freed, he added. He did not offer details on the extent of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Al-Hayya said the Trump administration and mediators had given assurances that the war is over, and that Hamas and other Palestinian factions will now focus on achieving self-determination and establishing a Palestinian state.

“We declare today that we have reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people,” Al-Hayya said in a televised speech Thursday evening.

In the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, reactions to the announcement of a ceasefire were relatively muted and often colored by grief.

“I am happy and unhappy. We have lost a lot of people and lost loved ones, friends and family. We lost our homes,” said Mohammad Al-Farra. “Despite our happiness, we cannot help but think of what is to come. ... The areas we are going back to, or intending to return to, are uninhabitable.”

In Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages popped champagne and cried tears of joy after Trump announced a deal late Wednesday.

In Jerusalem on Thursday, Sharon Canot celebrated with some others.

“We are so excited this morning. We cried all morning,” she said. “It's been two years that we are in horror.”

Under the terms, Hamas intends to release all living hostages in a matter of days, while the Israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of Gaza, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of an agreement that has not fully been made public. Some 20 of the 48 hostages still in captivity are believed to be alive.

In a short video posted by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump was seen speaking by phone to a group of elated hostage families.

 “They are all coming back on Monday,” said Trump, who is expected in the region in the coming days.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to convene his smaller Security Cabinet and then the full Cabinet to approve the deal.

Hamas called on Trump and the mediators to ensure that Israel fully implements the troop withdrawal, the entry of aid into Gaza and the exchange of prisoners. Hamas officials said nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners are to be released, including 250 serving long sentences, while the rest are people who were detained during the war in Gaza.

The days ahead could be politically tricky for Netanyahu, who has been shadowed by an ongoing corruption trial as he navigated the Gaza war.

His grip on power has been largely contingent on the support of hard-line, far-right coalition partners who have urged him to continue operations against Hamas until the group is eliminated.

But Trump on Thursday suggested Netanyahu's political standing has been bolstered by the ceasefire and hostage deal.

“He's much more popular today than he was five days ago,” Trump said. “I can tell you right now, people shouldn't run against him. Five days ago, might not have been a bad idea.”

The deal being submitted to Israel's government and then expected to be signed in Egypt will include a list of prisoners to be released and maps for the first phase of an Israeli withdrawal to new positions in Gaza, according to two Egyptian officials briefed on the talks, a Hamas official and another official.

Israel will publish the list of the prisoners, and victims of their attacks will have 24 hours to lodge objections.

The withdrawal could start as soon as Thursday evening, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be publicly named speaking about the negotiations. The hostage and prisoner releases are expected to begin Monday, the officials from Egypt and Hamas said, though the other official said they could occur as early as Sunday night.

Five border crossings would reopen, including the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing 400 trucks in the initial days and increasing to 600 trucks after that, the Egyptian and Hamas officials said.

The Trump plan calls for Israel to maintain an open-ended military presence inside Gaza, along its border with Israel. An international force, comprised largely of troops from Arab and Muslim countries, would be responsible for security inside Gaza. The U.S. would lead a massive internationally funded reconstruction effort.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that Turkey will “hopefully take part in the task force that will monitor the implementation of the agreement on the ground.” Turkey, which has close ties to Hamas, helped broker the deal, along with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.

The plan also envisions an eventual role for the Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to undergo a sweeping reform program that could take years. 

The Trump plan is even more vague about a future Palestinian state, which Netanyahu firmly rejects.

After the deal was agreed to, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi met Thursday with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Cairo.

In a statement after the meeting, Sissi said he is eager to celebrate the signing of the agreement and reiterated his invitation to Trump to visit Egypt to witness it “in a ceremony befitting the occasion.” Witkoff and Kushner later landed in Israel, according to an official who was not authorized to speak to the media.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, both Democrats, should be jailed as they oppose his deployment of National Guard troops for his immigration and crime crackdown in the nation's third-largest city.

Aerial footage showed a large group of demonstrators marching through downtown Chicago Wednesday night, in the wake of President Donald Trump's deployment of federal troops to an Army training center outside the city.

Illinois urged a judge Thursday to order the National Guard to stand down in the Chicago area, calling the deployment a constitutional crisis and suggesting the Trump administration gave no heed to the pending legal challenge when it sent troops overnight to an immigration enforcement building.

The government “plowed ahead anyway,” attorney Christopher Wells of the state attorney general's office said. “Now, troops are here.”

Wells' arguments opened an extraordinary hearing in federal court in Chicago. The city and the state, run by Democratic elected leaders, say President Donald Trump has vastly exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the Guard off the streets.

Heavy public turnout at the downtown courthouse caused officials to open an overflow room with a video feed of the hearing. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson got a seat in a corner of the courtroom.

U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness.” He pointed to an incident last weekend in which a Border Patrol vehicle was boxed in and an agent shot a woman in response.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They're not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

He said some people were wearing gas masks, a suggestion they were poised for a fight, but U.S. District Judge April Perry countered it might be justified to avoid tear gas at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago.




“I, too, would wear a gas mask,” the judge said, “not because I'm trying to be violent but because I'm trying to protect myself.”

Hamilton also tried to narrow the issues. He said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field — not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

Guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and have been activated for 60 days. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a legal challenge to President Trump's Chicago-area National Guard deployment.

Some Guard troops could be seen behind portable fences at the Broadview ICE building. It has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents, but the scene was peaceful, with few people present. 

Wells, the lawyer for Illinois, described the impact of Trump's immigration crackdown in Chicago, noting that U.S. citizens have been temporarily detained. He acknowledged the “president does have the power, and he's using that power.”

“But that power is not unlimited,” Wells added, referring to the Guard deployment. “And this court can check that power.”

Perry told the parties to return to court late Thursday afternoon.

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court heard arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor Paul Young said troops would begin patrolling Friday. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the role.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped the Guard would be used to direct traffic and have a presence in retail corridors, but not used for checkpoints or similar.

Davis said she doesn't want Memphis to “feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities.”

The Trump administration's aggressive use of the Guard was challenged this summer in California, which won and lost a series of court decisions while opposing the policy of putting troops in Los Angeles, where they protected federal buildings and immigration agents.

A judge in September said the deployment was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained on the ground. The judge did not order them to leave. The government later took steps to send them to Oregon.

Shabbos Kestenbaum tells 'America Reports' Harvard has 'normalized' antisemitism.

EXCLUSIVE: Mired in controversy over the past week after it was revealed that the school hosted a panel weighing the merits of political violence, Harvard University has several times ignored opportunities to condemn it. 

The Ivy League school has been under the microscope after it was reported that its Carr-Ryan Center for Human Rights hosted a panel in early 2018 where a guest lecturer from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made his case for potential armed political violence. Three Harvard faculty members participated in the panel. 

Since then, Fox News Digital has asked Harvard multiple times whether it condemns political violence. Those requests have all gone unreturned.

UNC PROFESSOR REVEALED ANARCHIST GROUP REQUESTED SECURITY FROM FAR-LEFT GUN CLUB DURING 2017 RIOT

UNC Professor Dwayne Dixon led the panel called ""You Don't Stand Around and Let People Get Hurt: Antifascism After Charlottesville"" in February 2018. 

Dixon was then a member of Redneck Revolt, an offshoot of the far-left John Brown Gun Club, which, amid last week's controversy, announced it had shut down in 2019. 

He described the ""far-right"" as ""filled with murderous rage,"" though he never clearly defined the term ""far-right."" 

During his speech, Dixon framed armed political action in the United States in 2018 in the context of the era of American slavery, when violent means were used to achieve political goals. 

Describing famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Dixon said, ""He saw no hope that slavery would ever be abolished by moral or political means.""

UNC PROFESSOR REINSTATED AFTER ‘THREAT ASSESSMENT' OF ‘POLITICAL VIOLENCE' CONCERNS, TIES TO FAR-LEFT GUN CLUB

""Douglass is not a victim of some faint-hearted anxiety about the use of force to free slaves and to dispatch those who would threaten their freedom or their lives,"" he said. ""He plainly says the system must be met with its own weapons.""

Three Harvard faculty members — education professor Timothy McCarthy, professor of American history and African American studies Vincent Brown and American history professor Lisa McGirr — listened intently to Dixon. 

McCarthy invoked President Donald Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in the context of ""fascism,"" saying that LGBTQ people have ""a sense, perhaps quite real, that we are indeed at war and that this is a different kind of phase of war that is more specific, more linked to domestic insurgency of White supremacy, the rise of that, a fascist state under the Trump-Pence regime.""

Harvard Professor Timothy McGirr speaks at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in 2018.  (University of Arkansas)

He also referred to the political climate as an ""emergent fascist moment with all the signs of that from history that if we're paying attention,"" and concluded that ""this may indeed be a moment that calls for a more robust integration of tactics and strategies that include both violence and nonviolence.""

McGirr fawned over Dixon's presentation.

""This was a beautiful, brilliant, wonderful, very convincing talk. So, you know, I actually came in here relatively skeptical about your use of, you know, coming armed to Charlottesville and what happened in North Carolina,"" she said. ""And, at the end, I'm kind of convinced, actually, you know, that there is a place for this.""

Brown, meanwhile, openly suggested that political violence was an obvious solution in a statement that drew laughs from the audience. 

""Many of you are aware of the ongoing vigorous debate over whether it's OK to punch a Nazi. I personally happen to believe that the ethical question was settled by WWII and ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,'"" he said in his introduction. 

""All four of [the panel members] are committed to study, interpretation and reasoned debate, but are well aware that deliberation might have distinct limits in the face of opponents who would prefer to see us eliminated,"" he continued.

When UNC officials were made aware of Dixon's involvement with Redneck Revolt and the panel, the school immediately condemned political violence. 

""The University continues to reaffirm its commitment to rigorous debate, respectful engagement and open dialogue in support of free speech,"" university spokesman Dean Stoyer told Fox News Digital. ""There is no place for or tolerance of inciting or extending sympathy toward violence of any kind within the UNC community.""

Harvard refused to follow suit. 

HARVARD FACULTY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR POTENTIAL LEFT-WING POLITICAL VIOLENCE DURING 2018 PANEL

Earlier this week, Fox News Digital reported that a University of Chicago faculty member was arrested for felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor obstruction/resisting charges stemming from an anti-ICE rally Oct. 3.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi, a known entity in the far-left activism world, was taken into custody that day. 

In the wake of the violent charges against her, the University of Chicago also condemned violence.

""Safety is a paramount concern at the University of Chicago. Violence runs contrary to the university's core values of free and open inquiry, dialogue and debate,"" a school spokesman said. ""The university promptly looks into any safety concerns, and takes action if necessary to uphold the safety of the university community."" 

Harvard has an institutional neutrality policy, borne out of an ""Institutional Voice Working Group"" and a subsequent report. It was implemented last year and forbids the school from making specific comments on anything. 

The report says that the ""university and its leaders should not, however, issue official statements about public matters that do not directly affect the university's core function.""

The report mentions violence in passing. 

""The University places special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which are essential to its nature as an academic community. Among these are freedom of speech and academic freedom, freedom from personal force and violence, and freedom of movement. Interference with any of these freedoms must be regarded as a serious violation of the personal rights upon which the community is based.""

Harvard did not return a request for comment Thursday.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Oct. 9, 2025, that ""Trump derangement syndrome"" has reached pathological levels, while pointing to pregnant moms protesting the administration by taking Tylenol.

""Trump derangement syndrome"" has spiraled to pathological levels, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the White House's monthly Cabinet meeting Thursday, pointing to a recent trend of pregnant moms protesting President Donald Trump by taking Tylenol — despite warnings the medicine could be tied to autism. 

""The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left political landscapes, and it is now a pathology,"" Kennedy said. ""That a mother could overwhelm millions of years of maternal instinct to put her baby at risk."" 

Kennedy explained to his colleagues and the media that he watched a video of a pregnant Columbia medical professor ingesting Tylenol on TikTok to protest Trump ahead of the meeting, and was startled that any mom would willingly ingest the over-the-counter pain medication following reports it's allegedly tied to skyrocketing autism trends. 

""Any mother who is taking this up during pregnancy just to get back into Donald Trump is doing something that is, it is pathological,"" he said. ""And we're seeing that across the board.""

Trump announced in September while flanked by U.S. health leaders that Tylenol taken during pregnancy ""can be associated with a very increased risk of autism."" 

Kennedy said during the same event that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are ""turning over every stone to identify the ideology of the autism epidemic and how patients and parents can prevent and reverse this alarming trend.""

""We have broken down the traditional silos that have long separated these agencies, and we have fast-tracked research and guidance,"" said Kennedy. ""Historically, NIH has focused on almost solely on politically safe and entirely fruitless research about the genetic drivers of autism. And that would be like studying the genetic drivers of lung cancer without looking at cigarettes, and that's what NIH has been doing for 20 years.""

Tylenol manufacturer Kenvue said it strongly disagreed with the administration's assessment in comment to Fox Digital in September. 

""We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,"" a company spokesperson said at the time. ""We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Kenvue Thursday afternoon for additional comment on Kennedy's and Trump's most recent Tylenol remarks but did not immediately receive a reply.

Following the September announcement, liberal pregnant moms began filming themselves taking Tylenol and posting the videos to X and TikTok as a way to protest Trump. Critics have balked at the claims that the common over-the-counter pain medicine is tied to autism. 

""It is so suggestive that anybody who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,"" Kennedy continued Thursday.

Kennedy told Trump that, back in 1970, researchers in Wisconsin determined that roughly one in 20,000 eight-year-olds in the state had autism before skyrocketing in the following decades. Kennedy called the increasing autism rates a ""national security issue."" 

""Now, it's 1 in 12 for boys, 1 in 18, 19 for girls. So obviously there's something, there's something that's artificially, I think, (inducing) something,"" Trump added.

Kennedy continued that there are a handful of studies pointing to Tylenol's alleged links to autism, including among male babies who are circumcised.

""There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism,"" he said. ""It's highly likely it's because they're given Tylenol."" 

Trump added that ""there's a tremendous amount of proof"" surrounding the claims linking Tylenol to autism, and remarked that he has discussed the increasing autism rate with Kennedy going back 20 years. 

""I've studied this a long time ago,"" Trump said, noting he himself is not a doctor. ""You know, I met Bobby in my office 20 years ago. We were talking about the same thing 20 years ago. And, I was a real estate developer, it bothered me that it seemed to be getting worse. But it's so bad now when you hear these numbers, it's not even really sustainable.""

Acting U.S. attorney in California Bill Essayli discusses the arrest and charges of the suspect allegedly behind the Palisades fire on ‘The Ingraham Angle.

The suspect charged with causing the deadly Palisades Fire in Southern California will remain in the custody of U.S. marshals without bail ahead of trial.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathan W. Hill cited 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht's mental health, unsteady income and complicated relationship with his family as reasons for the decision on Thursday in Orlando, Florida.

Three of Rinderknecht's siblings – two sisters and one brother – sat in the second row during the hearing. One of his sisters started crying after the judge made his ruling. 

Federal officials said during a news conference on Wednesday that Rinderknecht was arrested in Melbourne the previous day. Rinderknecht is accused of starting the Lachman Fire on New Year's Day, which kept burning underground and reemerged as the Palisades Fire due to strong winds on Jan. 7.

Rinderknecht was an Uber driver, and he was described by two passengers as ""agitated and angry"" the night he was accused of starting the fire, a criminal complaint obtained by Fox News said.

Officials said during the news conference that he was a resident of Palisades and was familiar with the neighborhood. He allegedly used an ""open flame"" to ignite the blaze after just having dropped off passengers.

Rinderknecht's access to the Uber platform was revoked once Uber learned of his suspected involvement in the fire, the company said. 

All Uber drivers ""must pass a state-mandated background check in order to drive with Uber and are rescreened annually,"" the Uber spokesperson said.

President Donald Trump's Cabinet broke out into applause, Oct. 9, 2025, as Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.

President Donald Trump's Cabinet and others at the White House broke out into applause Thursday afternoon when Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. 

""Today we have your Columbus Day proclamation for Monday, which we're signing a bit early,"" White House staff secretary Will Scharf told Trump Thursday ahead of the monthly Cabinet meeting. 

""Columbus, obviously, discovered the new world in 1492. He was a great Italian explorer. He sailed his three ships, the Nina, the Pinto and Santa Maria, across the Atlantic Ocean, and landed in what's today the Caribbean. And this is a particularly important holiday for Italian Americans who celebrate the legacy of Christopher Columbus, and the innovation and explorer zeal that he represented,"" he continued. 

AMERICAN HISTORY WON'T BE DISPLAYED 'IN A WOKE MANNER' AT SMITHSONIAN, TRUMP SAYS

Applause was heard breaking out in the room as Trump added: ""In other words, we're calling it Columbus Day.""

Trump continued in his remarks Thursday saying, ""We're back, Italians,"" as applause continued.

""That was the press that broke out in applause,"" Trump quipped of the warm reception to the proclamation. ""I've never seen that happen. The press actually broke out in applause. Good. Columbus Day. We're back. Columbus Day. We're back, Italians. We love the Italians.""

Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1971, following decades of the Italian American community already celebrating the explorer and previous presidents recognizing the holiday with their own proclamations.

Activists in recent years, however, have worked to disassociate the day from Columbus — claiming it celebrates colonialism and genocide of indigenous people — in favor of celebrating Native Americans. Activists also have worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020. 

Former Vice President Kamala Harris was among political leaders who favored celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day, and called on Americans in 2021 to ""not shy away"" from its ""shameful past"" of European explorers.

""Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for Tribal nations — perpetrating violence, stealing land and spreading disease,"" she said just one day after Columbus Day 2021. ""We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on Native communities today.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that giving Tylenol to infant boys after circumcision could be a cause of autism among males.

Kennedy and President Donald Trump, during Thursday's Cabinet meeting, briefly discussed the connection between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and early infancy, and the risk of the child developing autism.

In September, the Food and Drug Administration issued a recommendation to physicians that pregnant patients use Tylenol sparingly because of the possibility that it could cause autism in babies. The FDA did not directly address infant use of Tylenol as possibly being connected to Autism Spectrum Disorder. Trump, though, encouraged parents not to give their young children Tylenol.

On Thursday, Kennedy praised Trump's Tylenol announcement and highlighted two studies that have indicated that male infant circumcision is correlated with autism diagnoses, suggesting that it is because of giving the baby Tylenol for pain management. 

“There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It's highly likely because they're given Tylenol,” said Kennedy. “You know, none of this is dispositive. All of it should be paid attention to.”

A 2015 study from the Danish Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine looked at nearly 343,000 boys born from 1994 to 2003, finding that “boys who undergo ritual circumcision may run a greater risk” of autism, as well as hyperactivity disorders.

Another 2013 study found that countries with higher circumcision rates have higher levels of autism, but the authors acknowledged that their analysis does not prove causality.

Circumcision rates in the United States have steadily declined over the past several decades. In 1981, roughly 65% of newborn boys were circumcised in the hospital, but this fell to approximately 55% in 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A more recent study from Johns Hopkins University Medicine found that only 49% of male babies were circumcised in 2022.

The CDC estimates that one in 31 children aged eight years old, about 3% of children, has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism is more than three times more common in boys than in girls.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR LETTING ADDED OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES LAPSE

Trump was heavily criticized following his September advice to pregnant women to just “tough it out” instead of taking Tylenol during pregnancy, but he gave the advice again during Thursday's Cabinet meeting.

 “Just don't take it. Don't take it. If you're a woman, don't take it and don't give it to the baby when the baby's born. And I think that's going to have an impact,” Trump said, referring to decreasing autism rates over time.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Trump administration officials say their hands were tied over the Food and Drug Administration's decision to greenlight a generic version of the abortion drug mifepristone.

“It's not an endorsement of this drug by any means. They are just simply following the law,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of the FDA on Friday.

HAWLEY SAYS HE WAS ‘MISLED' BY TRUMP FDA PICK OVER ABORTION PILLS

I don't buy this “simply following the law” excuse. Neither do key anti-abortion legislators, including Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who rightly denounced the approval as a “betrayal” of the anti-abortion community that got President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance elected.

And neither does Kelsey Pritchard, the political director of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

“‘Powerless' is not a word that someone uses to describe this administration when they face trouble,” Pritchard told me by phone. “They're known for bucking the status quo. They're known for doing what they need to do to reverse problems.”

Oddly, the FDA issued the approval before it completed its own safety review of the drug, which began in mid-September. An Ethics and Public Policy Center study, showing 11% of users faced “serious adverse events,” prompted Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct FDA Commissioner Marty Makary to review “the latest data.” However, the FDA prematurely issued the approval without the results.

The administration had tools to delay or pause the process despite Leavitt's contrary claims. While Title 21 of the United States Code states that the HHS secretary “shall issue an order approving the application,” that's only if the data provided by the manufacturer meets the standards of safety and effectiveness. Leavitt overstated the law's rigidity as the administration could have cited the ongoing review, not to mention the safety concerns raised by the EPPC, as a cause to delay.

After all, the FDA's primary function is to protect public health by ensuring the safety of medical products. If the agency was concerned enough to start a review, why wasn't it concerned enough to delay approval? The decision defies logic.

The stakes couldn't be higher. It's difficult to imagine a starker “life-or-death” situation than mail-order abortion pills. These drugs take hundreds of thousands of innocent unborn lives each year, as the Guttmacher Institute found that in 2024, 63% of all abortions came from “medication,” totaling roughly 654,000 abortions, which grievously injure and even kill mothers in the process.

It's hard to say how many mothers are damaged by these pills annually. That's because the abortion drug dealers advise women, especially in red states, to lie about the reason for their ER visits, which are known to involve hemorrhages, sepsis, and even death.

The approval also undermines Trump's and Vance's preference for states' rights on abortion. Thanks to mifepristone and its peddlers, abortion is a national issue whether the administration likes it or not. Abortion pill manufacturers ship pills from blue states to red states regardless of the differences in state laws.

By approving a cheap generic abortion pill, HHS and the FDA are essentially aiding Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Kathy Hochul (D-NY) in their quest to subvert anti-abortion laws nationwide. Clinicians in California, New York, and other abortion-rights states are protected by shield laws, allowing them to mail pills interstate without fear of prosecution. Telehealth abortion provider Aid Access reports that 84% of its 118,000 prescriptions went to states with abortion bans. This state of affairs renders state abortion bans meaningless. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization may as well have never happened.

Trump and Vance are surely aware of all this. But sadly, they have little incentive to intervene. Abortion is broadly popular, and opposing it is politically hazardous. And whether they act or not, they'll continue to enjoy the unconditional support of sycophantic organizations in the anti-abortion movement and Christian media, who rarely, if ever, apply pressure, no matter how energetically their administration promotes the culture of death. Trump and Vance know that these organizations and their talking heads will continue to provide cover, convincing their followers that this is “the most pro-life administration in history,” in exchange for access to power.

Tragically, most anti-abortion groups, SBA and Live Action excluded, have devolved into pro-Trump pamphleteering outfits, posting his administration's “wins” and ignoring his mounting pile of anti-life actions.

Do they hold back criticism for fear of not being invited to speak at various “America First” galas? Have Trump and Vance bought their silence with cushy appointments? Do they fear that Vance might no longer occasionally return their texts?

It's impossible to know, but I have no qualms about asking these questions. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, and the Trump administration needs to be pressured to correct course. The time for niceties has passed.

It passed long ago, in fact. 

During the 2024 campaign, Trump dodged direct calls to restrict mifepristone, emphasizing states' rights, which universal access to mifepristone effectively nullifies. He proceeded to remove the call from the Republican Party platform for a constitutional amendment to grant personhood protections to the unborn, and he even waffled on voting for the six-week abortion ban in his home state of Florida.

Vance, meanwhile, has been crystal clear about his commitment to protect abortion rights. On Meet the Press in July 2024, he told host Kristen Welker, “The Supreme Court made a decision that the American people should have access to that medication. President Donald Trump supports that opinion. I support that opinion.”

Welker then asked him to clarify, asking, “Do you support mifepristone being accessible?”

“Yes, Kristen, I do,” he responded.

After his reelection victory, Trump told Time magazine that it was “very unlikely” he would restrict access to mifepristone.

True to his word, Trump soon ordered the Justice Department to preserve access to the abortion pill by defending federal regulations allowing abortion pills to be available online and by mail. The DOJ argued in a filing with a Texas federal court that the three GOP-controlled states suing the agency lacked standing, protecting Biden-era rules easing mifepristone access.

When will the broader anti-abortion community finally blink itself awake from its delusions about Trump and Vance? When will it finally take them at their word about preserving access to mail-order abortion?

TRUMP FDA APPROVES NEW GENERIC ABORTION PILL, ANGERING CONSERVATIVES

The Trump administration is far from the “most pro-life administration in history.” In fact, it's the most anti-life Republican administration since that of Gerald Ford, if not the most anti-life administration in history.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine will nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he provides long-range Tomahawk missiles and helps secure a ceasefire with Russia.

“During our most recent meeting, I didn't hear a ‘no.' What I did hear was that work will continue at the technical level and that this possibility will be considered,” Zelensky said of his meeting with Trump at the United Nations General Assembly late last month.

“The plan for ending the war won't be easy, but it is certainly the way forward. And if Trump gives the world — above all, the Ukrainian people — the chance for such a ceasefire, then yes, he should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,” he added. “We will nominate him on behalf of Ukraine.”

Trump has boasted about his role in ending seven wars around the world. That's now tentatively up to eight after his administration helped broker the first stage of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday. The agreement allows for the return of the remaining Israeli hostages and requires Israel to withdraw from most of Gaza.

Before announcing the peace deal, Trump downplayed expectations about receiving the prestigious award on Friday for his peacemaking efforts.

“I have no idea,” he said when asked if he believed he would win. “We settled seven wars. We're close to settling an eighth, and I think we'll end up settling the Russia situation, which is horrible.”

“So I don't think anybody in history has settled that many,” he added. “But perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me.”

The wars that Trump helped end were fought between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.

This year's Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and awarded at a ceremony in Norway on Dec. 10. Nominations for the annual prize closed in January, meaning it's unlikely Trump will get the award this year. However, he may win one in the coming years.

Zelensky, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, believes Trump deserves it if he can help the Russia-Ukraine war come to a peaceful close.

TRUMP ‘ISN'T HOLDING HIS BREATH' OVER THIS YEAR'S NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

Earlier this week, Trump said he had “sort of” decided on whether to send the requested Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, but first wants to know how the weapons will be used.

A spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry warned a shipment of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would lead to a “new serious stage of escalation” in the war.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The administration's confusing, creepy new style

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Last week, Donald Trump's White House anticipated the impending government shutdown like an album release, placing a massive countdown clock at the top of WhiteHouse.gov. “Democrat Shutdown Is Imminent,” read the online home of the People's House, on a black background. Now that the shutdown has happened, a clock is counting upward: “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government,” it says, with numbers climbing to mark the seconds, minutes, hours, and days that have elapsed.



This is an unusual use of the White House website. Though WhiteHouse.gov has always been a place to showcase the administration's agenda, it has mostly looked like the website of a mid-size high school. During the Clinton administration, it had the goofy GeoCities look of the day (American-flag GIFs); by the start of George W. Bush's presidency, it had transitioned into a bland informational page rendered in blue, white, and gray, clotted with text. (“President Bush Participates in Signing Ceremony With NATO Secretary General De Hoop Scheffer for NATO Accession Protocols for Albania and Croatia,” for example.) It stayed that way, with minor tweaks, throughout the Obama administration, and it was as dry as ever during Trump's first term too. Even as Trump was inciting an insurrection against the United States government, his team did not use the White House website to promote that goal. On January 6, 2021, the homepage still showed information about the new COVID-19 vaccines.



But when Trump returned to office in January 2025, his transition team had a redesign ready to go. The first day, the website was transformed. Visitors saw an auto-playing trailer with an action-movie score—helicopter, jets, eagle, salute, thumbs-up, then a new White House logo in which said house was mostly black. After the video came a landing page with a photo of Trump and the message “AMERICA IS BACK” written in a new, spindly serif font on a dark navy background. Unmistakably, the design evokes the concept of “dark mode,” the default app setting for guys who take themselves very seriously and who relish the idea that they may be edgy and cool. (A friend of mine used to react to people putting their phones in dark mode by saying “Okay, Batman.”) By the way, the site is no longer available in Spanish.



Read: We're all in ‘dark mode' now



Americans don't need the White House website to explain to them the attitude of this administration—Trump's actions and the consequences of them are plain to see. Yet the White House website is a record of an era: Looking back at the Bush years, I was struck by the plainness of the design, but also the gentle and classic expressions of patriotism that were about as jarring as an American-flag postage stamp. If WhiteHouse.gov is a chapter in the story of the second Trump administration, what is it saying?



Not a design expert myself, I asked Pamela Lee, a professor of modern and contemporary art at Yale, to take a look at the site. I told her I thought the dramatic darkening of the page scanned to me as creepy and menacing, but she called this a matter of perspective. “You read it as spooky,” she said. “Some folks might come to it and think it represents something serious, somber, and masculine.” (Appropriate, maybe, for a return to power.)



The same “dark mode” font treatment and color scheme have been used on the White House social-media pages since the first days of the new administration, marking another departure from the previous anodyne style. As my colleague Charlie Warzel wrote in March, on X, the White House is now a troll account, borrowing its snide visual language and tone from some of the internet's most cynical spaces and deploying this style to mock and dehumanize people.



These updates are apparently part of a larger project. In August, Trump announced the creation of a National Design Studio led by an Airbnb co-founder and Tesla board member, Joe Gebbia, one of the DOGE figures who was seen as a successor to Elon Musk after Musk's departure from Washington. (One of the National Design Studio's first projects was the website for the Trump Gold Card, a U.S. visa that will be granted only to those who can “make a gift of $1 million” to “substantially benefit” the United States.)



This new team reportedly replaces a group of United States Digital Service and General Services Administration employees, many of whom resigned or were fired during the DOGE cuts earlier this year. It is tasked with modernizing the government's digital services, but it also promises to beautify them. A launch page for the National Design Studio specifically names the Apple Store as a north star. (The White House initially responded to my request for an interview with the new team, but didn't respond to subsequent attempts to schedule one.)



A week after announcing the design studio, Trump signed an executive order titled “Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,” which states that classical styles emulating ancient Greece and Rome are the new “default” for government buildings. This sounds like a bit of a mishmash, but I can kind of see the vision. It's familiar as one that has been popular in Silicon Valley for years, where a survey might find that the most beautiful things ever created are Apple devices and the Roman empire.



This hybrid look is shared by many “network state” projects that have emerged in recent years. Those projects, which boast funding from the likes of Sam Altman, Marc Andreessen, and Peter Thiel, promise total freedom for people who regard themselves as overly constrained by our current democracy. They tend to combine elements of sleek, modern design with images and references drawn from the distant past, when men were great, spears were shiny, and buildings were intimidating. They like the look of Roman- and Greek-sculpture busts, for instance, but photoshopped with gradient overlays and sci-fi elements. Another tech-world project called More Monuments is currently working on building a 500-foot-tall statue of George Washington in a classical style but made of stainless steel, which they are funding in part with a crypto token called GEORGE; they plan to call it The Colossus of George.



Trump's personal taste is all over the place. He leans more toward the gilded, his own interior-design preference more toward Versailles. But his chosen architect for the gigantic new White House ballroom is a member of the National Civic Art Society, a nonprofit whose goal is promoting classical architecture, and his selection of Gebbia, who went to the Rhode Island School of Design and cites the Bauhaus movement as inspiration, suggests that he is on board with the Apple-meets-Rome combination.



When I spoke with Toby Norris, an art-history professor at Assumption University who contributed to the recent Routledge book Interrogating the Visual Culture of Trumpism, he said he didn't think that Trump had a coherent aesthetic vision. Instead, he sees “a kind of patchwork of all these things that different people who have influence on him have been pushing.” The executive order on architecture, for instance, was reportedly “spearheaded” in 2020 by the National Civic Art Society. Trump issued a version of it at the end of his first term but it was invalidated by the Biden administration almost immediately.



When Trump presents the idea of a return to the classical, it's in a populist tone. Both the 2020 and 2025 orders argue that people dislike the Brutalist government buildings of the second half of the 20th century, and that a revival of classical architecture would be a way of giving people what they want. Critics have countered that classical architecture has taken on a more authoritarian reputation over time. It's the architecture of ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy. “But it's also the architecture of the Roman empire,” Norris said. The later classical architecture of Rome was on a grander scale—more imperial and assertive and over-the-top, he told me. “And then people point out that's exactly what Hitler liked,” he added brightly.



At the end of the day, the “dark mode” online aesthetic paired with the offline return to a fantasy of the awe-inspiring past is not much more than a vibe—a porridge of references to power and control. When I spoke with Lee, she noted that the right has recently been reaching into the “grab bag” of history and looking for “moments that represented either the golden ages of this or that or kind of cusp moments.” And the gloomy website I pointed to seemed, to her, to represent a darkness before a dawn, if ham-handedly.



Whatever the intention, it would probably be easy enough to sell these ideas to Trump simply by calling them beautiful. “Trump uses the word beauty all the time,” Norris observed. “It's obviously a sort of talisman for him, this word beauty.” People can disagree about what's beautiful, of course. In her 1999 classic, On Beauty and Being Just, Elaine Scarry argued that spontaneous glimpses of beauty are what inspire in ordinary people the pursuit of truth and justice. I guess from another perspective, it could just mean “winning.”

What the Trump administration is portraying as a drug mission may be about a lot more.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The videos of carnage on the open seas have, by now, become almost routine: A small, fast-moving boat skips along the waves. Seconds later, it erupts into a ball of flame after munitions flying too quickly to be seen on camera strike their target. By the end of the short clip, huge clouds of smoke fill the screen. After one such air strike last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the four people on board—who were alleged drug runners—the way the United States once depicted al-Qaeda operatives: They are, in Hegseth's telling, “combatants,” foot soldiers in a foreign terrorist organization that is seeking to “poison our people” and who therefore must be eliminated by any means.

“These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!!” Hegseth wrote.

There are a few holes in the defense secretary's account. For one thing, the boats—there have been four of them—have not been carrying enough fuel to travel from the South American coast directly to the United States. For another, the administration has not said what kind of drugs it is seeking, through the strikes, to stop from entering. But relative to some of its neighbors, Venezuela is neither a major producer nor a significant transit hub for drugs. (Fentanyl, the drug that the president said is “killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people,” doesn't come through the Caribbean at all.) The United States has also not publicly revealed why it believes that those on board these boats are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang and the cartel that is the ostensible target. Even some of the president's supporters on Capitol Hill have said that the legal case for military strikes seems dubious at best.

Read: Fentanyl doesn't come through the Caribbean

Yet White House officials have shrugged off questions about the strikes, believing the attacks have a legitimate security rationale and, importantly, are politically popular. “No one is going to mourn a murderous, drug-dealing gang member,” one told us.

Both hawkish and isolationist figures in Donald Trump's orbit have found reasons to support the strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for instance, is a hard-liner on Latin America who has advocated for the ouster of leftist strongmen, including in Cuba, Nicaragua, and, of course, Venezuela. Rubio—whose home state of Florida has a large Venezuelan population—has spoken against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, who stole the country's most recent election and is not recognized by the United States as the legitimate Venezuelan leader. In Rubio's mind, perhaps, the strikes could weaken Maduro's political and economic grip and bring about regime change.

Then there are the senior officials who see Venezuela as a means to project a tough-guy, defender-of-the-homeland image. Stephen Miller views the air strikes as an opportunity to paint immigrants as a dangerous menace, according to one of the White House officials. Vice President J. D. Vance, though often inclined toward isolationism, has pushed the necessity of defending U.S. borders. And Hegseth, who prefers to be known as the war secretary, is seeking a means of projecting military strength in a region where Defense Department planners hope to reassert American primacy. Finally, there's Trump himself, who wants to score a foreign-policy victory amid frustrations over his inability to end the war in Ukraine. One close ally of the president's told us that he was also drawn to the chance to take decisive action, as he did with June's Iran bombings. “He can give the order and watch it explode. It's clear-cut and simple, and no American gets hurt,” that ally told us.

“The administration doesn't see strength in deterrence but in action. This is about optics,” one former U.S. official told us. The administration posts video clips from the strikes on social media within hours of conducting them, the former official noted, an unusually fast turnaround.

Others in the administration—such as Richard Grenell, Trump's special envoy to the regime—have favored trying to work with the Maduro government instead. But those efforts appear to be on hold after Trump ordered the end of diplomatic talks last week. (Grenell did not respond to a request for comment.) Administration officials have not decided whether they will try to push Maduro out, but the strikes are also a way to test what they can get away with in the region and whether Maduro has any means to respond. So far, the administration sees little downside.

“Whatever happens,” the former official said, “the administration will say they lessened the flow of drugs, no matter how slight or small or that we murdered people in international waters.”

The Paria Peninsula, on Venezuela's eastern coast, is known for its golden-sand beaches, its forested hills, and its blue-green waters. It's also a center of Venezuelan drug trafficking. Off its coasts, the U.S. has been hunting boats.

We talked by phone with Beatriz, who has lived in the area most of her life. The 37-year-old recalled that when she was a girl, her classmates laughed at her for not knowing that the colorful fishing boats in the harbor, known as peñeros, were in fact carrying drugs. (She asked to be identified only by her first name for fear of retribution.) The drug traffickers Beatriz knows run small operations. They might pay extortion fees to government officials, but they don't strike her as big players in an international crime syndicate. One man she knows from her village is a young father and fisherman who has no qualms about moving cocaine instead of fish when the opportunity presents itself and the money to be made is good.

On September 2, one of those peñeros was blown up by the United States military en route to Trinidad and Tobago, which lies about seven miles offshore. Since the first strike, military camps have become ubiquitous in the area as Maduro's regime prepares for a potential invasion.

In the past decade, a number of high-level Venezuelan officials have been convicted by American courts for trafficking cocaine to the United States—among them a Venezuelan general known as “El Pollo” and a couple of notorious relatives of Venezuela's first lady known as the “narco-nephews.” Also in the past decade, Tren de Aragua, which engages in drug trafficking, among other activities, has expanded beyond the country's borders and acquired a fearsome reputation.

Shortly after taking office, Trump declared Tren de Aragua to be a foreign terrorist organization that had “flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.” In July, the president ordered the Pentagon to target certain Latin American drug cartels. By August, there were eight naval vessels—including destroyers, a cruiser, and a littoral-combat ship—operating in the Caribbean Sea. By September, the first of four boats had been struck, and 21 alleged drug traffickers have now been killed. Last week, the administration sent a confidential notice to Congress signaling its intent to carry out more strikes. The campaign could extend inside Venezuelan territorial waters or include drone strikes inside its land borders, defense officials told us.

“The President determined these cartels are non-state armed groups, designated them as terrorist organizations, and determined that their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,” the administration wrote in the confidential notice, which we reviewed. “The President directed the Department of War to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.”

But it is far from clear that the ties between Maduro's government and Tren de Aragua are as extensive as the Trump administration has suggested, or that they exist at all. Ronna Risquez, author of the book El Tren De Aragua, told us there was “no evidence” that Maduro leads gang or drug-smuggling operations; an internal memo from the U.S. National Intelligence Council arrived at a similar conclusion. It's also not clear that Venezuelan drug operations, centralized or otherwise, are significant enough to merit the country being singled out as a threat to American lives. Venezuela is not a major cocaine or fentanyl producer. And even though most of the world's cocaine grows in neighboring Colombia, Venezuela is also not a major transit hub. As of 2020, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimated that three-quarters of South American cocaine reached the United States through the Pacific, one-sixth through Colombia's Caribbean shore, and only one-twelfth through Venezuela's Caribbean shore. (Of the four strikes, at least three targeted boats departed from Venezuela; a fourth may have left from Colombia.) And the drugs that do pass through Venezuela will typically also pass through other countries on their way to the United States. “A Venezuelan boat arriving all the way to the United States? To Miami? I have never seen that,” Risquez said, although she acknowledged that some boats have made it to Puerto Rico.

And yet, the idea that Maduro is a major drug lord is a key justification for the strikes. Maduro is “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said recently. She added that Maduro “uses” Tren de Aragua to “bring deadly drugs and violence” to the United States. During a Tuesday hearing on Capitol Hill, Bondi refused to give a legal justification for the strikes.

The idea that Maduro's regime runs a drug enterprise big enough to endanger American lives is also viewed skeptically in Venezuela, and not just among Maduro apologists. “If the argument is that drug trafficking is a good reason to threaten to invade a country, you'd have to invade Mexico first,” says Jose Guerra, who worked as an economist for Venezuela's central bank and then as an opposition lawmaker. The Venezuelan government, Guerra told us, has little incentive to engage in a risky, complex operation like drug trafficking when the country sits on the largest oil reserves in the world: “How many tons of drug would the Venezuelan government have to export to make the same amount of money it makes selling hundreds of thousands of barrels per day?” he asked us. “That's just a tale.” Venezuela's oil exports averaged 1.09 million barrels a day in September, the highest monthly level since February 2020. To make that kind of money selling drugs, you would probably need more than a few peñeros.

There are overlapping U.S. military missions under way in the Caribbean. Roughly 5,000 U.S. personnel, aboard approximately eight naval vessels operating in the region, are tasked with monitoring nearby boats. When the U.S. suspects that one is smuggling narcotics, standard practice calls for the Coast Guard, under its law-enforcement authorities, to board it and potentially seize it and detain those on board. But sometimes their assessments are off. Last month, the Coast Guard said in a statement that its forces boarded a ship “based on reasonable suspicion of illicit drug trafficking activity” but found none on board. (Local news reports said the vessel was carrying tuna.) In fiscal year 2025, the Coast Guard told us, it seized nearly 175,000 pounds of cocaine in the Caribbean.

In addition to the Coast Guard interdictions, there are also now the deadly missions. The U.S. Navy is rotating ships in and out of the area, but Defense officials have declined to say whether the strikes are coming from ships or drone operators based inside the United States. Nor has the military said what kind of munitions it is using in the strikes. Even if the Pentagon is being quiet about details of the operation, it is being vocal about the threat it is laying down—as is the president. “To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,"" Trump said in an address to the United Nations last month.

When the United States launched military campaigns against another nonstate actor, al-Qaeda, in the years after 9/11, there were questions about whether it was legally justified in conducting such strikes. The courts concluded that because the terror group had a mission to attack the U.S., the military could proceed. But Tren de Aragua's aims appear to be driven by finances, not ideology. Earl Matthews, a Pentagon lawyer, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during closed session last week that the designation of Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, coupled with Article II of the Constitution, which delineates the president's powers, was all the legal justification that the administration needs for the strikes. (Matthews did not respond to a request for comment.) But even Republicans balked at his description, one official familiar with the meeting told us. Declaring a group a foreign terrorist organization is typically used to allow the U.S. to target financing and other support for such groups, not to legally justify launching strikes. Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky publicly rebuked Vance on X last month after the vice president described the killing of drug traffickers as “the best use of our military.”

“What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,” Paul replied. Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told us in a statement that “every American should be alarmed that their President has decided he can wage secret wars against anyone he calls an enemy.”

Many Venezuelans, in the country and abroad, support the American military strikes, hoping that they will help push Maduro out of power. Regime opponents feel that they have exhausted all other options. Last year, opposition leader María Corina Machado was going to run against Maduro in national elections, but Maduro banned her candidacy after she garnered more than 95 percent of the primary vote. Still, her stand-in won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro, according to credible tallies from electoral observers. (The Venezuelan government refused to publish an official tally.) Maduro stayed in power and mounted a repression campaign against his critics. Machado has publicly welcomed the military strikes and frequently portrays Maduro as a drug kingpin. Maduro, she told Fox & Friends, is the “biggest threat to the national security of the United States.”

Read: Maduro takes the easy way out

The leadership of the opposition movement rejects the notion that an American intervention would be just another example of unwelcome meddling on the part of the United States. “I know there are voices that say that this could be another Libya, another Iraq. Not at all,” David Smolansky, a close Machado aide, told us. Through the elections, Machado proved her legitimacy as opposition leader. “That makes it so different from other experiences across the world.” Smolansky wasn't concerned that, given the history of American interventions in Latin America, an incursion might end unhappily. “The history of military incursion of the U.S. in Latin America? It has not happened for 36 years,” he told us. “The last one was in Panama, which, by the way, was successful.”

Just how it is that destroying small boats could ultimately lead to Maduro's downfall is not entirely clear. Supporters argue that the strikes could have tens of millions of dollars of economic impact that would put a dent in Maduro's economic clout and undermine the regime's authority. “Lacking legitimacy, the only way Maduro stays in power is through repression and terror financed by illicit income from drug trafficking and other criminal activities,” Smolansky told us. Not everyone in the Venezuelan opposition shares the belief that U.S. meddling will be helpful. Tomas Straka, a Venezuelan historian, told us that intervention could go many different ways. Panama may have been successful for the U.S., he noted, but Haiti, in 1994, was far less so. An invasion, Straka said, “is a roulette that I'd rather not play with.”

But Straka's perspective is not widely shared within the opposition. A contingent of Venezuelans in America, one that's vocal on social media, is cheering on the attacks. Some are enthusiastic Trump supporters; others dislike the president and resent his treatment of Venezuelans. Some believe that Maduro is indeed a narco-dictator; others have their doubts. Whatever the case, they don't care if “regime change” is Trump's goal; they just hope it will be the result.

The president's ego inspires plenty of bad choices, but his desire for a Peace Prize is proving useful.

“I'd kill for a Nobel Peace Prize,” the comedian Steven Wright once joked. This may be unironically true of President Donald Trump. But of course you are not meant to kill for this award. And because the prize cannot be won through threats, bribery, or any of Trump's other customary tools, his only remaining avenue is to actually encourage peace. Which, amazingly enough, appears to be happening.

The newly announced agreement between Israel and Hamas may or may not develop into a genuine peace deal. At a minimum, however, it appears likely to result in the release of the remaining hostages.

It is apparent that the agreement grew directly out of Trump's desperate thirst for the Nobel. Although he has whined in public about not getting the award—“I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,” he said at the White House in February—he seems to have grasped that winning it requires actual diplomacy. Accordingly, he has engaged in activities such as pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to support a plan to end the war, threatening Hamas with total destruction, negotiating with Arab states, and other normal presidential behavior.

Yair Rosenberg: Trump's plan to finally end the Gaza war

This same impulse has reshaped his policy toward Russia and Ukraine. At the outset of his term, Trump adopted his customary pro-Russian stance, blaming Ukraine for having started the war and attacking the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the Oval Office for being insufficiently grateful for U.S. aid.

But Trump's posture has changed. The administration has halted the flow of some weapons to Ukraine, but it hasn't stopped intelligence support. Trump seems to have realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop the war until he has either conquered Ukraine or destroyed its sovereignty, and that Ukraine won't submit. Ergo, the thing that stands in the way of a peace deal, and hence Trump's peace prize, is Putin.

Having been forced to choose between his habit of believing everything Putin says and his hope of winning a Nobel Peace Prize, Trump has chosen the latter. This is a good thing.

Yair Rosenberg: What's missing from Trump's Gaza peace plan

To be sure, Trump's desperate thirst to win this prize is of a piece with his general insatiable need to be flattered and praised—a desire that spurs plenty of bad choices, such as pushing to have anybody who opposes him thrown into prison. But in this case, it can be credited with inspiring his most constructive, prosocial impulses as president.

The challenge the prize committee faces is that if dangling the award in front of Trump encourages him to work hard to end conflicts, and perhaps to not start new ones, then they have to wonder what will happen if he gets it. Once given, these awards can't be revoked. A Trump who has secured his Nobel Peace Prize might feel tempted to go after the ego gratifications that come with military conquest. (He is already dipping his toes into these waters within his attacks on “Venezuelan drug smugglers,” who may or may not be drug smugglers or even Venezuelans.)

In an ideal world, the possibility of creating peace would be all the motive Trump needs to try to make it happen. But if the ego gratification of an award from a Norwegian committee didn't encourage leaders to work harder to end conflicts, the award wouldn't have been created in the first place.

The mood in the city is tense.

This week, Texas National Guard troops arrived in Chicago.

The deployment was the latest turn in the Trump administration's efforts to more aggressively marshal boots on the ground to abet its mass deportation efforts in some American cities.

The situation on the ground in Chicago before the arrival of the National Guard was already tense. The mission, which President Donald Trump has named “Operation Midway Blitz,” had US Customs and Border Protection officials hanging around high-visibility areas of Chicago and suburban neighborhoods, conducting at least one military-style raid on an apartment building.

Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has been vocal in his opposition to Trump's moves. In response, the president called for the governor and the mayor of Chicago to be jailed on Truth Social.

Dan Petrella of the Chicago Tribune spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King to break down what has happened in the last month in the city, and how the intense federal attention has affected Chicago's residents. Below is an excerpt of their conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Chicago is a big city, but there have been some high-profile instances of violence in the streets in the last couple of days. What is the mood there like?

Things are very tense. There's reports all over the city and the suburbs of confrontations with agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We see videos posted all over social media and hear from sources of folks having encounters with them on the streets. And there's a lot of worry about what might happen to escalate the situation if military troops are sent out under ostensible purposes of protecting these federal agents who've been operating at ramped-up level here in the city and surrounding area for the last month or so.

Have you seen what President Trump is saying about the mayor and the governor?

I did, and yes, he is saying that they should be sent to jail, which is not entirely surprising. I mean, I guess we shouldn't excuse that kind of language coming from the president, but it is not unusual from what we've heard from this president.

All right, let's go back to where this all starts, and it begins with President Trump and something called “Operation Midway Blitz.” What is this?

This is a title that they have given to this sort of stepped-up immigration enforcement activity that they began toward the beginning of September. This came after a couple weeks of the president talking about violent crime in Chicago and the possibility of calling up National Guard troops to deal with violent crime.

That sort of shifted to stepping up immigration enforcement, which is something we've seen from the president before. They did a round of sweeps and things like that in the early days of his administration — even brought Dr. Phil and a camera crew to follow around ICE agents as they arrested people. They have done what I would characterize as a military-style operation at an apartment building in the South Shore neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago where there have been reports of them detaining and zip-tying young children who were there.

And then, the administration sort of produces these highly produced, almost Hollywood-style, videos that they post on social media to promote their cause and gather support for this operation. And they've said that they've detained about a thousand people. It's really hard to get them to release actual, full information on who they've arrested. There have been several instances where there have been people who weren't the supposed “worst of the worst,” but just people who got sort of caught up as collateral detentions. We saw a family in Millennium Park a couple weekends ago that was taken into custody. So, it's been very sort of scattershot and chaotic from the point of view of folks out on the street.

The National Guard is not supposed to be deployed without the permission of a state's governor. Gov. Pritzker is giving a lot of main character energy the past couple of weeks. How has he been making his case, and how have you seen the tenor change in the last couple of days?

I think the way you characterize it is very fair. He has tried to state — forcefully, and frequently, and on seemingly every national media outlet — that there's not a crisis situation here in Chicago or in Illinois that warrants the use of National Guard, there is no wide-scale unrest really going on anywhere in the Chicago area right now that would warrant that sort of thing. He's really been outspoken about that from the moment that the president started bringing this idea up again.

Last summer, Dan, I was in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, and I spent a couple of days reporting from the South Side. And I talked to a lot of people who were very angry about illegal immigration. They said the South Side has been disinvested for years, people are coming in from Venezuela and they're getting money, they're getting schooling, they're getting city services, and we never got that. Many of those people were voting for Donald Trump because of immigration. 

So I wonder, you said these raids, some of them have been taking place on the South Side — are there people in Chicago who will say, “This is what I voted for, this is what we wanted?”

I would say that there is a very loud minority of voices that will say that, and I think the administration has been very active in highlighting some of those voices on social media, calling attention to folks who are sort of known quantities at City Hall, for example, where they show up and speak during public comment at city council meetings and things like that regularly.

That is not to say that those voices don't exist. I don't believe that they represent sort of a large swath of the public here in Chicago. I would note that, overall, President Trump only improved his vote total statewide in Illinois by about 2,000 votes from 2020 to 2024. So regardless of how it affects voting, there are the people who feel disaffected. And there's been long tensions in Chicago between the Black community and the Latino community, and I think politicians over the years have sort of stoked those divisions.

There is still, at the end of the day, a question here about what the point of this is — of sending the Guard into Chicago against the governor's wishes. Some people say it's about optics. President Trump is enjoying the memes. And some people say it looks like the administration is hoping for a confrontation. Now, I am asking you to speculate here, but I wonder, you've done deep reporting on this — what do you think the administration is after right now?

That is a very good question, and I wish I had a better answer. I think that's part of the problem, is that their real aim is unclear. I do think that there is a shock-and-awe approach to this, trying to project this image of power. And I do think they've obviously been told in federal court in California that they shouldn't be doing what they've been trying to do with these Guard troops. They've been told in federal court in Oregon; we're waiting for a federal judge here in Chicago later this week to rule on the state's request for a temporary restraining order.

So it's really, really hard to say what the end game is here. And that's honestly one of the questions that the federal judge here in Chicago has tried to get the Trump administration to answer in court: where these troops will be sent, what their activities are going to be once they're here. And those answers haven't been provided.

It's worth celebrating. But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿

At last, Israel and Hamas have reached a deal — of a sort. On Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump announced that the warring parties in Gaza agreed to implement the “first phase” of the peace plan he presented in September. While this doesn't quite mean the war is completely finished just yet, it appears to be an earnest attempt by Israel and Hamas to begin ending two years of bloody conflict, destruction, and despair.

Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. It has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, starved and displaced most of Gaza's 2 million residents, and reduced most of the territory's buildings and infrastructure to rubble.

The fate of the hostages has also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, and Portugal to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's UN General Assembly.

Now we'll find out if the peace can hold, and if so, what the “day after” actually looks like. Wednesday's deal means, the parties say, that all Israeli hostages who are still being held in Gaza will be returned, beginning with those still living, estimated to be around 20 people, as soon as Monday; the remains of the dead Israeli hostages (approximately 30) will reportedly be returned in phases afterward. In exchange Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, approximately 1,700 of whom were captured during the current conflict. Israel also says its army will retreat to an agreed upon line in Gaza as the first part of its withdrawal from the territory.

But most importantly, much is still unknown about the terms of the agreement that Israel and Hamas have reached. We don't know whether Hamas has agreed to completely disarm. We also don't know the extent to which Israeli troops are withdrawing from Gaza, or the timing of that withdrawal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is meeting Thursday to vote on accepting the deal, and the ceasefire has not yet begun; Israeli strikes on the Strip were reported even as celebrations unfolded across both Gaza and Israel.

This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. Indeed, he reportedly had to be strong-armed pretty aggressively by Trump into agreeing to it.

And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. If the deal actually being implemented resembles at all what was first announced by Trump at the beginning of the month, Israel will keep a troop presence in Gaza and the capability to periodically launch future strikes against militants there. Hamas will not control Gaza nor — for the foreseeable future — will the Palestinian Authority. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The seemingly impossible dilemmas faced by the Netanyahu government turned out not to be dilemmas at all.

Lessons will be taken from this, by both Israel and the rest of the world. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future.

It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. The days of “mowing the grass” — degrading Hamas's capabilities without getting embroiled in a long and costly struggle to wipe the group out entirely — were clearly over.

If Israel were to try to put an end to Hamas entirely, international observers had suggestions. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024 that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. But, he suggested, Israel should learn from the relative success of the counterinsurgency tactics the US employed in Iraq after 2007.

The true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out.

“Killing and capturing terrorists and insurgents is insufficient,” Petraeus wrote in Foreign Affairs back then. “[T]he key to solidifying security gains and stemming the recruitment of new adversaries is holding territory, protecting civilians, and providing governance and services to them.”

This is plainly not what Israel did. Commanders weakened safeguards meant to protect noncombatants. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Food aid was, at times, blocked entirely.

Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by the Biden administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans.

It seems likely that the war is going to deal a significant blow to the idea of “counterinsurgency” doctrine: that the best way to deal with an insurgency is to win over the local population — to “clear, hold, and build” your way to victory. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq.

Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments.

In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. But of course, there are caveats. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. As Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal writes, increasingly, “solidarity with the Palestinian cause—and hostility to Zionism—have become the political markers of a new generation.” The full extent of the consequences for Israel may not be evident for years. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel.

And yet, other countries are likely to take the lesson that crushing the enemy is worth the international opprobrium that comes with significant civilian casualties. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. When it comes to crushing a counterinsurgency, you don't have to “clear, hold, build.” You can just crush.

This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering.

The coming days will tell whether this is just a hostage exchange and prelude to a new phase of the conflict, or a lasting peace. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year.

But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. When questioned about the way they conduct those wars, governments are likely to point to Israel's example.

Dan Springer, the former CEO of electronic signature company DocuSign, told Business Insider that there are two things people can do to lower their risks of being laid off — one big-picture and one smaller.

Springer was DocuSign's CEO from 2017 to 2022. He left DocuSign's board in April and joined Ironclad, a Franklin Templeton-backed contract management software company, as CEO in the same month.

""The macro piece is, you need to invest in your capabilities, and as new technologies come along, you have to embrace them,"" Springer said.

Springer referenced the rise of Apple's iPhone, which launched in 2007 and displaced incumbent players like Blackberry.

""When the iPhone came out and mobility became part of business, there were some people who said, 'I'm just staying with my Blackberry. I'm using it for emails, and I don't care about apps.' Five years later, they're a dinosaur,"" he added.

Springer said the micro factor relates to how invested people are in their companies' work. He said that people who want to be the ""most employable"" need to be ""really committed to the company and constantly just apply yourself to make your company successful.""

""Companies aren't perfect, but for the most part, companies figure out who the best employees are. They want employees that are culture builders, the ones that are working hard to serve our customers, doing all the right things,"" Springer said.

""If you really apply yourself and don't become cynical about that, then I think you become really valuable to the company, and you're always going to be needed,"" he added.

DocuSign's stock soared in the pandemic, but cratered about 80% from its summer 2021 peak to Springer's departure a year later.

Springer's tenure as DocuSign CEO coincided with the rapid expansion of the company's workforce. The company went from 2,255 employees in January 2018 to 7,461 employees in January 2022.

After Springer stepped down as CEO in June 2022, DocuSign underwent three rounds of layoffs.

The first round took place in September 2022, when DocuSign said it was laying off nearly 700 employees, or 9% of its workforce.

Months later, in February 2023, DocuSign said it was laying off about 700 employees, or 10% of its workforce.

Its last round of layoffs took place in February 2024, when DocuSign laid off 440 workers, or 6% of its employees. The company said in an SEC filing that it had 6,838 employees as of January 31, 2025.

Mass layoffs have gripped the tech industry in recent years. In July, Microsoft said it was laying off around 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its total workforce. The company previously announced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers in May.

In 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg embarked on what he called a ""year of efficiency."" Zuckerberg said in March 2023 that he was axing 10,000 employees, just months after the social media giant had laid off 11,000 employees in November 2022.

That's on top of the threat posed by AI, which some business leaders say could result in fewer jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a May interview with Axios that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level office jobs in the next five years.

In September, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that AI was probably having an effect on the job market, though it is ""hard to say how big it is.""

""It may be that companies or other institutions that have been hiring younger people right out of college are able to use AI more than they had in the past,"" Powell said.

""That may be part of the story. It's also part of the story, though, that job creation more broadly has slowed down,"" he added.

Ukraine's escalating attacks on Russia's energy sector are biting into its economy and war chest, forcing Moscow to tap into emergency gas reserves, Kyiv said this week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday night that ""long-range sanctions against Russia,"" a reference to its deep-strike campaign targeting Russian energy facilities, is ""achieving truly significant results."" Moscow's vast oil industry is a critical sector, with oil and natural gas exports fueling its war efforts in Ukraine.

Ukraine has been targeting infrastructure across Russia, including refineries, with long-range weapons to turn up the pressure on Moscow.

""The fuel shortage in Russia is already approaching 20% — this specifically concerns their gasoline,"" Zelenskyy said, citing Ukrainian data. ""They've now begun tapping into diesel reserves, which they've been saving for a rainy day.""

Ukrainian drones have struck targets far beyond the front lines, sometimes hundreds of miles into Russian territory. A strike on Friday, for instance, hit a facility more than 800 miles away, underscoring Kyiv's long reach.

A source in the Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, said that nearly 40% of the capacity of Russian refineries is ""already idle"" because of the long-range strike campaign.

""The SBU continues to cause serious damage to the Russian economy, working on the facilities of the oil and gas industry of the Russian Federation,"" the source said after the strike last week, per a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.

""The decrease in petrodollar revenues to the budget directly affects the aggressor's ability to continue the war against Ukraine,"" they added.

Ukraine has primarily used homemade missiles and drones to strike deep inside Russia, investing heavily in the production of weapons as a workaround to the restrictions and shortages it faced in using Western-provided cruise and tactical ballistic missiles to hit across the border.

Zelenskyy on Wednesday praised Ukraine's weapons makers and said they were working to ensure that Russia bears the cost of the war. Their equipment has become more accurate, he added.

The attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure have leaned predominantly on drones; however, Ukraine has also used domestically produced cruise missiles and hybrid missile-drones to strike Russian targets.

Though Ukraine has received tens of billions of dollars in security assistance from Western countries, Zelenskyy has also pushed Ukraine's defense industry to contribute a greater share of domestically produced weaponry into the hands of soldiers.

On Monday, he said that more than 40% of the weaponry Ukraine uses at the front is Ukrainian-made, adding that it must be at least 50% by the end of the year.

Russia's energy infrastructure has long been a target. The oil and gas sector is a significant source of income for Russia, which, in turn, helps fund the invasion. This one industrial sector is estimated to be worth approximately 20% of Russia's GDP on average.

Kyle Glen, an investigator with the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience who tracks Ukrainian strikes on Russia's energy sector, told Business Insider that there have been 24 attacks on oil refineries since the start of August.

The ability to strike these facilities has been crucial for Ukraine, even when it faces challenges such as battlefield setbacks or shortages of weapons and ammunition from its partners. Kyiv views these efforts as an opportunity to weaken Russia and project power.

The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Ukraine as its forces continue to defend against the invading Russians, with relatively static front lines and mounting losses.

The escalating campaign comes amid Ukraine's expanding ability to strike high-profile Russian targets — like warships, aircraft, bases, factories, and ammunition production sites — far beyond its borders, with its own weaponry, hampering Russia's war machine and preventing the conflict from being fought solely on Ukrainian soil.

Russia is also hitting Ukraine with deep strikes. Nightly attacks, consisting of large numbers of drones and missiles, hammer civilian areas and critical infrastructure, including the country's energy sector. Bombardments sometimes involve hundreds of munitions as Moscow ramps up its own weapons production.

Russian attacks have resulted in outages and blackouts, and have left Ukraine more reliant on imported energy, but they have not decimated a major national income source like the attacks in Russia have.

OpenAI has raised concerns with European Union antitrust enforcers over potentially harmful conduct by the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.

The world's largest startup recently took its gripes to the office of EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera, highlighting “difficulties” it faces “in competing with entrenched companies” while pressing watchdogs to intervene to “avoid the lock-in of customers by large platforms,” according to notes on the Sept. 24 meeting.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Two funding bills that could end the federal government shutdown failed to pass in Senate votes for the seventh time on Thursday.

The votes on dueling Republican and Democratic stop-gap funding proposals came on the ninth day of the shutdown, and as fallout from the crisis spread.

The IRS on Wednesday said that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce because of the lack of funding by Congress.

Lawmakers showed no indication that they are open to yielding on their respective party's demands.

The Senate voted against the GOP-backed bill, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, in a 54-45 vote.

Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, as well as Angus King of Maine, one of two independents in the Democratic caucus, all again voted with Republicans, as they have done on prior votes.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted again with Democrats to oppose the GOP measure. 

Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the Senate, need about eight votes from the Democratic caucus in order to pass their short-term funding bill in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required for passage.

In the last round of voting on Wednesday, the GOP bill was rejected 54-45, while the Democrats' version fell short in a 47-52 tally.

On Thursday, the Senate rejected the Democratic bill in a 47-50 party-line vote.

President Donald Trump announced plans in September to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a move that could pose a challenge to companies, particularly in the technology sector, that rely heavily on highly skilled foreign workers.

""Now this is a big change because the typical fee is currently a couple thousand dollars,"" said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. ""So this could potentially change the program pretty significantly.""

""The whole idea is, no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers,"" said U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. ""They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee. So it's just not economic.""

The H-1B visa program, created by Congress under the Immigration Act of 1990, allows U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals on a temporary basis for positions that require highly specialized expertise. H-1B visa approvals, which are valid for three years and can be extended for up to six years, are capped at 65,000 per year, with an additional carve-out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees.

""The program was designed to bring in people, especially since technology was starting to ramp up in particular, bring in people that the U.S. did not have in terms of actual labor supply,"" said Roth.

Big Tech, in particular, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. According to the latest data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google were among the top 10 employers of H-1B holders in fiscal 2025. Notable past recipients of the H-1B visa include Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

The Trump administration, which separately proposed changes to the H-1B lottery selection system last month to prioritize higher-paid foreign workers, has defended the reforms as a way to push American companies to hire more domestic talent.

""If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,"" said Lutnick.

Meanwhile, critics of the fee hikes say the move could stifle innovation by restricting the flow of overseas talent to the United States.

""If you think about people like Elon Musk, for example, when they were startups, they were on a very slim budget and working out of their garage,"" said Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""All of those business never would exist today if that was the situation that we found ourselves in.""

""On one side, you don't want it to be that cheap labor comes and replaces America opportunity. I think there's some truth to that,"" said Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. ""On the other side, you don't want to have labor not be there and actually meet the needs of these startups and then slow down progress for our businesses. Nobody wants that. ""

Watch the video above to find out the impact of President Trump's H-1B visa reforms on Big Tech — and how the new $100,000 fee could reshape hiring strategies for American companies going forward.

In this article

PepsiCo on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, as international growth offset another quarter of declining volume in North America.

Shares of the company rose more than 2% in morning trading.

Here's what the company reported for its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Pepsi reported third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.6 billion, or $1.90 per share, down from $2.93 billion, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, Pepsi earned $2.29 per share.

Net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion. Stripping out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, Pepsi's organic revenue increased 1.3% in the quarter.

However, the Frito-Lay and Gatorade owner is still seeing softer demand for its products. Pepsi's worldwide volume for both food and drinks fell 1% during the quarter. The metric strips out pricing and foreign exchange fluctuations.

CEO Ramon Laguarta said on the company's conference call that volume was also softer as Pepsi shifts to smaller packaging sizing to appeal to price-conscious consumers. While that shift hurts volume, it lifts revenue.

In particular, Pepsi has struggled in its home market in recent quarters, leading the company to invest back into its brands and to explore cost-cutting measures.

""We also expect our North America business to deliver improved growth and profitability trends as we aggressively reduce costs, accelerate innovation and further sharpen our price pack architecture initiatives,"" executives said in prepared remarks.

Pepsi Foods North America, which includes brands like Doritos, Quaker Oats and Pearl Milling, reported that its volume fell 4% in the fiscal third quarter. The company has been investing in more ""permissible"" snack offerings, like Stacy's pita chips and Quaker rice cakes. It has more snack options on the way, like Doritos Protein, which aims to cash in on a consumer shift toward protein-rich foods.

Pepsi also unveiled new packaging for Lay's potato chips that highlighted its lack of artificial colors and flavors, and pledged to launch Doritos and Cheetos ""NKD,"" which will not use synthetic dyes or flavors. Pepsi and other brands have moved to cut out those ingredients in part due to pressure from the Trump administration.

Likewise, Pepsi is planning to use more olive and avocado oils in its snacks; the ""Make America Healthy Again"" movement has villainized canola oil and other seed oils, despite a lack of scientific evidence.

The company has also been trying to attract price-conscious consumers by making its multipacks and single-serving snacks cheaper.

Improving the performance of the North American food segment ""is a top priority for the business,"" executives said.

Pepsi's North American beverage unit saw volume shrink 3%, although Laguarta noted ""improved momentum"" in the business. The company's namesake soda grew both volume and revenue in the quarter, while new acquisition Poppi has seen its year-to-date retail sales climb more than 50% compared with the year-ago period, executives said.

In September, Pepsi divested its ownership of Rockstar Energy in the U.S. and Canada to rival energy drink maker Celsius. The beverage giant owns an 11% stake in Celsius.

That same month, activist investor Elliott Investment Management unveiled a $4 billion stake in Pepsi. In a presentation and letter sent to the company's board, Elliott pushed for a number of changes, including potentially refranchising its North American bottling network and reinvesting back into its soda brands. Laguarta said on the company's conference call that both Pepsi and Elliott share the belief that the company is undervalued.

""We're going to have conversations in the coming weeks and months,"" Laguarta said.

The company also reiterated its full-year outlook. It still expects its core constant currency earnings per share to be roughly unchanged from the prior year and organic revenue to grow by a low single-digit percentage.

Pepsi also announced on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Jamie Caulfield plans to retire. Walmart U.S. CFO Steve Schmitt will succeed him, effective Nov. 10.

In this article

Google is taking another shot at selling businesses on artificial intelligence agents by introducing subscriptions featuring agents that perform specific work tasks.

Gemini Enterprise targets large organizations, starting at a monthly fee of $30 per person. Gemini Business, for smaller clients, costs $21 per person each month. The offerings enable corporate workers to build agents that draw on data from Box, Microsoft and Salesforce products.

Premade Google agents for software development, data science and customer engagement also come with the new Gemini subscriptions, along with access to agents from Workday and other companies. They include the capabilities of Agentspace, an agent building product Google announced in December. Google will upgrade current Agentspace clients to Gemini Enterprise or Gemini Business free of charge through the course of their contracts, a spokesperson said.

Gemini subscriptions come with Model Armor, a feature for inspecting and blocking requests and responses in AI chats, so organizations don't need to fuss with setting it up.

The launch comes three days after OpenAI showed how people can access tools from third-party apps in ChatGPT. Google and Microsoft, meanwhile, are looking to get enterprises hooked on agents that take care of some processes, so employees can do other things. Both companies sell services aimed at developers and at nontechnical workers. Neither Gemini Enterprise nor Gemini Business require coding.

""We've seen people from consulting services companies, telecommunications companies, software companies, hospitality companies and a variety of different manufacturing companies all using these, and in a variety of scenarios,"" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google's cloud group, in a media briefing.

Kurian, who accelerated the unit's year-over-year revenue growth back above 30% in the second quarter, named cruise line Virgin Voyages as a Gemini Enterprise early adopter.

Firms are more likely to be exploring or testing AI agents than putting them into production, said Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner. But Google's handling of security and governance should ease concerns among big companies evaluating agent systems, Dekate said.

Google's new Gemini subscriptions depend on the company's Gemini AI models for working with text, images and videos. Google and other model makers regularly release new versions, and enterprises want to avoid getting stuck with lagging models when selecting agent software, Dekate said.

""How Google is able to leverage this unified messaging in the Gemini 3.0 launch sequence, which is coming soon, I think, will also be a crucial litmus test,"" he said. ""In other words, will they be able to offer a same-day sort of innovation cycle, or is this going to be staggered in terms of adoption patterns?""

Also on Thursday, Amazon's cloud unit announced Quick Suite, a service in which workers without technical skills can create AI agents, with connections to over 50 applications.

The CEO of AI data firm Snowflake isn't letting the stock market distract him from ambitions to become ""one of the great technology companies in this world,"" he told CNBC.

The company — a cloud data storage platform — made history when it became the largest-ever software IPO when it went public five years ago, and its share price is currently rallying amid an AI boom.

However, as investors flock to AI-related companies, fears of a bubble have emerged, leaving the market keen to distinguish between hype and reality in a bid to avoid being burned in the event of a pull-back.   

""You don't control the stock price,"" Sridhar Ramaswamy told ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. Shares of Snowflake rose 6.5% on Wednesday and are up over 60% year-to-date.

""My focus very much is on value creation. We have to earn dollars, every single dollar at a time, so we are focused on the quarter, focused on the year, but, much more, also on the value that we create with customers, or the long term, the stock market will settle itself,"" he added.   

His comments came after Snowflake investor Michael Speiser last week sold shares to net over $11 million, while senior VP Vivek Raghu Nathan made around $2.6 million in a share sale at the end of last month.

Ramaswamy declined to comment on individuals' sales but added: ""I am not selling any stock, I'm very much in favor of the long-term value that Snowflake is going to be creating, and the sales tend to be very, very modest.""  

Ramaswamy said it was important for firms to keep their eyes on the prize — making AI useful and building returns that way — and advised customers to do the same.

He stressed the importance of implementing AI incrementally, in part because not all projects will work, but also because employees fearing that AI will replace them may be resistant.

""That's part of the nuance that executives need to bring in to figure out: Where is the technology most applicable? Some are thinking of AI as a technology that can cure all problems. I think it's a mistake. Definitely, there's promise, but some areas are going to be much more amenable than others,"" Ramaswamy said.    

One key opportunity right now is how quickly AI can accelerate the value that comes from data, Ramaswamy said.   

""The time-to-value change is also pretty remarkable. Will there be turbulence along the way in the markets, with respect to how the stock market behaves? Absolutely. But I think the value that is going to come out of this AI revolution, if I may call it that, is pretty firm, and we all need to stay focused on that,"" he added.   

A market bubble — and burst — doesn't have to mean the end of a company. Meta, Amazon and Google all emerged from the dot-com era and are among the world's most valuable companies today.  

But AI might not necessarily play out in the same way as the dot-com bubble, according to Vista Equity's Ashley MacNeill, especially if investors keep a cool head, While bullish, she told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that it's important to have a ""measured"" approach.

""Is this a bubble that's going to burst like it did in 1999? Or is this more like a balloon where we're going to see it inflate and deflate as we go through the cycles?"" MacNeill said. 

""Given the longevity of this technology and given the fact this is waves that's going to adopt this technology, I'm more inclined to think that we aren't bursting, but rather we're going to inflate and deflate as this technology ebbs and flows,"" she added.

Americans in 2024 lost nearly $250 million to scams that used Bitcoin ATMs

In June 2024, when Fran Bates entered a Fort Worth-area gas station, she thought the voice on the other end of the phone was from her bank, and she thought a machine where she was in the process of feeding more than $23,000 would keep her money safe. 

Neither was true. 

The voice belonged to a scammer, and experts believe the call was likely made from overseas. The machine was a bitcoin ATM kiosk -- one of more than 45,000 across the country. And on that summer day in Texas, the 85-year-old Bates became one of the tens of thousands of Americans who fall victim each year to scams perpetrated using bitcoin ATMs. 

""It's a horrible, horrible experience,"" Bates recalled in a recent interview with ABC News' Jay O'Brien. 

The scammer convinced Bates that she was in danger of losing her savings, she recalled, and over the course of two days encouraged her to withdraw more than $40,000 in cash and deposit it into a special machine, where she was told it would be safe. 

The scammer even ordered her a car that delivered her to an area gas station, she told ABC News, where she began feeding $100 bills into the cash kiosk -- his voice instructing her every step of the way. 

""That seems so hard to believe,"" O'Brien told Bates about the scam. 

""I know,"" Bates replied. ""And you think if you had to listen to it, you would wonder, 'What's going on with that woman? Doesn't she realize what they're doing to her?' No, you don't.""

""But they've got you,"" O'Brien said. 

""Oh, they have you right where they want you,"" Bates said.

The FBI says scams perpetrated using bitcoin ATMs cost Americans nearly $250 million in 2024, more than double the sum from the previous year. And AARP is warning its 38 million members that bitcoin ATMs are increasingly scammers' preferred means to dupe Americans. 

Bitcoin ATMs allow users to insert cash and send it to a digital wallet anywhere in the world. It takes only a few minutes, and once the transaction is executed, experts say, the money can be nearly impossible to recover -- making it an attractive method for prospective fraudsters. 

""Have you seen an increase in how popular using crypto -- and using these ATMs specifically -- has become for a scam like this?"" O'Brien asked Amy Nofziger, AARP's director of fraud victim support. 

""Yes, requesting crypto is now the No. 1 preferred method of criminals,"" Nofziger replied. ""It is a huge problem."" 

Authorities have taken notice. Last month, the Washington, D.C., attorney general's office sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest bitcoin ATM machine purveyors in the country, accusing it of ""pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed fees on the backs of scam victims."" 

The lawsuit claims 93% of the transactions on Athena's devices in the District ""are the product of outright fraud,"" and that ""the median age of victims was 71 years."" 

Athena forcefully denied those allegations in a statement to ABC News, asserting in part that it maintains ""strong safeguards against fraud including transparent instructions, prominent warnings and consumer education."" 

""Just as a bank isn't held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users' decisions,"" the statement said. 

AARP has advocated for more stringent regulations to protect Americans from scams on bitcoin ATMs, like capping the amount of money a user can deposit in one day. At least 17 states have passed legislation in recent years regulating the machines, and some municipalities have moved to ban them outright. 

But critics say some bitcoin ATM firms have been reluctant to embrace regulation, as it could conceivably hurt their bottom line. Some companies that operate the machines charge transaction fees that exceed 20%. 

""Do you think these companies know that, in large part, their ATMs are being used for scams?"" O'Brien asked Adam Zarazinski, the CEO of Inca Digital, a cryptocurrency forensics firm. 

""They either know or they're turning a blind eye to it, yes,"" Zarazinski opined. 

Brenna Bird, the attorney general in Iowa, filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year against two major players in the space, Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip, which she accused of being ""a silent partner to many scammers' preying on Iowans, taking a cut of each scam with its excessive and deceptive [bitcoin ATM] fees."" 

Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip have both denied those claims in court and in statements to ABC News. 

Bitcoin Depot told ABC News that the ""vast majority"" of their transactions are ""legitimate,"" that they ""are one of a few operators in the bitcoin ATM space to proactively require an ID for even the smallest transactions,"" and that ""customers receive up to four scam warnings before completing a purchase."" 

A spokesperson for CoinFlip told ABC News that the company ""never wants to profit when honest people are duped by bad actors, which is why we refund transaction fees to victims in instances of fraud."" 

""We hold ourselves to the highest standards of consumer protection, compliance, and transparency,"" the statement said. 

While most victims never manage to recoup their money, Fran Bates' story has a rare happy ending.

She owes it to Myndi Jordan, another customer at the gas station, who noticed Bates hunched over the bitcoin ATM machine, shoving thousands of dollars into it -- and called the police. 

Jordan, who had herself been the victim of identity fraud, said she immediately recognized it as a scam. 

The two women sat down with O'Brien for a joint interview earlier this month, reuniting for the first time since that day in June 2024.

""I hate when somebody tries to take advantage of somebody that's not able to protect themselves, or defend themselves,"" Jordan told O'Brien. ""And I feel like they were taking advantage of you. And I was like, 'No, we're not doing this today.'"" 

Bates calls Jordan her ""guardian angel."" 

As Bates continued to pour bills into the ATM, Lieutenant James Stewart of the White Settlement Police Department arrived on the scene. He grabbed Bates' cellphone and confronted the man on the phone as the scammer implored Bates to execute the payment. She was just one click from losing it all.

""Ma'am, just you click on 'I'm done,'"" the scammer is heard saying on police bodycam footage. 

""No, don't click 'I'm done,'"" Stewart told Bates on the bodycam recording. ""Do not click anything."" 

Bates backed away from the machine -- and the transaction was never executed.

Days later, after contacting the machine vendor, Stewart personally delivered a cashier's check to Bates in the amount of what she entered into the machine. He even escorted her to the bank to deposit it back into her account.

Bates, in her interview with ABC News, called Stewart her ""knight in shining armor."" 

""It felt amazing, being able to see it to the end and see the happy ending,"" Stewart told ABC News.

""She gives amazing hugs,"" Stewart said of Bates. ""You know, that was the best part of it, I think.""

Oops, something went wrong

Retail Bitcoin traders made themselves heard today, causing $700 million in crypto liquidations. The price of BTC fell by around $4,000 as on-chain activity spiked, even though institutions kept buying. 

Whether or not BTC keeps dropping or recovers soon, we need to pay attention to these dynamics. Corporate liquidity is very influential in the market, but it's not the final arbiter of price.

When Bitcoin hit two successive all-time highs earlier this week, it caused a little consternation in the community. This took place despite a lack of retail activity, with institutional investors powering the growth.

Crucially, these corporations continued making huge purchases while BTC's value was inflated.

In other words, there have been fears that these inflows could profoundly alter market cycles. Arthur Hayes even proclaimed that the four-year cycle was dead and that global institutional liquidity would determine token prices now.

Today, however, these concerns seem less serious. Bitcoin fell around $4,000 in the last 24 hours, spawning a frenzy of crypto liquidations. Over $114 million in total short positions were eradicated in one hour:

A few key factors suggest that retail Bitcoin traders caused all these liquidations. For one thing, ETF issuers continued buying BTC at elevated rates, and the products are seeing huge inflows. Meanwhile, BTC's on-chain trading activity has spiked between 4% and 5%, showing that activity is stirring awake.

Analysts have already identified some of the most likely causes for Bitcoin's retreat to $120,000, which triggered these liquidations. They seem like pretty standard price actions; long-term traders are taking profits, holder accumulation rates sparked low confidence, etc.

Furthermore, there are even signs that BTC could rebound in the near future.

This, too, presents a useful opportunity to gather valuable market data. These new structural forces are very powerful, but they aren't all-powerful.

Retail activity still spurred a major Bitcoin price dump, causing a cascade of liquidations. What new narratives can help explain this behavior and enable accurate predictions?

Whether Bitcoin keeps going up or down, these questions should be at the forefront of traders' minds. These institutions are apparently going to keep stockpiling Bitcoin either way.

The first step of Monad's long-awaited token airdrop is finally arriving next week, the project announced Thursday.

The Monad airdrop claim portal will open for users on Tuesday. The project has not yet revealed details about eligibility requirements for receiving allocations of the Monad token, MON, nor has it unveiled information about the token's supply or planned release schedule.

The much-hyped Ethereum and Solana competitor is also widely expected to launch its mainnet in tandem with the Monad token.

A representative for Monad told Decrypt that only the airdrop claim portal will debut on Tuesday—not the airdrop itself, nor the network's mainnet. Further details about the MON token and airdrop, including a tokenomics breakdown, as well as regarding the Monad mainnet launch, will be shared “in the near future,” they added.

The MON token airdrop is heavily anticipated to come before other buzzy airdrops forecasted on the horizon, including those for crypto mainstays OpenSea and MetaMask, according to Myriad Markets users. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

For years, Monad has attracted loads of attention and capital in the crypto ecosystem—thanks to high-profile backers and lofty promises to build an EVM-compatible layer-one blockchain that's far more efficient than Ethereum.

In 2024, the project raised a whopping $225 million in a funding round led by crypto venture giant Paradigm. Monad was founded in 2022 by Jump Crypto alum Keone Hon.

How to Prepare for Monad: The High-Speed EVM Layer-1 Blockchain

Monad's value proposition is based on two key premises. One, that the vast majority of decentralized finance activity takes place on networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the system backing the Ethereum ecosystem; and two, that users desire a speedier and more scalable alternative to Ethereum that doesn't sacrifice security and interoperability.

Though the network's slow rollout has become something of a meme in crypto circles, Monad did launch its testnet in February. The testnet has featured a robust ecosystem stretching beyond standard DeFi applications into gaming, NFTs, meme coins, and prediction markets. 

Since February, users and developers have been able to build out projects by utilizing valueless “testnet MON” tokens. While the project has not yet announced whether activity on the Monad testnet will contribute to a user's MON allocation, such engagement is typically taken into account when coordinating a token airdrop, as a means of rewarding early adopters.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

 Takaichi's election may have a “material impact” on the governance and regulatory perception of crypto assets in Japan, experts told Cointelegraph. 

Japan's newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, may open the door for more “refined” regulations to boost the country's cryptocurrency economy, which could be set to emerge as the next global hub for crypto companies.

Takaichi was elected leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Saturday and is set to become Japan's first female prime minister when she takes office on Oct. 15.

Experts say her leadership may introduce a more open stance toward technological experimentation, including blockchain innovation, while maintaining Japan's rigorous regulatory standards.

Takaichi's election may have a “material impact on the perception and governance of digital assets within the country,” according to Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at tokenization platform Brickken.

In previous public positions, Takichi has expressed support for “technological sovereignty,” including the “strategic development of digital infrastructure, including blockchain technology,” Fabrega told Cointelegraph. “From a legal perspective, this suggests that her administration may adopt a posture that is not only permissive but potentially proactive in promoting the digital economy.”

Fabrega added that Takaichi's political positioning may strengthen “Japan's commitment to legal certainty in the crypto space” and renew interest in the country as an innovation-friendly crypto hub.

Japan's government is recognizing blockchain as a “ pillar of its digital transformation strategy,” said Maarten Henskens, chief operating officer at Startale Group and head of Astar Foundation.

“A looser monetary outlook under the new leadership could sustain liquidity and fuel investor appetite for alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies,” Henskens told Cointelegraph.

“At Startale and Astar, we see this as a strong environment to continue advancing Japan's Web3 ecosystem,” he added.

During the elections, Takaichi was the only candidate proposing both a major spending package and looser monetary policy. Her stance has been well received by voters facing a weakening Japanese yen.

Japan's Nikkei index rose to a new all-time high of 47,734.04 on Monday, soaring 4.75% on the news of her election.

Experts say Takaichi's administration could bring greater clarity to token classifications under Japan's Financial Services Agency. The FSA currently distinguishes between payment tokens, securities and utility tokens, each with different regulatory requirements.

Takaichi's leadership will likely focus on the “refinement and expansion” of existing categories, particularly related to custody, tokenized financial instruments and investor protection standards, according to Fabrega.

Japan has been developing its crypto regulatory framework since at least 2016, when the FSA amended the Payment Services Act (PSA) to establish a regulatory regime imposing the first registration requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.

This came in response to the meltdown of Mt. Gox, which exposed pressing regulatory gaps in the country.

In April 2017, the new amendments took effect, requiring exchanges to register with the FSA and comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer standards.

In April 2018, crypto exchanges came together to form the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), prior to the FSA granting the JVCEA self-regulatory status in October 2018.

In June 2022, Japan's parliament introduced new regulations allowing licensed financial institutions to issue fiat-backed stablecoins, requiring issuers to fully back stablecoins with reserves held domestically in yen.

In April 2023, Japan's LDP issued a white paper outlining strategies for Web3 and blockchain adoption, recommending adjustments in tax policies and exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval frameworks.

In June, the FSA proposed reclassifying crypto assets as traditional financial products. Expected to take effect from 2026, this will subject cryptocurrencies to a new tax regime.

Japan's evolving regulations could make the country a more attractive destination for cryptocurrency firms.

Japan's policy shift has already helped the country double its crypto adoption over the year leading up to September, according to Chainalysis' APAC policy lead, Chengyi Ong.

Japan saw the strongest growth among the five leading markets in the Asia-Pacific region, with onchain value received growing over 120% year-on-year in the 12 months to June 2025, according to an excerpt from Chainalysis' 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.

Oops, something went wrong

When Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2008, the pseudonymous coder envisioned his decentralized currency as a reaction to the financial crisis that had paralyzed the global economy. But nearly two decades later, the once renegade crypto industry has become increasingly intertwined with Wall Street. On the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook (which you can find on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube), Citi's head of enterprise digital assets, Artem Korenyuk, says that there's increasing “synergy” between the two sectors.

After the Wild West early days of crypto, Wall Street became increasingly interested in digital assets as Bitcoin's price rose into the hundreds and then thousands of dollars, and as other blockchains like Ethereum offered the promise of decentralized financial applications such as lending and payments that could reduce the frictions of legacy systems. But many early pilots, such as the R3 blockchain consortium formed in 2015 among financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and Santander, never gained any traction amid regulatory uncertainty and the ups and downs of the volatile industry.

But with the Trump administration's embrace of crypto and the passage of the Genius Act in July, which established regulation for stablecoins, Korenyuk says this time is different. “Blockchain is here to stay,” he tells Fortune. The question, he added, is how it will be used.

Citi has long been a pioneer in the space, including through its Citi Token Services program, which uses a private blockchain to facilitate 24/7 payments between institutional Citi customers. While this is a more limited use case, especially because it doesn't utilize the permissionless and decentralized innovations of Bitcoin, Korenyuk says it proves that crypto's distributed ledger technology can change payment rails through programmability. For example, financial markets have separate systems for different types of assets, such as cash, securities, and debt, while tokens and smart contracts on blockchains “follow the same architecture, creating economies of scale and efficiencies,” Korenyuk says.

Whether banks like Citi will start using blockchain in more widespread ways that impact everyday customers is another matter. Some have begun experimenting with tokenizing different types of financial instruments such as money-market funds, or issuing them on blockchains, and institutions have also explored launching their own stablecoins in the wake of the Genius Act. Korenyuk says that work by the Securities and Exchange Commission to create new regulatory frameworks for crypto has allowed Wall Street to explore new types of applications, especially around tokenized stocks. “We're certainly paying close attention to it,” Korenyuk says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","DappRadar industry report: NFT are carving a new potential in DeFi","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nfts-are-carving-a-new-potential-in-defi/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:50:00 GMT","

DappRadar noted BTC took the spotlight, but app building and activity continued. NFT are also taking on new roles, linked to tokenization and DeFi. 

DappRadar noted apps were highly active in Q3, despite BTC taking the spotlight. In the latest quarterly report, DappRadar noted new trends emerging, especially tokenization, a return of NFT, and DeFi making new records of value locked. 

In Q3, decentralized apps drew in 18.7M active wallets per day, down 22.4% from the previous quarter. Gaming apps made up 25% of all activity, up from 20.1% for the previous quarter. However, DappRadar warned only a few decentralized games are purely about play, and most have some form of DeFi mechanics. 

NFT followed with 18.5% share of apps, while DeFi had a 17.9% share. More specific use cases, such as SocialFi and AI, lost momentum, resulting in only a small increase in overall activity. 

While some app categories were surprisingly healthy, the slowdown in the AI agent space was one of the major reasons for the activity downturn. Virtuals Protocol changed its relevance from Q2, when it attracted 10K active wallets daily and rapid AI agent minting. In Q3, the platform carried 1,000 to 1,500 wallets daily, making up $100K in daily value transfers. 

The new wave of SocialFi apps like The Arena, Layer3 and OnchainGm  lost 50% of their activity, down to 1.57M in daily active wallets. 

Overall, apps are redistributing their activity, with utility apps still at the peak, as in the case of the Kai-Ching payment platform. 

App teams are retesting the NFT model, increasing the number of transfers and trades. In Q3, apps sold 18.1M NFT, up from 12.5M in the second quarter. In Q3, NFT activity generated $1.6B in trading volumes through apps. 

Some of the NFT activity is niche, and has not brought back mass adoption. Additionally, the items bought and sold go at much lower prices, as a fun activity rather than a life-changing investment. 

Still, 2.14M wallets interacted with NFT, each holding on average over 8 items. The number of interacting wallets grew by 28% quarter-on-quarter, while sales grew by 158%. The type of NFT traded also changed, as game-based items were less active. Interest shifted to Sorare items, mostly linked to sports and sports celebrities. 

Some of the activity with NFT is linked to OpenSea incentives for an eventual native token airdrop. Older blue-chip avatar collections also changed hands, with a special focus on the Pudgy Penguins collection. 

OpenSea increased its activity by 88% in Q3, while Blur grew its activity by 178% against the previous quarter. Moonbirds turned into one of the hottest collections after Yuga Labs divested some of its assets and sold them to the Orange Cap Games team. Moonbirds may soon have its native Solana token, BIRB, as the team announced plans in early October. 

The Moonbirds shift to a tokenized collection follows the general trend of integrating NFT into DeFi protocols. NFT are being used for tokenization, creating digital identities and copies for physical collections. The CryptoPunks collection is also used for its underlying value in minting and burning PUNKSTR tokens. Holding PUNKSTR is a proxy for the price of Punks NFT, without the need to hold the assets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO News Today: ICO Sector Sees Renewed Surge on Web3 and Crypto Fund","https://meyka.com/blog/ico-news-today-ico-sector-sees-renewed-surge-on-web3-and-crypto-fund-0910/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:49:02 GMT","

The ICO market is experiencing a surge in activity, particularly in the UK. This resurgence comes as Web3 projects gain traction and investor interest in crypto grows. Recent trends suggest an increasing focus on ICO compliance, market risks, and new opportunities. These developments may shape the future direction of crypto fundraising.

After years of decline, the ICO market is back in the spotlight, notably in the UK. A renewed interest in Web3 funding has led to a spike in ICO activity. In 2025, investors are showing increased appetite for innovative projects leveraging blockchain technology. This marks a significant shift from the subdued environment of past years.

The momentum is largely driven by projects focusing on decentralized technologies, which promise efficient and transparent investment opportunities. As major tech firms and startups embrace Web3, ICOs are once again becoming a favored method for raising capital.

A relevant discussion on Reuters highlights how these trends are unfolding within the market, suggesting a robust future for this fundraising model.

UK ICO regulations are evolving to address the complexities of the market. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been proactive in refining rules to ensure investor protection and market stability. These regulations aim to mitigate risks while embracing innovation in digital assets.

ICO projects must now adhere to tighter compliance requirements, including thorough financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks. This regulatory framework helps foster trust and transparency, encouraging more investors to participate in the ICO market.

The UK's regulatory stance is crucial as it balances encouraging digital innovation and maintaining stringent oversight. For more details on the regulatory landscape, refer to Yahoo Finance.

Web3 is at the forefront of this ICO revival, with significant funding directed toward decentralized applications. This shift is reshaping how fundraising trends are developing, allowing smaller projects equipped with cutting-edge technology to compete on a global scale.

Current trends indicate that investors are particularly interested in projects that integrate AI, blockchain, and financial technology. This alignment with modern tech trends ensures that the ICO sector remains dynamic and forward-looking.

For stakeholders and market observers, understanding these trends is essential. For instance, a piece on Bloomberg provides insights into how these activities are structured.

As the ICO market continues to gain momentum in the UK, driven by Web3 initiatives and evolving regulations, investors must remain informed. The regulatory environment offers both challenges and opportunities, necessitating a careful approach to compliance and transparency.

The current ICO climate presents diverse opportunities for those willing to engage with new technologies and digital strategies. The focus on regulatory compliance alongside innovative funding strategies marks a promising future for ICOs.

Moving forward, staying abreast of regulatory changes and investment trends will be crucial for success in the dynamic ICO landscape.

The ICO market surge is mainly driven by renewed interest in Web3 projects and increased investor interest in digital assets. This is causing a significant rise in ICO activity, particularly in the UK.

The UK is refining its regulations with a focus on investor protection and market transparency. The FCA enforces measures like financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks to ensure a safe investment environment.

Key trends include a focus on decentralized Web3 technologies that integrate AI and blockchain. These trends are making ICOs a preferred method of funding due to their transparency and innovative potential.

Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. His work has appeared in...

Uganda has launched one of Africa's most ambitious blockchain initiatives to date, a $5.5 billion real-world asset tokenization project paired with the country's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot. 

The new initiative, led by the Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Uganda's Diacente Group, will bring $5.5 billion worth of physical infrastructure assets on-chain. The tokenized portfolio will span sectors such as food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade. 

The rollout includes a pilot of Uganda's digital shilling, a CBDC backed by Ugandan treasury bonds and deployed on GSN's permissioned blockchain.

The move comes as neighboring Kenya advances its Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, marking a significant moment for digital finance regulation and infrastructure development across East Africa.

According to GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley, the initiative represents a major step toward linking blockchain technology with tangible development outcomes. 

“We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,” he said.

The CBDC is designed to operate in a regulated environment and comply with international standards, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. 

BREAKING: MPs have passed a Bill granting investigators the power to shut down social media accounts spreading what they term is Harmful Content before it circulates.

It will be accessible through smartphones and USSD technology, allowing over 40 million Ugandans to transact using a secure, mobile-first digital currency for the first time.

The partnership supports Uganda's Vision 2040 and aligns with the African Union's Agenda 2063, as well as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) framework. 

The Karamoja Green Industrial and Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), managed by Diacente, is at the core of this rollout and has been designated a national flagship under Uganda's Karamoja Regional Development Plan (2025–2035). 

The project is expected to create over one million jobs and could generate up to $10 billion in annual exports, reinforcing Uganda's position as a regional digital and industrial hub.

Diacente Group Chairman Edgar Agaba added that the partnership “goes beyond infrastructure,” emphasizing that integrating tokenization and CBDCs into Uganda's economic roadmap will help attract new capital, empower local industries, and drive sustainable growth.

Meanwhile, Kenya is making progress on its own crypto regulation efforts. The country's National Assembly has advanced the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill (N.A. Bill No. 15 of 2025) to the third reading stage. 

The legislation, which grants oversight powers to the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), seeks to regulate digital assets and combat risks such as money laundering and terrorism financing.

Kuria Kimani, Chair of the Finance and National Planning Committee, emphasized the bill's role in protecting Kenya's monetary system while fostering innovation. 

The Treasury will have the authority to issue additional regulations covering stablecoins, tokenization, exchanges, ICOs, and cybersecurity requirements.

If approved, the bill will move to President William Ruto for signature. 

Local industry group VACC noted that the legislation places Kenya among Africa's top five nations advancing comprehensive crypto regulations, opening doors for innovation and investment in the region's growing digital economy.

Sub-Saharan Africa has emerged as one of the fastest-growing regions for digital asset adoption, according to a September report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. 

The region, which includes countries such as Uganda and Kenya, received $205 billion in on-chain value between July 2024 and June 2025, ranking third globally for growth.

Nigeria remains the continent's leader in digital currency innovation, having launched Africa's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2021. Ghana and South Africa have completed pilots, while Egypt plans a rollout by 2030. 

Kenya and Rwanda are still conducting public consultations. Statista projects that Africa's crypto user base could surpass 75 million by 2026, generating an estimated $5.1 billion in revenue.

Stablecoins now account for 43% of Sub-Saharan Africa's total crypto transaction volume, driven by Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia.

In June, Visa also partnered with Yellow Card to expand stablecoin payments across Africa, starting with pilot programs this year.

Regulatory momentum continues to build. Kenya's proposed Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill is viewed as a potential model for regional frameworks, while Mauritius, Botswana, and several Central African nations have already passed formal crypto laws. 

Despite rapid growth, over 80% of intra-African payments still rely on foreign banks, showing the demand for local digital payment infrastructure.

Kenya and Rwanda are still conducting public consultations. Statista projects that Africa's crypto user base could surpass 75 million by 2026, generating an estimated $5.1 billion in revenue.

Stablecoins now account for 43% of Sub-Saharan Africa's total crypto transaction volume, driven by Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia.

Ripple recently expanded its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, across the continent through partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card. The token is being tested in remittance, treasury, and climate-insurance applications.

In June, Visa also partnered with Yellow Card to expand stablecoin payments across Africa, starting with pilot programs this year.

Regulatory momentum continues to build. Kenya's proposed Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill is viewed as a potential model for regional frameworks, while Mauritius, Botswana, and several Central African nations have already passed formal crypto laws.

Despite rapid growth, over 80% of intra-African payments still rely on foreign banks, showing the demand for local digital payment infrastructure.

Avalon X Presale Crypto Connects Blockchain Technology with Real Estate Investment","https://coincentral.com/next-100x-rwa-crypto-avalon-x-presale-crypto-connects-blockchain-technology-with-real-estate-investment/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:25:51 GMT","

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, and projects that connect real-world value with blockchain utility are catching investors' attention.

Among these innovations, Avalon X (AVLX) stands out as one of the best RWA crypto projects to emerge in 2025.

The idea of real estate tokenization has transformed how people view property investment. By converting tangible assets into blockchain-based tokens, Avalon X simplifies access to one of the world's largest markets.

Its presale crypto phase marks an opportunity for early adopters to explore how blockchain can bring transparency and liquidity to real estate—an asset class long dominated by barriers to entry and limited accessibility.

Join the Avalon X team for a live AMA on Friday, October 10th on X official.

Avalon X is introducing a groundbreaking platform that merges blockchain innovation with real-world assets, reshaping how investors interact with property-backed opportunities. All smart contracts within the ecosystem are independently audited by top-tier security firms such as CertiK, ensuring trust, transparency, and protection from vulnerabilities.

What sets Avalon X apart from many presale coins is its deep connection to tangible assets through Grupo Avalon, a property developer with over $1 billion in ongoing projects.

The AVLX token follows a deflationary model, creating scarcity while offering passive income opportunities through staking. Holders can also enjoy property-related rewards and exclusive access to partner developments.

This thoughtful combination of tokenization and blockchain infrastructure showcases why Avalon X is being recognized among the top RWA crypto contenders, offering a more structured approach to decentralized real estate participation.

Mark your calendars for Friday, October 10th, when a live AMA featuring an Avalon X representative will take place. You can share your questions early through the Google Form for a chance to get featured.

Avalon X is on a mission to make property investment accessible to anyone, anywhere. Its blockchain-powered model introduces fractional ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in projects that were once reserved for high-net-worth individuals.

By partnering with Grupo Avalon, with a development portfolio valued near $1 billion, Avalon X moves beyond promises—it delivers infrastructure that supports real-world integration.

Key highlights include:

To celebrate its launch, Avalon X is offering exciting opportunities for its community. Grupo Avalon is gifting a luxury townhouse in the exclusive Eco Avalon development to one lucky participant. In addition, the $1M giveaway offers ten winners a chance to claim $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens.

To participate, users simply need to:

Spot solana SOL$218.79 exchange-traded funds (ETFS) are unlikely to draw major investor inflows even if approved this week, according to a Wednesday report from Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM). 

Solana ETFs could see about $1.5 billion in first-year inflows, roughly one-seventh of ether's ETH$4,334.48, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

But the analysts warned that figure could be lower due to waning on-chain activity, heavy memecoin trading, investor fatigue from multiple launches, and competition from diversified crypto index products such as those tied to the S&P Dow Jones Indices Digital Markets 50. Corporate treasuries could also divert demand away from spot ETFs.

JPMorgan also noted weak demand signals in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) solana futures positioning.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide on roughly sixteen spot crypto ETF applications in October, including solana.

Markets widely expect approval, helped by an existing CME futures contract and the July launch of the first Solana ETF from REX Osprey, the bank said.

JPMorgan noted that expectations are already visible in pricing. The premium to net asset value (NAV) on the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) has collapsed from around 750% last year to near zero, echoing bitcoin BTC$120,956.79 and ether trends ahead of ETF launches.

Bitcoin BTC$120,956.79 dipped below a key support level Thursday, pulling the broader crypto market down as the US dollar gained strength ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech.

The leading cryptocurrency fell over 1% $121,500, reversing Wednesday's spike and penetrating the 200-hour simple moving average, CoinDesk data show. Other major tokens such as BNB and ETH dropped over 3%. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 1% to 4,155 points.

The decline followed another strong day of inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, which collectively pulled in $426 million on Wednesday, according to data source SoSoValue. This extends the streaks of robust daily inflows seen over the past week.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, rose to 99.10, the highest since Aug. 1, denting the appeal of dollar-denominated assets like bitcoin and gold. The yellow metal saw a brief drop to $4,000 per ounce. before bouncing back above $4,030 per ounce.

Fed's Powell is scheduled to speak at the Community Bank Conference in Washington at 12:30 GMT. Traders will look for cues on the monetary policy outlook against the backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown that has paused fresh economic data releases such as inflation and jobs, which the central bank takes into account while setting interest rates.

The minutes of the Federal Reserve September meeting released Wednesday also expressed concerns over the shutdown. “Should the shutdown not end by the FOMC's Oct. 28-29 meeting, policymakers essentially will be flying blind on key economic metrics,””the committee members noted,

Minutes revealed that while policymakers were united in their view that rates should be cut, they disagreed on how aggressively rate cuts should proceed and were worried about sticky inflation.

“Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year,” according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's Sept. 16-17 meeting. “A majority of participants emphasized upside risks to their outlooks for inflation.”

Participants voted 11-1 to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range down to around 4%. At the same, a majority of 19 officials anticipated at least two more rate cuts this year, while seven foresaw no further reductions. The dot plot published last month showed a slight majority favoring two more rate reductions this year which would take the benchmark rate to 3.50-3.75%.

Discussions focused heavily on a weakening labor market and early signs that inflation could reaccelerate. Still, the committee was generally aligned in its view that President Donald Trump's trade tariffs would not be a lasting source of inflation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin looks far from overbought as ‘stars are aligned' for ETF surge","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-not-overbought-bitwise-predicts-etf-surge","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 02:11:06 GMT","

 Bitwise's Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin ETF inflows will hit a record in Q4, as analysts say Bitcoin still has room to run despite recently hitting a peak. 

Bitcoin is currently clear of “overbought conditions” and is set to track a steady path upward despite hitting a new all-time high on Monday, according to analysts. 

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a peak high of over $126,000 on Monday, which places it “roughly halfway through its four-year price cycle,” CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain said on Wednesday. 

“Despite this strong performance, technical indicators suggest the price is still moving within a stable range far from the overbought conditions that typically precede historical peaks,” it added.

Arab Chain stated that Bitcoin “appears to be in a phase of balanced upward momentum,” with its 30-day moving average, which is the average closing price over the last 30 days, being just under $116,000, “suggesting a steady upward trend without sharp deviations.”

It added that Bitcoin's 30-day standard deviation, or the variability of its returns, was also “relatively low at $4,540, reflecting a compression in volatility, a condition that typically precedes strong price movements, especially upward, if supported by renewed liquidity inflows.”

The analysts said Bitcoin tends to reach its cycle peak up to 600 days after its halving, where mining rewards are slashed 50%, and if that pattern continues, Bitcoin is now “within the critical window that has previously led to major bull market tops.”

It comes as Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan predicted on Tuesday that inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) will surge in the fourth quarter.

Hougan said that Bitcoin's surging price is one of the reasons that inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs “will set a record” in Q4, and will “pull in more money in 2025 than they did in their record-setting first year, when they attracted $36 billion.”

The ETFs have attracted $22.5 billion in inflows in the first nine months of the year, which would put them on pace to end 2025 with approximately $30 billion in flows.

“Here's a hot take: I'm not worried,” Hougan said. “From where I sit, the stars are aligned for a very strong Q4 for flows — more than enough to push us to a new record.”

He said the “most fundamental” reason he predicts high flows to cap 2025 is that he's “bullish on Bitcoin returns for Q4.”

“Although it's a bit counterintuitive, higher prices often spur greater demand for Bitcoin ETFs as the media, companies, and everyday investors pivot their attention to Bitcoin,” Hougan said.

He added that in every quarter where Bitcoin saw double-digit growth, inflows to Bitcoin ETFs also saw “double-digit billions in inflows.”

Hougan said his prediction is also based on a wider range of investors being able to invest in the ETFs as wealth managers open up to them and as traders look to invest in assets that do well with a weakening US dollar.

Wall Street will look for “The Debasement Trade” to buy well-performing assets as the US dollar weakens, Hougan said, and gold and Bitcoin have both performed well so far this year.

That debasement trade will be helped by some of the largest wealth managers “finally changing” to open up their platforms to Bitcoin ETFs, Hougan said.

He noted a Morgan Stanley report released earlier this month that guides 16,000 advisers said they could “flexibly allocate to cryptocurrency as part of their multiasset portfolio” with a suggested allocation of up to 4% for “risk-tolerant investors.”

Hougan added that Q4 “is off to a great start” with the ETFs taking in $3.5 billion in net flows in the first four trading days.

“We have 64 more days to get another $10 billion,” he said. “I think we'll do that and then some.”

The record-breaking mission offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the geology of our planet's largest layer.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. Separating the planet's rocky crust and the molten outer core, the mantle makes up 70 percent of the Earth's mass and 84 percent of its volume. But despite its outsized influence on the planet's geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer. 

And that's understandable, especially when you consider that the crust is roughly 9 to 12 miles thick on average. Luckily, that average contains outliers—areas of the world where the crust is actually incredibly thin and faulting exposes the mantle through cracks. One such area is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically near an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif.  

On the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock's structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance. 

It was here, 800 meters south of this field, in May 2023 that members of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)—aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot-long research vessel rented by the U.S. National Science Foundation—extracted a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, which are the primary rocks that make up the Earth's upper mantle. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Although this makes this particular drill core the deepest sample of the mantle yet, going that deep into the rock wasn't the goal of this record-breaking expedition. 

“We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. He said that the drilling was so easy that they progressed three times faster than usual. The team eventually drilled a staggering 1,268 meters, and only stopped due to the mission's limited operations window. 

Andrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core's composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. It also contained rocks known as gabbros, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition. 

While this core represents an incredibly opportunity to learn more about the Earth's mantle, as well as give an in-depth look at the geologic substrate upon which the Lost City rests, the mission didn't quite complete the “grand challenge” of crossing the Mohorovičić discontinuity. Otherwise known as the Moho, the Mohorovičić discontinuity is recognized as the true boundary between the crust and pristine mantle. 

Future missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won't include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024. Just as scientists are finally knocking on the door to the Earth's most ubiquitous geologic layer, the future of these kinds of drilling missions is now uncertain.

Hailstorm formation has remained a mystery, until now.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Every year, hailstorms cause billions in damage to homes, businesses, and crops, yet how these ice balls of destruction form in the upper troposphere has remained somewhat of a mystery. The predominant theory was that hailstones went through a recycling motion, which explained why they often contained varying layers of a clear and opaque ice. 

Now, research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that this recycling motion is only a small part of the story. In the study, Peking University's Qinghong Zhang, lead author of the study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used stable isotope analysis to effectively recreate the “history” of 27 hailstone specimens produced by nine separate storms in China by analyzing the ‘fingerprints' left in each stone by unique layers of the atmosphere. 

Using this precise method, Zhang and her colleagues could pinpoint at what level in the atmosphere certain layers of the hailstones formed, creating a vertical map of the ice chunk's journey toward the earth.

“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Zhang said in a press statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.”

Of the 27 hailstones studied, only one of them displayed tell-tale signs of the hypothesized recycling method, in which hail travels up and down within a storm cloud. Some 10 stones showed that they formed while steadily descending toward the atmosphere, and another 13 displayed evidence of only one single upward push. Surprisingly, three even showed signs of nearly horizontal movement.

According to the researchers, hail typically forms in a temperature “sweet spot” of between roughly -30 and -10 degrees Celsius. However, Zhang's data showed that embryos of hailstones can actually form outside that gradient, between about -33.4 and -8.7 degrees Celsius. Although this largely refutes the previous theory behind hailstone formation, larger hailstones do require extended time (at least one upward growth) in this zone for supercooled water to form more layers. This explains why stronger storms—with more powerful updrafts—often produce larger hailstones. 

Zhang hopes that understanding the inner workings of hailstorm formation will help improve weather forecasting and our ability to estimate the potential dangers of a passing hailstorm (this research is in collaboration with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research). However, improving forecasting capabilities in the U.S. may prove difficult under the Trump Administration, as it steadily levies cuts on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the National Weather Service. Meteorologists at NWS have already reported degraded forecasting services due to curtailed weather balloon launches used to help gather data for accurate storm prediction. 

Although unlocking the secret of hailstone formation could help protect people in the path of dangerous storms, it helps to be able to identify that a storm is coming in the first place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","JWST spots a hidden red supergiant just before it exploded","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033233.htm","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 11:56:40 GMT","

A team of astronomers led by Northwestern University has captured the clearest and most detailed view ever of a dying star before its dramatic explosion.Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the international group identified the source of a supernova, known as its progenitor, in mid-infrared light for the first time. When combined with archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, the data revealed that the blast originated from a massive red supergiant star wrapped in an unexpected blanket of dust.This breakthrough may finally explain why astronomers rarely see red supergiants explode, even though models predict they should account for most core-collapse supernovae. The new findings suggest these enormous stars do explode but are often hidden from view by thick dust clouds. Thanks to JWST's powerful infrared vision, scientists can now see through the obscuring dust, bridging the long-standing gap between theory and observation.The research, published on Oct. 8 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, represents JWST's first confirmed detection of a supernova's progenitor star.

""For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like,"" said Northwestern's Charlie Kilpatrick, who led the study. ""Only now, with JWST, do we finally have the quality of data and infrared observations that allow us to say precisely the exact type of red supergiant that exploded and what its immediate environment looked like. We've been waiting for this to happen -- for a supernova to explode in a galaxy that JWST had already observed. We combined Hubble and JWST data sets to completely characterize this star for the first time.""

Kilpatrick, a research assistant professor at Northwestern's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics, is an expert on the life cycles of massive stars. His coauthor, Aswin Suresh, a graduate student in physics and astronomy at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, played a key role in the analysis.

Reddest, dustiest progenitor ever observed

The team first detected the supernova, named SN2025pht, on June 29, 2025, using the All-Sky Automated Survey of Supernovae. The event's light traveled from the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1637, located about 40 million light-years from Earth.By comparing Hubble and JWST images of NGC 1637 taken before and after the explosion, Kilpatrick, Suresh, and their collaborators pinpointed the progenitor star. It immediately stood out as both brilliant and intensely red. Although the star radiated roughly 100,000 times more light than the Sun, much of its glow was hidden by surrounding dust. The layer of dust was so dense that it made the star appear over 100 times dimmer in visible light than it would otherwise look. Because the dust blocked shorter, bluer wavelengths, the star's appearance shifted dramatically toward red.

""It's the reddest, dustiest red supergiant that we've seen explode as a supernova,"" Suresh said.

Massive stars in the late stages of their lives, red supergiants are among the largest stars in the universe. When their cores collapse, they explode as Type II supernovae, leaving behind either a neutron star or black hole. The most familiar example of a red supergiant is Betelguese, the bright reddish star in the shoulder of the constellation Orion.

""SN2025pht is surprising because it appeared much redder than almost any other red supergiant we've seen explode as a supernova,"" Kilpatrick added. ""That tells us that previous explosions might have been much more luminous than we thought because we didn't have the same quality of infrared data that JWST can now provide.""

Clues hidden in dust

The deluge of dust could help explain why astronomers have struggled to find red supergiant progenitors. Most massive stars that explode as supernovae are the brightest and most luminous objects in the sky. So, theoretically, they should be easy to spot before they explode. But that hasn't been the case.

Astronomers posit that the most massive aging stars also might be the dustiest. These thick cloaks of dust might dim the stars' light to the point of utter undetectability. The new JWST observations support this hypothesis.

""I've been arguing in favor of that interpretation, but even I didn't expect to see such an extreme example as SN2025pht,"" Kilpatrick said. ""It would explain why these more massive supergiants are missing because they tend to be dustier.""

In addition to the presence of dust itself, the dust's composition was also surprising. While red supergiants tend to produce oxygen-rich, silicate dust, this star's dust appeared rich with carbon. This suggests that powerful convection in the star's final years may have dredged up carbon from deep inside, enriching its surface and altering the type of dust it produced.

""The infrared wavelengths of our observations overlap with an important silicate dust feature that's characteristic of some red supergiant spectra,"" Kilpatrick said. ""This tells us that the wind was very rich in carbon and less rich in oxygen, which also was somewhat surprising for a red supergiant of this mass.""

A new era for exploding stars

The new study marks the first time astronomers have used JWST to directly identify a supernova progenitor star, opening the door to many more discoveries. By capturing light across the near- and mid-infrared spectrum, JWST can reveal hidden stars and provide missing pieces for how the most massive stars live and die.

The team now is searching for similar red supergiants that may explode as supernovae in the future. Observations by NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope may help this search. Roman will have the resolution, sensitivity and infrared wavelength coverage to see these stars and potentially witness their variability as they expel out large quantities of dust near the end of their lives.

""With the launch of JWST and upcoming Roman launch, this is an exciting time to study massive stars and supernova progenitors,"" Kilpatrick said. ""The quality of data and new findings we will make will exceed anything observed in the past 30 years.""

The study, ""The Type II SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: A red supergiant with carbon-rich circumstellar dust as the first JWST detection of a supernova progenitor star,"" was supported by the National Science Foundation (award number AST-2432037).

Oil and gas companies have claimed to be part of the transition to renewable energy. Our analysis of the energy assets of 250 of the largest oil and gas companies finds a marginal contribution to global renewable energy deployment and that renewable generation represents a tiny proportion of the total energy production of these companies. This study empirically legitimizes doubts about the commitment of the industry to transition to low-carbon energy production.

— Denise Mamaril is now Starbucks' vice president of cybersecurity; governance, risk and compliance; and international. 

She was previously at Nordstrom for nearly a decade, leaving the role of senior director of security architecture and engineering.

“I'm thrilled to join a security team I already know and respect for their integrity, deep expertise, and ability to get things done,” Mamaril said on LinkedIn.

Mamaril also worked in leadership roles at williamsworks, Headsprout, and Kaplan.

Last month Starbucks CTO Deb Hall Lefevre reportedly resigned amid layoffs and various tech-related changes at the Seattle-based coffee giant.

— Rob Williams, Amazon's vice president of device software and services and a member CEO Andy Jassy's senior leadership team, announced his retirement and will leave the company at the year's end. The news comes on the heels of Amazon's annual devices and services showcase.

“While this decision has been in the works for quite some time, I wanted to see our amazing 2025 products through to completion, launch Alexa+, and VegaOS — and participate in the fun of Tuesday's product launch event in NYC — before announcing my transition,” Williams said last week on LinkedIn.

Reuters broke the news, citing an internal memo. Panos Panay, senior vice president of devices and services, praised Williams, who has been with the company for 12 years.

“Rob has had a big impact on the software and experiences of nearly all of the products we've created and shipped,” Panay said in the memo.

— In other Amazon news, Alice Shobe, the company's global director of community impact, is stepping down from her role after nearly nine years with the Seattle-based tech giant. Bettina Stix will succeed Shobe.

Shobe is a longtime leader in affordable housing, previously working for nonprofits and the City of Seattle. In her role at Amazon, Shobe addressed housing, education for under-served students, disaster relief and other efforts.

“We brought Amazon's innovation and problem-solving approach to each challenge. Today, our global team of passionate people is driving real change across communities worldwide,” Shobe said on LinkedIn.

Stix has been with Amazon for nearly 27 years, joining the company as an editor in Germany. She has been a manager in the U.S. and Europe and worked in retail development, Prime, product management and community engagement.

Stix is credited with conceiving the idea for Amazon's disaster relief program, which taps the company's expertise in logistics and mobilized employees to respond to emergencies around the globe.

— Seattle Children's announced the appointment of Dr. Christopher Longhurst as its next CEO, effective Jan. 5 of next year.

Longhurst joins the hospital from UC San Diego Health, where he is chief clinical and innovation officer and has worked for more than a decade. He was previously at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford.

“Dr. Longhurst's unique ability to merge clinical operations, research and digital strategy, while enhancing patient safety and quality makes him the right leader to guide Seattle Children's into the future,” Kurt Shintaffer, chair of the hospital's board of trustees, said in a statement.

— Jordan Weitzen is now chief financial officer for Acumatica, the Bellevue, Wash.-based enterprise software giant that was acquired this year by Vista Equity Partners. Weitzen was CFO for Pacvue and FabFitFun and held senior finance roles at NBCUniversal and Hulu.

Weitzen succeeds Wayne Kimber, who is retiring after serving as CFO since 2023. 

“Jordan is a proven finance leader with a track record of building modern, data-driven finance strategies in fast-moving environments,” John Case, CEO of Acumatica, said in a statement. “His breadth of experience and operational discipline will help Acumatica scale while continuing to deliver exceptional value to our community.”

— Padmashree Koneti is chief product officer for Yoodli, a Seattle startup that uses generative AI to analyze speech and offer tips for improving communication skills.

Koneti joins the company from Salesforce subsidiary Tableau, where she was senior vice president of product management for the analytics platform and has worked since 2022. Koneti previously held senior product leadership roles at companies including Limeade, Puppet, eBay, Cisco Systems and others.

“Bringing on a product leader of Padmashree's caliber is a huge validation of both Yoodli's momentum and our vision for the future,” Varun Puri, Yoodli CEO and co-founder, said via email. 

Yoodli, which raised $13.7 million in May, recently hired longtime financial leader Andy Larson as CFO.

— Todd Humphrey is leaving his role as Seattle Kraken founding executive team member and senior vice president of innovation and fan experience after seven years with the NHL team. 

Humphrey just launched Highmark Sports Group, a startup that works with professional sports teams and leagues to bolster their fan engagement.

“I'll always be proud of what we built together, and excited to see where the Kraken go next,” Humphrey wrote on LinkedIn. “As for me, I'm excited to keep building, innovating, and elevating the fan experience — helping sports teams and leagues reach new heights, in Seattle and beyond.”

— Seattle-based Cascadia Capital, an investment bank serving clients globally, named two hires: 

— The University of Washington School of Medicine named Dr. Jennifer (Jen) Davis as director of the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine. Davis is a cellular and molecular physiologist who studies cardiac wound healing and regeneration. She has been with ISCRM since 2015, serving as interim director since 2024. She is also director of the UW Center for Cardiovascular Biology.

— Bensussen Deutsch & Associates, a Woodinville, Wash.-based global marketing company, announced Kelly Bengston as chief operating officer. Bengston held leadership roles at Starbucks for 15 years and joins Bensussen Deutsch & Associates from CKE Restaurants, the parent company for Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, where she briefly served as chief supply chain officer.

— Kartik Talamadupula joined Oracle as a distinguished architect in AI where he will focus is on building scalable foundations for intelligent systems that can reason over enterprise data and automate complex business processes. Talamadupula previously led AI efforts at Wand AI and Symbl. Earlier in his career, Talamadupula worked at IBM for nearly a decade.  

— Sarah Studer is filling in at the University of Washington's Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship as program manager for the Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership program while Winona Kantamaneni is on family leave until June. Studer previously served as assistant director of the Buerk Center and was managing director of Impact Hub Seattle.

— Barbara Hulit has abandoned retirement for a role as senior managing director of the financial firm Blackstone. In 2023, Hulit retired from the Everett, Wash.-based manufacturing company Fortive after nearly seven years. In the new role, she will lead the development of an operating system as well as serving as an operating executive in the Blackstone's industrials space.

Starting this week, Netflix subscribers can play games on their smart TV — a feature that has been in the works for some time. Reports about Netflix's efforts to bring its mobile games to televisions began in early 2023. Later that year, the company launched a game controller app for iOS devices. 

However, there hadn't been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over.

To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller.

Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix's strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete more directly with major video game companies, beyond just mobile gaming rivals.

Alongside the announcement, Netflix revealed the new slate of games it's launching, all of which are party titles meant to be played in groups. 

These include: 

Launching group-focused games is a smart move for Netflix because it encourages more customers to participate. It also means users will stay engaged with the streaming service, even when they're not watching a TV series or movie. 

The addition of the five titles follows Netflix's recent insight into its current gaming strategy, which will now focus on four types of games, including party titles.

The games are currently available on select TV screens in specific countries, and Netflix plans to expand their availability over time.

Six months after Lip-Bu Tan began his quest to turn around struggling Intel, the semiconductor giant has announced a major hardware upgrade.

On Thursday, Intel unveiled a new processor, codenamed Panther Lake. This marks the next generation of the company's Intel Core Ultra processor family and is the first chip built using Intel's 18A semiconductor process.

The processors are expected to begin shipping later this year and are being produced at Intel's Chandler, Arizona, Fab 52 facility, which came online in 2024.

“We are entering an exciting new era of computing, made possible by great leaps forward in semiconductor technology that will shape the future for decades to come,” Tan said in a company press release. “Our next-gen compute platforms, combined with our leading-edge process technology, manufacturing, and advanced packaging capabilities, are catalysts for innovation across our business as we build a new Intel.”

Separately, Intel also previewed its Xeon 6+, codenamed Clearwater Forest, which is the company's first 18A-based server processor. Intel predicts this will launch in the first half of 2026.

This is the company's largest manufacturing announcement since Tan took over as Intel's CEO in March. In his first few weeks, Tan made clear he would refocus the company on its core businesses and restore its engineering-first culture.

The announcement also emphasizes the 18A semiconductor's ties to the U.S. The company's press release highlighted that this is the most advanced chip manufacturing process produced domestically.

“The United States has always been home to Intel's most advanced R&D, product design, and manufacturing — and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” Tan said in the release.

The U.S. government took a 10% equity stake in Intel in August just weeks after Tan and President Donald Trump met at the White House to discuss how Intel and the government could work together to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.

TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.

Security researchers at Google say hackers targeting corporate executives with extortion emails have stolen data from “dozens of organizations,” one of the first signs that the hacking campaign may be far-reaching.

The tech giant said Thursday in a statement shared with TechCrunch that the Clop extortion gang exploited multiple security vulnerabilities in Oracle's E-Business Suite software to steal significant amounts of data from affected organizations.

Oracle's E-Business software allows companies to run their operations, such as storing their customer data and their employees' human resources files. 

Google said in a corresponding blog post that the hacking campaign targeting Oracle customers dates back to at least July 10, some three months before the hacks were first detected. 

Oracle conceded earlier this week that the hackers behind the extortion campaign were still abusing its software to steal personal information about corporate executives and their companies. Days earlier, Oracle's chief security officer, Rob Duhart, claimed in the same post — since scrubbed — that the extortion campaign was linked to previously identified vulnerabilities that Oracle patched in July, suggesting the hacks were over.

But in a security advisory published over the weekend, Oracle said the zero-day bug — named because Oracle had no time to fix the bug, as it was already being exploited by hackers — can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” 

The Russia-linked Clop ransomware and extortion gang has made a name for itself in recent years for mass-hacking campaigns, often involving the abuse of vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor at the time they were exploited, to steal large amounts of corporate and customer data. This includes managed file transfer tools, like Cleo, MOVEit, and GoAnywhere, which companies use as a way to send sensitive corporate data over the internet.

Google's blog post includes email addresses and other technical details that network defenders can use to look for extortion emails and other indications that their Oracle systems may have been compromised.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech after receiving reports that the software caused vehicles to run red lights or cross into wrong lanes.

The probe, which identified more than 50 reports of these kinds of violations (four of which led to injuries), is one of the first specifically targeted at Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance software. The NHTSA previously opened an investigation into FSD in October 2024 after receiving reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions.

The federal safety agency in April 2024 closed an investigation into Tesla's less-capable Autopilot system after identifying 13 fatal crashes related to the misuse of that software. A separate investigation into the efficacy of the fix Tesla issued to Autopilot remains open.

The new investigation was opened the same week that Tesla released the latest version of the software, which CEO Elon Musk has spent months hyping. This new version is supposed to incorporate training data that Tesla acquired during its limited robotaxi pilot, currently underway in Austin, Texas.

The safety agency's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) said on Thursday that it has received at least 18 complaints and one media report alleging that Tesla's FSD software failed to stop the car or stay stopped at red lights. In addition, ODI said it identified six reports from Tesla under the agency's Standing General Order for Crash Reporting (SGO), which requires companies to submit information about crashes involving autonomous or partially autonomous cars.

ODI said it has already worked with Maryland's Transportation Authority and its State Police to determine if some of the red light problems are repeatable, since “multiple subject incidents occurred at the same intersection in Joppa, Maryland.” Tesla has already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection,” according to the NHTSA.

ODI also said on Thursday it had identified 18 complaints, two media reports, and two SGO reports from Tesla about instances in which FSD “entered opposing lanes of travel during or following a turn, crossed double-yellow lane markings while proceeding straight, or attempted to turn onto a road in the wrong direction despite the presence of wrong-way road signs.” 

ODI said it has identified six complaints, one media report, and four SGO reports where a Tesla with FSD engaged drove straight through an intersection from a turn lane, or turned from a through lane.

“Some of the reported incidents appeared to involve FSD executing a lane change into an opposing lane of travel with little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene,” ODI wrote. 

ODI opened what's known as a “Preliminary Evaluation,” one of the first steps it can take on the way to requiring a recall. The agency said it typically tries to complete these investigations within eight months, although it's unclear if the federal government shutdown would affect the timeline. 

Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year reportedly made dramatic cuts to NHTSA's vehicle automation safety staff.

Why are even experts unsure about whats the right way to do something or even if its possible to do something at all, for anything non-trivial? Why so much hesitancy, if this is the panacea? If we are so sure then why not use the AI itself to come up with a proven paradigm?

I prefer instead to make shallow checkouts for my LXC containers, then my main repo can just pull from those.  This works just like you expect, without weird worktree issues.  The container here is actually providing a security boundary.  With a worktree, you need to mount the main repo's .git directory; a malicious process could easily install a git hook to escape.

FWIW one thing that is worth calling out here is that the initial goal for JIT right now in Python is getting it relatively stable, functional, and more or less getting the initial implementation out there. It's not surprising at all that it's not faster.I say this because I think the teams working on free-threaded and JIT python maybe could have done a better job publicly setting expectations.

Game of Thrones universe fans are going to be fed come 2026. Not only will House of the Dragon be coming back for its third season, but the new spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will explore a fan-favorite part of the Westeros lore.

New York Comic Con attendees were given a peek behind the curtain for the upcoming series, which is set to premiere in January. The show will dive deep into the tales of George R.R. Martin's Hedge Knight in a six-episode adaptation of his stories.

Panelists from the show included showrunner Ira Parker along with cast Peter Claffey, Dexter Sol Ansell, Finn Bennett, Edward Ashley, Henry Ashton, Youssef Kerkour, Daniel Monks, Shaun Thomas, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, and Danny Webb, who gave insight on how the major events in Martin's first “Dunk and Egg” story, The Hedge Knight: The Tourney at the Ashford Meadow, will come to life. 

Readers know the tournament is where Duncan the Tall (Claffey) finds his place as a knight after his mentor passes away. He's a former squire who rises to a new role and takes a squire of his own, a boy by the name of Egg (Ansell)—who's hiding a big secret. 

Parker previously shared with Entertainment Weekly details on the setting of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. It takes place 50 years after House of the Dragon, in a time when all the dragons have died out (before being revived thanks to the events of Game of Thrones).

“The fact that we live in this world where magic once existed is very interesting to me,” Parker told EW. “This is the ground and the grass that has seen dragons and dragon fire before. So everything is just like how the world is, but a little stranger, a little different.”

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms aims to portray Westeros from a scaled-down, grittier perspective—no Iron Throne in sight. It's definitely a much-needed change of pace and we can't wait to see more!

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will debut on HBO January 18, 2026.

NASA employees are bracing for layoffs and budget cuts as the congressional dispute over government funding drags on, threatening several crucial space missions—including some that are already in space.

Earlier this week, hundreds of space advocates met with Congress to try and salvage NASA's funding, according to The Planetary Society. The White House's proposed budget for 2026, released in May, would reduce NASA's funding by $6 billion compared to 2025. Under that proposal, NASA's science budget would drop from $2.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Meanwhile, the fate of almost 40 NASA missions is unknown, after Congress on September 30 failed to agree on a deal to keep the federal government funded for the fiscal year 2026.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed that layoffs were imminent this month, although it is unclear how many workers might be affected, according the Los Angeles Times. The federally funded research center in La Cañada Flintridge, California has already endured two rounds of layoffs that impacted 855 of its employees.

Yet despite the government shutdown, NASA is still focused on sending astronauts to the Moon. “NASA would continue to support Artemis operations during any funding lapse,” the agency wrote in a statement prior to the shutdown. The agency is deep in preparations for its next Artemis mission—Artemis 2—which is set to launch a a four-person crew on a journey around the Moon and back in February 2026.

NASA's ground teams will also continue to operate its current science missions. “If a satellite mission is in the operations phase, we will maintain operations that are essential to ensure the safety of that satellite and the data received from it.”

But not all its spacecraft are accounted for. NASA's Juno mission, launched in 2011 to study Jupiter and its moons, surpassed its latest extension deadline during the shutdown and it's not clear whether the spacecraft is still operational. The mission faces the threat of cancellation under the White House's proposed budget, and although it hasn't been officially chopped, its funding has been cut. It remains unclear whether Juno will survive this.

NASA's OSIRIS-APEX mission, on the other hand, has been saved, Ars Technica reported. A follow-on mission to OSIRIS-REx that's currently on its way to study an asteroid, Apophis, lawmakers have set aside $20 million for the mission to continue, although the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate are yet to agree on a final budget. OSIRIS-APEX was one of 19 operational missions threatened to be shut down under Trump's proposed budget.

We still don't know exactly how much funding NASA will have available for each of its science missions going forward. Earlier in September, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee expressed support for several NASA missions under threat by the proposed budget cuts. The House's commerce, justice, and science budget bill, which allocates funding to federal agencies like NASA, secured more than $24.8 billion for NASA. That's around the same amount the agency received in 2024 and 2025, but much higher than the administration's proposed $18.8 billion for 2026.

The committee adopted amendments to a report accompanying the bill, adding the New Horizons mission exploring the Kuiper Belt, Juno, and a series of lower-cost robotic missions to Mars as part of the bill. The report did not, however, allocate a specific amount of funds to go toward these missions, but it did indicate the committee's overall support.

The last government shutdown in 2018 lasted for 35 days. It's still not clear how long the ongoing shutdown will last. That means it could be days or weeks until the fate of many of NASA's most critical space-faring missions becomes known.

Last week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attempted to urge Taiwan to agree to a 50% - 50% arrangement, under which chips used in devices for the American market would be produced equally in both countries. The ultimate plan of the current administration is to boost domestic semiconductor production to more than 40% by the end of President Donald Trump's current term.

As observed by officials in Taiwan and analysts, the proposal lacks a workable definition, overstates Taiwan's influence on supply constraints, overlooks the current state of the U.S. semiconductor industry, and ignores peculiarities of the global supply chain.

Lutnick said in an interview that the U.S. government has held preliminary talks with Taipei about rebalancing chip output to ensure that half of America's consumption comes from domestic facilities. Even if successful, he acknowledged, the country would remain reliant on Taiwan but would gain the ability to act independently if a crisis arises. Lutnick links his proposal to Taiwan's security, suggesting that a stronger U.S. production base would enable America to safeguard the island more easily, as it would have the means to do so, and would not be dependent on chip supply from the country.

He rejects the idea that Taiwan's (or rather TSMC's) advanced logic dominance — the so-called Silicon Shield — inherently deters conflict. To a large degree, his remarks echo Trump's past claims that Taipei benefits from U.S. protection without adequate compensation.

The Trump administration's stance stems from a long-standing concern: Taiwan manufactures more than 90% of the world's most advanced logic chips, which all happen to be developed in the U.S., which is a vulnerability for American companies like Apple, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, or Nvidia, given the island's proximity to China.

The current U.S. government believes that if the U.S. shares the manufacturing load, it can better defend Taiwan because critical components would not be trapped offshore. In addition, the U.S. Government also tied the cooperation to continued defense commitments. Furthermore, the administration has also paired this message with economic pressure. It proposed 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors but offered exemptions to companies investing in U.S. fabs, such as TSMC and Samsung, to encourage them to build capacities in the U.S. In all likelihood, the proposed 100% tariff would hurt smaller manufacturers.

Lutnick's '50% – 50%' idea focuses on geography instead of capacity. The real issue is not that too many chips are made in Taiwan: it is that the U.S. does not have enough advanced-node capacity or packaging infrastructure to meet its own demand, particularly to make chips equipped for techologies like 5G or AI.

 




The United States already manufactures a large number of chips domestically — Analog Devices, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, SkyWater, and onsemi produce vast quantities of mature-node semiconductors used in cars, power systems, and industrial gear. These often represent the majority of chips in terms of unit count and revenue. Meanwhile, Intel produces plenty of advanced logic chips in the USA, whereas Samsung Foundry and TSMC aim to significantly expand their advanced fabs in America.

So, the U.S. already makes millions of chips, but lags in cutting-edge logic used in AI accelerators, CPUs, smartphones, and servers. Rebalancing the total chip production 50% – 50% is meaningless if the categories are mixed or not defined: the bottleneck lies in EUV-era logic and advanced packaging, not in chips produced on trailing nodes, which represent the lion's share of all chip supply.

""The '50% – 50%' lacks a workable definition, hindering substantive discussion,"" wrote Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities. ""For example, does it refer only to advanced nodes, or also include mature nodes or advanced packaging? Does it apply to chips used domestically within the U.S., or those required by the U.S. government and companies? Without a clear definition, meaningful discussions cannot proceed. This also helps explain why Cheng Li-Chun, Taiwan's Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, said there have been no '50% – 50%' discussions with the U.S.""

Taiwan views its cooperation with the United States as mutually beneficial, rather than delivering on a fixed quota. TSMC's management has expressed commitment to its U.S. sites but remains cautious about overextending resources abroad, highlighting that complex production chains cannot be duplicated overnight.

For years, the United States has been attempting to reclaim lost ground in leading-edge microelectronics. While Intel continues to produce its latest products on its most advanced nodes in America, its arch-rival AMD has long become a fabless semiconductor designer, and Nvidia has always been one. However, GlobalFoundries has ceased to develop leading-edge process technologies. As a result, Taiwan-based TSMC and UMC have gradually absorbed production of advanced chips, which were developed in the U.S., due to costs and logistical reasons. Since the majority of PCs and smartphones are assembled in Asia, it makes sense to make chips there as well.

Lutnick's 50% - 50% proposal looks bold, but it remains aspirational because the gap between American and Taiwanese capabilities is vast. TSMC alone produces more advanced chips than the rest of the world combined. Catching up would require multiple new fabs, tens of thousands of advanced tools from Europe and the U.S., in addition to tens of thousands of skilled workers that the United States currently lacks.

Industry leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. labor pipeline for advanced manufacturing remains limited, which makes constructing news fabs longer and running them difficult.

 




TSMC's ongoing expansion in the United States already represents the largest foreign semiconductor investment in history. The plan includes six fabs for advanced nodes, two advanced packaging facilities, and one research center. The first facility in Arizona — Fab 21 phase 1 — started mass production in late 2024, while the second — Fab 21 phase 2 — was initially expected to use the N3 process by 2028, but has been accelerated to the second half of 2027 and upgraded to include N2 (and possibly A16) technology at the request of the U.S. government, according to Kuo.

The analyst expects the first three fabs to reach full utilization between 2028 and 2030. TSMC itself says that 30% of its N2/16 capacity will be located in the USA, whereas Kuo suggests that its U.S. output will account for roughly 10% to 15% of the foundry's global capacity by 2030, and once all six phases of Fab 21 are operational around 2032, the share could reach 25% to 30%. By some definitions, this level would already fulfil the intent of producing half of America's advanced-node demand domestically at TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona alone, not to mention Intel's fabs in Arizona and Ohio as well as Samsung's fab in Texas.

Kuo argues that the real constraint on American self-reliance is not the willingness or unwillingness of chipmakers to invest in U.S. capacities, but the actual semiconductor industry ecosystem that supports chip manufacturing.

The upstream network supplying materials such as ultra-pure photoresists, underfills, and liquid monomer coatings is heavily concentrated in Japan. Companies like JSR, Namics, and Nagase currently ship to Arizona to support TSMC's Fab 21 phase 1, but as capacity grows, they would need to establish local production or logistics centers in America to avoid tariffs and add flexibility. Building such infrastructure will take years and may not be commercially attractive straight away, given the relatively small demand outside Asia as of today.

Neither Intel, nor TSMC, nor Samsung has been able to persuade JSR to build a photoresist or CMP factory outside of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, or the U.S., where it serves plenty of customers.

However, if GlobalFoundries, Intel, Micron, Samsung, and TSMC build the necessary EUV-based capacity in the U.S., JSR may be more inclined to build its own plant on American soil. At the end of the day, the global photoresist market is expected to grow to $5.3 billion by 2028, and the U.S. may stand to represent a significant share.

This dependence on Japanese materials undercuts the assumption that relocating fabs automatically guarantees security. If geopolitical tensions were to disrupt East Asian trade routes, it is unclear whether Japanese firms could continue supplying chemicals to American customers. Thus, moving chip fabrication to the United States without parallel supply-chain localization would just shift vulnerabilities from one region to another.

The same applies to equipment vendors from Europe and the Netherlands, whose lithography tools remain irreplaceable. Semiconductor resilience depends on the entire global ecosystem: from raw materials to chipmaking equipment and packaging facilities, not just the geographical placement of wafer fabs.

Perhaps a fundamental question is whether it even makes sense to produce half of chips for the U.S. in America, considering the fact that they are more expensive than chips made in Asia.

 




From a cost standpoint, producing half of the chips used in the U.S. on domestic soil is inefficient. Even chips made on TSMC's proven N4/N4P/N5/N5P technologies in the U.S. are said to carry a 30% higher markup than the same chips produced in Taiwan, and while companies like AMD, Apple, and Nvidia can absorb that extra cost, not all companies are that rich.

Furthermore, Asian hubs benefit from dense industrial ecosystems that span from raw materials to fab tool suppliers, enabling fast maintenance and low logistics costs. New U.S. fabs must recreate that web from scratch, and their output will take years to match that of long-established facilities abroad.

Overall, end-users in America will have to pay more for chips produced in the U.S. The difference might seem small per component, but it scales significantly across industries. Everything that relies on silicon — cars, medical devices, PCs, smartphones — absorbs a fraction of the added cost, and becomes more expensive. The price inflation is something that remains to be seen, but ultimately, Americans will have to pay for the onshoring of semiconductor production.

Of course, the logic changes when viewed through the lens of security and resilience. The United States consumes roughly 25% - 33% of the world's semiconductor supply. But it manufactures only about 10% - 12%, and its leading-edge capacity is limited. Meanwhile, Taiwan alone accounts for approximately 90% of leading-edge logic output. Any disruption — whether from conflict, blockade, or earthquake — would affect everything from cloud infrastructure of AWS and Microsoft Azure, to defense electronics.

Truth be told, not many sensitive microelectronics are produced outside the U.S., but the economic harm caused by disruptions may be comparable to actual military harm. Therefore, the proposed '50% to 50%' plan may be considered an insurance policy that guarantees the U.S. and its allies' economic and military continuity, if Asian production faltered.

As a bonus, each fab attracts satellite suppliers, boosts local innovation, and rebuilds technical skills that generate far greater downstream value. However, though the immediate financial return looks weak, the long-term industrial payoff may be substantial. Making half of America's chips domestically may be inefficient, but strategically important.

The implications of Lutnick's proposal extend beyond economics, defense, and supply chains. For the Trump administration, the political symbolism of semiconductor self-reliance is a big deal. Expanding domestic chip production aligns with his economic nationalism and industrial revival, and big announcements by Intel, Samsung, and TSMC enable the government to talk about tangible progress toward that goal.

 




The proposed total commitment of $165 billion from TSMC, and substantial plans from other chipmakers reinforce that narrative, even if many commitments were made when Joe Biden was in the White House, and full capacity remains years away.

Meanwhile, trade talks between Washington and Taipei continue, and future tariff structures for companies getting chips in Taiwan and supplying them to the U.S. will depend on those negotiations.

Achieving a balance in semiconductor supply will depend on tackling bottlenecks that span across regulators, workforce development, and supplier localization. TSMC's U.S. build-out is already advancing faster than expected, and by the early 2030s, American fabs could meet a significant portion of local demand.

However, transforming the global semiconductor supply chain into a model, equipped with multiple major vertically-integrated semiconductor manufacturing hubs, led by America and Taiwan, would require changes that are outside the U.S. government's control.

 




True strategic autonomy for the U.S. will require more than just advanced logic fabs. For now, lithography systems are made in Europe, while sophisticated raw materials are supplied by Japanese companies, which have never disclosed plans to make them in Korea, Taiwan, or the U.S.

All advanced processors need memory, and only Micron plans to produce DRAM in the U.S. Even SK hynix, which plans to assemble HBM memory stacks in America, has no plans to build actual HBM DRAM dies in the country.

Without a vertically integrated semiconductor supply chain, which will take years to build, the strategic autonomy vision will remain a political talking point, rather than a practical path to semiconductor independence.

We scream and shout and let it all out about backups, yet nobody listens.

It's a fairly safe bet that on any given day, at least a good dozen IT departments are trying to convince their bosses and/or users about the vital importance of backups. Unfortunately, it seems that the argument was lost in the South Korean government, as the institution has completely lost the sizable amount of 858 terabytes of data, with 0 bytes of backups.

The event happened on September 26 and was caused by a battery fire at the National Information Resources Service datacenter in Daejeon, burning up 384 battery packs, the majority of one floor, and taking down 96 government systems. While 95 of those had backups, the G-Drive system (no relation to Google Drive), used primarily but not only by the Ministry of Personnel Management, did not.

In total, it's estimated that roughly 17% of central government officials are affected, and roughly eight years' worth of data was lost. The fire promptly brought down government email, online post office, websites, complaints and petition services, and even the national 119 emergency service. A full recovery should take about a month, as reportedly the affected teams are having trouble even figuring out which specific data was lost. As of October 4, it was estimated that only 17.8% of services were back online.

While a datacenter fire is an event that can happen anywhere at any time, it's more than a little puzzling to find that the G-Drive data was lost because, according to an unnamed source, ""[it] couldn't have a backup due to its large capacity.""

858 terabytes is a big number for a household, but barely registers in the scale of datacenter storage, where entire petabytes are doled out like candy. This fact is even stranger, as South Korea is seen as a highly technologically advanced country, being the home of Samsung and other conglomerates known as chaebol.

G-Drive is a document sharing platform, similar to Google Drive. Each employee's default quota on the system was 30 GB, and users were instructed to keep their data there instead of in the office computers, as should be the policy everywhere... when there are backups. There's also a certain irony in the fact that the more vintage systems were then ones whose data survived.

While the fire itself apparently caused no casualties, one government worker overseeing the data recovery sadly took his own life by jumping off the Central Building in Sejong's Government Complex on October 3. Four people have been arrested in connection with the fire, reportedly under suspicion of criminal negligence.

OpenAI will be among the first to get these accelerators.

Compute chiplets of AMD's next-generation Instinct MI450-series accelerators based on the CDNA 5 architecture set to be introduced in the second half of next year will be made on TSMC's N2 (2nm-class) fabrication technology, marking the first time the company will use a leading-edge manufacturing process for AI GPUs. Usage of the latest production node could give AMD a major advantage when competing against Nvidia's upcoming Rubin GPUs and systems on their base, which are set to be made on N3.

""We are really excited about our MI450 generation, it has 2nm technology, so the most advanced fabrication capability, it has rack scale solutions, so we are really putting all of these compute elements together,"" Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, revealed in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ""The way to think about it is it takes a village to build this all. So, you know, we are of course very, you know, proud and focused."" 

AMD's current-generation CDNA 4-based Instinct MI350-series AI accelerators use compute chiplets produced by TSMC using one of its proven N3-series fabrication technologies (which entered mass production in late 2022), so it is reasonable for the company to transit to a 2nm-class manufacturing process for its next-generation GPUs for AI and HPC applications. AMD's Instinct MI450-series accelerators will be the company's first processors tailored specifically for AI and, therefore, support appropriate data formats and instructions. Perhaps, a new node will enable AMD to pack in some secret sauce into its new compute GPUs. 

Indeed, N2 promises tangible — as TSMC calls them 'full node' — improvements compared to predecessors, such as a 10% to 15% performance improvement at the same power or complexity, or a 25% to 30% power reduction at the same frequency, along with a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E. The key advantage of the new production node will be gate-all-around (GAA) transistors that enable developers to tailor designs for maximum efficiency when using design and technology co-optimization (DTCO). Overall, by migrating to N2, AMD will obtain a broad set of benefits that include performance efficiency and transistor density.

Nvidia has already announced that its next-generation Rubin GPUs will be produced using one of TSMC's N3 technologies (presumably N3P tailored for Nvidia's needs), so AMD's Instinct MI450 will have an edge over its key rival when it comes to manufacturing process. AMD's Helios rack-scale solution with 72 Instinct MI450 GPUs will also carry more HBM4 memory (51TB vs 21TB) and offer more memory bandwidth (1,400 TB/s vs 936 TB/s) compared to Nvidia's Rubin-based NVL144 machine. However, Nvidia's next-generation rack-scale solution will offer tangibly higher FP4 (well, NVFP4) performance compared to AMD's Helios (3,600 PFLOPS vs 1,440 PFLOPS), so it remains to be seen which of the systems will be faster and more power efficient, especially given uncertainties with UALink scale-up interconnections for the Instinct MI450-series GPUs. 

One of the first customers to adopt AMD's Instinct MI450 is said to be OpenAI, which will start to get the hardware in the second half of next year, with AMD revenue ramping sharply afterward. The project will unfold over multiple phases and should generate double-digit billions in incremental sales once fully operational, according to Su. For AMD, the alliance signifies validation of years of investment in its AI architectures and data center solutions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Daily 'exercise snacks' linked to better heart and lung function","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/exercise-snacks-boost-heart-and-lung-health","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 05:39:34 GMT","

Regular physical activity is essential for health, helping to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depression, and osteoporosis, as well as premature death.

However, many adults struggle to achieve the 150 minutes of moderate activity, or 75 minutes of intense activity each week recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A recent study found that almost one-third of people take insufficient physical activity to maintain health.

Now, a review study has shown that, for physically inactive adults, short bursts of physical activity, known as “exercise snacks,” may be effective in enhancing heart and lung function.

First author of the study, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, a doctoral researcher in clinical research at the University of Oviedo, Spain, told Medical News Today that:

“When people are asked why they don't exercise, the most common answers are lack of time and lack of motivation. Exercise snacks directly address both: They're short, flexible, and easy to fit into daily routines.”

The study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests that exercise snacks could be an easy way to get some exercise every day, particularly if you are otherwise physically inactive.

Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, who was not involved in the research, explained that “this review analyzed multiple previous studies and found that brief (less than 5 minutes) periods of moderate-to-intense exercise at least twice a day was associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness.“

“These findings provide a potential avenue for sedentary people to obtain a health benefit with only short amounts of physical activity,” said Chen.

The researchers analyzed data from 11 studies, from Canada, Australia, China and the United Kingdom. The 414 participants (approximately one-third men and two-thirds women), ranged in age from 18-75 years.

All participants were sedentary or physically inactive at the start of the programs and, in studies that recorded body mass index (BMI) — nine out of 11 — all participants were in the normal, overweight or obese category.

Exercise protocols varied between studies. Participants exercised on 3, 4, 5 or 7 days a week, carrying out between 2 and 10 ‘exercise snacks' per day at moderate to vigorous levels, for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time, over a period of between 4 and 12 weeks.

Types of exercise included stair climbing, leg-focused strength exercises and tai chi — a low-impact ancient Chinese martial art designed to improve balance, strength and flexibility.

The researchers noted that 83% of participants stuck to the program for the entirety of the study they were involved in, which is much higher than for other exercise protocols, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), to which only 63% of participants adhere.

The researchers assessed several outcomes, including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and endurance, blood lipids (cholesterols and triglycerides), BMI, body fat percentage and fat distribution. They also looked at balance, blood pressure, and mental health outcomes including anxiety and depression.

Even when participants were undertaking less than the CDC's recommended amount of exercise per week, exercise snacks resulted in statistically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (heart and lung function) in younger physically inactive adults, and in muscular endurance in older adults.

“What's remarkable is that these gains were achieved with exercise volumes far below current WHO [World Health Organization] recommendations. This suggests that small, consistent bouts of movement can meaningfully improve fitness, even in people who find it hard to dedicate long periods to exercise,” Rodríguez told MNT.

However, the researchers emphasize that as only one of the studies compared exercise snacks with moderate intensity continuous exercise, they cannot determine whether these benefits are equivalent to those achieved with longer sessions.

“The main message is that exercise does not need to be long, structured, or complicated to be effective. Short, repeated bouts of activity (i.e., ‘exercise snacks') can significantly improve fitness with very little time commitment,” Rodríguez advised.

“It is important to recognize that exercise should ideally be individualized to maximize its benefits,” he continued. “The response to training can differ substantially between adults and older adults, due to variations in physiological capacity, recovery rate, and baseline fitness. To optimize health-related outcomes, some degree of programming and personalization of these exercise bouts becomes necessary.”

“Nevertheless,” he added, “any opportunity throughout the day to move, even briefly, can make a meaningful contribution. Incorporating short, vigorous snacks of activity whenever possible remains a highly valuable and accessible strategy for improving overall health and cardiorespiratory fitness.”

Chen agreed: “This form of exercise might be an efficient way for busy and/or sedentary individuals to get at least some cardiopulmonary benefit with only brief periods of higher-intensity physical activity.”

For those who are physically inactive and/or short of time, Rodríguez suggested a number of different activities that can be easily fitted into daily routines:

“For healthy adults, practical examples include fast stair climbing, bodyweight squats, lunges, push-ups, or even burpees, provided that their physical condition allows these higher-intensity movements. For older adults or individuals with lower fitness levels, more accessible activities such as chair stands, light resistance training, or short bouts of balance and coordination exercises like tai chi can be highly effective.”

However, he added that, particularly for those over 50 years of age, “balancing intensity, safety, and consistency is essential when implementing exercise snacks in everyday life.”

BERLIN — Diet drinks may not be “healthier” than sugary drinks when it comes to liver health.

A large UK Biobank study found that higher intakes of both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low- and non-SSBs (LNSSBs) were significantly associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

In fact, low- or artificially sweetened beverages were actually linked to a higher risk for MASLD than sugar-laden drinks, even at modest intake levels such as a single can per day.

“These findings challenge the common perception that these drinks are harmless and highlight the need to reconsider their role in diet and liver health, especially as MASLD emerges as a global health concern,” lead author Lihe Liu, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, said in a news release.

She presented her research at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2025 in Berlin, Germany.

MASLD affects 38% of the global population and has become a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related death. Lifestyle modification remains “a cornerstone” of MASLD management. Current guidelines advise against SSBs, but the evidence regarding LNSSBs remains “limited,” Liu explained in her presentation.

To investigate, the researchers analyzed data of 123,788 UK Biobank participants without liver disease at baseline who were followed for an average of 10.3 years. Beverage consumption was assessed through repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires using the question: “How many glasses, cans, or cartons containing 250 mL (roughly 250 g) of SSBs or LNSSBs did you drink yesterday?”

Intake was averaged across at least two recalls, and participants were grouped into three intake categories: none, more than 0 to one serving per day, or more than one serving per day.

The primary outcome was incident MASLD, and secondary outcomes included liver-related mortality and liver fat content measured using MRI-derived proton density fat fraction.

In the fully adjusted multivariable Cox model, compared with no consumption, consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was associated with a 60% higher risk for MASLD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.599). The level of consumption of SSBs was associated with a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.469).

Consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was also associated with a higher risk for severe liver outcomes (HR, 1.555), while SSBs showed no significant association after adjustment.

Neither SSBs nor LNSSBs showed significant associations with all-cause mortality in fully adjusted models.

Substituting either beverage with water reduced the risk for MASLD by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs, Liu reported.

Both beverage types were positively associated with higher liver fat content. Consumption of more than one serving of SSBs and LNSSBs daily was associated with about 5% and 7% higher liver fat levels, respectively, than nonconsumption.

“The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain, and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings, and even stimulating insulin secretion,” Liu said.

“The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body,” she concluded.

Reached for comment, Sujit V. Janardhan, MD, PhD, director of the steatotic liver disease program, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, said the findings “certainly should cause one to take pause from the popular notion that diet or non-sugar-sweetened beverages are healthier than their sugar-sweetened alternatives.”

He cautioned, however, that it would be “important to confirm cofounders are adequately addressed in this large population-based study.”

“We must better understand what other exposure and characteristics were present in patients who had increased intake of non-sugar-sweetened beverages,” Janardhan told Medscape Medical News.

“For example, it's possible people who drank more non-sugar-sweetened beverages had more cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors (which prompted them to switch to the ‘diet' alternative) and that it is these comorbidities that drove an association with increased MASLD incidence and liver-related mortality,” Janardhan noted.

“If there is one finding that seems easy to take away from this study, it's that people who drank more water in place of sweetened beverages had reduced risk of MASLD,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Therefore, while awaiting results of mechanistic studies and careful confounder analysis, “plain old boring water is your best bet,” Janardhan said.

The study had no specific funding. Liu and Janardhan had no relevant disclosures.

Methotrexate-induced osteopathy is a rare but significant condition, predominantly affecting postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. In patients using methotrexate who presented with stress fractures of the lower limbs, early confirmation with MRI or bone scintigraphy could aid diagnosis and discontinuation of methotrexate should be considered.

“Clinicians should bear in mind that the benefits of using MTX [methotrexate] far outweigh the risk of developing this osteopathy in most cases,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by François Robin, MD, PhD, Rennes University Hospital in Rennes, France. It was published online on September 25, 2025, in RMD Open.

The retrospective nature of this study with potential bias is a major limitation. Due to the study design, the researchers could not make conclusions on the efficacy of associated specific bone therapy on fracture evolution. Additionally, the patients presented multiple risk factors for bone fragility, including prolonged corticosteroid therapy, which could influence bone phenotypes. 

The study did not receive any funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Ochsner Health announces the launch of its Genetic Wellness Assessment, an innovative screening tool to help identify individuals at risk for hereditary cancers. The Genetic Wellness Assessment is now available for adults interested in learning more about their cancer risk at Ochsner.org/GeneticWellnessSurvey. 

The Genetic Wellness Assessment allows individuals to determine whether they may have a higher genetic risk of developing cancer by answering a few simple questions that evaluate individual risk factors. Those identified as having a high risk, or anyone interested in further evaluation, can schedule an appointment to discuss genetic testing. The results of genetic testing are used by healthcare providers to offer personalized recommendations for cancer screening, prevention and further evaluation for patients and family members. 

The Genetic Wellness Assessment is a pivotal step in advancing precision medicine and preventive care. This program allows us to proactively determine if patients are genetically predisposed to developing cancer. Once patients are identified, we can offer a tailored plan to prevent a cancer from developing or detecting it early when it's most treatable."" 

Marc Matrana, MD, system medical director of precision medicine, Ochsner Health

Adults interested in taking the assessment can visit Ochsner.org/GeneticWellnessSurvey to complete the Genetic Wellness Assessment at no cost. The assessment evaluates a patient's personal and family history of cancer to identify their risk of having a genetic cancer syndrome. 

If a patient is identified as high risk, they are offered genetic counseling, testing, and a personalized cancer screening and prevention plan. 

It's estimated that hereditary cancer syndromes, like Lynch syndrome or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, are responsible for about 1 in 8 cancers. These conditions increase the risk of developing cancer at a younger age or in multiple family members. 

By identifying these risks early, Ochsner can help patients take preventive actions, such as specialized screenings or treatments, which can improve outcomes. Ochsner offers complete care and support through its Hereditary Cancer & High-Risk Program to ensure patients receive personalized attention and resources. 

""Advancements in genomics and precision medicine are transforming how we approach cancer prevention and treatment,"" said Dr. Matrana. ""This program empowers patients with knowledge about their risk of developing cancer and connects them with a multidisciplinary team of experts to ensure they and their families receive the best in cancer prevention, early detection and treatment.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Perlmutter Cancer Center experts shine light on the rise of breast cancer in younger adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251009/Perlmutter-Cancer-Center-experts-shine-light-on-the-rise-of-breast-cancer-in-younger-adults.aspx","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:02:00 GMT","

Currently, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women age 20 to 49 in the United States. Compounding this concerning issue, younger patients are being diagnosed at more advanced stages, according to doctors at NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center, and this points to a greater need for screening, prevention, and breast cancer education.

While this is a concerning trend, the quality of life for those diagnosed—even at stage 4, when it has spread to other parts of the body—is improving. Perlmutter Cancer Center is adapting to the landscape with the recent launch of the Early Onset Cancer Program, one of several programs aimed at targeting and tailoring treatment for people living with cancer.

This Breast Cancer Awareness Month, leading oncologists Elizabeth Comen, MD, co-director of the Mignone Women's Health Collaborative, and Mary L. Gemignani, MD, MPH, director of the Women's Early Onset Cancer Program and chief of the Division of Breast Surgery, answer the most important questions around the rise of cancer in younger adults.

Dr. Gemignani: While the median age at the time of diagnosis is 62, we're seeing early onset at a much younger age than that. Around 10 percent of the patients that we see today are 45 and younger. Over the last two decades, there's been an increase in diagnoses in people age 20 to 29 and 30 to 39. We're also seeing more aggressive molecular profiles among our younger patients, which poses a greater risk for prognosis and outcomes. Triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive subtype without many targeted treatment options, is also more common in younger women. The American Cancer Society reported that women under 50 are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to men of the same ages. This is primarily attributed to increasing rates of breast cancer.

Dr. Comen: Education about risk assessment and family history is crucial in addressing the increasing number of breast cancer diagnoses among young people. Patients should openly discuss their family medical history with their primary care physicians and consider taking a breast cancer risk-assessment test. Understanding your personal risk helps guide and tailor your care, regardless of whether you have a family history of the disease. For women at average risk, beginning routine screening at age 40 is generally appropriate. However, those at higher risk may need to start screening earlier. Additionally, women with dense breasts may benefit from supplemental imaging—such as ultrasound or breast MRI—in addition to standard mammograms. We advocate for grassroots education: start the conversation with your primary care provider, learn your family history, and collaborate with your doctor to monitor and manage any symptoms. If something feels off, speak up. Trust your instincts.

Dr. Gemignani: Health literacy and self-advocacy are also extremely important. Younger patients, whether they're undergoing screening, diagnosis, or treatment, are often navigating the healthcare system for the first time. A breast cancer diagnosis can be extremely overwhelming because there's so much terminology and medical language that people may not understand. Building a trusting relationship between the care team and the patient creates a safe space for questions and conversations, which empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care.

Dr. Comen: At Perlmutter Cancer Center, we recognize that treating breast cancer goes beyond addressing the biology of the disease. It's also about supporting the whole patient experience. Every individual's journey is unique, and young women in particular may face distinct challenges related to their stage of life, including concerns about fertility, parenting young children, career demands, and family responsibilities. Our approach is focused not only on treatment, but also on preserving quality of life and helping patients maintain their roles and identities outside of their diagnosis. This includes addressing important issues such as nutrition, exercise, emotional wellbeing, sexual health, and overall functioning in daily life. Our goal is to provide care that supports the whole person—not only treats the cancer.

Dr. Gemignani: When we established the Early Onset Cancer Program, we were thinking about these types of lifestyle changes and priorities like family planning. In your 30s to 40s, your friends could be going on a night out, and you are buying a cold cap and getting ready for chemo. That is difficult for people. The Early Onset Cancer Program was designed with these moments in mind. Survivorship has really evolved into a holistic, individual, and personal experience, and our program honors that.

Dr. Comen: There are several innovative programs we have invested in and now offer to oncology patients. One is the Oncofertility Program, which helps any cancer patient at NYU Langone understand and pursue their fertility options as part of their cancer treatment. Any provider in the health system—including nurses and physician assistants—can refer patients to a team of dedicated fertility nurse navigators.

Dr. Gemignani: We also launched the Cardio-Oncology Program in October 2024, enabling patients and their oncologists to create personalized care plans to protect and treat the heart for newly diagnosed patients, those actively receiving treatment, or cancer survivors. We also offer services for psychosocial distress, sexual health, rehabilitation, and sickness from hormone therapy, as well as exercise and physical therapy, yoga, and access to social workers as part of our Survivorship Program.

We are committed to providing younger cancer patients personalized care that meets their individual needs and gives them the best quality of life possible. There are more people living with cancer now than ever before, and the oncology field has come a long way in how we think about survivorship and treat the specific needs of younger cancer patients.

Poor blood sugar control in adolescence increases the risk of painful future complications for people with type 1 diabetes, research co-led by University of Michigan suggests.

The study, which followed participants for over 30 years, highlights how children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age have trouble controlling their blood sugar as teens.

Investigators found that children who had poor glycemic control - meaning, higher-than-average blood sugar levels - during adolescence were more likely to develop neuropathy in adulthood.

Neuropathy is nerve damage that can cause pain, numbness and tingling in the extremities. Of nearly 40 million Americans with diabetes, up to 50% may receive a neuropathy diagnosis.

Results are published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

This unique study emphasizes the importance of supporting teenagers with type 1 diabetes to manage their blood sugar well and ensure a smooth transition to adult care to prevent future complications.""

Eva Feldman, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author, director of the ALS Center of Excellence at U-M Health and James W. Albers Distinguished University Professor at U-M

Children in the study received a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes before the age of six. Researchers accessed nearly 2,000 of the participants' HbA1c (blood sugar) readings over the course of three decades.

During adolescence, participants had an average blood sugar reading of 8.9%, higher than averages during both childhood and adulthood.

Participants with the greatest increase in HbA1c levels from childhood to adolescence not only retained higher blood sugar levels in adulthood, but they also had a greater risk for neuropathy.

""Our findings suggest that difficulties maintaining blood sugar in adolescence may lead to greater difficulties in achieving future glycemic control,"" Feldman said.

""Although the mechanisms behind that association are unclear, hyperglycemia leads to impairments in cell metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose regulation, all of which could cause long-term challenges in optimal glycemic control.""

Adolescent hyperglycemia is likely not the only contributor to risk of future complications, such as neuropathy, says Kara Mizokami-Stout, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at U-M Medical School, who was not involved in the study.

""While clear links between glycemia and neuropathy have been found in type 1 diabetes, we know there are also vascular risk factors that play a key role in the development of neuropathy,"" Mizokami-Stout said.

""However, this study does underscore the need to maximize our support for younger individuals with diabetes.""

The 'Futbol W' crew debate who will miss out on a play-off spot in NWSL. (2:54)

United States women's national team forward Emma Sears has signed a new contract with Racing Louisville FC through the 2028 NWSL season, the club confirmed Thursday.

Sears is tied for third in the NWSL Golden Boot race with 10 goals this season after scoring a brace on Saturday in a 3-1 victory over the North Carolina Courage. A week earlier, she scored Louisville's lone goal in a 1-0 win over Angel City FC.

Those victories leave Louisville seventh in the NWSL standings with three games to play. The top eight teams make the playoffs. Louisville has finished in ninth place in all four seasons of the franchise's existence, missing out on the playoffs each time.

""I'm so proud to be continuing my career with Racing Louisville FC -- a club and city that have truly become home for me,"" Sears said in a statement. ""We've built something special here. I'm motivated to grow as a player, compete for championships and to make Louisville proud.

""I'm excited for the opportunity to continue building with this team, and I am fully committed to help push this club to new heights in the seasons ahead!""

Sears arrived in Louisville as a second-round pick in the 2024 NWSL Draft and quickly played her way onto USWNT head coach Emma Hayes' radar.

The 24-year-old Sears has eight caps for the United States, registering one goal and two assists. In her debut against Iceland on Oct. 27, 2024, she became the first player to register a goal and an assist in their first cap since Christen Press in 2013.

Hayes said in July that she had been working with Sears on advancing elements of her game like a better final pass. Sears contributed an assist in a 4-0 win over Ireland in June.

Sears said after Saturday's brace for Louisville that she has grown as a player in recent months.

""I think the biggest thing for me and just taking those conversations and soaking everything in that I can from all the coaches that I have, is mostly the consistency piece,"" Sears said. ""I think that I have been a lot more intentional with the way that I'm playing, and I think that has ultimately benefitted my game.

""I feel like I've found myself in a little bit more of a flow state in games and I'm not having to think as much. It's kind of just coming naturally, and I think that these past few games, I've really hit my stride with that.

""All credit to my teammates. I know that they've backed me and they're there for me. I hear the encouragement from behind me each game and I think that helps boost my confidence a lot in the final third.""

Louisville's 32 points this season is already a franchise record. The club has done work to keep the core of the squad in place and avoid losing players to free agency. Sears' previous contract was due to run through the 2026 season.

Midfielder Taylor Flint signed a new contract in July to stay in Louisville through the 2028 NWSL season. In July, Racing also exercised the 2026 option on head coach Bev Yanez's contract to keep her in the role.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

From winning two MLS Cups with the Columbus Crew to excelling in the EFL Championship with Middlesbrough FC, Aidan Morris has always risen to the occasion in big moments.

Now, the 23-year-old midfielder faces arguably the biggest challenge of his career as he competes for a spot on the US men's national team ahead of next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup.

One of 26 players called up by head coach Mauricio Pochettino for this month's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, the Crew homegrown visited ""Club & Country"" at USMNT training camp in Austin to discuss his World Cup dreams, role model and more.

On the competition for USMNT midfield spots:

""It's definitely a competitive area and position, but I'm trying just to be myself; I'm not gonna do anything more. Try to put good performances in, show the right things, be a good teammate. I don't think anything is complicated; I'll just be myself.""

""I try to steer clear of that. I think that leads you into kind of a victim mindset, like, 'I deserve this, I deserve that.' As I mentioned earlier, I try to just be myself and control what I can control. Just wake up every day and try to get that one percent better. From there, wherever that leads me, whether it's back to the national team or just still performing at a high level for my club, and that's it, and then hopefully that leads me to 2026.""

On playing with MLS legend and retiring midfielder Darlington Nagbe in Columbus:

""I wouldn't be sitting here if it weren't for that guy. He's just been such a big role model for me in my career. When I was 18, he was just in a couple of months, and he was sitting with me doing film for every day before games.

""I've tried to model my game after him, but not even football. Man, you take football out of it and just life, how he carries himself, he could say hi to everyone here and just have that same smile on his face. Just how he treats people with the utmost respect, how he shows up to work every single day and gives it his all. You see guys take days off. But man, never with him. He's probably been the biggest influence in my career since I started playing.""

On thinking about the 2026 World Cup roster:

""I don't think this game, this sport, and this career are a crazy formula. I think it's like I just said: Just try to get better, and try not to get carried away and swept away with all the other nonsense of like, 'I'm entitled to this, I deserve to be here, I deserve to be there.' I think it's focused on the simple things, just getting better.""

On potentially playing a World Cup at home:

""It's all about inspiring the next generation. It's probably the biggest tournament in the whole entire world in all sports, and I think having that on home soil, it just gives that next generation so much to look forward to. There will be millions of kids in the stands, being like, 'Oh, that's what I want to do now.'""

In just a few short years, Patrick Agyemang has gone from Division III college soccer to MLS stardom with Charlotte FC to a club-record transfer to EFL Championship side Derby County.

Is a trip to the 2026 FIFA World Cup with the US men's national team up next for the 24-year-old striker?

Currently in USMNT camp for this month's international friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, Agyemang spoke with ""Club & Country"" to discuss his meteoric career rise, World Cup aspirations and more.

WATCH: Club & Country

On asking teammates about the EFL Championship before his transfer:

""I think for me, I had teammates that played in the Champ[ionship] at Charlotte, so the first thing I talked to them right away. I said, 'Yo, what do I need to expect?' And they were like, 'Listen, it's a grind,' But they told me they have confidence in me to do well, and there's a couple of guys in the camp here as well that have been there. So when I was in the Gold Cup, of course, I was talking to Haji [Wright] and stuff like that, because I know he's in it and he understood it. I was trying to get as much feedback before I got into it.""

On playing at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup:

“The main thing for me, it's a very pressured environment and you're expected to perform. That's what you want to be around, especially myself. You want to learn from these experiences, and I think for me, the intensity and how much everyone cares to win. It's something that I want to take into my game every single day. I just want to take every moment at a time, take it in stride and enjoy it, but for me it's like, I want to be back there in specific environments like that.”

On whether he reflects on his unique career journey to the USMNT:

“Honestly, my brothers are the ones who help me with that a lot. They just say, ‘Look where you came from, where you started from.' Back then, I'm just trying to enjoy every day. I knew I had talent, but I just wanted to show it. Now I'm at the stage where I can show it and I can really put my stamp on games and stuff. Now for me, it's just to take that next step and take that next level to just try to be a better version of myself.”

On mentors throughout his career:

“It's crazy because it's not even positional-based, but there's a couple of guys on the team that kind of took me under their wing at Charlotte when I first got there. I could say Nathan Byrne right away. I was new to everything. I kind of kept to myself initially, and he just pulled me and said, ‘Look, you've got talent, now it's just show it.' He just kind of took me under his wing, and I just started listening to him and seeing how he plays. You see him on the field, always running, always hitting somebody, always trying to give 100%, and I wanted to do that as well. So he's definitely helping me a long way.”

On playing the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil:

“For me, it's a dream. I've grown up playing and I always wanted to be in a position to be in a camp like this and to be in a World Cup. So for me, it's trying to show what I can do at that world stage and the fact that it's here, it's like it's right in a script. Who's writing the script, you know? For me, it's just to do everything I can to put myself in the best position possible to be selected.”

The U.S. men's national team is back in action to kick off the penultimate international window of 2025, as they take on Ecuador at Austin FC's Q2 Stadium before looking ahead to a matchup with Australia. 

Against Ecuador, the USMNT faces the second-place finishers in South American World Cup qualifying and the 24th-ranked team in the world, providing Mauricio Pochettino's side with a strong test. 

While Pochettino's first year with the USMNT saw some less-than-ideal outcomes, the Argentine manager may have found a new lease on success with his adjustment to a 3-4-3 formation, which led to a 2–0 win over Japan. 

It would be easy to stick the Stars and Stripes into its usual 4-3-3, but that has not garnered results, leaving Pochettino with a major decision to make for Friday's clash.

Here's what the USMNT's XI could look like against Ecuador. 

GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper has been the de facto No. 1 in 2025 for the USMNT, and there has been no legitimate challenger in recent months, even with Matt Turner back in MLS with the New England Revolution. 

CB: Tim Ream—The Charlotte FC veteran shifts to right center back, allowing him to link up with Alex Freeman on the right side. 

CB: Cameron Carter-Vickers—Vancouver Whitecaps FC defender Tristan Blackmon started against Japan in the back three, but is not on the roster for October, so Celtic FC mainstay Carter-Vickers comes back in. 

CB: Chris Richards—The Crystal Palace stalwart has been the USMNT's best defender in 2025, and is arguably the team's most important defensive player. 

RWB: Alex Freeman—It's been a breakout year with the USMNT and Orlando City SC for Alex Freeman, and he appears as much of a lock to start for Pochettino as anyone. 

CM: Malik Tillman—The best creative player for the USMNT at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, Tillman has had some challenges adapting to life in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen, but should remain a USMNT starter. 

CM: Weston McKennie—The Juventus midfielder has been in middling form in Serie A, but will look to prove himself as a true starter with the American squad after sporadic minutes under Pochettino. 

LWB: Antonee Robinson—The man they call “Jedi” returns to the USMNT for the first time since March, and the Fulham defender could slot in at the role Columbus Crew midfielder Max Arfsten has been playing. 

RW: Alejandro Zendejas—After scoring against Japan, Zendejas endeared himself to USMNT fans and, with five goals and three assists in 12 games with Club América in Liga MX, should earn another start

ST: Folarin Balogun—With a goal and an assist in five Ligue 1 games with AS Monaco, Balogun remains the best option up top for Pochettino. 

LW: Christian Pulisic—Leading the Serie A Golden Boot race with four goals and two assists with AC Milan, Christian Pulisic comes into this USMNT camp in the best form of his life.

Mauricio Pochettino's United States men's national team will get a good challenge from fellow World Cup entrants Ecuador at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas on Friday.

The Yanks have a strong squad for this window, an improved unit from the group that lost 2-0 to South Korea before toppling Japan by the same score.

This Ecuador team hasn't lost in over a year, a September 2024 away loss to Brazil in World Cup qualifying. La Tricolor have since gone 11 games without a loss, all CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with a win over Argentina the latest triumph.

Former Elche manager Sebastián Beccacece, a Jorge Sampaoli disciple, is at the wheel of a strong ship, even if Ecuador will be without Moises Caicedo for the window. They'll face Mexico in Zapopan on Oct. 14, and play North American-based matches in November against Canada (Toronto) and New Zealand (New Jersey).

Kick off time: 8:30pm ET Friday (October 10)Venue: Q2 Stadium — Austin, TexasTV Channel: NBC Universo (en Español), TNT (in English)Streaming: Stream live en Español on Peacock



This team can do some damage even without Tyler Adams, Sergino Dest, Yunus Musah, and Ricardo Pepi.

RELATED — How will USMNT line up vs Ecuador?

Antonee Robinson is back in the fold despite a surprisingly-limited number of minutes at Fulham, while red-hot Tanner Tessmann of Lyon rejoins the midfield unit. Malik Tillman is also doing so well after a move to Bayer Leverkusen.

Christian Pulisic has had a sensational early run at AC MIlan this season even accounting a missed penalty in recent weeks. In-form Haji Wright and Timothy Weah will also be in the discussion to start.

The Yanks will not have to deal with several big names besides Chelsea star Caicedo, as Arsenal's Piere Hincapie, Flamengo's Gonzalo Plata, Quito's Carlos Gruezo, and Cremonese's Jeremy Sarmiento are not in the squad.

But new centurion Enner Valencia is joined by Strasbourg hotshot Kendry Paez (a Chelsea loanee), PSG's Willian Pacho, and AC Milan's Pervis Estupinan in the squad. It's an excellent group.

The Caicedo absence could loom large here, especially with the Americans on home soil. Let's go for the same score as a memorable Copa America quarterfinal win for Jurgen Klinsmann's USMNT in 2016. USMNT 2-1 Ecuador.

BIR EL DJIR, Algeria -- Algeria has become the fourth African country to qualify for the 2026 World Cup -- and all of them are from the north of the continent.

A 3-0 win over Somalia on Thursday guaranteed Algeria first place in Group G in African qualifying and a return to the World Cup for the first time since 2014.

Algeria, captained by Riyad Mahrez and led by former Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic, joined neighboring nations Morocco and Tunisia as well as Mohamed Salah's Egypt in securing a spot in next year's expanded 48-team tournament being held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

- Salah double sends Egypt to 2026 World Cup
- 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it
- Infantino: Need 'open mind' on World Cup planning

It will be the fifth time for the Algerians at the World Cup -- and they've only ever progressed from the group stage once, in 2014 when they lost to Germany in the round of 16.

A total of nine African teams will directly qualify and be in the World Cup tournament draw taking place on Dec. 5 in Washington D.C.

The other five group winners will be known over the next week. The four best runners-up play in a knockout competition in November and the winner advances to the playoffs.

Despite being a home game for Somalia, it was staged at the Miloud Hadefi Olympic Complex in Algeria and the fans were treated to a show by Mahrez -- the team's star winger who used to play for Manchester City and now is at Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia.

The 34-year-old Mahrez set up goals for Mohamed Amoura in the sixth and 58th minutes, either side of scoring himself with a fierce strike into the roof of the net in the 19th.

Mahrez started his international career weeks before the 2014 World Cup and was included in Algeria's squad for the tournament, only playing in its first group game.

Uganda stayed in second place in the group -- four points behind Algeria -- after beating Botswana 1-0 and moved three points clear of Mozambique, who lost 2-1 at home to Guinea.

In the final round of matches, Uganda travel to Algeria and Mozambique play Somalia.

All the African teams heading to the World Cup will look to repeat the exploits of Morocco, which became the first team from the continent to reach the semifinals in the 2022 tournament in Qatar.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

It all adds up for Felix Auger-Aliassime, who has been one of the game's most popular players since making his ATP Tour main-draw debut in 2018 in Rotterdam — the same event where he won his first tour-level title in 2022. Every season and every match is part of a memorable story that the 25-year-old continues to write, with his current quarter-final run at the Rolex Shanghai Masters the latest chapter.

ATPTour.com caught up with the Canadian earlier in the year to discuss his successes, challenges, rivals, idols and more.



What is the biggest success of your career?
At the end of 2022, I had this win streak — it was 16 matches. Then I qualified for Turin at the end of the year, won the Davis Cup. That whole stretch was probably what I am most proud of. Since I was young, I had good results, but I wasn't able to put up a streak of wins like this. I could have a great tournament, then I could lose early in the next tournament. Then I was able to prove to myself and the competition that I can actually go and win a tournament and then back it up again and again.

Three titles in a row and then the semi-finals in Paris-Bercy, that was huge for me. To top it off with the Davis Cup was a moment I am definitely really proud of.

What is the biggest difficulty you've had to overcome in your career?
When you get to a point where you struggle to find consistency and you have to figure out why. You can go to work and you can play, but the most difficult part is not the physical part, it's figuring it out with yourself and your team. “What do I actually need to improve? What's making me not play the way I want right now?” That's the difficult part, finding out the why.

Who would you say your greatest rival is?

I would say Stefanos Tsitsipas because it's two-sided. There are guys that I have struggled to get a win over for a long time, like Medvedev. With Tsitsipas, we have gone back and forth over the years, even since we were juniors. It goes way back. He always brings competitiveness.

What is your favourite tennis rivalry, outside of your own? 

Nadal-Federer was an iconic rivalry. I liked Novak and Andy growing up. It was interesting because they both have a counter-punching game. I felt like they were really trying to find ways to outsmart the other guy, and they had a lot of rallies so it was always interesting to watch. You could see how physically demanding it was. Those were fun to watch in Slams.

What is your favourite tournament to play and why?

Grand Slam, I would say Wimbledon. The most prestigious, historic tournament. ATP Masters 1000, Monte-Carlo. It's just a beautiful place to play tennis. ATP 500, I would go with Doha, I feel like it's one of the best. ATP 250, Auckland. It's the only tournament we have in New Zealand, and I feel like it's such a unique part of the world. Sometimes you play these tournaments in common countries for tennis, but New Zealand is out there.

What's been the coolest experience of being a tennis player?

Meeting my idols from when I was growing up, that's the coolest thing. You can travel to places, but meeting people who I saw growing up — the likes of Roger, Rafa, Novak and Andy — that's pretty unique.

What is the biggest goal you have been chasing?

I still haven't won a Masters 1000 title or a Grand Slam. They are the biggest categories of tournament and the toughest to win, so if you do capture one in your career, that's huge. Those are still to do. But winning the Davis Cup, winning an Olympic medal were huge. I think capturing a medal goes beyond your sport.

 The emotions set in for Valentin Vacherot moments after he completed his fifth comeback win from a set down at the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters to become the first player born in Monaco to reach an ATP Tour semi-final. 

 After wiping away tears of joy, the 26-year-old signed the courtside TV lens, ""Top 100!!!"" 

 The qualifier rallied for his biggest career win over the No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Holger Rune, 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 in the second-longest match of the 2025 tournament (two hours, 59 minutes). It was his third main-draw win from a set down and fifth overall including two qualifying matches. He will next face four-time champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.

 ""It was a lot of emotions, and I already had a lot of emotions,"" said Vacherot, who is the first qualifier to reach the semi-finals in the history of the Chinese ATP Masters 1000. ""I was a bit going through the emotions, through everything. The first three wins, especially the one in the third round was tough to enjoy because Tomas (Machac) had to retire. But already the round of 16 against Griekspoor was a lot of emotions. It was an unreal moment. 

 “This one even more. My first semi-final. Also going from [World No. 204] to No. 92. It was just an unreal moment for me. So much emotion. To get to share that with my coach and brother, my girlfriend, Arthur [Rinderknech] my cousin. Still feels like there are still a few people with me here, and also ready to tomorrow to cheer on Arthur."" 

 Rinderknech, who plays No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Friday, knew his cousin would one day join him in the Top 100. 

 ""I wasn't doubting at all, but I was waiting for this moment for a long time,"" said Frenchman Rinderknech. ""I can't wait to have a full year with him on the Tour and the following years."" 

A moment to remember 🙌@val_vacherot outlasts Rune 2-6 7-6(4) 6-4 to reach a maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/l29tKkSJsh

 Last year, Vacherot was on the verge of breaking into the Top 100, reaching No. 110 in the PIF ATP Rankings on June 24, 2024. But a right shoulder injury forced him to be sidelined for most of the final seven months of the season, during which he played in just two tournaments, and none after retiring in the second round of qualifying at the US Open. 

 ""I had a really tough one last year when I got hurt after Roland Garros in May, being 30 points away from the Top 100, just sitting on the couch, seeing myself not moving in the rankings, and then after going down,"" said Vacherot, who finished last season at No. 140 and fell as low as No. 267 on June 23 this year. ""I knew it wasn't going to be easy this year to get back at the ranking. 

 ""It took me a while. Even before this tournament I was ranked at 204, so it's still really far from the Top 100."" 



 On the original qualifying cutoff list in Shanghai, Vacherot was 22 spots from getting into the draw. And when he arrived in the city on the Thursday night before qualifying began on Monday, he was still nine spots out. He learned less than 36 hours before qualifying began that he would make it into the draw. 

 ""I knew there was a big chance because Shanghai is one of the last Masters 1000s [of the year] and a few guys, if you're hurt at the end of the season, you are not taking risks. I knew it would drop,"" said Vacherot, whose only previous Masters 1000 main draw in his career came in Monte-Carlo in April, when he lost in the second round. 

 ""I said, worst of all, I was going to be here one week earlier, because I was going to play five more Challengers after,"" he said. ""Now I'm just going to go home after this tournament, so it's another funny story. I said to myself, if I don't get in, I just train in the conditions of China for just one week and just be ready for after."" 

 His half-brother Benjamin Balleret has been coaching him since 2022 and knows what the Top 100 milestone means. 

 ""There was the injury last year and we were so close from the Top 100,"" said Balleret. ""You have to start all over again and so it was very difficult for him to accept. It's a bit emotional because he's my brother and I see him grow and I know that he wants it so much. 

 “Sometimes I feel he wants it too much. Also because we started from zero. He came back from college and had zero points. I believe in him, he believed in me. He believed in my experience to help him. So for all that it's emotional.""

 Rinderknech was in the player guest box on Thursday and was proud of his cousin's resilience. 

 ""He was really fighting throughout the match today and he found a way, a little bit like his previous round. He found a way to win the second set, and physically Holger was struggling in the third,” said the Frenchman. “It's a single sport, so a lot of variables, and if any of them is not at 100 percent, nowadays everybody is just so close level-wise that it showed."" 

 Rinderknech and Vacherot played two and a-half seasons at Texas A&M University and their coach from those days, former ATP pro Steve Denton, was watching the final two sets at home around 3 a.m. 

 ""He is quite a fighter and the thing I always admired about Val is he never gave up and he went for it in the big moments,"" said Denton. ""It was great to see his resilience and he went for it late in the tie-breaker and that was ultimately the difference. I couldn't be prouder of him and his brother Ben. They have been through a lot together and Val has learned his lessons well. He is ready.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Can Djokovic or Medvedev build on Shanghai's ATP No. 1 Club legacy?","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/no-1-club-shanghai-2025-tournament-feature","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:48:07 GMT","

Since its inception in 2009, the Rolex Shanghai Masters has stood as one of the most prestigious stops on the ATP Masters 1000 calendar.

Over the years, it has constantly attracted the game's biggest names and produced some of its most memorable battles. Five of the 29 players to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings have triumphed in Shanghai: Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner.

Two from that illustrious quintet are in the midst of deep runs at this year's event: Medvedev, who will face Alex de Minaur Friday in the quarter-finals, and Djokovic, who will meet surprise package World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot in Saturday's semis.

As the 2025 tournament boils towards its conclusion, ATPTour.com celebrates the No. 1s who have lifted the trophy in Shanghai.



Murray's Triple Spark
Murray made Shanghai his playground with back-to-back titles in 2010-11, before returning in 2016 for one of the most important victories of his career.

Arriving in Shanghai as the World No. 2, Murray had already built momentum with titles in Rome, Queen's Club, Wimbledon and Beijing. But the Briton didn't stop there: He stormed through the field without dropping a set to complete his Shanghai hat-trick and later extended his winning streak to 24 matches to earn his lone ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF finish.

Djokovic's 2012 Breakthrough & Record Trophy Haul
Djokovic denied Murray's bid for a Shanghai three-peat in unforgettable fashion in 2012. After semi-final runs in 2009-10, Djokovic stormed through the field upon return to Shanghai two years later to set a clash with Murray in the final.

Across three hours, 21 minutes of battle, Djokovic clawed back from a set and a break down — saving five championship points en route — to seize his first Shanghai crown. With his victory, he also avenged his recent US Open final defeat to Murray one month prior and took a 9-7 lead in their rapidly growing Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

Djokovic successfully defended his title in 2013 and won a further two trophies in 2015 and 2018, making him the tournament's most decorated champion.

Federer's Shanghai Prestige
Federer's first Shanghai title in 2014 began with a great escape. In his opening match against Leonardo Mayer, the Swiss star saved five match points before surviving a tense third-set tie-break.

That getaway lit a fire under Federer, who powered through the rest of the draw — including top seed Djokovic in the semi-finals — to lift his maiden Shanghai trophy.

“I feel unbelievable prestige to win this event. Especially putting my hands on the trophy for the first time is a good feeling, I must say,” said Federer, who returned three years later to capture his second Shanghai title, and 27th ATP Masters 1000 crown.

Medvedev's Masterclass
Medvedev had already hinted at his potential in Shanghai when he pushed Federer to three sets in 2018, but it was the following year when he fully delivered on that promise.

Returning in 2019 as the World No. 4, and a completely different player, Medvedev dominated the field with a near-flawless display of power and consistency to clinch his first title in Shanghai. He capped his run with consecutive wins over two of his greatest rivals, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev, in the semi-final and final, respectively.

Sinner's Statement
Sinner became the latest ATP No. 1 Club member to shine in Shanghai, capturing last year's title in the midst of an end-of-season surge. He dropped just one set en route to a championship-match clash with record champion Djokovic.

Yet with fearless execution and unwavering focus, Sinner toppled the Serbian 7-6(4), 6-3 and snapped his perfect 4-0 streak in Shanghai finals. The win, which cemented his status at the top of the game, marked the Italian's seventh title of the season.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

McLaren have secured a milestone 10th Teams' Championship in 2025 – but where does the achievement rank amongst the squad's other title triumphs?

The Singapore Grand Prix marked a milestone moment for McLaren, the squad sealing the 10th Teams' Championship of their long and storied history. Having so far achieved 12 wins, 28 podiums and a whopping 650 points in 2025, the Woking-based outfit wrapped up the title with six rounds of the campaign remaining.

It is doubtless an impressive feat – but how does this success compare to the team's previous triumphant seasons? Well, we've taken a shot at ranking each of McLaren's 10 Teams' Championships, from their first in 1974 through to their latest.

As ever, this comes with the caveat that Formula 1 has undergone various changes – such as developments to the points-scoring system and the increased number races in a season – across the team's title-winning campaigns, making comparisons tricky, but we have tried to balance statistics with sentiment in our list.

Don't quite agree with our order? Let us know which of the team's titles you rate as the greatest in the poll below…

Drivers – Niki Lauda and Alain Prost
Races – 16, Wins – 6 (37.5%), Podiums – 12 (37.5%), Points – 90

While it feels unfair to rank any title triumph at the bottom, we start with the 1985 crown. Such has been the success that McLaren have experienced in their championship-winning seasons that this campaign – in which they took victory in six out of 16 races – features one of their lower winning percentages.

Arriving into the season off the back of title glory in 1984 (more on which later), 1985 brought with it increased competition as seven drivers – from five different teams – each won races.

McLaren's Alain Prost – who had just missed out on the Drivers' title in 1984 to team mate Niki Lauda – emerged victorious in a total of five Grands Prix, while Lauda stood on the top step just once.

This ultimately gave the squad their third Teams' Championship and marked the first time that they had achieved back-to-back titles.

Drivers – Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger
Races – 16, Wins – 6 (37.5%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 121

The 1990 season marked a change in driver line-up for McLaren, with Gerhard Berger arriving to partner Ayrton Senna after tensions boiled over between the Brazilian and previous team mate Alain Prost (again, more to come on that).

Prost's move to Ferrari saw his former team pick up fewer wins, with Senna leading the charge as he again went head-to-head with the Frenchman in the championship fight.

That battle ended in infamous style when the rivals controversially collided into the first corner at the Japanese Grand Prix, immediately putting both out of the race and handing Senna the Drivers' crown in the process.

McLaren, meanwhile, took the Teams' Championship with an 11-point margin from Ferrari.

Drivers – Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger
Races – 16, Wins – 8 (50%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 139

The 1991 crown was a historic achievement for McLaren, marking the team's fourth consecutive championship victory. This run of form was unbeaten for several years, with only Ferrari (six titles between 1999-2004) and Mercedes (eight titles between 2014-2021) bettering the record.

Amid previous rivals Ferrari falling away, reigning Drivers' Champion Ayrton Senna kicked off his and the team's title defence in commanding style, winning all four of the campaign's opening races including his long-awaited first home victory in Brazil.

Despite Williams emerging as their nearest competitor as the campaign progressed, McLaren did enough to fend off the challenge and secure their seventh Teams' title to complete a remarkable run of four back-to-back championships, while Senna clinched his third Drivers' crown.

It would prove to be the final time that Senna became a World Champion, while McLaren would have to wait several years for their next title…

Drivers – Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme
Races – 15, Wins – 4 (26.7%), Podiums – 10 (33.3%), Points – 73

Statistically, McLaren's 1974 triumph is another to feature a lower winning percentage, the squad having taken victory in four out of 15 races.

However, needless to say, this championship was an incredibly important one as it marked the first time that the team had experienced title glory since making their F1 debut back in 1966.

With the strong pairing of World Champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme at the wheel, McLaren finally earned a long-awaited Teams' title, while Fittipaldi also scored the squad's first Drivers' crown.

Coming just four years after the death of founder Bruce McLaren, the feat was an emotional one. As Fittipaldi recounted in a McLaren interview last year: “At the time, we were 28 people, now it's 1,000. For sure, it created even more motivation for the future. History tells us what happened next, with so many fantastic World Champions.”

Drivers – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
Races – 24, Wins – 6 (25%), Podiums – 21 (43.6%), Points – 666

On paper, the 2024 championship features McLaren's lowest percentage of race wins across their title-winning years. But, as ever, the numbers only tell part of the story, with this triumph proving hugely significant in the papaya squad's history.

After Red Bull collected both 2023 titles in one of the most dominant performances ever witnessed in the sport, it initially appeared that the Milton Keynes-based outfit had carried that form through by surging to a 1-2 in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.

McLaren finished that race well off the podium – but, after a major upgrade to the car on the weekend of Lando Norris' debut victory in Miami, the team rapidly became a force to be reckoned with, taking the fight to Max Verstappen and Red Bull in both championships.

While the Drivers' crown ultimately proved elusive – and the team made some strategic errors along the way – McLaren were able to keep a chasing Ferrari at bay during the Abu Dhabi season finale to secure their first Teams' title since 1998, a feat that would scarcely have seemed believable when the squad started 2023 near the back of the field.

Drivers – Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard
Races – 16, Wins – 9 (56.3%), Podiums – 20 (62.5%), Points – 156

As previously mentioned, the 2024 success was McLaren's first Teams' crown in 26 years, with the last one prior to that also marking something of a comeback story.

Following their aforementioned 1991 victory, the squad were overhauled by Williams – and Benetton – in the seasons that followed. But a change to the technical regulations in 1998 was an opportunity that McLaren seized, with the MP4-13 proving the class of the field when the campaign got underway.

The team faced increased competition as the season progressed – with this arguably marking the start of Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher's classic rivalry as they fought for the Drivers' Championship – and Ferrari were still in with a chance of taking the crown at the season-closing Japanese Grand Prix.

However, a flawless performance from Hakkinen at Suzuka – coupled with misfortune for Schumacher, who was forced to retire after suffering a puncture – secured both titles for McLaren. And while the squad could not make it back-to-back Teams' Championships in 1999, Hakkinen went on to secure another Drivers' crown.

Drivers – Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna
Races – 16, Wins – 10 (62.5%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 141

As we head towards the top end of our ranking, we now move into some of McLaren's most dominant championship successes, seasons that also brought with them some truly iconic moments – and battles – along the way.

The 1989 season marked the second year in which Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna formed the team's line-up, a formidable pairing that had (spoiler alert) already secured title glory during the 1988 campaign.

While new regulations outlawing turbocharged engines had come into effect, McLaren appeared to have tackled the change smoothly as 1989 began, with Senna and Prost claiming six and four wins respectively amid another fierce title fight between the two.

The Drivers' Championship ended in controversy, with Senna being disqualified from the Japanese Grand Prix for cutting a chicane after rejoining the track following a collision with Prost, a result that gave the crown to the latter. But, internal tensions aside, the duo again brought home the Teams' title in their final campaign as team mates.

Drivers – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
Races – 24 (18 completed so far), Wins – 12 (66.7%), Podiums – 28 (77.8%), Points – 650*
*From season so far

Arguably, the dominance of McLaren in this year's Teams' Championship could put this success even higher in our ranking. But given that the season is still playing out – and the Drivers' crown is crucially yet to be decided – we have opted for the number 3 spot.

While the 2024 season saw the papaya squad slowly gain momentum, there was no such process this time around, with the team immediately quick out of the blocks at the start of the 2025 campaign.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris have achieved seven and five Grand Prix wins respectively so far, which has included an impressive seven 1-2 finishes. This gave McLaren such a sizeable lead over their rivals that the Teams' title was wrapped up in Singapore, tying with Red Bull's 2023 record for the earliest championship win in the sport's history.

There have been hiccups along the way – and questions remain over how the squad will handle any tensions that may linger between their drivers following that first-lap incident at Marina Bay – but McLaren's all-round form in 2025 has been an extraordinary achievement.

Drivers – Niki Lauda and Alain Prost
Races – 16, Wins – 12 (75%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 143.5

McLaren did not trouble the top of the standings during the late 1970s, the squad going on to end the 1980 season down in ninth place. However, after joining the likes of Ferrari in switching to a turbocharged engine, their fortunes started to turn around into the ‘80s, culminating in a stunning 1984 campaign.

With Alain Prost returning to partner Niki Lauda – forming another one of the team's strongest line-ups – the pair quickly became a dominant force at the wheel of the MP4/2, a car that brought them an incredible 12 victories in 16 races including a run of seven consecutive wins in the second half of the year.

While Prost had outscored Lauda on victories – claiming seven triumphs over Lauda's five – the Frenchman ultimately lost out on the Drivers' Championship by just half a point to the Austrian, meaning that his debut title had to wait until 1985.

He did, however, get to experience championship glory in the Teams' category, McLaren storming to the crown – their first in 10 years – on 143.5 points. To put that dominance into perspective, closest challengers Ferrari had amassed only 57.5 in comparison.

Drivers – Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna
Races – 16, Wins – 15 (93.8%), Podiums – 25 (78.1%), Points – 199

It is hard to argue with the notion that the 1988 season marked McLaren's greatest triumph, a campaign in which an all-star driver line-up – and a brewing rivalry between them – was paired with a benchmark-setting car to create magic.

After two years of finishing second in the championship, the Woking-based squad bolstered their chances of changing that statistic with the MP4/4, a Honda-powered challenger often touted as one of the greatest cars in Formula 1 history.

With race winner Ayrton Senna joining the team alongside two-time World Champion Alain Prost, the duo kickstarted a season of utter dominance from the off. In a 16-race calendar, McLaren astonishingly won all but one Grand Prix, seven of these going to Prost while eight were claimed by Senna.

Amid rising tensions with Prost, it was Senna who clinched a maiden Drivers' Championship by just three points, while the outfit surged to the Teams' crown with a total of 199 points, giving them a significant buffer of 134 points over second-placed Ferrari.

Many years on, McLaren's winning percentage of that season remains the second greatest in the sport's history – indeed, they continued to hold the record for the highest up until just two years ago, when they were bettered by Red Bull's 2023 campaign.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer analyses whether Oscar Piastri's complaints were justified, and whether McLaren should have intervened to keep things fair between their two drivers.

Singapore provided another contentious intra-team McLaren moment, as Lando Norris overtook Oscar Piastri in the opening corners of the race, with the help of a bit of contact. It was a race where you could sense the Australian's growing frustrations, as he again had his championship lead nibbled.

There are two aspects to this: the stewarding side, and the team side – and it's the latter where Piastri's frustrations lie.

Technically speaking, this wasn't a move that was penalty-worthy from Norris. I liked the attempt. It was punchy, gutsy and quite simply had to be attempted by a driver looking to boost his hopes of winning the title after a difficult Qualifying session.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

As part of LVMH's landmark 10-year agreement with Formula 1, Volcan will increase its presence across F1-operated hospitality spaces throughout the remainder of the 2025 season.

Volcan de mi Tierra, the distinguished luxury Tequila brand established through a joint venture between Mexico's esteemed Gallardo family and global luxury leader LVMH, has been named as the Official Tequila of Formula 1.

The partnership, part of the landmark 10-year deal between Formula 1 and LVMH, marks a significant milestone in the brand's international expansion and continued commitment to excellence.

Volcan made its first appearances in the F1 world as the Official Tequila Partner of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023 and 2024. This year will see the brand dramatically increase its presence across F1-operated hospitality spaces, including F1 Paddock Club, throughout the remainder of the 2025 season.

Animated by the premise that 'Tequila should taste like Tequila', Volcan de mi Tierra's prestigious portfolio of ultra-premium, single NOM (Official Mexican Standard) tequilas are born from the union of traditional Mexican craftsmanship and global luxury.

From harvest to bottle, each step of the brand's uncompromising production process reflects an unwavering commitment to quality, ensuring a tequila equal parts traditional and polished, timeless and modern.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1, said: ""Formula 1 has always been a symbol of prestige and excellence. We're thrilled to welcome Volcan de mi Tierra as the Official Tequila of Formula 1.

""When the brand first partnered with the Las Vegas Grand Prix, it was clear that they shared Formula 1's vision for innovation, craftsmanship and sophistication. We are excited to build on the success of the recent years and take this collaboration to the next level.""

Santiago Cortina Gallardo, Volcan de mi Tierra CEO & Co-Founder, added: ""We are delighted to witness Volcan de mi Tierra reach the global stage with Formula 1. Our brands champion those who rise to every challenge, push past their limits, and embrace their inner fire. Tequila lovers and motorsport enthusiasts demand the best — and that's exactly what they get with Volcan de mi Tierra.""

Jay Hernandez, who starred as the titular Magnum P.I., and Monica Raymund, one of the stars of TV's Chicago Fire, are the big names in the feature, titled The Revenge of La Llorona and that also has rising actors Edy Ganem (9-1-1), Martín Fajardo (Griselda), Acston Luca Porto (Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado), Avie Porto (Bob Hearts Abishola) on the call sheet.




	Raymond Cruz, who co-starred in the 2019 movie as the helpful Father Perez, is one acting talent returning for the feature, which began production this week in Buffalo.

	Also back is the producing team of Emile Gladstone, Gary Dauberman, and James Wan.

	But while the producing team is the same, the director and writer are not. Santiago Menghini, the Canadian filmmaker known for his award-winning short Milk and who made his feature debut with 2021 horror movie No One Gets Out Alive, is sitting in the director's chair.


	Sean Tretta, who worked with Wan on the filmmaker's Creature from the Black Lagoon feature set up at Universal, wrote the script.


	The fact that the movie is now in production is a notable resuscitation of a sequel that had been shelved several times before, at least once even during pre-production. That last shelving occurred in early 2024 and may have been due to budgetary issues. Sources say movement on this one got going after the success of this summer's Final Destination: Bloodlines, which showed the company that an appetite for sequels exists.

	











La Llorona's tears can't be ignored. A surprise breakout when it was released in 2019, The Curse of La Llorona grossed $123 million worldwide. That movie was led by Linda Cardellini and directed by Michael Chaves, who graduated to the The Conjuring franchise, helming the last two entries, including the most recent one, The Conjuring: Last Rites. Last Rites is a prime example of the enduring strength of the supernatural horror franchise, as it has grossed over $460 million worldwide on a budget of around $55 million.


	Latino audiences are among those flocking to the scares, with Revenge of La Llorona hoping to tap that market.  


	Executive producers on the new movie include Mia Maniscalco, Jamie Buckner, Michael Clear, and Judson Scott.


	The story sees the vengeful spirit La Llorona returning, forcing a fractured family to confront their past and join forces with their estranged curandero grandfather to battle ancient evils, before the Weeping Woman claims their children forever.


	Menghini is repped by UTA, Good Fear and Mike Castrillo at McKuin Frankel. Tretta is repped by CAA, Adventure Media, and attorney Jennifer Levy.


	Cruz is repped by Media Artists Group, Raymund is repped by Gersh and Door 24, and Hernandez is repped by CAA, Alchemy Entertainment and Fuller Law.


	Fajardo is repped by Magnitude Entertainment and CESD, siblings Acston Luca Porto and Avie Porto are repped by Coast to Coast Talent Group, D.R. Entertainment, and attorney Carolyn Conrad. Ganem is repped by Prime Talent Media, Allegory Creative Talent and Yorn Levine.

The video, posted to X, featured Bryan's signature hit 'Revival' over footage of masked federal agents arresting people.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	The Department of Homeland Security used a Zach Bryan song in a promotional video on social media – a trolling jab at the country star after he released a song criticizing ICE raids. Can he sue them for copyright infringement?


	The video, posted Tuesday to the official DHS account on X, featured Bryan's signature hit “Revival” over a montage of footage of masked federal agents arresting people. It came under the caption “We're having an All Night Revival,” the song's central refrain.


	The post came amid days of right-wing outrage after Bryan released a snippet of a new song that said Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a unit of DHS, plans to “bust down your door.” Captioned “The fading of the red white and blue,” the lyrics seemed to be a reference to President Donald Trump's controversial immigration crackdown and mass deportations.


	Bryan currently seems to be trying to deescalate the situation, saying his lyrics had been “misconstrued.” But since he almost certainly didn't authorize the use of his song, the DHS video begs the question: Can Bryan hit back by suing the government for copyright infringement?


	The answer is yes, with some big qualifications.


	Using a copyrighted song in a social media clip requires a so-called sync license, the same way that movie producers need to get permission and pay fees to feature a song in their film. Assuming Bryan didn't grant such a license just to be trolled by the Trump administration, the video posted by DHS is a textbook example of copyright infringement.


	Doesn't everyone use music in social media videos? Platforms have licensing deals with music companies, allowing their users to soundtrack their videos with a huge selection of legally-cleared songs. But that kind of license is aimed at non-commercial uses by individual users and likely wouldn't cover a promotional video by an entity like DHS – and Elon Musk's X famously doesn't have one anyway.


	The agency likely isn't shielded by “fair use,” either. If a person disagreed with Bryan's opinion on ICE and wanted to criticize him, they might successfully argue they had a right to use his music. But that's a much harder argument to make for what amounts to a recruiting advertisement by a large entity that would normally pay for the music in its ads.


	Bringing lawsuits against the federal government can be difficult due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which largely shields it from civil actions. But when it comes to copyright law, Congress has formally waived that restriction and created a path for rightsowners to sue over exactly this situation.


	Unlike a typical copyright case, Bryan would bring his hypothetical infringement lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a special federal court designed to handle cases against the government. And unlike a normal case, he could only ask for “reasonable and entire compensation” for the use of his song, not an injunction forcing DHS to remove the video.


	However, Bryan could still get the video pulled down by using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which empowers copyright owners to file takedown notices directly with platforms like X – and requires those platforms to comply unless the alleged infringer disputes it. It's unclear if the star has filed such a notice; the clip remains live on X as of Thursday afternoon.


	Last month, comedian Theo Von objected to another DHS post on X, which featured a clip of him saying “Heard you got deported dude, bye.” The right-leaning podcaster, the son of a Nicaraguan immigrant, said: “Yooo DHS i didn't approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos.”


	It's unclear if Von lodged a formal DMCA complaint, but the clip was pulled down the next day. It's not clear if DHS deleted it or if X removed it.


	One major caveat to any discussion of Bryan's song: It's unclear whether he owns the rights to it. The star reportedly sold or was close to selling some of his catalog earlier this year, though the exact parameters of that deal have not been made public. He would need some ownership stake in the song's publishing or master rights in order to sue DHS.


	Perhaps even more importantly, Bryan appears unwilling to pick this kind of fight. Litigation is expensive and difficult under the best circumstances, and a case over the clip is unlikely to yield much in the way of actual monetary damages. It would also obviously further inflame a situation that Bryan – a country superstar with a fandom that spans the political spectrum – seems intent on calming.


	“This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything,” the star said Tuesday. “When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.”


	Reps for both DHS and Bryan did not immediately return requests for comment on the “Revival” clip.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Matlock series regular David Del Rio has abruptly exited the hit CBS legal drama following an investigation into a sexual assault allegation, Deadline has learned. According to sources, the alleged incident occurred Sept. 26 and involved fellow Matlock series regular Leah Lewis.


	A report of the incident triggered immediate action by the series' producers and CBS Studios, which is behind Matlock. Following an internal investigation by the studio, Del Rio was fired and escorted off the lot the same day the alleged assault was reported, which we hear was Oct. 2. According to sources, Matlock executive producer Eric Christian Olsen was among those who led him away. 

	











	Filming on Matlock continued after Del Rio's firing. Matlock is set to go on a pre-planned hiatus next week after wrapping half of the new season this week, with production slated to resume after Thanksgiving. Given the sudden nature of Del Rio's departure, the Matlock creative team will have to rework scripts to write his character off.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Del Rio played Billy Martinez, a first-year associate at Jacobson Moore, the law firm at the center of the show which hired Madeline “Matty” Matlock (Kathy Bates) — claiming to be a widowed lawyer — to work under Olympia Lawrence (Skye P. Marshall).


	In addition to Bates, Marshall and Lewis, Matlock's main cast also includes Jason Ritter.


	The series tackled the topic of sexual assault In Episode 3 of its first season, in which Matlock (Bates) takes over the case of a young lawyer claiming that she was sexually assaulted by her boss. 

	











	Season 2 of Matlock premieres Oct. 12.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


	After landing Twisters director Lee Isaac Chung to direct, Warner Bros is now in line to land another high-profile talent to star opposite Margot Robbie in its Ocean's prequel. While a deal isn't closed, Bradley Cooper is in negotiations to star in the prequel Chung is directing and Robbie is starring. Robbie's production company LuckyChap is producing.


	Sources say Cooper has been close with Robbie over the years and always wanted to work together, and this seemed the perfect opportunity. After a meeting with Chung, Cooper was on board.


	The film is set to start shooting next year and in true Ocean's fashion, the plot is locked in the vault other then it being a prequel. The current screenplay is by Carrie Solomon and based on characters created by George Clayton Johnson & Jack Golden Russell.  

	











	Cooper has strong ties at the studio where his current production deal is set up. He also has his Bullitt movie in development at Warner Bros that Steven Spielberg will direct with him starring.

	Next up for Cooper is his Searchlight dramedy Is This Thing On? which he is directing and starring in. The film is set to make its world premiere Friday at the New York Film Festival.


	Cooper is repped by Range Media Partners.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Disney is taking a fresh look at the live-action take on Tangled, we hear, which is resuming early development with Scarlett Johansson circling the role of Mother Gothel. The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey is still attached to direct, working from a script by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson based on the 2010 animated feature.


	Disney hit pause on the project in April after getting jitters from the box office performance from its live-action take of Snow White. However, there's a big difference in regards to the audience appeal for old Disney animated pics getting a live-action take, versus those titles since the 1989 Little Mermaid musical renaissance. Those live-action redos — e.g., Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch — have had greater success at the box office. Lilo & Stitch alone is the highest-grossing MPA title of 2025 to date with $1.03 billion worldwide.

	











	Nothing has been formally greenlit yet in regards to Tangled. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	The original 2010 movie, which grossed close to $600 million worldwide, followed the magically long-haired Rapunzel, who has spent her entire life in a tower. But now that a runaway thief has stumbled upon her, she is about to discover the world for the first time, and who she really is.


	Under its leadership, the Disney Live Action team is continuing to celebrate/revisit existing stories through a modern lens, while also investing in new IP – as evidenced by the Impossible Creatures announcement earlier this week – in an effort to build a foundation of new stories that can be told for generations to come.

	











	Johansson's feature directorial debut, Eleanor the Great, starring June Squibb, recently opened in theaters via Sony Pictures Classics and has a 94% Rotten Tomatoes score from audiences. The movie received a six-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival world premiere. The two-time Oscar nominee starred in two movies this summer: Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme and Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, the latter of which, at $867.9M, is the year's third highest-grossing MPA title.


	Johansson's movies have grossed $17.7 billion at the worldwide box office.


	She is repped by CAA and Yorn Levine Barnes.

As long as they get whoever it is that plays Rapunzel to grow her hair long enough to genuinely reach down to the bottom of the tower, I'm game. No cheating that with CGI!

Need them to eye Luke Newton for Flynn Rider please and thank you. Gorgeous, can sing, and do stunts.

What about Demi Moore? Wasn't she supposed to do it? Scarlett looks too youthful to play her.

Well, Mother Gothel should look youthful – at least after the uses the incantion. It is probably easier to age a performer up than down.

For the love of all things gleaming and glowing, please don't redeem Gothel and give her a girlboss arc.

ScarJo when Kathryn Hahn is RIGHT THERE?

Why either of them when Donna Murphy is RIGHT THERE? 

If Dreamworks can cast the original voice of Stoick as the live action equivalent, why can't Disney do the same for Mother Gothel? Murphy still looks amazing and wouldn't look out of place.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: In a heated multi-studio bidding war, 20th Century Studios has locked down rights to Crush, a snake-themed spec penned by current Temple Hill executive John Fischer.


Crush is a propulsive, ticking-clock survival thriller about a woman hiking alone in the Everglades who wakes to find herself trapped in the crushing coils of a massive python, fighting to stay alive as every breath brings her closer to death. Inspired by true events and told primarily in real time, the hot spec is said to be a real page-turner that has already begun attracting interest from major actresses for its juicy lead role.

	20th is said to be fast-tracking the project for production, with conversations underway on a director and cast. Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey will produce for Temple Hill, with Scott Glassgold's 12:01 Films also attached to produce. J.R. Young will be overseeing for 20th. While unconfirmed, sources placed Fischer's deal in the mid-to-high six figures.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As previously alluded to, there's an interesting backstory to this project: Fischer, who serves as Executive Vice President of Development and Production at Temple Hill Entertainment, wrote it under the pseudonym J.W. Archer in his free time, unsure whether anyone would like it or if he'd ever do anything with it. It quickly gathered heat after he posted it on the Black List, leading to outreach from reps eager to sign him and take the project out. Fischer then had to sheepishly walk into the office of his Temple Hill bosses to confess that he'd written a script — and ask if they might want to produce it. Now, he's in the enviable position of getting a movie he wrote off the ground while still juggling his day-to-day executive duties.


	“Needless to say, it was quite a surprise when John walked into our office and told us he had written a script on the weekends in Spain while working on one of our movies,” Bowen and Godfrey told Deadline. “We went from being terrified about how to come up with nice things to say when he asked us to read it to elated that it was a thrill ride of a movie that we wanted to produce. We can't wait to abuse him with pages and pages of notes as we move this into production.”

	











	Fischer joined Temple Hill in 2016, going on to co-produce The Hate U Give, based on the bestselling novel by Angie Thomas, before exec producing titles including Uncle Drew, On the Come Up, and We Have a Ghost. He also produced Sundance prize-winner Emergency, as well as Temple Hill's horror hit Clown in a Cornfield and Lasse Hallström's The Map That Leads to You.


	Fischer's upcoming films as a producer include Monitor, a high-concept horror written and directed by Matt Black and Ryan Polly; Children of Blood and Bone, the adaptation of Tomi Adeyemi's bestselling novel directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood for Paramount; and The Berenstain Bears, an animated feature based on the beloved book series.  Fischer has no plans to quit his day job just yet, but given his natural storytelling instincts, we'll see where things go from here. 


	Recently producing Smile 2, as well as Clown in a Cornfield, Temple Hill's other upcoming projects include Charlie Harper and People We Meet on Vacation. Glassgold is coming off producing the sleeper Sony hit Tarot, which grossed nearly $50 million worldwide, and is currently readying Drew Hancock's My Wife and I Bought a Ranch for Amazon MGM Studios.


	Fischer and 12:01 were repped by Verve on the deal.

This is delightful, but not at all surprising. John has always been a talented writer with breadth and taste. VERY cool that he did it under a pseudonym.

Yes, just like your comment, John :)

so now execs are writing scripts without telling any one…. why isnt he doing his job and trying to find a writer to write this story that he brought in. thats his job.

What a mindless comment. Should actors not direct? Should writers not act? Seems like maybe you're jealous of someone who can wear multiple hats successfully.

If you come up with the idea yourself, nobody else is entitled to it. You have every right to pen it yourself.

What's more, JF proven to every writer he works with that he's faced that blank page and flashing cursor, just like they have.

Nothing but kudos and congratulations here.

So he came up with the idea completely on his own? Then what does Glassgold, who almost deals exclusively in short stories, have to do with it in that case, and why is he a producer on it if Temple Hill should be the only producer needed? Why bring in another non-writing producer?

Now writers have to compete with execs moonlighting as writers. OH MY GOODNESSS. WE ARE COOKED.

Good guy

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Perfect Neighbor stares helplessly at a perfectly ordinary American murder","https://www.avclub.com/the-perfect-neighbor-review","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

There's a level of wishful thinking that goes into The Perfect Neighbor. There's nothing false about it; director Geeta Gandbhir's crime documentary is almost entirely composed of bodycam and interrogation footage, 911 recordings and court appearances. But part of its narrative arc is predicated on a set of assumptions, on a social contract that no longer exists—or, for most people, never existed in the first place. To watch The Perfect Neighbor‘s racist murder unfold is to watch the notion that the police are here to protect and serve unravel. To see its inevitable conclusion coming, far in advance, is to understand what and who American laws legitimize. To exhale a faint sigh as its ending finds a bare minimum of justice is to acknowledge how rare even that has become. It's a cold and angry film, effectively constructed yet not nearly as special as its harrowing case seems.

This tone is familiar for Gandbhir (a frequent Spike Lee collaborator who also helmed the brutally effective 2017 rape kit documentary I Am Evidence), though The Perfect Neighbor sets itself apart with its intensely hands-off format. As the film unfolds, its nightmarish true-crime told through the visual language of Cops, the only hope is found on the edges of the frame. In a low-income Florida neighborhood, Susan Lorincz—an overreactive “Karen” to her neighbors, Black and white alike—is a known menace whose racist outbursts plague the community and pepper local law enforcement with endless false alarms. The responding officers kid around with the fed-up families over their shared eye-rolling attitude towards the annoyance, but each time they arrive, they back up Susan's Black neighbors and their children (who are always the target of her ire), and do a fat lot of nothing. The rest of the community is helping look out for each other, but when Susan escalates things with her constant emergency calls, there are no consequences—for her, at least. It's all perfectly legal.

But since this is America, and since this is Florida in particular, the old white lady who cried wolf is armed and dangerous. And without repercussions for over a year of these back-and-forths, things were going to get much worse. Despite the doc's early framing, there's no mystery about that. Unchecked in a country more concerned with the rights of gun owners than the lives of its citizens, Susan's hatred is allowed to escalate until she murders her neighbor Ajike “AJ” Owens, a Black mother of four of the children who attracted Susan's ire, in 2023. It's a horrifying finale to a story whose conclusion is obvious to anyone who knows the first thing about the United States. 

The documentary's damning look at stand-your-ground laws and the ineffectiveness of police even when they're doing everything “right” (because the body-cam footage that makes up this film wouldn't exist if they thought they were doing something “wrong”) is awful and thorough, avoiding cliché through a devotion to fisheye footage. Its upsetting, explicit-bordering-on-exploitative access drives its points into the pit of your stomach. Crying children, haunted friends, delusional killers. The closeness Gandbhir establishes through objective footage is astonishing; it's no wonder she won the Directing Award at Sundance earlier this year. And yet, despite the oppressive power of this intimacy, The Perfect Neighbor is still familiar—how many news stories and viral videos have us clenching our fists at these same injustices, these same images, every single day? The Perfect Neighbor just breaks it down fully, from queasy start to morbid finish.

That it does so mostly using footage from the cops and the courts makes for a heavy film that's surprisingly light on its feet. No talking heads tell you to think about the comparison between community action and a gun-happy police state. It's impossible not to. Some final statistics underscore ideas the audience will have had the entire time, and their fears that will have unconsciously festered: These kinds of crimes happen all the time, will happen again, are probably happening right now. Few will see justice served. Those are elegant side effects of The Perfect Neighbor‘s tough watch, which stares helplessly at a quintessentially American murder and dares its desensitized audience to blink.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Read This: Betty Gilpin writes letter to AI ingénue Tilly Norwood","https://www.avclub.com/betty-gilpin-letter-ai-tilly-norwood-read-this","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:05:00 GMT","

In the week-and-a-half since her Zurich Summit “debut,” so-called AI actor Tilly Norwood has been met with concern, fear, and disgust from the human actor community. Today, in a letter published in The Hollywood Reporter, Betty Gilpin (who played an AI-battling nun in Mrs. Davis) shared some sage wisdom with Norwood. “When I was your age… well, wait, no. You are both infant and immortal, like Thor in a diaper,” Gilpin writes. “I mean, when I was starting out in my career like you, this very thing happened. An actress older than me pulled me aside and gave me advice.”

In the letter, Gilpin takes on the daunting task of explaining the quintessential humanness of performance. Explaining how she first fell in love with theater as a teenager, she says, “Tilly, you never had to be 14, so I'll tell you what google can't. It feels like your soul gets a broken glass enema. You go from curious about this marvelous world to drowning in un-marvelous you. Who am I? How should I be? Am I alone? Your human brain answers ‘no one,' ‘invisible' and ‘yes.'” But while watching a bad play, one transcendent actor “was so good that, impossibly, I left myself.”

As Gilpin concedes, an AI “actor” can remain young and beautiful forever, without the pesky interference of aging and emotion to transgress or interrupt its “career.” An AI character will say and do exactly what its handler tells it to—”Property without zits or opinions,” as Gilpin puts it. She wonders “if an eyelash or toothshine of mine from a screenshot twenty years ago is one speck of your billions of Hot Young Actresses mosaic that is your not-real face.” Gilpin lays out a solid and beautifully articulated argument for the power of connection, admitting that she, too, is “made up of a million bits of plagiarism of every person I've had the privilege to come across.” But the difference is that Gilpin draws from a rich well of experience over the course of a lifetime, and Tilly Norwood draws from computer programming. You can read the full letter for yourself here.

Megyn Kelly is great for business right now, and SiriusXM is betting she'll remain a boon to its brand for multiple years to come. The radio network has inked a new, multi-year deal to give the conservative commentator her very own channel, per The Hollywood Reporter. While the exact duration of the deal hasn't been shared (at least as of this writing), the former Fox and NBC host's fans can start listening to her curated content 24/7 starting on November 4.

The “Megyn Kelly Channel” will take over channel 111, the current home of the “Triumph” channel, which broadcasts Kelly's exceptionally popular “The Megyn Kelly Show,” as well as content from Glenn Beck, Nancy Grace, and more. Most of those non-Kelly shows will move to channel 123 next month to make room for even more of her own programming, as well as a to-be-announced rotation of guest speakers, series, and specials. 

“Linear television news is dead,” Kelly said in a statement underscoring the kind of hard-line thinking that won her so many followers in the first place. “People can't stand those stilted, censored conversations anymore, which is exactly why this medium is thriving,” she continued. “I'm thrilled to deliver our bold brand of no-BS news live on SiriusXM and to be expanding my relationship with such a stellar, blue-chip brand and great partner. Soon our listeners will have the Megyn Kelly Channel to enjoy and trust for the conversations and content they love.”

In March, Kelly launched a podcast network, MK Media, to, in her own words, “help sane, reasonable, good-humored people build their own followings in this new media space.” Some of those “good-humored people” include Maureen Callahan, who's mocked everyone from Stephen Colbert to Whoopi Goldberg on her YouTube show, former Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aide Link Lauren, and journalist Mark Halperin, who was fired from NBC News after he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. While the Megyn Kelly Channel's schedule is still under wraps, SiriusXM subscribers may soon be able to add some more of this sane and reasonable content to their morning commutes.

Kris Jenner surely knows how to turn heads! The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” matriarch, 69, just debuted a bold new look — and fans can't stop talking about it. In a new Instagram video shared on Wednesday, October 8, Jenner revealed a stunning platinum blonde transformation courtesy of celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton. 

The post, captioned “Blondie,” quickly set social media buzzing. In the clip, Jenner appears makeup-free and relaxed in a salon chair, wrapped in a white towel and cozy brown hoodie as Appleton mixes dye beside her. Set to Sabrina Carpenter's hit “When Did You Get Hot?,” the video captures the playful banter between the two before the big reveal.

A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)

“Wait, I need a minute,” Jenner mouths, before Appleton joins in with, “Ok? Here it comes!” Seconds later, the reality star turns around, unveiling her sleek new platinum locks — and the internet lost it.

A post shared by Chris Appleton (@chrisappleton1)

Reactions poured in from Kris Jenner's glam squad and fans within minutes of the post.

“Uhhh she looks incredible,” makeup artist Ash K. Holm gushed in the comments, adding, “we did that!!!”

Fans echoed the excitement. “I'll have what she's having,” one follower wrote, while another joked, “She's 30 right now! Stunning work and so much fun — always gorgeous, both of you!”

The clip wrapped with Jenner and Appleton posing together as Sabrina Carpenter's chorus played, and the verdict across social media was unanimous: Kris Jenner can rock any hairdo.

A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)

The platinum makeover isn't Jenner's first foray into blonde territory. Back in January 2018, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star kicked off the New Year with an icy pixie cut, and she later stunned at the 2019 Met Gala with a sleek blonde bob that had fans doing a double-take.

Her latest transformation comes as the momager continues to make waves in the fashion world. Earlier this year, Jenner was spotted in Paris attending Lauren Sánchez's star-studded bachelorette party, where fans noticed her fresh, youthful glow.

A post shared by M·A·C Cosmetics (@maccosmetics)

“You have to do what makes you feel good, first of all,” Jenner previously said during a 2015 episode of Good Work. “You can't do something because somebody else wants you to do it, and you have to do great research on the doctor that you choose.”

Appleton, 42, who counts Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian among his celebrity clients, has long praised Jenner's bold style.

Last month, he told People, “My entire TikTok is a Kris Jenner fan account at this point. I'm obsessed with her.”

He added, “I just love that she's having this resurgence and she's living her best life. I'm all for reinventing yourself at any age — and she is the queen of doing that right now.”

So, we can all agree: Kris Jenner is the undisputed queen of makeovers. From her sleek Paris looks to her viral platinum transformation, she's proof that reinvention has no age limit, and that confidence really is the best glam.

The boxing world is in mourning following the heartbreaking death of Arturo Gatti Jr., the 17-year-old son of late boxing legend Arturo Gatti. Gatti Jr.'s longtime coach, Moe Latif, confirmed the news on Wednesday, October 8, after the teen was found dead in Mexico.

The tragic circumstances mirror the mysterious death of his father, who died in 2009 at the age of 39. Chuck Zito, Gatti Sr.'s former bodyguard, was among the first to share the news publicly in an emotional Instagram post.

“It's with a heavy heart that I have to say,…. R.I.P. to 17-year-old ARTURO GATTI JR.,” Zito wrote. “The same way they found his Father dead in an apartment in Brazil 16 years ago.”

Zito added, “My condolences to Arturo Gatti Senior's mom, sisters, brothers, and his daughter Sophia.”

A post shared by Chuck Zito (@officialchuckzito)

According to Zito, Gatti Jr. was found hanging in an apartment in Mexico, echoing the manner in which his father was discovered in a Brazilian apartment in 2009. An official cause of death has not yet been confirmed.

Gatti Jr. was reportedly in Mexico with his mother, Amanda Rodrigues, who was also Gatti Sr.'s widow. A neighbor discovered his passing.

The news comes 16 years after Gatti Sr.'s death shocked the sports world. His death was officially ruled a suicide, though Rodrigues was initially suspected of murder before being cleared following an autopsy. Mystery still surrounds the Hall of Fame fighter's death to this day.

Following online speculation, Latif confirmed the news on social media, writing, “It is unfortunately not a rumor or a joke. Arturo is gone.” He asked for privacy during the devastating time: “I'd appreciate if you stop reaching out at this time.”

A post shared by Arturo Jr (@arturogattijr)

Gatti Jr. had been poised to follow in his father's footsteps, training seriously under Latif and showing early promise in the sport. His passing has left the boxing community reeling.

Boxing News released a statement: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Arturo Gatti Jr, who has died at just 17 years old in Mexico. Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with his family and loved ones during this heartbreaking time. May he rest in peace.”

In a 2012 interview with “48 Hours Mystery,” Amanda Rodrigues spoke lovingly about her son, calling him “everything I asked God for” and saying he “makes me complete.” She also noted that her son's smile “is the same” as his father's.

Gatti Sr. was beloved for his fearless fighting style and was part of one of boxing's greatest trilogies against Mickey Ward in the early 2000s. He also faced Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Oscar De La Hoya during his career.

Michael Shannon stars as James A. Garfield, aka the 20th president of the United States, in Netflix's latest historical miniseries, “Death by Lightning.”

“Succession” favorite and Emmy winner Matthew Macfadyen holds his own opposite Shannon as Charles J. Guiteau, aka the man who shot Garfield on July 2, 1881, at a railroad station in Washington D.C. Garfield died from his injuries in New Jersey two months later, as this period series dramatizes. The assassination led Vice President Chester Arthur (played here by Nick Offerman, who has made politically charged roles a hallmark of his recent career) to succeed Garfield for one term through 1885. Grover Cleveland followed.

The four-episode Netflix series, which just debuted its full trailer (below), comes from creator Mike Makowsky, who wrote the 2019 HBO true-crime drama film “Bad Education” and the 2018 apocalyptic sci-fi thriller “I Think We're Alone Now.” Bradley Whitford, Shea Whigham, and Betty Gilpin also star in the limited drama series “Death by Lightning,” which debuts on the streamer November 6.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The series continues Netflix's partnership with executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (“3 Body Problem,” plus HBO's “Game of Thrones”), as well as Bernie Caulfield (“3 Body Problem,” “Game of Thrones,” “Big Love”). Benioff and Weiss secured in 2019 a nine-figure deal to produce television series exclusively for Netflix. Matt Ross (“28 Hotel Rooms,” “Captain Fantastic,” and TV‘s “Gaslit”) directs all episodes of “Death by Lightning.” It's based on the 2011 nonfiction tome “Destiny of the Republic” by Candice Millard, which won Edgar and PEN Center USA awards.

Here's Netflix's logline for the series: “‘Death by Lightning' is a drama series that brings to life the epic and stranger-than-fiction true story of James Garfield, reluctant 20th president of the United States, and his greatest admirer Charles Guiteau — the man who would come to kill him.”

Netflix is on a roll with fact-based historical drama series that are capturing the zeitgeist, such as Steven Knight's “House of Guinness,” about the complex dynasty behind the famed beer brewing company. Shannon, who also stars in this year's Sony Pictures Classics World War II drama “Nuremberg” as Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, comes to the series with two Oscar nominations under his belt: for 2017's “Nocturnal Animals” and 2009's “Revolutionary Road.” He received an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series Emmy nomination in 2023 for “George & Tammy” as country legend George Jones.

 










IndieWire spoke to Shannon out of the Toronto International Film Festival circa the premiere of “Nuremberg” here.

							By 

	Antonia Juhasz



	As the federal government shutdown stretches into its second week, President Donald Trump is targeting nearly $30 billion in cuts to federal funding almost exclusively to Democratic states and cities. The impact of the cuts to public transit, energy projects, and fundamental civil rights programs could carry far-reaching harms across the nation and the economy.


	The cuts are the next step in the implementation of executive orders issued by Trump that strive to eradicate policies that advance racial and gender equity, tackle the climate crisis, and threaten the fossil fuel industry. 


	Democrats are holding firm for concessions to lower health care costs while Republicans in the House have sent their members home until at least October 14. The shutdown has shuttered services and programs Americans rely on and furloughed 750,000 government workers deemed “nonessential,” including almost 90 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rather than try to end the shutdown, Trump is reveling in it. Calling it an “unprecedented opportunity,” Trump is leveraging the shutdown to exact revenge on his perceived enemies and to blame Democrats for painful cuts to government jobs and programs he has long-opposed. 

	











	In immediate jeopardy is funding for over $20 billion for public transportation expansions in Chicago, New York City, and the Hudson River Rail Tunnel between New York and New Jersey that would impact hundreds of thousands of rail travelers throughout the Eastern Seaboard; nearly $8 billion for energy projects in over a dozen states across the country; and core civil rights programs providing equity in federal contracting.

	











	“In Donald Trump's authoritarian America, even the trains won't run on time,” wrote New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer.


	Democrat Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner in New York's upcoming mayoral race, slammed “Trump and his sycophants” for treating people as mere “political pawns” and taking actions that will have immensely serious consequences on their lives and livelihoods. “This is about Donald Trump going to war with New York City,” Mamdani said.

	Rescinding these funds would likely result in higher transportation and energy costs as well as the loss of thousands of jobs, critics warn. Increased access to public transit can save people more than $13,000 per year versus driving. Across the country, household electricity bills are skyrocketing, but the administration intends to cancel hundreds of projects and programs designed to increase energy supply and equity and reduce costs.


	Brent Booker is General President of the Laborers' International Union of North America which represents construction workers impacted by the project cuts. In a statement, Booker blamed the White House and Republican members of Congress for failing to negotiate in good faith and putting essential services that Americans rely on daily at risk. He called the energy and infrastructure cuts, “scorched earth style retaliation” adding, “these project cancellations are an immediate and dire threat to our economy and the livelihoods of thousands of construction workers.”


	“The health implications are really significant,” Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) tells me. Clean transit and energy protect public health and the climate, reducing pollution and the carbon footprint, she says. Despite making history as the first Latina woman elected to represent Arizona on September 23, she is still waiting for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to swear her in as a member of Congress. “These projects were already authorized” by Congress, she explains, and have now been arbitrarily cut because Trump “doesn't like what city they're in.”

	Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, who is overseeing the cuts, is a co-author of Project 2025, the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. On X, Vought described the nearly $8 billion in energy projects cuts as cancelling “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda,” echoing the same explanation given by the Department of Energy. The Department of Transportation explained the infrastructure cuts by stating that Illinois and New York are “well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy.”

	











	“The Trump administration is trying more aggressively than any prior administration to dismantle civil rights policies developed to further the mission of equality in the United States,” Georgetown University Constitutional Law and Global Health Policy professor Michele Bratcher Goodwin tells me. Goodwin is co-faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. On a variety of topics “courts across the country, including conservative judges, even Trump-appointed judges, have said overwhelmingly that what he has been doing has been unlawful and unconstitutional,” Goodwin adds. “There's a lot of winning that is going on.”


	But Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress have proven unwilling to act as a bulwark against the president's increasingly autocratic actions, illegality, and usurpation of congressional authority, particularly its power of the purse. Vought authored the section of Project 2025 focused on the expansion of presidential powers and executive authority. While he implemented his agenda largely from the shadows during the first months of Trump's presidency, he is now taking center-stage and a leading role in the government shutdown.


	Trump touted on social media how Vought, “of PROJECT 2025 Fame,” wants to use the shutdown to eliminate “Democratic Agencies.” He later posted an AI-generated video featuring a cover of Blue Öyster Cult with Vought as “The Reaper” (death incarnate) in full black robes, scythe in hand, and with congressional Democrats and federal employees seated at their desks in his sights.


	On the first day of the government shutdown, Vought took to social media to announce nearly $8 billion in cuts to energy projects in Democratic states, listing California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. 


	Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the move, “Just naked and brazen corruption. All states represented by Democrats in the Senate. Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law.” Others have pointed out that these are all states that voted for Trump's rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, for president in 2024.


	The list of affected projects includes major upgrades to electrical grids in California, Minnesota and Oregon; efforts to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in Colorado; and large hubs to produce hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest, according to a New York Times analysis. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports that New Mexico lost $135.2 million for 10 energy projects that include renewable energy and battery storage microgrids to improve energy access and service across the state. Hawaii public radio found that the state lost some $68 million for electrical grid reliability, zero-emission vehicles, and a renewable energy microgrid at the U.S. Joint Airforce and Naval Base Pearl Harbor Hickam.

	











	“This is a shameless and vindictive attack by Director Vought, which will eliminate jobs and raise energy costs for Americans across the country,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a statement.


	On the same day and within hours of the shutdown, Vought took to X to announce more than $18 billion in cuts to public transit infrastructure projects in the Democratic strongholds of New York and New Jersey, followed two days later by another post announcing over $2 billion in cuts to public transit projects in Chicago. 


	The $18 billion supports the expansion of the Second Avenue Subway line in New York City and a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, which carries hundreds of Amtrak and commuter trains with hundreds of thousands of passengers daily, affecting travel between Boston and Washington. 


	The $2.1 billion supports Chicago's modernization and upgrades of its public transit system, including the addition of four new train stops on the city's South Side, improving access for the areas low-income and communities of color. 


	“Right when we are finally on the brink of moving forward, Trump just cut off the funding. From public safety to public education to public transit, this president is cutting the services that working people rely upon,” Chicago's Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson, said in an October 3 statement.


	The funding cuts to Chicago take place amid Trump's escalating broadscale attack on the city's residents and Democratic leadership. Trump has deployed ICE and the Texas National Guard, and declared on social media that Johnson and the state's governor should be jailed “for failing to protect ICE Officers.” Johnson warned Wednesday on CNN that Trump is “unstable, unhinged” and “a threat to our democracy,” and that “it's certainly not the first time that Donald Trump has called for the arresting of a Black man unjustly.”


	Implementing Trump and Vought's attack on public infrastructure in Democratic cities and states and federal civil rights law is Sean Duffy, secretary of the Department of Transportation. Duffy is a far-right former congressman and Fox News host with limited transportation experience. His White House bio touts his reality TV show props (MTV's The Real World and Road Rules All Stars), including being one half of “America's first and longest-married reality TV couple,” citing his 25-year marriage and nine children with Rachel Campos-Duffy. 

	











	At a Senate hearing in May, Duffy told Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York that he would not cancel federal grants that had been awarded for the two New York projects. “If you're asking me if I plan on canceling those grant agreements, I do not,” he said.


	Duffy is a climate skeptic who voted against climate and environmental action at every opportunity during his time in Congress. He has a visceral disdain for public transit, which he describes as “dirty” “homeless shelters” and “insane asylums” filled with “criminals” who “prey upon the good people.” 


	In a Fox News interview in May, Duffy and host Larry Kudlow decried bike, pedestrian, and public transit lanes, despite extensive evidence that, compared to cars, physical (walking, biking) and social (public transit) commutes lead to healthier and happier people, save money, and reduce harmful air pollution. Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in the country. Public transit policy can be used to advance social justice and equity, with Black and Hispanic workers nearly three times as likely to use public transit than white workers. 


	Transportation infrastructure has long been used “as a powerful tool to enforce white supremacy,” American Civil Liberties Union President Deborah Archer explained on a podcast with W. Kamau Bell earlier this year. Archer is associate dean at the New York University School of Law and author of Dividing Lines: How Transportation Infrastructure Reinforces Racial Inequality. “White supremacy depends on Black people knowing ‘their place' in a social hierarchy and staying there,” she said. 


	“In cities, failing public transit continues to isolate Black neighborhoods from jobs and essential services,” Archer wrote recently in Rolling Stone. “And as climate change intensifies storms, floods, and heat waves, Black communities are, once again, consistently left exposed, unprotected, and forgotten.”


	“When the Biden-Harris administration came in, they did not just create plans in a vacuum, they went and listened to people in the community” to learn what projects were needed, “and financing flowed from those discussions,” Michele Roberts, national co-coordinator of the Environmental Justice Health Alliance, tells me. The programs included projects to address historic and ongoing environmental racism and injustices, and the disproportionate health and economic burdens in Black and Brown communities that followed.

	











	Within days of taking office, Duffy released a series of memos that call for the purge of all Department of Transportation actions — including rules, regulations, policies, and funding agreements — that relate “in any way to climate change, ‘greenhouse gas' emissions, racial equity, gender identity, ‘diversity, equity and inclusion' goals, environmental justice or the Justice 40 initiative.” He subsequently froze project funding while the agency reviewed grants for these offenses.


	Last week, Duffy issued an interim final rule “barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.” The order targets the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which for four decades has enjoyed bipartisan congressional support to address systemic inequalities in government infrastructure contracting that has discriminated against small businesses owned by women and people of color. Within days of issuing the rule, the agency announced the transit cuts to New York and Chicago. Communities across the country are now bracing for more cuts.


	Goodwin, the Georgetown professor, says the rule is illegal: “Now this gets to be vetted before court, but for decades the federal government has engaged in contracting that is sex- and race-based, recognizing that providing opportunities to those that were previously excluded” is a necessary condition of attempting to “level that playing field that has been 400 years of cheating.” She adds, “As a consolation, now you have some bidding power.” 


	A coalition representing minority and women owned businesses has sued the Trump administration, pointing to extensive documentation from the Department of Labor, among others, of historic and ongoing barriers to entry experienced by women and minority business owners seeking federal contracts. Ken Canty, the Black CEO of Atlantic Meridian Contracting Corporation explains in a statement, “This program was never about handouts — it's about fair access. We've earned our place, and the court already recognized that we should be allowed to defend it.”


	The lack of access extends beyond small businesses to include workers in the construction fields. Women workers, particularly women of color, face “significant obstacles to economic security in large part due to racism, sexism, and discrimination,” which create barriers to good jobs “that pay well, offer quality benefits and support workers' right to come together in unions,” according to an analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families. As a result, women workers have been underrepresented in industries funded by federal infrastructure investments.

	











	Vought shared a social media post in August from the Department of Labor with an image of a young, white, male worker in a hardhat and the heading, “Make America Skilled Again.”

	The Trump administration is not against federal preferences, per se, just some of them. For example, in January, Duffy signed an order that directed the Department of Transportation “to give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average.” 


	Washington Democratic Senator Patty Murray called it “disturbingly dystopian.”


	According to Goodwin, the order is directly related to Duffy and the rest of the administration's purge of diversity initiatives. “It's very much a pronatalist type of administration, and its pronatalism is aimed at white women,” she says. Pronatalism refers to policies which seek to encourage married women to stay home and have more children. The National Women's Law Center lists Duffy along with Vought and Vice President J.D. Vance as part of “Trump's Pronatalist Army.” The Trump administration “doesn't see all Americans as equal,” Goodwin adds. “It doesn't have an interest in more Latino Americans. It doesn't have an interest in more Black Americans, but it does have an interest in more white Americans.”


	“Let's be clear that the replacement theory concept that the Confederacy pushed forward in the 1800s has been replicated in these times almost verbatim,” Goodwin explains. There were those who worried that the abolition of slavery would result in a “mass populating of Black people” that would overwhelm the nation and the government, and “take away power from white people.” At the same time, the idea that “white women needed to spread their loins” and procreate was advocated in response to this irrational racist fear. “Now, here we are again,” Goodwin says.  


	Among the many ills of racism and sexism is that they are exceptionally expensive, labor economist Valerie Wilson explains, noting that the Trump administration is “really striking at anything and everything that has to some extent or another provided opportunities to historically marginalized groups, specifically by race and gender.” 


	Wilson is director of the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy. Her research has found that reducing discrimination is a financial boon for everyone. Extrapolating from an earlier study which found that declining occupational barriers to women and Black men relative to white men resulted in substantial gains in gross domestic product of almost eight percent per capita between 1960 and 2010, Wilson found that the benefit of reduced discrimination through 2024 is more than $4,932 per person.

	











	Wilson argues that the U.S. economy may now be headed towards recession and recovery will be made far more difficult and unequal if Trump's current policies remain unchanged.

	Trump has made clear that he cares little about any unequal fallout from the government shutdown. As he sent National Guard troops into Democratic cities across the country, Trump was asked about a White House memo threatening to deny backpay to the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers (which has been called “illegal and morally corrupt” by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility). 


	“We're going to take care of our people,” Trump said. “There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.”

Charli XCX‘s A24 film endeavor is getting an A-list cast behind it. On Thursday, the pop star shared a first flashy teaser for the upcoming film, The Moment, unveiling that celebs like Kylie Jenner and actors such as Rachel Sennott and Alexander Skarsgård will be featured in the film. It's out next year.


	Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes co-wrote the film “based on an original idea” by Charli XCX. According to a provided synopsis, the film will be about “a rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.”


	Eighties icon Rosanna Arquette, Charli bestie and Sweat tour opener Shygirl, Interview editor-in-chief Mel Ottenberg, and PC Music founder and Charli collaborator A.G. Cook are also featured in the film. (Cook will also be in charge of The Moment‘s music.) Jamie Demetriou, Kate Berlant, Isaac Powell, and Rish Shah are among the actors featured.  Arielle Dombasle, Hailey Benton Gates, Tish Weinstock, Trew Mullen, Michael Workéyè, and Richard Perez round out the cast.

	











	Charli shared a strobe-light, flashy teaser for the film, unveiling the entire cast backed by a gritty remix to “I Love It,” her collaboration with Icona Pop. (Warning: the Bratty video's flashing is quite intense.)

	Charli confirmed the project back in January 2025, and told Billboard previously that she had three weeks booked off to work on writing a film in Poland. “Well, I don't really know if I should say because I also don't know if we're going to do it,” she said. “We might actually just go to Poland and not do that, but that is the idea.”

	











	“We would write it and shoot it at the same time, kind of like making an album,” Charli explained, referring to Zamiri. “One of the guys is the director — he works that way all the time.”

	Growing up, Jack Osbourne felt like he had to share his dad with the world. “He was always touring,” Ozzy's youngest son, 39, tells Rolling Stone over Zoom from his Los Angeles home on Tuesday. “I really feel like it was in adulthood that we got to know each other, doing [the travel TV series] World Detour.”


	Although MTV's reality show The Osbournes displayed a tight bond between father and son, World Detour, which aired for three seasons between 2016 and 2018, gave Jack the opportunity to spend true quality time with the man who helped invent heavy metal with Black Sabbath and went on to greater fame as a solo artist.


	 “I remember having these thoughts when we were doing it and being like, ‘Oh, I'm so lucky I got to do this with him,'” he says of the show, which found the tourist duo visiting American landmarks and curiosities. “I was so lucky, in the sense that I got him in his last good years.”


	Ozzy severely injured his neck after a fall at home in 2019. That accident, along with complications due to Parkinson's disease and other ailments, formed a shadow over the rest of his life, forcing him to postpone and cancel tour dates while he recovered. He performed his final concert as a solo artist and Black Sabbath's singer, at Back to the Beginning, a blowout charity-concert extravaganza in his hometown of Birmingham, England, on July 5 of this year. The singer, whose music inspired Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Slayer, and countless other metal bands who performed at the festival, died weeks later, on July 22, prompting worldwide tributes.

	A new book written by Ozzy, Last Rites, and a documentary on Paramount+, Ozzy: No Escape From Now, chronicle how hard the artist worked to recover from his injuries so he could make it to Back to the Beginning.

	











	The singer completed Last Rites days before his death. In his own inimitable language, he details the pain his injuries caused him, as well as the love he felt from his family and fans in his final years, all while reflecting on how he stared down death many times in the past, from the devastating loss of guitarist Randy Rhoads to bidding farewell to friends like Led Zeppelin's John Bonham. He also reflects on how the Back to the Beginning concert, and the outpouring of love that followed, warmed his heart.

	“When [Dad] passed, we were like, ‘Well, do we go forward [with the book]?'” Jack says. “I think we all collectively were like, ‘Well, he wanted the book to come out.' That was something he was working towards and right up until two days before he passed, and so it felt wrong to hold off on the book.”


	The producers of Ozzy: No Escape From Now began work on the documentary during the making of Osbourne's final album, 2022's Patient Number 9, filming him as he recorded the songs and made comeback appearances at England's 2022 Commonwealth Games through the Back to the Beginning concert. “[The doc] feels like Rocky III when he loses everything and he's trying to fight to get it all back,” Jack says. “It's a great insight into the lead-up to that final show.”


	During the course of a candid and emotional interview, Jack reflects on the impact Ozzy had on him throughout his life, as well as how he, his mom, Sharon, and sisters, Aimée and Kelly, have been handling the tragic loss.


How are you holding up these days?It's just weird. I think that's just a common reaction when losing any parent, but I think I'm doing OK. Having kids and getting back into the school routine just forces me to focus on “All right. Let's keep moving forward.”


I'm sure that's what Ozzy would want, too.Oh, yeah. One hundred percent. The amount of times I could just hear him going, “What are you all crying for?” is endless. He would think this is all so ridiculous.

How has the family been supporting one another?I was in England for three or four weeks and came back to L.A. about a month after he passed. Mom and Kelly are in England; Aimée and I are here in L.A. So it's just a lot of checking in with each other daily and rolling through the emotions of it all. Just knowing that, hey, someone else is feeling similar to the way I do — meaning my sisters or my mom — is so helpful.


Ozzy definitely didn't want people to feel sorry for him. Why do you think it was important to him to write the book and explain the challenges he faced after the accident?I think he wrote it partially to clear away some speculation about this, that, and the other. Also, he wrote it just to set the record straight: “Yeah, I've been sick but don't feel sorry for me, and this is the life.…” He had no regrets. He has had such a blessed life, such a journey, and I think he wanted to share that in his own words.

	











I know the family struggled with whether to release the book. It must be difficult for you to unveil this chronicle of the past six years. Was it hard to relive that time by reading it?It was interesting to see what he put in the book from the last six and seven years. Everyone always wonders when you read a biography of someone, “How accurate is that?” I can honestly say with this book, it really is his stream of consciousness over this last period of time. I was reading it and I'm going through a chapter, and it starts with a story, and then he goes off on a tangent and then he comes back, and it is so spot on to how his thought process was. I think it has a real personal touch to it because of that.


What struck you while reading his account of his health struggles?There was some stuff that I would've liked him to have gone a little bit deeper into with the health stuff, but to be honest with you, I think the reason why he didn't go deeper is because he was just so fucking tired of it. The one thing that I think comes across, though, was how important it was for him to do that last show.


What was the experience of the Back to the Beginning concert like for you?I got up there a couple of days early. I saw them soundcheck. It was powerful in a way that was surprising. I knew it was going to be a hard day for the whole family, especially him, and so, like, and I said on GMA, it was like a living wake. There was a divine perfection to it all in a weird way. It was a full stop. I mean, he saw people he hadn't seen in 30 years. He got to see friends and fans and just be in his hometown, and it was just wild and really moving.


What did Ozzy tell you about the experience for him?He was so happy. Since he got sick, he became a bit of a social media junkie. He was on Instagram; he was on TikTok; he had YouTube, because he was relatively stationary, so he did a lot of social media scrolling. It was the first time he'd done a gig and then got to see direct response on social media.


	So every morning he would wake up in England, and you'd get tabloid newspapers, and every day of the week following was some big spread in one of the British newspapers. He just really got a kick out of seeing all the great reviews and all the posts online. He was so stoked. I'm like, “Dad, all these reviews are amazing.” And he goes, “A lot of fucking good that does me. I've retired.”


In the book, he explains how much therapy and hard work he put into preparing for the concert. That concert must have felt like a victory to him.It was huge for him. And he was frustrated he couldn't get out the chair, but I think all things considered, he did a great fucking job.

	











Watching him sing “Mama, I'm Coming Home” was incredibly emotional. Did he tell you anything about that?The only thing he said to me was like, “Oh, I fucking started losing it in ‘Mama, I'm Coming Home.'” And my response was, “Well, everyone was.”


How did the family keep his spirits up since his accident?I think he felt purposeful whenever he was working, whenever he was doing an album with Andrew [Watt] or working with [friend and guitarist] Billy Morrison or doing the podcast with us. It would be tough during these long periods where he either wasn't working towards something or he was in between things. He would start to just get low.


	He loved working. So when he wasn't, he wasn't his best self. But there would always be someone at the house, either me and the kids or Kelly and Aimée. We would visit him as much as we could and try and get him to come out occasionally. But he liked his routine. He got into the vibe of just being at home, which was a blessing and a curse; if you tried to mess up that routine, he didn't like it.


	I ended up moving back in for a period. I was between houses, and it was just easier for me to move in with them for six months, and he was in a good spot then, because he couldn't be miserable. It was just a house full of kids.


When was he happiest?When certain friends would visit, he'd be very, very happy. When we would have a big dinner at the house. He wasn't always happy, but I have memories of him laughing a lot. I've got some memories of him laughing pretty hard over some very inappropriate jokes. A dick-in-the-mouth joke that would get him going.


How did his personality change since the accident?Just because the pace of life slowed down so much for him, he was a lot quieter. I think slowing down put things into perspective for him a little bit more. In some ways, he was a lot more present. But even though he was quieter, he would still blare music at 10 billion decibels, but it was a different version of himself.


What was the music he was blasting?He would play the most random shit. He went through a deep Michael Jackson phase at one point, and he went through a heavy Eighties phase. He always would play Peter Gabriel.


	And the shitty thing is — one of the things that bums me out the most about the whole fucking Roger Waters bullshit — is that he was always playing Pink Floyd. Fucking asshat how that guy is. I think it's just jealousy. It's like, “Dude, when you die, they might just do a cheers at the local pub.”

	











When I was reading about all the surgeries he had to get, especially how the first one caused him more problems, I got angry. How does the family feel about all of that now?It's an anger that I've had for so long. It's the blessing and the curse of the L.A. doctor: You get great doctors in this city, but they don't want to be the doctor that fucked someone up, so they will never give it to you straight. What I noticed with my dad in the medical world was, like, the doctors were almost too scared to be honest with the surgeries.


	There were a couple doctors that were really great, but it really all went downhill from that first surgery, and that one doctor should never have done the surgery the way he did it. It just set the wheels in motion for a really tough stretch for my dad. And then you put Covid in, and it was just, yeah …


	Everyone was just hoping like, “Oh, this surgery, this'll be the one that fixes him. This'll be the one that fixes him,” but there was just so much damage done from that first one it was hard to dig out of the hole.


A few years ago, your mom said she wanted to sue that doctor. Is that still in the works?I've been saying from the jump that we should have done it immediately, but I don't know. It's one of those things where you look at it and you're like, “OK, yeah, you could sue this doctor or whoever, but it's not going to bring [Dad] back. It's not going to fix him.” Yeah, it lets everyone know that that doctor's an asshole, but I guess if I had a magic wand, I probably would've done it five years ago.


How is your mom coping with everything these days?She's OK, but she's not OK. It's ups and downs. She's just trying to figure out where to go from here, how to navigate, what's the new norm, what's the new baseline, “What do I do without my person?” But she's got a lot of love and support around her. I'm bringing her back to L.A. this week. Actually, I'm flying over to England tomorrow, because it's her birthday on Thursday.


	So, yeah, we must keep moving forward. You even said it yourself: He hated people feeling sorry for him, and he always wanted to keep moving forward.


	After the funeral, we sat at home and everyone was just having a tough morning, and I opened up my phone and a video popped into my feed, and it was my dad on David Letterman a week after Randy [Rhoads] had passed, and David Letterman asked him, “I'm surprised you came. You've been going through it right now.” My dad's response is “I'm about rock & roll, and I've got to keep moving forward, and I've got a job to do.” And I held it up. I was like, “See, he's telling us. Got to keep going.”

	











One of the things that struck me about the documentary was just how strong your parents' bond was right up until the end.Yeah. And that's what I said about the blessing and the curse of him getting injured and slowing down. I think it really helped reinforce their relationship. It's no secret they'd gone through their own problems, and I think it just helped really just heal a lot of stuff in a way. The upside, if there is any in the last seven years, is that we got a lot of time with him.


How do you see your dad's legacy?With a lot of musicians, they become the rock star — and he certainly did — but I think he always did it with the air of “This could all go away tomorrow.” I think his legacy too is that he didn't just stay one thing. He was able to take risks and change and grow with the times. There's not a decade that he wasn't making an impact, and I'm not just saying that. It's just fact.

In the book's last chapter, your dad wrote, “I've had a loud life. I'm ready for some quiet now.” Do you think he meant it?One hundred percent. I remember a conversation I had with him where he turned around, he looked at me, and he went, “I think I'm going to grow a beard. I'm going to cut my hair off.” And I was like, “What?” And he's like, “Yeah, I'm not a rock star anymore.” And I was like, “Oh, fuck off.” He'd look like a hipster from Brooklyn.


How do you think he saw his own legacy?I don't think he saw it as a legacy. I think that was almost too grandiose for him to look back and go, “Oh, look at my legacy.” I think he was such a day-to-day kind of person. But after the show, it was such a big deal for him. And when he felt all that love and saw all these musicians just paying him so much respect, I think he felt complete with his legacy.

A paper from a SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute scientist has directly addressed claims that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft.

On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected an object moving through the Solar System on an escape trajectory. Follow-up observations soon confirmed that we were looking at our third interstellar visitor, after ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, although it looks quite different from the previous two. It's an interesting object, perhaps from an earlier age of the universe and a different part of the galaxy, and even spacecraft around Mars and Jupiter are getting in on the action observing it.

There have been a few suggestions – although not from the majority of scientists – that the object could not be natural at all. Soon after the object was discovered, and before we could take a proper look at it, Harvard theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and astronomer Avi Loeb suggested in a paper that it could be an interstellar probe sent by an intelligent species, potentially with the goal of destroying Earth.

In the first paper, which he states in an accompanying blog post is largely a ""pedagogical exercise"" and ""fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity"", he suggested that the object could be hostile, as outlined in the ""Dark Forest"" hypothesis. In short (though you should read the book on which it is based, you will not regret it), given the finite resources in the universe, and our lack of knowledge of any other civilization's intent, any lifeform may want to pre-emptively attack any other form of life they discover, before it becomes a threat to their own civilization. According to Loeb's paper, the object could be here for that purpose.

""The low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity,"" Loeb, Adam Hibberd, and Adam Crowl write in that paper.

""The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of ∼ 5.9 × 10-5 au day-2, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.""

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and Loeb did not provide this, instead arguing that given the potential consequences of a dark forest strike (Earth goes kablooey), we should consider it, and any planetary defense measures we could take if it were the case.

While speculation like this is enjoyable in a sci-fi context, it has been less than helpful for more conspiracy-minded citizens of Earth. As well as people out there who believe an alien spacecraft is going to approach Earth in late November or early December (per Loeb's suggestion), there are also people who believe that we are being told a spacecraft is approaching as a cover-up for something else. People are getting real weird with it.

In the paper addressing these claims, which has not yet been peer reviewed, SETI scientist and senior lecturer at the Geoscience Department of Universiti Teknologi Petronas, AKM Eahsanul Haque, outlines why it is likely a natural object. 

""Loeb et al. found that the retrograde orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS is quite near to 129the ecliptic, with a 0.2% likelihood that this alignment is not just a coincidence,"" Haque writes, adding that the alignment is not impossible for interstellar objects, even if it is statistically rare.

""The galactic disk, which is where most stars are, is nearly in line with the solar system's ecliptic plane. It is plausible that ISOs that are thrown out of other systems may naturally follow paths that are similar to these.""

 

""The hyperbolic trajectory, which has an eccentricity of around 6.1, and the high speed of about 58 kilometers per second 134are both consistent with gravitational ejection from a distant star system, according to the measurements 135made in 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Also, it is important to note that the low likelihood of close encounters with Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, which is about 0.005%, is not only for man-made objects. Natural comets can also have similar dynamics because of changes in gravity.""

Other papers, of course, treat it as an interstellar comet, but do not address these alien technology claims specifically. Loeb and colleagues flagged up a lack of identifiable chemicals as evidence that the comet could be artificial, according to Haque, but comparing the spectral slope with D-Type asteroids and interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, he finds they demonstrate consistency with these other natural objects.

In Loeb's initial paper and blog post, he states that ""detection of a non-gravitational acceleration could also indicate an intent to intercept Jupiter, not far off the path of 3I/ATLAS, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion."" 2I/Borisov underwent a little non-gravitational acceleration, meaning a change of speed that was not caused by gravitational interactions alone, which astronomers put down to outgassing.

""Seligman et al. also found a slight change in the light curve over about four days, showing that the structure is stable and there is no evidence of acceleration beyond what gravity would cause,"" Haque explains. ""This differs from the results of 1I/‘Oumuamua, which showed a small, non-gravitational acceleration thought to be caused by outgassing. The fact that 3I/ATLAS did not display such acceleration is a strong argument against the idea of artificial propulsion.""

    

Since that first paper, Loeb has claimed that a lack of non-gravitational acceleration observed so far could be a sign that there is a ""major anomaly"" with its mass, and again that the explanation could be aliens. 

""The mass of 3I/ATLAS scales with its diameter cubed. If the nucleus diameter of 3I/ATLAS will be found to be larger than 5 kilometers in the HiRISE image, then an origin associated with the interstellar mass reservoir of rocky material will be untenable,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""An alternative technological origin could explain the rare alignment of the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS with the ecliptic plane (having a random chance of 1 in 500, as discussed here), and the detection of nickel without iron — as found in industrially-manufactured alloys.""

In short; if it accelerates it might be aliens, if it doesn't accelerate it might be aliens. While alien spacecraft are an undeniably fun topic to talk about, scientists have a much more likely explanation for the object, which is backed up by the evidence. It is a comet.

“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies, said to The Guardian about such claims. “It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It's a comet.”

Based on its trajectory, spectra, and comet-like properties, Haque suggests that it could be ""a lithified clastic fragment from an exoplanetary sedimentary basin"". For his own part, Loeb has moved from saying that the idea is purely a teaching exercise, to placing pretty high odds that the object is an alien spacecraft.

""As of now, I assign a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, based on its seven anomalies that I listed here. This low-probability scenario includes the possibility of a black swan event akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet,"" he writes in a new post, adding that his percentages are likely to shift as we get more information on the object.

More information on the object is highly-anticipated by other astronomers too, not because it might be aliens, but because it is an interesting comet from another part of the galaxy, which could operate as a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. Surely that's enough?

The paper is posted to the preprint server Earth ArXiv.

The first observation of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.

A team of astronomers has attempted to track the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS back into the past, tracing its path through the galaxy in simulations involving over 13 million stars.

On July 1, astronomers spotted an unusual object speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was soon confirmed to be an interstellar comet, and is suspected to have a nucleus (the rocky center of the comet, excluding its coma) of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), and a potential mass of over 33 billion tons.

The astronomical community continued to track the object as it moved through the Solar System and behind the Sun from our perspective. We may even have seen it using NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars.

But where did it come from? Luckily for us, gravity is time-reversal symmetric, and if we know an object's trajectory, we can work backwards and trace its path. In a new paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, but not yet peer reviewed, a team from the University of A Coruña attempted to do just this.

  

The team used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, which produces a three-dimensional map of stars and other objects in the Milky Way and beyond. Tracing the object's path backwards through 10 million years, the team tried to identify where it had close encounters in the past, coming within 2 parsecs (6.5 light-years) of another star. 

""We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the 2σ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation,"" the team writes in their paper. ""The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s−1, imparted only a velocity change of |∆v| ≃ 5 × 10−4 km s−1 to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin.""

In short, none of these potential close(ish) encounters could explain 3I/ATLAS's origin, and barely altered its trajectory. But mapping it back into the past, the team believes it likely originated from the galaxy's thin disk, in contrast to an earlier study, which suggested it may be from the thick disk, given how little it wandered from the galactic plane.

""Together, all data indicate that while 3I/ATLAS follows a thin-disk orbit in the solar neighborhood, it may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system, or from an exo-Oort cloud, and is most likely associated with the transition region between the thin and thick disk, although its origin remains undisclosed,"" the team concludes.

Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is needed to draw further conclusions, but this preliminary study suggests it could be a very old object, that may have been traveling alone for billions of years until we spotted it near our star. The team suggests the object is around 10 billion years old, making it a time capsule of the formation of the earliest planetary systems in the galaxy and universe, though we will likely never know its true origin.

“What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now,"" Pérez Couto, Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies researcher and team leader, added in a statement. ""Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past.""

The study is posted to the pre-print server arXiv.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural Star's Theory Changes The Show's Ending For The Better","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-god-theory-better-ending/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:45:00 GMT","

Supernatural star Rob Benedict, who played Chuck/God, spoke exclusively with ScreenRant to reveal his idea for the show's ending, and it's so much better than the Supernatural finale we got. There were really two endings to Supernatural: the original ending in season 5, and the actual ending with the season 15 finale.

Debates continue even to this day regarding which Supernatural ending was better, and fans remain divided. There are several reasons some viewers took issue with the true finale, ranging from the way that Dean died (in addition to the fact that he died at all) to the choice to show Sam aging and eventually dying as well.

In fact, Supernatural's stars recently shared their insights with ScreenRant, including how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the original plan for the series finale. There are, therefore, many opinions when it comes to how Supernatural should have ended, but none sounds quite as good as Rob Benedict's pitch for God's role in the finale.

Supernatural began with two brothers battling monsters and searching for their father, but it ultimately culminated in an epic showdown against God himself in season 15. In the end, Sam and Dean prevail and strip God's powers from him (and leave him alive), along with the help of Jack, who ultimately takes over God's role.

Sadly, this didn't mean that Sam and Dean were safe. On the contrary, it's revealed that God had actually been keeping Sam and Dean alive, essentially giving them plot armor. With that now gone, Dean loses his life not in some immense battle between good and evil but rather by being slammed into rebar by a vampire.

This proved incredibly controversial, even after Sam and Dean reunited in Heaven at the end of the episode, because it felt so unceremonious. However, Chuck/God actor Rob Benedict shared a theory that would have given the show a very different ending—and it's so much better for that very reason.

Speaking exclusively with ScreenRant, Benedict said:

“There's a theory that I think is interesting, that I've heard, that God is, Chuck is, still writing the show, even as his powers are lost and Jack takes over. And the end of the show happens, it's still Chuck writing. And, you know, in season 11, he's like, I just thought of my ending. What if that's what he thought of? He said he's going to be the bad guy, they're going to take him down, take his powers away. He's still kind of in control of the whole thing. He's still the writer, so I always say to people, what if after, on the bridge, they wave goodbye, end of the series, and then the book shuts, and it's still me, like ‘So, what'd you think?'”

While this theory doesn't change the events of the final episode, in that Dean still would have died and the brothers would have reunited in Heaven, this completely recontextualizes not only the finale but also the show overall. This is so much more than just any old theory, though; this alternate ending actually makes more sense than the real conclusion.

While there were concerns that making God the ultimate villain could be jumping the shark, this was actually a thrilling direction for the show to take, and given that Supernatural had increasingly focused on angels, demons, and even the Devil, it wasn't all that difficult to believe when it happened.

Benedict actually spoke about that in his interview with ScreenRant as well, sharing:

""Ultimately, I think it's kind of brilliant, and I got used to fans saying, 'We hated you in the final season.' Like, yeah, you were supposed to. But the idea that Sam and Dean, their biggest enemy of all, the final chapter in the video game, is to take on God himself. If you can beat that one, then you win, you know? So, I thought that was kind of cool.""

The only issue with this plot was, arguably, that they really were able to take God down, despite his being all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent. Yes, Dean and Sam had the help of Jack, who was a Nephilim (half-human and half-angel) born of Lucifer himself, but this was still a feat a bit too grand to just accept.

Rob Benedict's idea for the Supernatural finale completely resolves this issue, and it simply makes a ton of sense. If this were all part of God's plan, then that reveals in a much more believable way how/why Sam, Dean, and Jack were able to stop God.

It also makes sense that, even after being 'defeated,' God would still be in control. After all, he is literally God.

This also would have been an ending that offered more closure, which was particularly needed because the ending the show had planned, which brought all the fan-favorite characters back together in Heaven, wasn't possible due to COVID. In fact, this alternate conclusion would have resolved some complaints about Dean's death, too.

Dean died many times in Supernatural, be it from Hell Hounds claiming him when his demon contract was up or the more than 100 times he died in the episode ""Mystery Spot,"" but that didn't stop his final death from causing outrage. This in part stemmed from the fact that Dean, one of the most beloved characters, died at all.

However, many continue to argue that it wasn't that Dean died but rather the way he died that infuriated them. That is, Dean was killed by a random vampire with no extraordinary powers compared to the average monster, and that felt, to some, like a disservice to the character and all that he had survived.

Rob Benedict's Supernatural ending would resolve this issue by revealing that, even then, Dean only died in this way because it was what God wanted. This would actually make even more sense in light of Sam and Dean so blatantly turning on God and taking his powers.

Whereas God had long kept Dean and Sam safe because they were his 'favorites,' after they fought against him, God undoubtedly no longer had any interest in protecting the brothers. Presumably, just the opposite was true, which would also make this conclusion logical; Supernatural didn't invent the notion that God is vengeful, and this could be seen as God's punishment.

Benedict also points to the fact that Chuck had long been the writer of Supernatural, so him literally closing the book on the show at the end would have been fitting. Most importantly, though, the show wouldn't have had to make the narrative leap of God himself being defeated.

Instead, this Supernatural ending would have wrapped everything up in a way that explained how God could have been defeated, ameliorated some of the pain surrounding Dean's death, and brought the show to a clear conclusion befitting its 15 seasons.

WASHINGTON — Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to hit pause on an almost $1.5 billion defamation judgment that was imposed over his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

In a new filing, Jones said the court's immediate involvement is needed because his website, InfoWars, is on the verge of being turned over to the satirical news site The Onion to help fund payments to family members of the Sandy Hook victims.

If the case is not put on hold, ""InfoWars will have been acquired by its ideological nemesis and destroyed,"" Jones' lawyers wrote.

The Sandy Hook tragedy occurred in December 2012, when a gunman killed 20 first-grade children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Connecticut.

Families of the victims had sued, winning the huge judgment in Connecticut state court.

Jones, who owns InfoWars via his company Free Speech Systems, subsequently lost attempts in state court to appeal the judgment. He is also seeking bankruptcy protections.

The Onion failed in a previous attempt to acquire InfoWars via a bankruptcy auction, but Jones' lawyer said a new attempt is underway in Texas state court.

His lawyers asked the Supreme Court to put the judgment on hold while the justices consider his appeal. The court is scheduled to discuss his appeal in private on Friday.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said his administration plans to use the ongoing government shutdown to permanently cut government programs popular with Democrats, his latest threat amid the funding stalemate.

""We're only cutting Democrat programs,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

It was not immediately clear which programs Trump had in mind, but he specified that they were ""very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly.""

""They wanted to do this,"" Trump said, doubling down on blaming Democrats for the shutdown.

They will ""get a little taste of their own medicine,"" he added.

The president's threat to target Democratic priorities came one week after he initially floated the idea of inflicting pain on his political opponents during the shutdown, which is now in its ninth day.

He said in a Truth Social post last Thursday that the congressional funding lapse gave him an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to slash what he described as ""Democrat Agencies.""

He also wrote he would be meeting with Russell Vought, the White House Office of Management and Budget director, to determine what to cut.

On the first day of the shutdown, Vought announced that the administration was freezing about $18 billion in funding for New York City infrastructure projects, and canceling roughly $8 billion more in climate-related funding for Democratic-leaning states.

Two days later, Vought said that $2.1 billion in Chicago transit project funding has also been put on hold.

The administration is considering canceling an additional $12 billion earmarked for clean energy projects, Semafor reported Tuesday.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Republican and Democratic congressional leaders could not pass appropriations bills to keep the government funded past the end of the fiscal year.

Republicans want to pass a stopgap measure to resume funding largely at current levels through Nov. 21. Democrats say any funding bill should include additional health-care protections, including extending premium Affordable Care Act tax credits before they expire at the end of the year.

The dueling proposals have repeatedly failed to pass in the Senate.

            A French court on Thursday rejected the appeal of a former construction worker found guilty last year of the aggravated rape of Gisele Pelicot, and increased his prison sentence by a year to 10 years, France Info reported.
    


            A lawyer for Husamettin Dogan did not respond to a request for comment on her client's failed appeal.

The Gaza war is over, a senior Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, has said, adding that the peace plan put forth by US President Donald Trump would mark the start of a “permanent ceasefire.”

The militant group received some “guarantees” from Washington and other mediators that the hostilities would not continue, he told Gaza residents in a televised address on Thursday.

According to al-Hayya, the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group “dealt responsibly with the American president's plan” and submitted a response aimed at preventing further bloodshed. He did not elaborate on the nature of the response but said that the deal, which was reached in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, includes providing the Palestinian enclave with humanitarian aid, opening the Rafah border crossing, and exchanging prisoners.

“Everyone confirmed that the war has completely ended,” the official said, vowing to work with all national and Islamic forces to complete the next steps envisioned by the agreement.

His words came as the Israeli cabinet was still voting on the ratification of the agreement. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said ahead of the vote that he and his party would oppose Trump's peace plan and would leave the government if Hamas is allowed to retain control over Gaza. He also described the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages as an “unbearable price” to pay for the agreement.

Earlier media reports suggested that Israeli forces would be required to withdraw to a pre-set line within 24 hours, leaving Israel in control of around 53% of the Palestinian enclave. Hamas would release all living hostages within 72 hours of West Jerusalem ratifying the deal. In return, Israel would free 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained since 2023, including all women and minors.

According to Israeli Channel 12, West Jerusalem would only allow the prisoners to go free after the 72-hour period, during which Hamas is expected to release all Israeli hostages. The group still holds around 48 hostages; Israel believes that around 20 are still alive.

The Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters attacked the Jewish state, killing around 1,200 people, and taking around 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent military operation in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to local officials. It also led to unprecedented destruction and a humanitarian disaster in the enclave.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump suggests throwing Spain out of NATO","https://www.rt.com/news/626162-trump-expel-spain-nato/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 22:49:00 GMT","

NATO should expel Spain from the military bloc for failing to meet the new 5% defense spending target, US President Donald Trump has said. The American leader, who spearheaded the increase, claimed he secured the commitment during the NATO summit in June.



Trump addressed the issue during a meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in the Oval Office on Thursday. He boasted about making NATO members commit to the new spending target “virtually unanimously.”

“We had one laggard. It was Spain,” the US President said, adding that “they have no excuse not to do this.”

“Maybe you should throw them out of NATO, frankly,” Trump stated.

The US president has repeatedly accused NATO member of failing to shoulder the military spending burden equitably even during his first term. Since taking office again in January, he had intensified demands that the bloc's European members spend more on defense.

His push culminated at the June summit in The Hague, where NATO members committed to hike defense spending to 5% of their GDP annually by 2035. Trump praised the meeting as “the most unified and productive in history.”

Not all the bloc members were happy about the development. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said after the meeting that his nation was capable of meeting NATO demands even without a substantial spending increase and pointing to his government's “other priorities.”

Spain has emerged as the strongest opponent of the spending increase. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he had secured an exemption for Madrid ahead of the summit, while the country proposed a more modest defense spending target of 2.1% of GDP. Last year, Spain allocated the smallest share of its GDP to defense among NATO members, at around 1.3%.

After the June summit, Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles dismissed the 5% spending target as “absolutely impossible.”

“No industry can take it on,” she said at the time, arguing that European defense firms lack both the skilled labor and the raw materials needed to expand production, even if governments provide the necessary funding.

DUSHANBE, October 9. /TASS/. There has been a significant pause in dialogue between Russia and the United States, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

""Indeed, the dialogue as a follow-up of the Istanbul talks is considerably stalled,"" he said.

Regarding Ukraine, it has not provided any feedback on the documents. ""Our progress is at a standstill,"" he lamented.

On July 23, Istanbul hosted the third round of direct Russia-Ukraine talks. The two sides agreed to exchange civilians along with service members. Russia invited Ukraine to establish three online working groups to address political, military and humanitarian issues. In addition, Moscow offered to transfer the bodies of another 3,000 Ukrainian troops to Kiev and resume short humanitarian pauses on the frontline to collect the wounded and the dead.

Presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who is also Russia's chief negotiator in talks with Ukraine, said the decision to hold a fourth round of talks will be made after those agreements have been implemented.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Data shows a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns

Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US's major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns.

Personnel data obtained by Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, and shared with the Guardian, suggests the Trump administration has moved 45% of FBI agents in the country's 25 largest field offices to support the Department of Homeland Security's immigration crackdown. Across all of the FBI's offices, 23% of the roughly 13,000 total agents at the bureau are now working on immigration, according to Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.

Warner's office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau's mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities.

The data, first reported by the Washington Post, suggests the FBI is dramatically shifting its objectives in an effort to back Trump's increasingly aggressive immigration raids, with the administration targeting 3,000 daily arrests and seeking to expand its detention capacity to detain more than 100,000 immigrants.

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner. The senator's office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents' total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.

“When you pull a quarter of the FBI's top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement.

The transformation of the FBI has raised alarms about the potential consequences for communities targeted by immigration raids and the impact on the work the bureau is abandoning, experts said.

Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI's mandate. Some agents might be eager to support the president's immigration agenda while others likely oppose the redirection, he said: “Part of the reason FBI leadership would be doing this at such scale is to separate those two – to identify who are the loyalists and who are potential impediments to the administration's goals.”

The move is in line with FBI director Kash Patel's efforts to purge the bureau of agents seen as disloyal to Trump, German said, noting reports of the termination of personnel involved in the January 6 investigation.

FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said.

There has been extensive documentation of the violent and indiscriminate nature of the Ice raids, which have often been carried out by masked men and have at times led to the detention of US citizens, and adding FBI personnel to the mix could exacerbate the chaos and potential for abuses, the former agent said.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear. Spokespeople for DHS, Ice, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau's intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don't have capacity to tackle: “That's where the real harm will come.”

Current and former FBI agents told the Washington Post there were growing concerns about low morale within the agency and that agents were stretched thin, which could hamper national security investigations and complex cases.

Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent and professor of practice in the University of New Haven's criminal justice department, said the shift in priorities resembled the post-9/11 reorganization at the FBI, when counterterrorism became the central focus.

“The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.”

Gray, however, said he was not concerned about a temporary shift while DHS engages in rapid recruitment of new Ice officers.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, defended the redirection of FBI resources toward immigration enforcement at a tense Senate hearing earlier this week when she was accused by Democrats of weaponizing the justice department. FBI agents, she said, were working daily with DHS on “keeping Americans safe and getting illegal aliens out of our country”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump administration has been accused of preparing to severely limit journalists' ability to cover the department

With days left before journalists covering the Pentagon must sign on to a new set of guidelines to retain physical access to the department, major US news companies – and organizations representing their interests – remain concerned about specific policies they fear will stifle independent reporting on the Pentagon.

The Trump administration has been accused of preparing to impose severe limitations on the ability of journalists to cover the Pentagon and publish information that had not been officially approved for release.

An “in-brief for Media Members” that updated an earlier set of policies, released last month, drew strong condemnation from media companies and groups advocating for press freedom. On Monday, the Pentagon sent out a revised version.

On Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association, which said it has been “cautious” in communicating about the policy as it worked behind the scenes, said the changes made – including an acknowledgment that signees may not “agree” with the policies – are not sufficient.

In particular, the revised policy still prohibits journalists from the “solicitation” of information from Pentagon employees, “such as public advertisements or calls for tips encouraging [Department of War] employees to share non-public [Department of War] information”. Journalists fear that policy could infringe on their ability to seek information about the agency from employees.

Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to change the name of the defense department to the Department of War. This would require approval from Congress to become official.

“We acknowledge and appreciate that the Pentagon is no longer requiring reporters to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement. “But the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding' of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.”

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), which has worked behind the scenes to relax the policies, said the changes don't go far enough.

“The fact is we still have concerns with the updated language of the policy and expect that it will pose a significant impediment as journalists weigh with their employers whether or not to sign this revised version,” Gabe Rottman, the RCFP vice-president of policy said on Wednesday.

PEN America, an organization that advocates for free expression, also said Thursday that the Pentagon should “revisit” its policies. “National security is strengthened, not threatened, when journalists can investigate and report without fear,” Tim Richardson, PEN America journalism and disinformation program director said.

With the exception of CNN, which does not plan to sign the policy, most news organizations have been tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sign by next week's deadline or risk losing access to the Pentagon compound.

The New York Times said in a statement that it “appreciates the Pentagon's engagement, but problems remain with the policy and we and other news organizations believe further changes are needed”.

A spokesperson for the Atlantic also said that it “[continues] to oppose the Pentagon's proposed press policy”.

Pentagon representatives have been steadfast in rebuffing the protests of media organizations.

“Access to the Pentagon is a privilege, not a right and the Department is not only legally permitted, but morally obligated to impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of that privilege,” chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a post on X, denying that journalists will be forced to “clear stories” with the agency before publication.

Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, said in her own post that “reporters would rather clutch their pearls on social media than stop trying to get warfighters and [Department of War] civilians to commit a crime by violating Department-wide policy.”

In its statement on Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association called on the agency to reconsider the policies in the remaining days before journalists are asked to sign them.

“Limiting the media's ability to report on the US military fails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” the group said. “The American people deserve to know how their military is being run. They deserve more information from this administration, not less.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A Chinese takeover of Taiwan would severely threaten the national security of the US, Japan, the Philippines and other nations, while global economic losses could reach US$10 trillion, National Security Council Deputy Secretary-General Lin Fei-fan (林飛帆) wrote in an article published yesterday in Foreign Affairs.

“The future of Taiwan is not merely a regional concern; it is a test of whether the international order can withstand the pressure of authoritarian expansionism,” Lin wrote in the article titled “Taiwan's Plan for Peace Through Strength — How Investments in Resilience Can Deter Beijing.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) intent to take Taiwan by force and become the Indo-Pacific hegemon has been clear since he came to power in 2012, Lin wrote, citing China's military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, aerial incursions of Taiwanese airspace and disinformation campaigns as part of its efforts to bring about the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”

“Beijing's campaign is designed not simply to intimidate, but to erode Taiwan's confidence and capacity to resist,” he said.

Taipei's leaders have repeatedly warned partners and allies that Beijing's ambitions extend beyond Taiwan, and that China and its allies seek to reshape the global order, he said.

“Should Taipei fall to Beijing, the resulting power shift could fundamentally alter the global order. Strategically, China would gain a forward operating base in the western Pacific, threatening several vital sea-lanes and undermining the US' ability to meet security commitments to its Indo-Pacific partners and allies,” he said.

“The survival of a small democracy up against a powerful authoritarian adversary depends on preparations made long before the first shot is fired,” Lin said.

The administration of former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) pledged US$18.5 billion over 10 years to increase civil defense capabilities and bolster infrastructure, laying the foundation for a much more structured whole-of-society resilience campaign under President William Lai (賴清德), he said.

The efforts go a long way toward ensuring that Taiwan is developing the mindset that surrender is never an option — a model also present in Ukraine, Israel and Finland, he said.

Public support is key to achieving national resilience, and the opposition parties' claims that arms purchases only antagonize Beijing are wrong, he said.

Taiwan has little time to waste as authoritarian aggressors are seeking to change the world order, Lin said.

“Many of Taiwan's international partners, including the United States, are also engaging across Taipei's political lines to illustrate the importance and urgency of such preparations,” he said.

Taiwan producing the majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and being a part of a critical hub for global trade, means that any disruption to trade or manufacturing in the region would “reverberate across global markets, crippling industries from consumer electronics to automotive manufacturing and even defense systems,” Lin said.


MILITARY BOOST:
                                        The procurement was planned after Washington recommended that Taiwan increase its stock of air defense missiles, a defense official said yesterday                                        Taiwan is planning to order an additional four PAC-3 MSE systems and up to 500 missiles in response to an increasing number of missile sites on China's east coast, a defense official said yesterday. 
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the proposed order would be placed using the defense procurement special budget, adding that about NT$1 trillion (US$32,88 billion) has been allocated for the budget. 
The proposed acquisition would include launchers, missiles, and a lower tier air and missile defense radar system, they said 
The procurement was planned after the US military recommended that Taiwan increase                                    


POLITICAL AGENDA: 
                                        Beijing's cross-strait Mid-Autumn Festival events are part of a ‘cultural united front' aimed at promoting unification with Taiwan, academics said                                        Local authorities in China have been inviting Taiwanese to participate in cross-strait Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations centered around ideals of “family and nation,” a move Taiwanese academics said politicizes the holiday to promote the idea of “one family” across the Taiwan Strait.
Sources said that China's Fujian Provincial Government is organizing about 20 cross-strait-themed events in cities including Quanzhou, Nanping, Sanming and Zhangzhou. 
In Zhangzhou, a festival scheduled for Wednesday is to showcase Minnan-language songs and budaixi (布袋戲) glove puppetry to highlight cultural similarities between Taiwan and the region.
Elsewhere, Jiangsu Province is hosting more than 10 similar celebrations in Taizhou, Changzhou, Suzhou,                                    


TWO HEAVYWEIGHTS:
                                        Trump and Xi respect each other, are in a unique position to do something great, and they want to do that together, the US envoy to China said                                        The administration of US President Donald Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) “we don't want any coercion, but we want [the Taiwan dispute] resolved peacefully,” US ambassador to China David Perdue said in a TV interview on Thursday.
Trump “has said very clearly, we are not changing the ‘one China' policy, we are going to adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act, the three communiques and the ‘six assurances' that were done under [former US president Ronald] Reagan,” Perdue told Joe Kernen, cohost of CNBC's Squawk Box.
The act, the Three Joint Communiques and the “six assurances” are guidelines for Washington

Elvis Nghobo tried to get into four different professional schools in Cameroon, but could not make it. Frustrated, the 34-year-old turned to selling food at a market in Yaounde, the country's seat of power.

Nghobo blames his woes on what he calls a corrupt education system that favors children of the elite.

As the central African country prepares for Sunday's presidential election, he said he would not be heading out to vote.

He called the results a foregone conclusion for 92-year-old Paul Biya, the world's oldest president, who has ruled for Nghobo's entire life.

“He is already too old to govern, and it's boring knowing only him as president,” Nghobo said.

The sentiment is shared by millions of the country's young population, whose median age is 18, in perhaps the most dramatic example of tension between Africa's youth and the continent's many aging leaders.

Biya is seeking an eighth term in office in a single-round presidential election in which 8.2 million Cameroonians are registered to vote.

He first became president in 1982 following the resignation of his predecessor, Ahmadou Ahidjo, and has ruled since then. He was declared the winner of seven subsequent elections. Cameroon has seen just two leaders since independence in 1960.

“In the face of increasingly difficult international environment, the challenges facing us are more and more pressing,” Biya said in announcing another run. “In such a situation, I cannot shirk my mission.”

The country's youth are hungry for jobs. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5 percent, but 57 percent of the labor force aged 18 to 35 works in informal employment, World Bank data showed.

Despite Cameroon being an oil-producing country that is experiencing modest economic growth, young people say the benefits have not trickled down beyond the elites.

The country also faces escalating security crises. In the western region, a secession fight has long brewed mainly among English-speaking citizens who claim they are marginalized by the French-speaking majority. In the north, the Boko Haram insurgency spills over from neighboring Nigeria, with armed groups routinely attacking border towns.

Biya in this election is challenged by nine opposition candidates, including some former allies and appointees. They include Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who until recently served as the minister of employment, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was minister for tourism.

Another candidate who ran against Biya in 2018 and came second with 14 percent of votes, Maurice Kamto, was barred from contesting in this election.

The electoral commission said it disqualified Kamto because his party was also sponsoring another candidate, a claim Kamto's lawyers rejected.

Kamto was arrested after the previous election for demanding fairness.

“The key opposition candidates are former ministers in Paul Biya's government who just resigned a few weeks to the presidential elections. The youths see double standards in that kind of sudden twist of demeanor, pointing to the grim fact that ‘belly politics' is the order of the day,” University of Dschang law professor Wilson Tamfuh said.

He referred to a tactic of “opposition” by those who seek to dilute support for real opposition candidates in return for the president's favor.

Analysts say Cameroon's elites are unwilling to disrupt the political order after decades of Biya's rule.

“It is no question that [Biya] is widely unpopular in the country, but he definitely has the support of a lot of the elites and customary rulers through corruption and a money network. That sort of plays a big role in making sure he wins,” Oxford Analytica Africa analyst Nat Powell said.

The government has rejected such allegations in the past.

The ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement controls the legislature with 94 of 100 seats at the senate and 152 of 180 at the national assembly.

Biya's health has routinely been a topic of speculation as he spends most of his time in Europe, leaving governance to key party officials and family members.

“Part of it is he wants to be president ‘til he dies, but part of it is also entourage and the ruling party,” Powell said. “The party wants to keep him there because he is the stabilizing force, because as long as he lives, that keeps everything together.”

At the University of Yaounde I, Manoung Wilfried, a 27-year-old geoscience student, sat near a staircase, looking pensive.

He said he would vote in the election, but none of the candidates has convinced him, and he decried Biya's participation.

Wilfried cited patriotism as his only motivation for voting.

“For the good of the country, he should hand over the country's leadership to someone else who can better understand and solve the problems faced by the youths,” he said of Biya.

Like many young people, Nghobo has lost faith in the electoral system that he believes is designed to keep Biya in power.

“Power change in this country can come through other means, but not through the ballot box,” he said.


READINESS: 
                                        According to a survey of 2,000 people, 86 percent of Swedes believe the country is worth defending in the event of a military attack                                        Swedes are stocking up on food items in case of war, as more conflict in Europe no longer feels like a distant possibility, and authorities encourage measures to boost readiness. 
At a civil preparedness fair in southwest Stockholm, 71-year-old Sirkka Petrykowska said that she is taking the prospect of hostilities seriously and preparing as much as she can. 
“I have bought a camping stove. I have taken a course on preservation in an old-fashioned way, where you can preserve vegetables, meat and fruit that lasts for 30 years without a refrigerator,” Petrykowska said. 
“I've set aside blankets for warmth, I                                    


FRUSTRATIONS:

The bank highlighted a persistent gap between younger and more experienced workers across several Asian economies in a regional economic update released yesterday, noting that one in seven young people in China and Indonesia are unemployed.
The share of people now vulnerable to falling into poverty is now larger than the middle class in most countries, it said.

Germany's competition watchdog has announced an investigation of Chinese discount online retail site temu.com, suspecting it of influencing retailers' prices. The site is the fastest-growing of its kind in the world.

Germany's Federal Cartel Office on Wednesday announced an investigation into Chinese e-commerce giant Temu, saying it wanted to examine conditions for traders and the company's treatment of the suppliers it relies upon to sell products. 

""Each month more than 100 million users from European marketplaces visit temu.com,"" Andreas Mundt, the president of the competition watchdog, said in a statement. 

""For almost a year now the trading platform for German suppliers is also open. We are pursuing the suspicion that Temu could be setting unacceptable conditions for pricing for traders on the German marketplace,"" Mundt said. ""Such actions could pose dramatic threats to competition and ultimately lead to price increases in other sales channels as a result.""

The investigation formally targets EU-wide parent company Whaleco Technology Limited (Temu) based in Dublin in notoriously corporation-tax-friendly EU member the Republic of Ireland.

Temu has an estimated 19.3 million active users in Germany, the equivalent of well over one quarter of the adult population.

Reliable figures for Temu's turnover or trade volume are not available, but experts concur that its revenues spiked sharply in 2024 amid its expansion in Europe and the Americas. Estimates for annual turnover range between roughly $30 billion and $70 billion, either doubling or quadroupling 2023's figure.

Temu also faced criticism from a European Commission investigation in July this year. It accused the company of violating EU laws by not doing enough to tackle the sale of illegal products on its platform.

Trump bragged about his administration seeking to ban flag burning, which is protected speech.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

President Donald Trump bragged that his administration “took the freedom of speech away” from protesters who burn the American flag during a rant against anti-fascists on Wednesday.

While speaking about “antifa-inspired terror” in a meeting on the anti-fascist movement, Trump touted his recent executive order instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi to find ways to prosecute people who burn the American flag.

“We've made it a one year penalty for inciting riots,” he said. “We took the freedom of speech away.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“Because that's been through the courts, and the courts said you have freedom of speech,” he went on, in a serious tone. “But what has happened is when they burn a flag, it agitates and irritates crowds — I've never seen anything like it on both sides — and you end up with riots. So we're going on that basis.”

Trump appeared to be referring to his August 25 executive order arguing against the decades-old precedent set by the Supreme Court designating flag burning as protected speech. 

The order claims that the Court didn't say flag burning was protected if it was “conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action.” In essence, the administration is seeking to redefine an act of constitutionally protected free speech as “incitement to violence,” which does not traditionally enjoy First Amendment cover. Experts have said that this argument is baseless and an extremist effort to undermine First Amendment rights.

Despite Trump's remarks on Wednesday, the executive order doesn't include anything about imprisoning people who burn American flags. Nonetheless, the president's comment sparked disbelief as a remarkable moment of Trump “saying the quiet part loud.”

Indeed, Trump has spent his second term rapidly accelerating the erosion of free speech rights. 

Trump has imprisoned numerous activists for Palestinian rights and is still trying to deport one of them, Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil. Last month, he designated “Antifa” — a movement frequently vilified by the right as a malicious organized group — as a “terrorist threat,” seemingly casting a wide net for going after those on the left. He has also sicced the National Guard and other federal agents on protesters against his administration's violent immigration raids across the country.

Trump has not been shy about his goal of punishing and silencing his political enemies. His administration has levied an all-encompassing effort to defund, deplatform, or realign his critics in the media — an effort that many outlets and owners have eagerly complied with. Other institutions like universities have followed suit.

Attorneys general from 20 states have stepped into the dispute between Oregon officials and the Trump administration over the use of National Guard troops to defend Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who have come under assault from protesters in Portland.

Led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, Brenna Bird of Iowa, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, and South Carolina's Alan Wilson, the attorneys general filed an emergency appeal amicus brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 8, charging that Portland police failed to protect ICE agents from “violent rioters,” and that “President [Donald] Trump's deployment of a small number of National Guard members to defend against this lawlessness is responsible, constitutional and authorized by statute.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 A Conversation With Dara Massicot

Ever since Russia started its war in Ukraine, assessments of its military power have vacillated wildly. First, Russian forces were supposed to overrun Ukraine and crush any resistance in a matter of days. Then, they were thought to be so weak that a Ukrainian counteroffensive or a new capability might cause them to collapse altogether. Now, with the war in its fourth year, and Donald Trump's return to office bringing uncertainty about Western support, it has started to seem once again that time might be on Moscow's side.

Dara Massicot argues in Foreign Affairs that none of these images reflects reality. Since the invasion began, Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has been analyzing the state of Russia's military—its failure and its surprising resilience. But what has struck Massicot more recently, and what she thinks many observers are missing, is the extent to which Russia has managed to learn and adapt—in Ukraine and beyond. She warns in a new piece for Foreign Affairs that “the Russian military will emerge from its invasion with extensive experience and a distinct vision of the future of combat”—experience it is already sharing with China, Iran, and North Korea.

The United States and Europe should pay close attention. Because if they do not take it upon themselves to “study Russia's studying,” as Massicot puts it, she worries that they risk not just losing Ukraine but also falling behind in the next global crisis.

            At the start of the government shutdown last week, it was Democrats who looked like they wouldn't be united. Right off the bat, they lost the votes of three members of their Senate caucus. They had folded just before the last shutdown, and it was an inauspicious start to this one.
    


            A lot can change in a week.
    


            Yes, those three members continue to vote with Republicans. But otherwise, it's largely Republicans who are springing leaks in their shutdown strategy.
    


            Repeatedly in recent days, GOP members have stepped forward and undermined their side's negotiating posture on key issues.
    


            These voices are largely coming from the House, which has already passed a Republican-led short-term funding bill, whereas the Senate is where the action is right now. But their comments run counter to the party's messaging as Senate Republicans still need several more Democrats to sign onto the package.
    


            Most prominent among them is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who seems to be basking in sticking it to her party leaders right now. Starting with her comments Monday signaling her support for Democrats' policy demand – an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits – the Georgia congresswoman has unleashed a torrent of unhelpful comments for GOP leaders.
    


            While GOP leaders have said they'll negotiate on Obamacare after Democrats vote to reopen the government, Greene has basically argued: Why wait?
    


            She's also suggested GOP leaders haven't approached that important Obamacare issue with any particular urgency, despite the potential for huge increases in premiums for her constituents and even her adult children.
    


            “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene posted on X on Monday. (House Speaker Mike Johnson said Greene simply wasn't familiar with the work leaders are doing on these issues.)
    


            While GOP leaders blame Democrats for demanding something extra as part of a shutdown deal – which is almost always a losing proposition – Greene said she's “actually putting the blame on the speaker and Leader [John] Thune in the Senate. This should not be happening.”
    


            And on Thursday, she played into another major Democratic argument – that Johnson isn't seating Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who was elected more than two weeks ago, because he doesn't want her to be the decisive 218th signature on the discharge petition to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. (Greene is one of four Republicans who has signed the petition.)
    


            “I can't conclusively say if that's why the House isn't in session,” Greene said. She added: “But the House should be in session. There is a new Democrat that's been elected that does deserve to be sworn in. … If it's to avoid the discharge petition, why drag this out? That's going to have 218 signatures.”
    


            Johnson has said Grijalva hasn't been seated because the House is on recess. But as CNN's Manu Raju has noted, the House swore in two special-election-winning Florida Republicans earlier this year during what's known as a “pro forma” session.
    


            Greene isn't the only one bucking leadership and calling for the House to return to Washington.
    


            Johnson has said it's not necessary because the chamber already passed a clean seven-week continuing resolution that Senate leaders are demanding Democrats support. But some have stepped forward to say the House should be working.
    


            Rep. Kevin Kiley of California responded to Johnson's comments by saying the House should be working to pass a full budget.
    


            “The Speaker shouldn't even think about cancelling session for a third straight week,” Kiley said on X.
    


            And Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia has called on Johnson to bring back members of Congress to pass legislation ensuring the military members get their paychecks before those paychecks are missed next week.
    


            “Military pay should not be held hostage due to Washington's dysfunction!” Kiggans posted on X.
    


            Johnson has rejected this, again pointing out Senate Democrats could ensure those paychecks if they pass the continuing resolution. It's clear he'd like to use that as leverage. But Kiggans is suggesting it shouldn't be used as such. And her legislation has been co-sponsored by more than 100 House Republicans.
    


            Greene, too, said Thursday on CNN that leadership shouldn't “dangle” issues like that as leverage.
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, insist that growing pressures – like the military missing an upcoming paycheck – won't cause them to throw in the towel next week.
    


            GOP senators also continue to push back on another leverage point for GOP leaders and the Trump administration: the threat of government cuts.
    


            Trump said Thursday, “We're only going to cut Democrat programs.” But a number of Republicans have cautioned the administration against that approach or even large cuts, period, warning it would squander the GOP's political advantages.
    


            “There should be no targeting of anyone,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told CNN on Thursday.  “We don't need to unnecessarily target any other areas more than others.”
    


            And then there's a particularly vivid scene on Wednesday that really ties all of this together.
    


            GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York got into a brief confrontation with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the halls of Congress. Lawler's gambit: Asking Jeffries to sign on to a brief, one-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies.
    


            “You're embarrassing yourself right now,” Jeffries told Lawler. “You're chasing clout.”
    


            But there was one main problem with Lawler's gambit: The bill he was asking Jeffries to sign onto doesn't have the support of GOP leadership. Republican leaders haven't supported anything specific when it comes to extending the subsidies. His bill has just more than a dozen GOP co-sponsors, less than 10% of House Republicans.
    


            It was a remarkable scene. While GOP leaders are trying to hold a hard line, Lawler was making a big show of offering a concession they don't even support.
    


            All of it suggests there is some real reluctance about the GOP's firm posture here. Democrats, meanwhile, are projecting more unity, at least at this early juncture.
    


            That could change, especially next week as the military-paycheck deadline looms.
    


            But the more Republicans spring these leaks, it's likely to add to Democrats' resolve.

            As the ninth day of the government shutdown wears on, the focus is on how many air traffic controllers show up to work tonight.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages for controllers dealing with airspace in 11 different places Thursday evening, according to a publicly available planning document.
    


            The control tower at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport will have fewer than normal controllers from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET along with Bradley International Airport in Connecticut from 4:25 p.m to 8:45 p.m. ET and Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport in Virginia, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
    


            Two different parts of the airspace controlled by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center will be short-staffed from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and two parts of the Albuquerque center will be short staffed between 7:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. ET. The Washington center, located in Virginia will not have a normal number of staff from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and the Indianapolis center will be short staffed 12:30 a.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET. These areas usually deal with planes flying at higher altitudes.
    


            Newark Approach control, which handles flights approaching or departing the airport, will be short staffed from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET. Delays of nearly 90 minutes are expected. And Orlando International Airport Approach will be understaffed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
    


            Earlier Thursday, a facility in Fort Worth, Texas was also short-staffed for about an hour.
    


            The cause of the staffing problems was not immediately apparent, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said early Thursday on Fox Business a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work.
    


            Every staffing problem reported does not always cause delays since controllers can take other actions, like routing flights to airspace with a normal complement of controllers.
    


            Wednesday six FAA facilities had staffing shortages, including the control towers at Denver International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where about a quarter of the flights were delayed.
    


            “It's a small fraction of people who don't come to work that can create this massive disruption, and that's what you're seeing rippling through our skies today,” Duffy said.
    


            He said normally about 5% of delays are caused by short staffing, but now it's more than half of the delays.
    


            “I think what's happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,” Duffy said, blaming Democrats in Washington for the shutdown.
    


            Monday night, the Hollywood Burbank Airport control tower closed when too many controllers there called out sick. Tuesday, flights in Nashville were delayed and part of the air traffic control operations had to be shifted to another facility across the state when workers took unscheduled time off.
    


            If controllers keep not showing up, Duffy will fire them, he said.
    


            “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don't show up to work… they're the problem children,” he said. “We need more controllers, but we need the best and the brightest, the dedicated controllers, and if we have some on our staff that aren't dedicated like we need, we're going to let them go.”
    


            Controllers are considered essential employees and have to work during the government shutdown, despite not being paid.
    


            It is against the law for controllers to strike or take actions like sickouts, and the air traffic controllers' union has urged members to keep working during the shutdown.
    


            “There are processes and procedures in place to deal with the inappropriate use of sick leave,” the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said responding to Duffy's threats.
    


            Tuesday is the next payday, and controllers will only get a partial check for hours worked before the shutdown.
    


            The government shutdown has not had a “significant impact” on Delta Air Lines' operations, CEO Ed Bastian told Brad Smith in an interview on “CNN Headline Express.”
    


            There were barely any flight cancellations the first week of October, with Delta completing nearly 100% of its flight schedule, Bastian said. Delays were also infrequent, with the airline running on time for 90% of flights.
    


            “As everyone's well aware, the air traffic control system is already understaffed, so I think it's difficult to speculate at this point in time, ‘is it more understaffed than normal?'” Bastian said. “We'll keep our customers posted as always, but I do not anticipate any meaningful issues here.”
    


            Southwest Airlines, which has a large operation in Nashville, Burbank and several of the other cities hard hit by recent staffing problems, said it is monitoring the situation.
    


            Southwest must remain “vigilant in ensuring operational reliability” as air traffic controller staffing is “dynamic and could change rapidly at any ATC facility,” airline leaders wrote Wednesday in a company-wide memo obtained by CNN.
    


            “To date, while we've experienced a few manageable delays and cancellations related to the shortages,” it said. “We'll continue to adjust our schedule, as needed and under the direction of the FAA, to help maintain the safety of our customers and employees.”
    


            United Airlines and American Airlines declined to comment, directing CNN to the industry group Airlines for America.
    


            “When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation's aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group said. “Aviation is the safest mode of transportation, but to maintain that the system may need to slow down.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and that the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

One of the officials said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza.

The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza.




A second official said the troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center.

Two other senior U.S. officials who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations offered more details about forces from other countries and what U.S. troops would be doing.

Members of the armed forces of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are expected to be embedded with the team of 200 U.S. troops, according to one of the officials. The American service members will integrate the multinational force and coordinate with Israeli defense forces, the official said.

The exact location of where U.S. troops will be positioned is something they will be working to determine Friday, the other official said.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, highlighted Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command, during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday, saying he had worked alongside special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“Cooper — I hear he's been fantastic,” Trump said.

Cooper joined the U.S. side of the talks in Egypt this week, according to one of the U.S. officials, and he helped reassure the Arab countries at the negotiating table that the U.S. would put a strong guarantee behind its commitments — a reassurance the Arab countries then passed along to Hamas.

In a show of readiness, Cooper told them he could have a command post up and running in the next two and a half weeks.

A breakthrough deal to pause the war in Gaza was reached Wednesday after the United States and mediators in the region pressured both Israel and Hamas to end the fighting that has devastated the Gaza Strip, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, sparked other conflicts and isolated Israel.

That push sealed an agreement on a first phase that would free the remaining living Israeli hostages within days in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio leaves the federal courthouse in Phoenix, July 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Angie Wang, File)

PHOENIX (AP) — The sheriff's office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert's report.

The report released Wednesday criticized the use of compliance money by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office to fund personnel costs and tasks, either in part or in full, that aren't connected to the overhaul.

It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8 million for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court's orders; $1.5 million in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3 million to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location.

For over a decade, Maricopa County taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then-Sheriff Arpaio's traffic patrols targeting immigrants.

The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency's traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.

The county says $323 million has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff's department's progress and the agency's compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352 million by July 2026.




The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff's office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case's monitor.

The report concluded 72% of the $226 million in spending by the sheriff's office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or “improperly prorated” to a compliance fund.

Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.”

Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff's office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.

Sheriff Jerry Sheridan's office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.

Raul Piña, a longtime member of a community advisory board created to help improve trust in the sheriff's office, said the report opens up a broader conversation about the integrity of the sheriff's office.

“You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said.

Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn't still be under the court's supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn't still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30 million to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.

The report criticized Maricopa County and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.

Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county's governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board's legal counsel is reviewing the report. “The board has confidence in MCSO's budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said.

Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff's office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency's also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn't yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.

New York Attorney General Letitia James decries mortgage fraud indictment pushed by the Trump administration as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday on mortgage fraud charges in a case that President Donald Trump urged his Justice Department to bring after he vowed retribution on his biggest political enemies.

James, a Democrat who infuriated Trump after his first term with a lawsuit alleging that he built his business empire on lies about his wealth, was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.

The top federal prosecutor for eastern Virginia, a former Trump aide, personally presented the case to the grand jury weeks after she was thrust into the role amid the administration's pressure to deliver charges.

The indictment, two weeks after a separate criminal case charging former FBI Director James Comey with lying to Congress, is the latest indication of the Trump administration's norm-busting determination to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to pursue the president's political foes and public figures who once investigated him.

In a lengthy statement, James decried the indictment as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

“These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties,” she added.

Both the Comey and James cases followed a strikingly unconventional path toward indictment. The Trump administration last month pushed out Erik Siebert, the veteran prosecutor who had overseen both investigations for months and had resisted pressure to file charges, and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who has worked as lawyer for Trump but has never previously served as a federal prosecutor.

Halligan presented the James case to the grand jury herself, as she did in the case against Comey, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

James called the decision to fire Siebert and replace him with a prosecutor who is “blindly loyal” to the president as “antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country,” and she said she stood by her investigation of Trump and his company as having been “based on the facts and evidence — not politics.”

Abbe Lowell, James' lawyer and a prominent attorney representing multiple Trump targets, said James “flatly and forcefully denies these charges.” James is scheduled to make an initial appearance in the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Oct. 24. 

“We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,” Lowell said in a statement. “When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone — when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted -- it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law.”

James, 66, has been New York's attorney general since 2019 after becoming the first Black woman to be elected to statewide office. She cruised to reelection in 2022 after abandoning a short-lived run for governor.

The indictment pertains to James' purchase of a modest house in Norfolk, where she has family. During the sale, she signed a standard document called a “second home rider” in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her “personal use and enjoyment for at least one year,” unless the lender agreed otherwise.

Rather than using the home as a second residence, the indictment alleges, James rented it out to a family of three. According to the indictment, the misrepresentation allowed James to obtain favorable loan terms not available for investment properties.

In a post on X shortly after the indictment was handed up, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “One tier of justice for all Americans.”

“No one is above the law,” Halligan, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. “The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.” 

Trump has been advocating charging James for months, posting on social media without citing any evidence that she's “guilty as hell” and telling reporters at the White House, “It looks to me like she's really guilty of something, but I really don't know.”

The Justice Department has also been investigating mortgage-related allegations against Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, using the probe to demand her ouster, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., whose lawyer called the allegations against him “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.”

But James is a particularly personal target. As attorney general, she sued the Republican president and his administration dozens of times. Last year, she won a staggering judgment against Trump and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements.

An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. 

The indictment comes a day after Comey made his first court appearance in his case, accusing him of lying to Congress in 2020. Comey's lawyer told the judge that the defense plans to push to have the case dismissed ahead of trial, arguing that it is a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the president.

The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war.

President Donald Trump praised the “momentous” Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the “complicated” hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. Speaking during his Cabinet meeting, the president said he may travel to Egypt for the signing ceremony.

Video released by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum showed hostage relatives, with Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick speaking on the phone with Pres. Donald Trump. This after Trump announced Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan.

U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready to be moved in to Gaza when they are given a green light.

Trump said Wednesday in announcing the outlines of the biggest breakthrough in months in the two-year-old war that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners.

US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war. Families of hostages and their supporters rejoiced as news spread that a deal had been struck to free Israeli captives held in Gaza.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of gridlock, the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza came together in a matter of days after a deft maneuver — or perhaps a misunderstanding — by President Donald Trump that boxed in the two adversaries.

Either way, efforts to wind down the devastating war unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel have seen a breakthrough, and the last 48 hostages — about 20 of them believed to be alive — are set to be returned under the agreement announced Wednesday.



Hamas saw hostages more as a liability than asset over time, providing an opening for the deal, according to two senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.

One of the officials added that negotiators, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had detected that “Hamas had enough.”

Major questions remain, including over governance and reconstruction of a territory that largely has been destroyed as well as whether Hamas will disarm — a key Israeli demand that the militants have not yet publicly accepted.

But it appears for now as though the fighting will pause, because at a critical moment last week, Trump took Hamas' very conditional response to his proposal as a yes.

In early September, long-running ceasefire talks mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar were at a standstill. 




Trump's Mideast envoy had walked away weeks earlier, blaming Hamas. The militant group then accepted a proposal that mediators said was almost identical to one approved by Israel, but there was no public response from Israel or the U.S.

Hamas stuck to its position that it would only release the remaining hostages in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those terms, saying the war would only end with Hamas' surrender and the return of all the captives, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control over Gaza.

On Sept. 9, explosions rocked Doha and smoke rose over the steel and glass skyline of Qatar's capital.

Israel had carried out an airstrike on Hamas leaders and negotiators as they had gathered to consider the latest ceasefire proposal in Qatar, a close U.S. ally and mediator. The strike killed five lower-ranking Hamas members and a Qatari security forces member.

It infuriated Gulf Arab leaders and angered the White House. Trump quickly went into damage control, seeking to reassure Qatar.

The strike alarmed U.S. allies across the region, including countries like Turkey and Egypt that have hosted Hamas political leaders. The war that Trump had pledged to end was at risk of spiraling across the Middle East once again.

The strike united Gulf Cooperation Council countries in a way not seen since the bloc's 1981 inception as a counterweight to post-revolutionary Iran.

It caused the seven GCC members, which include Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to rethink what had been relatively moderate stances on Israel and led some to believe Israel was now a bigger threat to regional security and stability than Iran, according to Arab diplomats familiar with conversations at the bloc's last summit in Doha. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Such a shift could have had profound implications for the Trump administration's anti-Iran push, which relies heavily on being able to respond from two major U.S. military bases in Bahrain and Qatar. And it might have doomed the signature diplomatic achievement of Trump's first term: the Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel.

Two weeks after the Doha strike, Trump met with the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim nations on the sidelines of an annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations that highlighted Israel's growing isolation. The president said it was his “most important meeting.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that efforts “took a turn” at that meeting, with the U.S. building a coalition behind Trump's plan.

Trump unveiled his 20-point peace plan less than a week later — during Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House this year. Trump also made a show of trying to soothe angry Qatari officials.

Trump dialed up Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and spoke to him before handing the phone to Netanyahu. The prime minister read from a written apology, expressing his regret for Israel violating Qatari sovereignty with the strike.

The White House later published photos of a grim-faced Trump with the phone awkwardly perched in his lap.

In a press conference in Washington after the Sept. 29 meeting, Netanyahu said he had accepted Trump's plan.

Rubio said Trump's negotiators then stepped up their efforts through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt to get Hamas on board, while Trump held phone calls and meetings with world leaders.

The U.S. plan calls for Hamas to release all the remaining hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, to give up power in Gaza and to disarm.

The plan essentially demanded Hamas' surrender. Trump said the militant group had days to think it over and issued a stark warning.

“If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote on social media last week. “THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”

Hours later, and ahead of schedule, Hamas submitted its response.

Hamas reiterated its willingness to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and to give up power to other Palestinians. But it said other elements of Trump's plan required more negotiation and offered nothing about disarming, a key Israeli demand.

The response was clearly a “yes, but.”

The U.S. and Israel could have taken it as a “no” and blamed Hamas for the failure to reach a ceasefire on Israel's terms, as they had in the past. Israel could have vowed to press ahead with its invasion of Gaza City or even expand it.

But when the Hamas response landed late Friday, Israel was largely shut down for the Sabbath, and Trump was first to respond.

“Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

U.S. officials declined to comment on Trump's thinking. If he misread Hamas' response, no one was in any mood to correct him — neither Hamas, which had sidestepped his ultimatum, nor Netanyahu, who would not want to be seen as spoiling the president's deal.

In a brief statement later that night, Netanyahu said Israel was preparing for the implementation of the “first stage” of Trump's plan — the release of hostages — and was still committed to ending the war according to its own principles.

It made no mention of the fact that Hamas had not accepted some key demands.

There was room to negotiate, and a desperation on the part of the international community, key Arab players — and likely Trump himself — to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and destabilized the region.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Thursday that he and many other Israeli officials were skeptical about Hamas' heavily qualified acceptance. But he said Trump's decision to frame it as a sign of momentum proved to be a “brilliant” move.

Trump “not only seized an opportunity but created an opportunity by saying, ‘Well, it's positive, and let's move from there.' And eventually it worked,” Saar told Fox News.

In an interview with Fox News host and ally Sean Hannity after announcing the agreement, the president said he hoped it would help repair Israel's international standing.

“I spoke to Bibi Netanyahu just a little while ago,” Trump told Hannity, using the Israeli prime minister's nickname. “I said, ‘Israel cannot fight the world, Bibi.' They can't fight the world. And he understands that very well.”

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association, said Thursday that he opposes sending National Guard troops across state borders without the permission of the state receiving them.

The position from a sitting Republican official posed a rare rebuke of President Donald Trump's push to send National Guard troops to cities in states where Democrats are in charge, including Chicago where Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker are fighting in court to try to halt the deployment of Texas Guard members.

The administration is also trying to send California troops into Portland, Oregon.

Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, said he supports Trump's effort to help impose law and order in some cities and to aid federal agents removing immigrants who have committed crimes, but that National Guard troops from one state should not be deployed to another over the objection of the receiving state's governor.

“When it's governors working together, it's a very different story, but this whole situation where one state's governor is sending their national Guard troops over the objections of another state's governor, that sets a very dangerous precedent,” Cave said.

Speaking to The New York Times on Thursday, Stitt said “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

Stitt drew one key distinction: While he opposes sending groups across state lines where they're not welcomed by the governors, he said that Trump should have federalized National Guard from Illinois instead to protect federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. That's the approach Trump took over the summer went he sent National Guard to Los Angeles during protests there.




The National Governors Association, a bipartisan group, has experienced turmoil, with Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatening to leave the organization because of its silence over the troop deployments. The organization has still not taken a stance.

Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said on Thursday he was “incredibly disappointed” that the NGA hadn't taken a more forceful stand in opposition to the Trump administration's deployments.

“In the past, it has always stood up for the powers and the rights of governors,” Beshear said during a news conference in Frankfort, Kentucky. “And right now, it's doing nothing as a president is trying to send National Guard into states over the objection of the governors and doing so unlawfully.”

He also gave a blistering critique of the Trump administration's decision to deploy troops into cities over local opposition.

“We don't militarize our communities,” Beshear said. “It's one of the tenets of our very founding. What Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are doing is wrong. It is un-American.”

Stitt's position puts him at odds with the state's Republican Attorney General and officials in most other Republican-controlled states.

Oklahoma's Gentner Drummond was among 20 Republican attorneys general who filed a brief Wednesday supporting Trump's administration in its legal battle to allow him to deploy Oregon and California National Guard troops in Portland.

In the filing, they say the president needs to be able to federalize National Guard and send troops to Oregon so that federal immigration resources are not diverted there. “Otherwise, states will continue to bear the costs of nonenforcement of federal immigration laws,” they said.

Most Republican-controlled state including Oklahoma, have also requested permission to file similar papers in the Illinois court case.

The Democratic attorneys general or governors of 24 states also filed jointly Wednesday to side with California and Oregon.

There's a similar partisan split over the use of troops in Washington, D.C.

A former Minnesota high school girls softball player opened up about losing to a transgender pitcher in a state tournament and how the declining safety of the state has caused her and her family fear.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison responded to dozens of school board members who are urging the state to keep biological males out of girls sports by saying the issue ""doesn't harm anyone.""

A letter penned by more than 40 school board members expressing support for policy revisions to enforce Title IX and protect girls sports prompted the response from Ellison this week. 

""Letting the very small number of transgender students in Minnesota play on their school sports teams doesn't harm anyone, but segregating them does,"" part of Ellison's statement read.

Ellison said this despite the fact that multiple girls high school athletes in his state have spoken out about how the experience of facing trans athletes has impacted them, and some have even filed a lawsuit over the issue. 

Three anonymous Minnesota high school girls filed a lawsuit against the state's education agencies in the spring after having to compete against a transgender softball pitcher. 

One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans pitcher.

""This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. It's simply unfair, and I hate that nothing is happening to change that. Boys should not be able to take girls' spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. I hope that more girls affected by this issue will stand up against this."" the player said. 

Another anonymous player directly called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females.

""It's really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn't taking rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong,"" one anonymous player previously told Fox News Digital. 

Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears.

""How do you acknowledge that you lost to a biological male? How do you process those events that happened? And that was something that entire night, I still couldn't do it. … We lost to a biological male in a female state tournament,"" Kotzmacher said. 

Minnesota's education agencies face a deadline Friday from the U.S. Department of Education to change their trans athlete policies. President Donald Trump signed the ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order in February, but Minnesota was one of the first states to openly defy the order.

Ellison then filed a lawsuit against Trump and the Department of Justice over the executive order and appears staunchly opposed to complying with the DOE's Friday deadline.

""Exclusion is a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which has protected the rights of trans kids to participate in all extracurricular activities for decades,"" Ellison's statement continued. 

""I too am concerned about the Trump Administration's threats to cut education funding for kids across Minnesota, but this matter is before the court right now. The federal government's threats violate the U.S. Constitution, Minnesota law, and Title IX itself. I'm fighting to prevent these harmful cuts, stop the Administration's bullying of transgender kids who just want to live their lives in peace, and protect the rights and freedoms of all our students in Minnesota.""

Fox News host Laura Ingraham discusses Illinois suing the Trump administration over its deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on 'The Story.'

Lawyers for President Donald Trump and the state of Oregon clashed Thursday before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals over Trump's push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, a high-stakes showdown marked by sharp accusations that the president's actions were unlawful and unnecessary.

A three-judge panel, composed of two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee, seemed deeply skeptical of the case made by Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin, including her assertion that Trump's descriptions of the violence in Portland were hyperbolic and ""untethered from reality.""

Judges sharply questioned Chaffin about the specifics of the protests in Portland. Many of them focused on specifics, including dates of protests and number of arrests, in asking why — in the state's view — these conditions failed to meet the standard needed to justify Trump's deployment of the National Guard.

""I'm not sure even President Lincoln would have been able to authorize the use of force right now"" if his actions were to be scrutinized under the ""much more stringent reviewability standard"" implied by Oregon here, Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee, interjected loudly, one of several times he cut off Chaffin as she attempted to answer the court's questions.

Chaffin argued that the protests in Portland are a far cry from a definition of a ""rebellion,"" one of two conditions Trump needs to satisfy to meet the legal pretext for National Guard deployment. 

The 9th Circuit Court agreed to take up the Trump administration's request to hear the case just days after a federal judge in Oregon issued a temporary restraining order halting the president from immediately sending Oregon National Guard troops to the city of Portland, describing the action as one that risks ""blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.""

Rebellions ""are unusual and extreme emergencies,"" Chaffin said, noting that the bulk of agents' complaints on record are focused instead on them being short-staffed. Administrative difficulties ""are not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other U.S. city,"" Chaffin added.

Still, the court's two Trump appointees took a much more critical view of the state's case during oral arguments, which lasted roughly 90 minutes.

BONDI CLASHES WITH DURBIN ON NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT: 'LOVE CHICAGO AS MUCH AS YOU HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP'

Justice Department attorney Eric D. McArthur, meanwhile, spent the bulk of time reiterating the two tenets of the Trump administration's core arguments in deploying National Guard troops. The first is that there is a threat of ""rebellion"" underway, and the second is that the federal government cannot carry out the law without the help of the National Guard.

McArthur argued that Portland meets the criteria of an ""active threat,"" regardless of the weeks that passed between Trump's June memo authorizing the federalization of National Guard troops and his September attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

Asked by the Clinton-appointed Judge Susan Graber whether Trump could hypothetically rely on any violent event that ""post-dates"" the administration's National Guard mobilization to justify its deployment, McArthur said yes.

""I think we can rely on later evidence to show there was a colorable factual basis for the president's determination,"" he told judges for the 9th Circuit.

""It demonstrates the very kind of risk that can materialize at any time with this sort of violent crowd.""

The court did not specify when it planned to issue a ruling. In the meantime, dozens of National Guard troops — roughly 200, as lawyers testified Thursday — remain just outside the city's limits, pending possible deployment.

The case is just one of several challenging Trump's authority to federalize the National Guard over the objections of state and local leaders.

Journalist and author Alex Berenson explains the dangers of cannabis as celebrity athletes call on President Donald Trump to reform marijuana laws. 

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday signed an executive order banning THC-containing beverages, gummies and other ""intoxicating hemp.""

Retailers in the Buckeye State will be required to remove all gummies, beverages, cookies and other products containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) — the main psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant — from shelves by Oct. 14.

""Intoxicating hemp products are known to have significant impacts on young, developing brains, yet these products are legally marketed to kids, sold to kids and ingested by kids in Ohio,"" DeWine stated in a press release.

Exposure during adolescence, while the brain is still developing, has been linked to poorer learning, memory and attention problems, as well as changes in brain development, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

Intoxicating hemp is made by manipulating compounds found in hemp plants to create toxic compounds like delta-8-THC and delta-9-THC.

Exposures to these compounds among those aged 19 and younger increased to 994 from 419 between 2021 and 2024, according to Ohio Poison Control (OPC).

Among children 5 and under, the number of exposures nearly tripled between 2021 and 2024, going from 202 to 555.

About 90% of children 12 and under who were exposed to THC ended up in the emergency room, with two-thirds requiring hospitalization, per the OPC.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital that the problem stems from lack of regulation of cannabis products.

""This ban is temporary but appropriate given the dangers.""

""The 2018 Farm Bill opens up a Pandora's box, where hemp products are used to justify unregulated use of THC gummies, drinks and intoxicating hemp products,"" he added.

The 2018 Farm Bill, or the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, legalized industrial hemp at the federal level.

""This ban is temporary but appropriate given the dangers,"" Siegel said.

DeWine noted that when Ohioans voted to legalize marijuana, they only voted for licensing dispensaries to sell products to those 21 or older.

""Intoxicating hemp completely bypasses these laws, and we must do more to keep these products away from kids,"" the governor said.

Any THC-containing products must be returned to the manufacturer or handed over to law enforcement, the order states.

Retailers who break the order could face a $500 fine per day if the products are still offered for sale, and the Ohio Department of Agriculture will have the authority to confiscate any of the products.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott slammed Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for opposing the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Chicago.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott mocked Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, calling him a ""joke"" for opposing his deployment of Texas National Guard troops to provide security over immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Abbott said, ""Gov. Pritzker is a joke"" and is in ""violation of his oath of office"" by attempting to interfere with federal law enforcement efforts to improve safety in Chicago and other Illinois communities.

Texas National Guard troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday, tasked with protecting federal personnel and property amid anti-immigration protests, the Pentagon confirmed. A Pentagon official said 200 guardsmen were mobilized for an initial 60-day period.

Pritzker, a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and fierce critic of President Donald Trump, has condemned the National Guard deployment, calling it ""Trump's invasion"" and calling on Abbott to withdraw his support. He has also threatened to pull out from the National Governors' Association if the bipartisan group does not condemn the deployment.

The state of Illinois, joined by the city of Chicago, also filed a lawsuit in federal court in an attempt to stop the deployment.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Abbott said that Pritzker's actions are in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

""You may recall it wasn't too long ago that he put his left hand on a bible and raised his right hand and swore to God that he would support the Constitution of the United States as opposed to supporting it and allowing federal officials to enforce federal law. He's violating the Constitution, violating the oath that he took by interfering with the ability of federal officials to conduct the executive branch of the federal government,"" said Abbott.

He said that it is ""only natural"" Trump would call on his ""elite National Guard to provide assistance anywhere in the entire country,"" because of Texas soldiers' extensive experience providing security at the southern border.

""Texas has the most proven, the largest, the best-trained National Guard in the United States of America,"" he said. ""Americans will remember we had thousands of our National Guard securing the American border, the largest border state in the entire country, more than 1,200 miles. And it was Texas, as opposed to the federal government under the Biden administration, that had to step up and secure the border.

""Now, because we have a president who is finally enforcing the laws of the United States … it's only natural, by extension, that if there's a need for that elite National Guard to provide assistance anywhere in the entire country, that it would be the National Guard called upon,"" he added.

Though Pritzker has denounced the deployment as an ""invasion,"" Abbott clarified that his soldiers' presence in the state is strictly to provide backup for federal officials who have recently faced intense opposition from agitators in Illinois.

""They provide a very important backup role to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Right now, they are playing a very important backup roll to ensure the safety of federal officials while federal officials enforce federal law in places like Illinois, Oregon and elsewhere,"" he explained. ""There's unrest in areas where ICE is trying to operate and where ICE is trying to enforce the law. And what ICE or other federal officials need, they need safety and security as they go about the process of carrying out their function.

""It is very important that the public understand that these federal officials, they have a requirement to enforce federal law. Anybody who interferes with that is interfering with the ability for federal officials to do their job.

""What the National Guard is trained and skilled at doing is dealing with civil unrest like that,"" said Abbott. ""Whenever the country is in times of need, Texans will step up and help out any way we possibly can.""

Taylor Swift was not exactly subtle in one of her latest songs.

The pop superstar released her 12th studio album, ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" last Friday, and the ninth track, ""Wood,"" turned the heads of just about every listener.

The song included lyrics that just about everybody could assume were about fiancé Travis Kelce's anatomy that ""opened [her] thighs.""

Swift also sings that the ""redwood tree … ain't hard to see"" and said her beau had ""new heights of manhood,"" a play on the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's podcast title with his brother, Jason.

Jason's wife, Kylie, just like about everyone else, gave a listen to her future sister-in-law's album, and she said she is a fan. She even put ""Wood"" in her top three favorite songs on the album.

But she was understandably a little bit uncomfortable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Appeals court judge says no evidence of improper use of National Guard in Portland","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3844732/appeals-court-judge-says-no-evidence-of-improper-use-of-national-guard-in-portland/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:40:13 GMT","

A federal appeals court judge on Thursday cast doubt on Oregon's challenge to President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Portland, saying there was no evidence the deployment was unlawful despite state concerns about presidential overreach.

Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said he was not “trying to diminish” worries that federalizing the Oregon National Guard could set a dangerous precedent. But he added that the record before the court did not show evidence of abuse.

“It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now,” said Nelson, a Trump appointee. “All we have is a document that says, ‘We have a federal facility under attack or that violence has forced it to close down, and we want to protect it.' That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.”

The panel, comprised of two Trump appointees and one appointee of former President Bill Clinton, heard oral arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a lower-court order blocking the Guard's deployment to protect a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that had been shuttered amid months of protests and sporadic violence.

Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur told the panel that the president has broad constitutional authority to safeguard federal property when local authorities fail to maintain order. He acknowledged the government did not dispute the factual findings in the district court's injunction but argued those facts did not justify restraining the president's national defense powers.

Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin countered that the Portland demonstrations did not amount to a “rebellion” or “insurrection” that would justify military intervention, insisting the federalization order exceeded the scope of presidential authority.

Judge Susan P. Graber, a Clinton appointee, pressed McArthur early in the hearing to define what constitutes a “rebellion.” McArthur said it referred to an “organized resistance by force and arms” against the government, while Chaffin said such events must be “unusual and extreme emergencies” that threaten “the existence of the Union.”

Chaffin's arguments drew sharp questioning from both Trump-appointed judges on the panel. 

Nelson called her description of the protests as “largely sedate and generally peaceful” “clearly erroneous,” noting that demonstrations had repeatedly disrupted federal operations. Judge Bridget Bade, an appointee of Trump, added that the ICE facility had been closed for more than three weeks during the height of the unrest — a fact she said was “relevant” to the president's duty to ensure federal law enforcement.

Chaffin replied that those conditions no longer existed and urged the court not to treat events from three months earlier as justification for a standing military order. “There is an expectation in the law that the circumstances are going to be evaluated as they happen,” she said.

The three-judge panel did not indicate when it would rule, though they indicated they would attempt a decision as soon as possible.

Even if the Trump administration prevails, a separate district court order remains in place blocking any National Guard deployment in Portland until at least Oct. 19. That order pertains to a secondary lawsuit joined by the state of California after Trump reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland.

TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PUSH GAINS STEAM THANKS TO STRONG LEGAL FOOTING

A simultaneous hearing related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago happened in the Illinois federal court on Thursday. The state has asked for a temporary block on the use of troops to protect federal agents and facilities in the state, and the judge previously declined to immediately enjoin the use of troops when a lawsuit was filed earlier this week.

U.S. District Judge April Perry, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not indicate when she would make a decision but said she would be back at the bench at 4:30 p.m. local time.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","New York Attorney General Letitia James indicted on bank fraud charge","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3844862/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-on-bank-fraud-charge/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:04:47 GMT","

A federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia has handed down an indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James, bringing one charge of bank fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The investigation into James follows allegations that she misrepresented a Virginia residence as her “principal residence” in 2023 in order to secure favorable mortgage terms while serving as New York's top law enforcement official.

The investigation was prompted, in part, by a referral from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who alleged James “falsified records” to obtain preferential financing.

The indictment of James, a Democrat who has clashed with President Donald Trump in high-profile legal battles, follows months of speculation about whether prosecutors would be willing to bring a charge in response to Pulte's allegations.

James responded to the indictment Thursday evening, saying, “This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

“I am not fearful — I am fearless.”

The single count of bank fraud stems from the same allegations first raised in April, when federal housing regulators accused James of making false statements on mortgage loan applications for a Norfolk, Virginia, property. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Jamar K. Walker, an appointee of former President Joe Biden.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a special attorney to probe the mortgage allegations after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte referred the matter to the Justice Department. At the time, prosecutors expressed skepticism that they had sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.

Trump later appointed Lindsey Halligan, one of his personal attorneys, as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, placing her in charge of the office that is now also handling the recent indictment against former FBI Director James Comey and now the New York attorney general.

“The scheme involved falsely representing the [Virginia] Property as a secondary residence to obtain favorable mortgage terms, while using it as an investment property with no intended or actual personal occupancy or use by her,” the five-page indictment, signed by Halligan, reads. It goes on to say James knew the property was used as an investment property with no intent to use or occupancy by her.

Notably, James sued the Trump Organization in civil court in 2023, alleging that Trump manipulated the value of his assets on paper in order to obtain favorable loans and insurance premiums. In August, a New York appeals court found the nearly $500 million penalty imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron in the civil fraud case was “excessive” and threw it out, though Engoron's underlying verdict that Trump was liable for fraud was allowed to stand. James is appealing that decision. 

In response to targeted acts against him, like the civil fraud case, Trump has repeatedly called for the prosecution of political adversaries, including James Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). “We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote on Truth Social less than a week before Comey's indictment.

The bar for indictment before a grand jury is considerably lower than the threshold required to secure a conviction at trial.

Democrats swiftly denounced the indictment as an act of political retaliation. Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said Thursday that the country was witnessing “nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,” while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) decried it as “baseless” and “part of Donald Trump's corrupt weaponization of the criminal justice system against anyone who has sought to hold him accountable.”

“Donald Trump continues to disgrace the presidency and the Department of Justice,” he added. “Those sycophants who aid and abet the President's vengeful schemes will not be able to hide from the serious legal consequences of their behavior. They will be held accountable.”

FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC NEW YORK OFFICES CLOSE OVER AG JAMES'S ‘CORRUPT' ACTIONS

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) celebrated the news, calling the indictments “long overdue.”

“For years, Letitia James has illegally weaponized her office to conduct a political witchhunt against Democrats' political opponents most notably President Donald J. Trump,” she added, saying James “now faces allegations of committing the very type of financial misrepresentation she baselessly pursued against President Trump.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Riyadh Comedy Festival is just one part of a much bigger plan.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Updated at 10:45 a.m. ET on October 9, 2025

It's hard to be a comedian; it's never just bits and punch lines. They expect you to weigh in on so much serious stuff: cancel culture, political repression. And now the latest heavy question plaguing the world of stand-up is: “Should you decline to perform at a comedy festival in a country that has arrested and jailed some of its own comedians?” The Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia concludes this week, but the outrage (from comedians who didn't go) and self-justification (from comedians who did) continues.

The festival is an outgrowth of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a plan launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) to attract Western investment and glitz up his country's draconian image. According to the Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama, who has covered the Gulf states for decades, the country has changed considerably—at least on the surface. Women drive, work in different sectors, and dress more vibrantly. The country has launched a women's soccer league and expressed interest in hosting the Women's World Cup in 2035. But the country's leaders still jail and harass critics, and U.S. intelligence still suspects MBS of involvement in the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which are some of the reasons why Human Rights Watch said the comedy festival “whitewashes abuses.”

In this episode, we talk to Salama and our colleague Helen Lewis, fresh back from seeing Louis C.K. and Jimmy Carr perform in Riyadh, about what happened at the festival and how to understand Saudi Arabia's push for modernization.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Okay, how about this for a setup: A bunch of comedians walk into a festival hosted by a country that has arrested and jailed some of its own comedians, a country accused in American courts of providing support to the 9/11 hijackers. And then, days before the festival starts, a different comedian says—

Marc Maron (from Instagram): Well, there's a Riyadh comedy festival; I don't know if you heard about that.

(Audience laughs.)

Maron: This is true. There's a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, comedy festival.

[Music]

Rosin: That's Marc Maron, from a recent video he posted on social media.

Maron: I mean, how do you even promote that? From the folks that brought you 9/11, two weeks of laughter in the desert! Don't miss it!

(Audience laughs.)

Rosin: And then another comedian says—

Shane Gillis (from Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast): Everyone's like, Yeah, you should do it. Everyone's doing it. It's like, For Saudis? 

Rosin: That was Shane Gillis, who declined to go.

Gillis: Weren't those the 9/11 guys?

(Laughter.)

Zach Woods (from TikTok): Guys, it's that special time of year: It's the Riyadh Comedy Festival. And all of your favorite comedians are performing at the pleasure of Turki al-Sheikh, and—

Rosin: That's Zach Woods.

Woods: Human Rights Watch has been begging the comedians not to participate in the whitewashing of the horrors that are ongoing in Saudi Arabia. Ugh, what a cockblock Human Rights Watch is for comedy.

Let's have some fun—

[Music]

Rosin: Atsuko Okatsuka said she was offered a spot in the festival but declined. And then she posted on social media what looked like a contract, where it stated that performers could not make fun of Saudi Arabia and its leadership, the Saudi royal family, and basically anything regarding religion.

Now, the comedians who did sign on to the festival included some pretty heavy hitters: Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, and Bill Burr, among dozens of others. The amount they were paid isn't known for sure, though at least one comedian has said he was offered $375,000 and that others received more than $1 million—which is a lot more than some of them make in the U.S.

In an appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher last Friday, Louis C.K. said he had “mixed feelings” about attending.

Louis C.K. (from Real Time With Bill Maher): I think everything that's being said about it, that's a worthy discussion: When are you appeasing? When are you engaging? And I have mixed feelings about it too. I struggled about going once I started hearing what everyone was saying.

Rosin: Jessica Kirson, who is a gay comedian with a big queer following, also went to the festival and then apologized to her fans when she got back.

Aziz Ansari, meanwhile, told Jimmy Kimmel this week that he saw performing there as an overall good thing for Saudi Arabia.

Jimmy Kimmel (from Jimmy Kimmel Live): So you felt that, in the long term, this will be a positive: people seeing comedy and American comedy and free speech—

Aziz Ansari: Yeah, so many people were there talking about stuff. And I hope people see that, and they go, Wow, this was really great, and I want more of this. Not just in comedy, but in everything.

Rosin: All of this, whether intended or not, brought a lot of attention to a festival that otherwise may have gone largely unnoticed.

Rosin: So you literally just got back from Saudi Arabia.

Helen Lewis: Yeah, my plane landed about two hours ago.

Rosin: I mean, we even sent Atlantic staff writer Helen Lewis there.

Lewis: This is a country that has been a theocracy, essentially, practicing one of the more conservative forms of Islam. Some stuff was genuinely pretty groundbreaking. This is probably the first time anyone has joked about dildos onstage in Saudi Arabia.

[Music]

Rosin: We'll hear more from Helen about what it was like to be at the festival later in the show.

And in case you were wondering, or waiting, I do not have a punch line to this setup. But in the end, maybe it's Saudi Arabia that gets the last laugh, because the Riyadh Comedy Festival is just one small part of a much bigger plan the country has put in place that goes way beyond comedy—a plan to compete with its neighbors, pull in Western investment, dominate sports, and generally be known for things other than 9/11 and human-rights violations.

Vivian Salama: You could really kind of envision the skyline of Dubai: You know that it's a shopping hub, and there's all these celebrities that go there, and it's glitzy, and it's glamorous.

Well, Saudi Arabia has a lot more money and kind of looked on all these years very jealously, in some ways, of the fame and fortune that came with Dubai and Abu Dhabi and Qatar's transformation. And it wanted that, but it had some restrictions.

Rosin: That's my colleague Vivian Salama, who lived and reported in the Gulf for several years.

Salama: After all, this is the home of Islam. Mecca and Medina hold very, very spiritual significance for Muslims around the world. Saudi Arabia was known for morality police and things like that; it was not known for comedy and fashion and entertainment.

And then all of a sudden, about a decade ago, you had a young crown prince—who came in somewhat forcefully into power, pushing his cousin out of the way—and he vowed to change things, and that's when some of these new patterns began. And so it's been a gradual shift, a comedy festival being part of that bigger picture.

Rosin: What is the bigger picture? I've heard of Vision 2030. What is that? What is that about?

Salama: So Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia—who, by the way, just turned 40 years old in August—he launched something called Vision 2030, he and others, the king included.

[Music]

Salama: Vision 2030 is their economic-diversification plan and which gets very in the weeds in terms of the different sectors of development. But one of the big parts of this framework was that they were gonna diversify their economic, social, and cultural life. If you read through this very long plan, it talks about the pillars for promoting a “vibrant society,” among it getting its citizens to exercise more, getting them to spend more on entertainment, things like that.

They really believe that they cannot rely exclusively on the fact that they are the world's largest exporter of oil as the sole basis for generating economic revenue; they needed to diversify— which is what, by the way, Dubai and Abu Dhabi and Qatar had been doing in the decades before. It's just a more sustainable model. And Saudi Arabia, up until about a decade ago, was really in trouble in that regard because of the fact that it needed to find other alternative avenues for revenue. They weren't getting tourism the way that Dubai and Qatar were. They weren't getting any of that other money. The retail shopping hubs were not looking to go there.

And it's partly because of their record on a number of issues. Human rights, for example, has been problematic all along. Repression of women was always something that was notable for Saudi Arabia. They have been trying to change this, in conjunction with this diversification plan that they're also trying to execute on.

Rosin: It's funny—you're saying it in a straight way, but as you're saying it, I'm like, This does not necessarily hang together. How does “comedy festival” dropped into the middle of this make any sense? Comedians are known for making fun of everything. And so how do you think they thought through that? It's not a shopping center; it's a different animal, you know?

Salama: The fact that we are here talking about it is what they are trying to accomplish. They want to bring eyes and people's attention to Saudi Arabia for things other than, say, negative headlines or just the Hajj, for Islamic pilgrimage. They want to be known for other things. They want us to be talking about Saudi Arabia: Did you see that festival in Saudi Arabia? Did you see that fashion show in Saudi Arabia?

Rosin: So Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS, has actually made headway in this goal, proving to the world that this is not your grandma's Saudi Arabia. He's also an ally of President Donald Trump.

During Trump's first presidency, his very first international visit was to Saudi Arabia. In the spring of 2018, Trump hosted MBS at the White House for some classic Trumpian dealmaking.

Donald Trump (from PBS NewsHour): We've become very good friends over a fairly short period of time; I was in Saudi Arabia in May. And we are bringing back hundreds of billions of dollars into the United States, and we understand that—

Rosin: Then, just about six months after that warm welcome in the Oval Office, news broke about the shocking killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Salama: It was eventually determined by U.S. intel that the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, either knew about or directed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, which was an extremely brutal event, as we know now—happened extraterritorially in Istanbul, likely with the use of a bone saw. And so you had this very jarring image of this journalist working for a Western publication who was brutally killed by this man, and at the same time, he was out there talking about: I'm a different kind of ruler. I'm a reformer. I want to engage with the West. And so you had this split-screen situation, and it just so happened that the Trump administration had come into office right around that time.

President Trump did acknowledge, with some trepidation, these reports. He reportedly, according to my sources, told the crown prince and the king privately, I hope there wasn't a bone saw; I'll be very mad if there was a bone saw, but also made very clear that he wasn't gonna get involved in their domestic affairs, that this relationship is a business relationship above all else: We can help each other do really well.

Rosin: Do you, as an observer of the country and its ebbs and flows, think that MBS, for being young and kind of desiring this cultural opening, has made any actual meaningful reforms?

Salama: Oh, yeah, most certainly. When I last visited Saudi—a year and a half ago, maybe—I couldn't actually believe how much it had changed. There was a time less than a decade ago where I could not walk around without an abaya, the full dress that goes to the floor, that covers the very modest clothing. Oftentimes, I'd have to have a veil at least on hand so that if anyone yelled at me, I'd just kind of throw it on my head, if not always wearing it.

I walked around in jeans and a T-shirt. Women were wearing bright, vibrant abayas that were open and showing their jeans and T-shirts underneath—and I'm talking Saudi women. Their hair was exposed much more than I'd ever seen before. Women are now driving, which is one of the big headliners that came out during the MBS period.

But also, Saudi Arabia was a little bit of an interesting mix even before this because you did have women who were involved in government, who were business leaders, and they've just been given a platform to expand their influence in the kingdom more as these reforms have set in over the years. And so definitely, there's been significant changes, and you can see it even superficially when you go to visit.

Rosin: So thinking about the comedy festival again, one obvious argument is: “You have a comedy festival. You have comedians show up. Saudis are in the audience. They hear this kind of comedy. Even if it's not free comedy—it cannot criticize the crown prince or the government or the royal family—it's still an edgy kind of comedy, and that, in and of itself, has an opening effect.” Do you believe that to be true?

Salama: I mean, it is surprising to me, having been now traveling and/or living in the Gulf for close to 20 years, it is surprising to me to see where we are. It's definitely a change; it has to be acknowledged.

At the same time, whether or not you can criticize the government, for example, that's obviously still a red line, and it's problematic. And a lot of these comedians just decided that they're not going to participate in a festival that draws red lines, that tells them what they can and cannot say, because comedy is notoriously sort of a free rein—or at least it used to be; things are changing even here. But the Gulf governments—and I'm not just talking about Saudi Arabia—the governments in the Middle East across the board don't take criticism very well. They're not a free-speech society by any stretch.

[Music]

Rosin: Yeah. I guess what you're observing is openness is a big, broad term. There is some openness in the way women walk around on the streets, the fact that women drive, the kinds of comedians that were invited. But that doesn't mean all kinds of openness; it doesn't mean criticizing the government, it doesn't mean comedians can say what they wanna say, and it doesn't necessarily even translate into the exact same standards for a Saudi citizen. But it is something different.

Salama: That's right. That's right. And a lot of these comedians have just determined that any restriction is a no-go.

Rosin: After the break, the view from inside the comedy festival.

[Break] 

Rosin: The Riyadh Comedy Festival just wrapped today, and as fans and comedians return home, a clearer picture of what the event was actually like is taking shape.

Atlantic staff writer Helen Lewis just arrived home from Riyadh when we spoke.

Lewis: So we went to see the co-headliners of the comedy festival, who are Louis C.K. and Jimmy Carr, a British comedian. And they had a Saudi comedian as a support act, and he said, I just want everyone to give a big round of applause for Mohammed bin Salman. (Laughs.) And I was just like, No, no. And obviously, I don't applaud anything anyway, and I thought, Well, what a way to go, what a way to be dragged off by the secret police, is for showing insufficient enthusiasm for the comedic potential of Mohammed bin Salman.

But this was organized by the General Entertainment Authority. This was a state-sanctioned comedy festival. So I think performing there implies not even quite an endorsement, but certainly a level of comfort and ease with what the government is doing that, even in an American context, never mind a Saudi context, I think lots of people would have a problem with.

Rosin: So that expectation was not on the American comedians, exactly—like: Share a big round of applause. But when comedian Atsuko Okatsuka posted a picture of the contract, the contract was essentially: No insulting, degrading, embarrassing the leadership or religion. It was specifically about insulting the heads of state.

Lewis: Yeah, and I think that's really worth noting because, actually, the material was pretty blue—pretty blue—so that is kind of interesting. This is a country that has been a theocracy, essentially, practicing one of the most conservative forms of Islam. Some stuff was genuinely pretty groundbreaking. This is probably the first time that anyone has joked about dildos on stage in Saudi Arabia. Might not be the last.

Rosin: Well, I was wondering about Jimmy Carr. I was like, He's a filthy comedian, you know?

Lewis: He is a filthy comedian. I would say about 75 percent of his set is about: Ooh, wouldn't it be funny if I was a sex offender? (Laughs.) And you're like, You do know that they kill those over here, Jimmy? (Laughs.)

Rosin: Yes! So how did that roll out?

Lewis: Well, actually, you know what, almost all of it went down really well—and, actually, in this slightly intoxicated way, where he kept saying, like, Let's push it a little bit more, shall we? Which is something that came up in Bill Burr's reflections on the event, right? That there was a feeling that people were really excited to be there. This was thrilling to them, that this is kind of slightly titillating, to hear this kind of what, to you and me, would be like, Oh, 9 p.m. at the Comedy Store any night of the week, kind of sex-based comedy. This is the first time that's been heard in public.

But I will say, Jimmy Carr, I will give him some credit because he did—I mean, I think it was an unpleasant joke—but he did do a political joke, which was he'd done a long section on euthanasia that said, We put a dog to sleep, but we allow people to go on living in what can only be described as, and then there was a beat, and then he said, Yemen.

Rosin: (Laughs.) Oh my God, wow.

Lewis: Yeah, and there was genuinely a kind of collective: (Gasps.)

Rosin: Yeah.

Lewis: Because mentioning the Saudi war with Yemen and the bombing of the Houthi rebels there is an incredibly touchy political subject. Then he went back to some light-hearted anal-sex material, and everybody kind of calmed back down again.

The other thing I thought was very interesting about Louis C.K. is that he basically did, as far as I can tell, his current tour show. So he did a whole bit that was about how much he hates jury duty. Well, no one in Saudi Arabia does jury duty.

Rosin: (Laughs.) Yeah.

Lewis: And then he did a bit about how terrible it is when it rains. It's literally a desert.

Rosin: So he is playing it safe, yeah.

Lewis: And then he did a bit about how the woman down his hallway's really elderly and yet still, despite that, still wears a tube top and cropped shorts, and he finds this disgusting. And I was like, Again, not a problem that these people will encounter in their day-to-day life, Louis C.K.

Rosin: Right.

Lewis: So it was—and he did do a bit about his own religion. He said, Am I okay to mock my religion? Am I okay to talk about Catholicism? And so technically violating the spirit of the contract, except that we all know that the spirit of the contract really was: Don't mock Islam.

Rosin: There've been some comedians—like Aziz Ansari, for example—who have come out after the event and said, I think it was net positive. It was net good for Saudi Arabia. It exposed people to a kind of talk and humor that they hadn't heard before.

On the Bill Burr podcast that we mentioned—you were not in this show. But he talked about a comedian—who he did not name—who, when three members of the audience who were Saudi got up to go to the bathroom, this comedian, who was gay, said, Oh, are you going to check Grindr? Which Bill Burr thought was like, Whoa, that's really pushing it.

And so there are some voices coming out of that saying, like, They really did push the boundaries in some way. Did you talk to any comedians? What was your sense of, like, did they feel good about what they'd done, whether it had had any impact?

Lewis: I talked to Andrew Maxwell, who I've previously done panel shows with, comedy panel shows in Britain. And he gave a very interesting defense, which was, he's Irish, and he said, I grew up in a de facto theocracy—divorce was illegal; abortion was illegal; homosexuality was completely frowned upon. And all that changed during the time that I was growing up, and Ireland is now a much more liberal society. And if this has a chance to do that, I want to be part of it. And already, I can hear the bit in my head that's going, Do we really think that Saudi Arabia is gonna creep towards Western liberal democracy through the medium of dildo jokes?

Rosin: Right, right.

Lewis: It seems hopeful. But I can understand the fact that this is a very young country, right? It has de-Islamized in very visible and obvious ways. So the most obvious one is the way that the religious police no longer have powers of arrest, and if you went over 10, 20 years ago and you weren't correctly dressed, or whatever it might be, that was a really scary and repressive thing. And I'm not saying now it's a free-speech paradise, but that is definitely something that has changed.

So the paradox of Mohammed bin Salman's rule of Saudi Arabia is that you can liberalize up to the exact point that he allows, but no more, and you must never question how much or how little he has liberalized. So the most obvious example of this being: Around the time that women were allowed to drive, also, a very prominent women's rights activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, who was a big campaigner for women's driving rights, she was jailed. She's not been heard from in public since; she's not allowed to speak publicly. So the government has adopted this policy that they've said that her position was essentially the correct one, but she did it wrong because she spoke out against—she questioned the Saudi state. And that's the bit that I think is—people from Europe and America, it's hard to grapple with—is: What price are you willing to pay for this liberalization? And what authoritarian penalty will you put up with? Should you be grateful for the good things while condemning the bad thing?

[Music]

Lewis: And also, part of this is, I think, when I read all the defenses of the comedians about why they were doing it, two things came across. One was a kind of nihilism, which was a kind of Doesn't matter. You know, Tim Dillon saying, They're paying me enough to silence the screams. I don't care. You just take the money, keep your head down.

And then the other one was moral relativism, which was, really, essentially boils down to: America's done some bad shit too. Who are we to preach to other people? And I heard that sentiment, and I think particularly because of Israel's war in Gaza, lots of comedians in that kind of sphere who took the invitation and took the money are like, Our ally Israel is bombing a country back to the Stone Age; who are we to lecture Saudi Arabia on its human-rights record?

And I heard that sentiment again and again and again. And it's one that I think is quite widespread now among younger, disaffected people who listen to that kind of podcast-comedian sphere, a real deep dissatisfaction with American foreign policy—which is not a new thing, right? You could have said the same thing around the time of the war in Iraq in 2004. But I think it complicates what some people might feel, that America is a great liberalizing force and is morally superior to other people.

Rosin: So now that you've been there, which of those do you find the most compelling? Or do you think, in the end, none of them should have gone?

Lewis: I wouldn't have gone. But then, you and I are in a different position, as journalists, right? There's an honor system in Britain, and sometimes people who are editors of newspapers take honors, and they become Sir Such and Such, and I think, What are you doing? (Laughs.) If the government likes you, you've done it wrong, essentially, as a journalist. So that's my perspective that I bring to this.

And now, it's not the same for comedians. And I think the bit that is kind of crucial to this is, at what point did we stop having public intellectuals, and we started having comedians and started treating them as kind of philosopher-kings, right?

Rosin: Yeah.

Lewis: The idea is these are people whose job is like dinner theater: You go out for the evening, and they make you laugh. And I think I wanna go back to why we've ceded this much moral authority to this class of people who are—you know, many of my best friends are stand-up comedians. But they are heat-seeking missiles for getting the right reaction from an audience. And that's not the same thing as telling the truth, right? Sometimes the jokes are lazy or easy, and those ones are the guaranteed laughs. So for me, this whole festival should make us reappraise why we take the political thoughts of comedians so seriously and whether or not they've really earned that right to be taken seriously.

Under that argument, lots of American businesses already trade with Saudi Arabia. Why are we holding Bill Burr to a higher moral standard than Chili's or Dunkin' Donuts?

Rosin: A last question, which is maybe the one I should have asked you first: Why did you wanna go? It's an interesting choice. It's not as if you cover the Middle East. I'm curious why—what you were looking for.

Lewis: I thought it would be funny.

Rosin: (Laughs.) That's not …

Lewis: In many different ways. No, should I tell you what—(a) when I saw it, the two words: Riyadh—the most austere Saudi city; the home of the Sauds, the ruling family—in conjunction with standup comedy. Then I saw the lineup, and it was lots of people that I've covered for The Atlantic for a long time, right? And I was thinking about this: that the festival really owes its existence to two things. One of them is Mohammed bin Salman and his liberalizing regime, and the other one is cancel culture.

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Lewis: And you look down that list, and it's Dave Chappelle—huge backlash at Netflix over his jokes about trans people. It's Louis C.K.—got MeToo'ed. But there is a sense that, in the last couple of years in American comedy, that lots of people got pushed out of the mainstream, and they rebuilt a whole new—you know, in the same way there was alt-comedy in the 1980s, this is kind of alt-alt-comedy, anti-woke comedy.

So for me, this whole festival was really reflective of the state of American comedy and the new energy that pulsed through it, and I think pulsed through it last year, leading so many of these guys to flirt with Trump, interview Trump, maybe full-on endorse Trump. And that is a big challenge to people my age, who've grown up with the default assumption that comedy is kind of liberal.

Rosin: Well, Helen, get some sleep, and thank you for talking to us after your trip.

Lewis: As ever, thank you for having me.

An earlier version of this episode incorrectly stated that the leader of Saudi Arabia allegedly participated in the killing of the journalist Jamal Kashoggi. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud is accused by the CIA of approving a plan to capture or kill Kashoggi.

Going along with an untruth for fear of disagreeing with others is a form of self-betrayal that will make you miserable.

Several years ago, I did some lecturing at a university in Moscow. One of my Russian colleagues had been involved in the dissident student movement in the 1980s, and talked a lot about how bad the regime was and how much most people hated it. I was curious about how, if it was so unpopular, the Soviet system managed to survive for so long. “Brute force?” I asked. “No,” he said, “it was the fact that people pretended to support the government out of fear, giving everyone else the impression that they were alone in their private opinion, so they stayed silent. But eventually, the dissidents helped people figure out that hating the system was actually the majority view—at which point, the jig was up for the Kremlin.”

What had kept the U.S.S.R. population in chains for so long was what the author and scientist Todd Rose has termed a “collective illusion,” precisely this phenomenon of people holding an opinion that is widely shared but that they believe is theirs alone—thus staying silent from fear of persecution or rejection. In his writing and through the work of a think tank that he co-founded, called Populace, Rose has shown that this illusion affects not only people living under a dictatorship but also those in any society that demands a certain kind of cultural conformity. We even have our own version of it in parts of America today. Although no one would confuse the modern-day United States with the old Soviet Union, the dynamics of collective illusion are harming both our democracy and our individual well-being. Here is how to know if you are falling prey to a collective illusion—and how to break free from it without fear.

One way to find evidence of collective illusions is to ask people about the social pressure they may face to stay silent on their true point of view. As scholars at Populace point out in a recently published survey, this pressure is pervasive in the U.S., where 58 percent of people in a sampling of more than 19,000 citizens said they believed that “most people cannot share their honest opinions about sensitive topics in society today,” and 61 percent admitted to self-silencing.

Listen: How to have a healthy argument

Because of this pressure, people are routinely giving what they perceive to be more acceptable opinions in their social circles than those they truly possess. Take, for example, the Populace report's findings about the controversial topic of “gender and diversity quotas” in executive positions within business. The demographic group in America most likely to publicly agree with this form of progressive action—showing 48 percent approval—is Gen Z, young people who have come of age in the past decade, when these ideas became more mainstream. But do these young adults truly agree with these kinds of DEI policies? When asked in the Populace survey what they privately believe, only 15 percent of them say they do—the same percentage as Baby Boomers. In other words, nearly 69 percent of Gen Zers who say that they agree publicly with such quotas are hiding their true feelings.

Or consider the question of whether we live in a mostly fair society. This issue has become a political football of late; older, more right-leaning Americans argue that we do, and younger, more left-leaning people say that we don't. Populace finds that 62 percent of people from the Silent Generation (those born before 1946) publicly agree with the statement (compared with just 32 percent of Gen Zers), as do 50 percent of Republicans (versus 32 percent of Democrats). Privately, however, the rates of agreement among those in the survey are just 6 percent of older Americans and 11 percent of Republicans. In other words, Americans of all ages are now much more doubtful about whether they live in a fair society than they like to admit in public.

Everyone accepts a degree of “going along to get along” to make community life run smoothly, but the phenomenon being tracked here goes well beyond that. Rose and his colleagues see in these findings a threat to our society, insofar as self-silencing and collective illusions indicate a tyranny of the minority that suppresses citizens' perception of the truth and free expression. The problem surpasses this, however. Collective illusions also exacerbate the negative well-being trends that I have previously documented. Saying one thing when you believe another is bad for your happiness. As researchers have long shown, this dissonance can induce psychological discomfort when it cannot be resolved. No surprise, then, that such dissonance is a common side effect of social anxiety and also associated with symptoms of depression. It creates a sense of dishonesty and inauthenticity: a gap between collective illusion and individual disillusion, you might say. This is what George Orwell's concept of “doublethink” identified in his novel 1984, in which people are dehumanized by being forced to accede to two contradictory ideas—in this case, one thought and the other stated.

Why don't people just say what they think and fix the dissonance? That's not so easy. To part ways with what you believe or fear is the majority opinion, especially in a community such as a political group, means risking social exclusion, which is scary and painful. Experiments demonstrating this phenomenon have involved subjecting humans to fMRI brain scans while they play a multiperson game from which they are suddenly excluded. This exiling experience stimulated the subjects' anterior cingulate cortex, part of the limbic system that processes emotional pain. When people go along with an opinion they disagree with but think is popular, they are in a catch-22 of inviting pain through cognitive dissonance by trying to avoid the pain of social rejection.

The way out of the collective-illusion catch-22 is to conquer the fear of rejection from stating your true opinion. The best guide to this that I have encountered comes from the philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, a co-founder of this magazine who helped formulate its motto, “Of no party or clique.” His 1841 essay “Self-Reliance,” about which I have written before, is a handbook for breaking free of collective illusions. Here's my three-part summary.

1. Stop lying. Self-censorship creates a pattern of personal dishonesty. It's one thing to refrain from saying something you think out of politeness; it is another thing entirely to say something you don't think for the sake of self-advancement or out of fear. This, according to Emerson, is a self-betrayal. “Check this lying hospitality and lying affection,” he counsels. “Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse.” For Emerson, to voluntarily utter a lie just to fit in is like choosing to live in a prison: True happiness requires freedom in the form of honesty, come what may. To those who might not like hearing your contrary opinion, Emerson offers this counsel: “If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should.”

2. Reframe your independence. Contradicting the majority is, of course, difficult and frightening. Emerson's answer to this fear is to see it in a new way: “The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.” Your evolutionary tendency is to see the act of breaking from the group in terms of rejection and isolation, both of which are painful and scary. They evoke the image of one cast out of the tribe and wandering alone and defenseless. Nonsense, Emerson says. Recast rejection as going your own way, and isolation as benign solitude from the deafening chorus of agreement with what is popular but wrong. Make ideological independence your personal brand and hold your head high.

Arthur C. Brooks: A gentler, better way to change minds

3. Just walk away. This advice might sound as if Emerson is advocating that you stomp off with your middle finger in the air. If you are a normal person, that sounds like a terrible way to behave—and fortunately, such defiance is not necessary. All that you need to become independent in your ideas is to separate your attention and energy from the source of acceptable but, in your mind, incorrect views. “If you are noble, I will love you,” he writes, but “if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions.” If, for example, your friends are, in your private opinion, spouting nonsense, you don't have to refute or condemn them. Just quietly stop listening to them, and get some new friends.

To strengthen democracy and improve your happiness, here is the question I would ask you to consider: Which of your private opinions are different from what you tell others? They shouldn't be hard to find. After all, as the Populace report bluntly states, “every single demographic group is misrepresenting their true opinions on multiple sensitive issues.”

Next, make a list of your unpopular opinions and an Emersonian plan to quietly declare your independence from what you believe is the erroneous mainstream or socially sanctioned view. In some cases, you will find that this seeming consensus wasn't mainstream at all but a collective illusion, and you might just be the one to break it. In other cases, you will find that you truly are in the minority, and will walk alone. So be it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What's Going On With Marjorie Taylor Greene?","https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-new-voice/684509/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 22:11:00 GMT","

The Georgia representative is finding a new voice.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Way back in 2018, before she had ever held any kind of political office, Marjorie Taylor Greene reportedly endorsed a plan to murder former President Barack Obama. “Stage is being set,” she wrote in response to one Facebook commenter's request to “hang” Obama and Hillary Clinton. “We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.” (Greene later distanced herself from the comments but did not deny having written them.)

Oh how things change. After nearly five years in Congress, the hard-right North Georgia representative is calling for an extension of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health-care policy, breaking with her party over the central policy issue of the current government shutdown and creating ripples of anxiety throughout the broader MAGA movement. “I'm absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year,” she wrote on X. Today, Greene put the blame for the government shutdown squarely on Republican leadership. (Greene's office did not respond to a request to comment on some of her recent statements.)

Greene is no Democrat: She believes that Obamacare created many of the problems with today's health-insurance market, but she also believes that Republicans “have no new solution.” Lately, her impulse to go after both sides has left her very much on her own.

Her sudden criticism of Republicans' approach to health care comes after a summer of minor defections from the far-right political milieu. In June, while many Republicans were throwing their full support behind Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, Greene became the first Republican congressperson to call Israel's actions a “genocide.” And whereas the White House has tried to put an end to the discussion about the sex offender and former Donald Trump associate Jeffrey Epstein, Greene has pushed for transparency, supporting a petition to force a vote on the release of information about individuals connected to Epstein (the other backers have largely been Democratic House members). She has also continued to champion oddball issues that few others in Congress seem to care about. Her Clear Skies Act, for example, doubles down on Greene's stated belief that “they” control the weather. Jury's out on who “they” are.

Neither the White House nor congressional leaders have been shy about expressing frustration with Greene's heel turn. “What's going on with Marjorie?” Trump reportedly asked at least two different senior Republicans. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, whom Greene tried to oust from Congress last year, alluded to the idea that Greene doesn't have all the facts. “Not everyone knows everything,” he said during a press briefing. Democrats, however, are praising Greene for her new stances. “You are going to hear me utter words I never thought I'd say,” said Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia. “Marjorie Taylor Greene is right.”

When she first ran for Congress, Greene was more known for her fanatical adherence to the QAnon conspiracy theory than for her vision for sound policy. Even as she was publicly praising Trump from afar during her campaign, Greene didn't receive the president's endorsement right away—she was well on her way to winning before he threw his support behind her. Greene has hewed closely to the MAGA movement during her time in Congress, even after the White House reportedly discouraged her from attempting a Senate run this past spring and neglected to give her a Cabinet position. But she insists that she is still a free thinker: “I'm not some sort of blind slave to the president,” Greene told NBC News this week. “I got elected without the president's endorsement, and I think that has served me really well.”

The question is whether Greene's actions are the result of genuine disenchantment with the congressional GOP and its mode of governing—an expression of the anti-establishment spirit that got her elected in the first place—or just political maneuvering. Her political calculations may have to do with the fact that an estimated 2.3 million Georgians signed up for Obamacare from 2014 to 2024—one of the highest numbers of any state. “It's as authentic as anything is in Congress,” my colleague Mark Leibovich told me of Greene's recent moves. “Whether it's a heel turn, or whether it's a calculated heel turn,” he isn't yet sure. “And I don't pretend to understand her thought process.” Still, he said, her ideological independence has “gotten her pretty far in a pretty short period of time”: Not every representative secures a subcommittee chairmanship so quickly.

Upstart political candidates in the GOP broadly understand that their potential for success is correlated with their fealty to the MAGA movement and its leader. Greene understood this before most; she was bending the knee well before Trump even acknowledged her. And perhaps it's thanks to those political instincts that she now seems to be recognizing an opportunity to seize the narrative. With the government at a standstill, Greene is once again making noise.

Can Gen Z Get Rid of Their iPhones?

By Elias Wachtel

In 2009, Apple coined a catchy slogan: “There's an app for just about anything.” The original commercial is a time capsule from the early years—when the idea that smartphones could be used in every corner of life read more as a promise than a threat.

Now we have apps to help us stop using apps. The deterrents are creative. Some apps slow down how quickly we can open others; some block everything except calls and texts until we enter a specific password; some prompt us to reflect on a mantra or take deep, meditative breaths before scrolling on. One shows a little animated tree growing—a tree that dies if we open Instagram.

If an app for everything was prophecy, this is its dark fulfillment.

Trump is checking off his enemies list.

This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.

Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump successfully directed the indictment of another of his personal political enemies, New York state Attorney General Letitia James.

What happened? James was indicted for bank fraud on Thursday in Virginia, where she owns a vacation home. She had been under federal investigation for mortgage fraud in connection with that home, but investigators had previously been unable to find evidence that she committed a crime.

Why was James indicted? Because Donald Trump wanted her to be. The former US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to bring charges against James and was forced out late last month. Subsequently, Trump installed Lindsey Halligan, previously his personal lawyer, as US attorney.

Halligan was expressly chosen to target Trump enemies; in a September social media post addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump wrote, “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff, Leticia??? They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. … JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Since then, former FBI director James Comey and Letitia James have both been indicted.

What's Trump's history with James? In 2022, James sued Trump, three of his children, and his family business on behalf of New York state, alleging widespread fraud; he was found guilty by a judge in 2023 and assigned a $500 million penalty, among other punishments. The penalty has since been voided and is still under litigation.

What's the context? Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director who has become one of Trump's top attack dogs, has helped dredge up flimsy mortgage fraud allegations against a number of Trump opponents, including James, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.

Trump had attempted to use these allegations as a pretext to remove Cook from the Fed board, though she has not been criminally charged; today's indictment is an alarming escalation in how Trump intends to wield such accusations.

Every tech giant is ""ganging up"" on OpenAI, said a Thrive Capital partner.

On an episode of the ""Uncapped"" podcast released on Wednesday, Vince Hankes said Big Tech companies don't want new players entering their league.

""My mental model for you on how the competitive landscape looks like is: OpenAI is in a corner and every Big Tech company has a bazooka pointed at them to try to take them down,"" Hankes said. ""Because none of those Big Tech companies want a new Big Tech company.""

Thrive Capital, founded by Josh Kushner in 2011, is a major investor in the ChatGPT maker. The venture capital firm has also invested in companies including SpaceX, Databricks, and Stripe.

""We should want it to be a competitive fair fight for a new company to break into Mag Seven,"" Hankes added, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia. ""Because that's what our whole ecosystem lives and breathes off of.""

This support for OpenAI doesn't mean the VC firm only plans to invest in the AI giant, Hankes said.

""There isn't a risk-adjusted better return than OpenAI, and therefore if we're given a decision, we should do it,"" he said about investing more in the company.

""At the same time, you can't not take a risk because of that,"" he added.

Hankes did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In the past month, a string of deals and announcements has positioned $500 billion OpenAI closer to some of its more established tech competitors.

At its DevDay event on Monday, the company announced it's bringing apps inside ChatGPT, which CEO Sam Altman said now has 800 million weekly users.

OpenAI also unveiled an app software development kit that allows developers to build their own apps for ChatGPT. This makes the AI tool more like an app store, a move that could threaten industry leaders like Apple and Google. Google investors have already been concerned about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools eating into Google's search engine share.

On Monday, OpenAI announced a multi-year deal with AMD in which it will deploy chips requiring up to six gigawatts of power.

The agreement came just weeks after Nvidia announced that OpenAI would gain access to 10 gigawatts of high-powered GPUs, alongside a $100 billion investment from the chipmaker.

OpenAI is set to produce its first AI chip in partnership with Broadcom next year.

If you turn on CNBC or Bloomberg at any given time, there's a decent chance you'll see a talking head discussing a bubble in AI stocks.

It's a pretty easy case to make if you use the historical playbook for identifying an overvalued market. Judging by traditional metrics, we're flashing red. Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell — who rarely talks about asset prices — mentioned it recently. Bubble talk is peaking.

But what if the historical playbook is broken? After all, certain corners of the stock-strategy community have been forecasting a crash for years, citing valuations, and no such meltdown has transpired.

The outdated-playbook argument has been continuously trotted out by those still bullish on the fate of stocks. The idea is that the AI revolution is different than past speculative bubbles, largely because the companies are simply better. There's way more profitability, and way less Pets.com-style fool's gold.

There's also a psychological case: If we're constantly talking about an AI bubble, is our guard already effectively up? Are we unwittingly guarding against a market crash by acknowledging and — perhaps subconsciously — bracing for the risks ahead of time?

If you're still not convinced, don't take my word for it. Ask the Wall Street old guard, which has been reluctant to call foul about an AI bubble, even as lower-profile pundits have continued to sound the alarm (some of whom we've covered at Business Insider).

Just this week, equity strategists at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs published new research outlining why AI stocks are not in a bubble.

Here are some of their main points:

This overall point gets at the bull case referenced above: when you adjust valuations for alternate measures of corporate health, the picture is far less stark, and parallels to the dot-com era weaken.

Take the chart below from Morgan Stanley, for instance. It shows that the median free cash flow yield for the top 500 companies is roughly triple what it was in 1999.

The next chart — also from Morgan Stanley — shows the traditional forward price-to-earnings ratio with a twist, by adjusting for profit margins. The current level of this valuation metric is way lower than it was in 1999, because those margins are so much more robust.

Goldman offers yet another alternate valuation measure, this one designed to account for future earnings growth. The chart below shows the so-called PEG ratio over time for tech stocks (light blue line) and the MSCI all-world index (dark blue). Note that tech is far cheaper than it was in 1999 — and far less decoupled from the rest of the market.

Finally, one major reason alternative valuation metrics look attractive is because the biggest players in the dominant industry — AI — are stronger now than they were in the dot-com era.

When looking at ""strength,"" Goldman is focused on a company's balance sheet. How much debt does it have? Does it have enough cash to pay that debt down and still reinvest? The firm says today's crop of elite AI companies has far more fortified balance sheets.

Morgan Stanley agrees: ""Free cash flow generation, operational efficiency and strong profitability are all characteristics of a higher quality index than what we saw during the late 1990s,"" the firm's equity strategists wrote this week, adding that ""the macro/earnings regime we believe we're heading into in 2026 is also supportive of valuation.""

The last thing I want you to do after reading this is to get complacent about the risks of a possible bubble in stocks. That's how the real comeuppances have happened across history — when the collective investing landscape lets its guard down.

One area to watch is the increased dealmaking in the AI space. Just this year, OpenAI has splashed $1 trillion on computing deals with the likes of Nvidia and — most recently — AMD. This has drawn criticism from those who see the increasingly circular nature of the semiconductor supply chain as a risk.

They argue that this ""vendor financing"" was also prevalent during the dot-com bubble, which gave an incorrect reading of how much demand there actually was.

But even that is getting some pushback from the denizens of Wall Street.

""The recent concerns re: AI financing are highly overstated since it's unlikely to contribute more than 5-10% at most of the $1.2 trillion that we anticipate could be spent annually by 2030,"" Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote to clients this week.

So bookmark this story, and the next time you see a talking head warning of an AI bubble, come back and check out the arguments above.

And remember, being aware and afraid of an eventual crash is the best defense against one. It's best to keep your antenna up all the time for new developments.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Leigh Coney, a 34-year-old AI consultant based in France. It's been edited for length and clarity.

AI models can tend to be ""yes-men.""

They are sycophantic by design, meaning they agree with us, support our ideas, and want to help. Part of the reason I think so many AI projects fail is because the human factor is overlooked. The same biases that apply to us also apply to AI, so it's important to factor in psychological principles when building experiments, agents, and automation.

I decided to pivot from teaching psychology at a university to becoming an AI consultant after Microsoft announced Copilot for its products nearly three years ago. At that moment, I decided AI would be in every business.

Now, I build custom AI automations and agents for businesses across many industries to increase efficiency and growth, using my psychological background to interact better with AI. Although ChatGPT was updated to make it less sycophantic, we have to make an extra effort to be critical of and question our ideas if we want to improve our thinking or work content.

A standard ChatGPT prompt might not challenge a flawed plan.

I ask AI to point out assumptions I might be making when I'm talking about an idea. My goal is to uncover things I'm not thinking about by asking questions like ""where am I not being clear in my thinking?"" or ""What am I overlooking?""

AI is particularly useful for expanding our thinking by uncovering perspectives we could be missing.

Let's say you're pitching an idea to a CFO. Tell your chatbot to ""Act as a skeptical CFO and ask five hard-hitting questions. Don't be shy. Be harsh.""

Not only will it prepare you for the pitch, but it will also give you better output. The questions may even be more valuable than the answers because they force you to think about things you didn't think about before.

A surgery with a 90% survival rate feels different than a surgery with a 10% mortality rate. That's the framing effect. Little wording tweaks in our prompts not only change how we feel, but can also change how AI responds.

The way you should frame a question to AI depends on what you're trying to do.

Let's say a team is facing a setback at work, and a manager is using a chatbot to write an email to their employees. If the manager prompts the chatbot to ""explain the project delay and the problems they encountered"", that's a negative framing, and the response will be more critical.

A more positive framing would be to say something like, ""draft a project update for the team. Frame our recent challenge as a critical learning moment that has revealed two insights for making the final product even better. Focus on our resilience and the path forward.""

If I'm using a chatbot to work on something important, I test out many different versions of my prompt in different chats. I tweak some words, sometimes just one, and it actually makes a really big difference in the response I get.

The speed at which AI was advancing made me a bit concerned about jobs and employment, but since the personally underwhelming GPT5 release, I think we've got a lot more time than I previously assumed. To me, this is good news for our job market.

Learning about cognitive biases is worth it. It improves how we think and communicate with each other and with AI, and will ultimately lead to better output.

The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a ""civil-military coordination center"" in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and how the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed this week to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

One of the officials said the new team would help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza.

The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza.

A second official said troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center.

New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on criminal charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution after a prosecutor hand-picked by President Donald Trump presented evidence to that panel.

James is a long-time antagonist of Trump, who recently publicly called for criminal charges to be filed against her and former FBI Director James Comey.

The attorney general previously sued Trump in a civil case in New York that led to him and his company being held liable for business fraud.

The indictment issued Thursday accuses James of making false statements in connection with a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae that she obtained to buy a three-bedroom home in Norfolk, Virginia, in August 2020.

James, whose primary residence at the time was in Brooklyn, New York, is accused of lying on a rider to that mortgage, which required her to use the Norfolk home as a secondary residence and not rent the property, according to the indictment.

""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,"" said Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, in a statement after she obtained the indictment of James in Alexandria federal court.

""The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served,"" Halligan said.

James, in a statement, said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General.""

She called the charges ""baseless,"" saying that Trump's ""own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.

""The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties,"" James said.

""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me – and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president – is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country. This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""

James was ordered to make her first appearance in the criminal case on Oct. 24 in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia. The case has been assigned to Judge Jamar Walker, who was appointed to the bench in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden.

If convicted, James faces a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison, and up to a $1 million fine on each count. Any actual sentence would likely be much less severe given federal sentencing guidelines.

The indictment alleges that total amount of purported ""ill-gotten gains"" by James were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan, which was originated in mid-2020.

Halligan on Sept. 25 obtained a criminal indictment against Comey, on charges related to his allegedly lying to Congress in 2020.

Halligan also had personally presented the evidence in Comey's case, reportedly after other prosecutors balked at the idea. It is highly unusual for a U.S. Attorney to present a case to a grand jury.

Comey pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Alexandria on Wednesday and was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5.

Halligan's predecessor as acting U.S. Attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned on Sept. 19, shortly after Trump said he wanted him gone.

Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that ""investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey,"" The New York Times reported on the day he resigned.

Trump promptly tapped Halligan to replace Siebert.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James.

""New Yorkers know @NewYorkStateAG James for her integrity, her independence, and her relentless fight for justice,"" Hochul wrote in a post on X.

""What we're seeing today is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,"" the governor wrote.

James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James.

""Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC,"" that report on Monday said.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte in April made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had in multiple instances falsified bank documents and property records in connection with the Norfolk home and a New York property.

In a letter in April to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called Pulte's allegations ""baseless.""

Pulte has made similar accusations about purported mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

Trump cited those claims in August when he tried to fire Cook, who, like James, is the first Black woman to hold her position. A federal district court judge blocked Trump from removing Cook while her lawsuit challenging her termination was pending.

The Supreme Court on Oct. 1 said Cook could remain in her post pending the outcome of oral arguments over the dispute, which are set for January.

In early September, James asked New York state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case.

""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization,"" James said in her statement on Thursday.

""We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence – not politics,"" she said. ""Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""

""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space,"" James said. ""And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""

In this article

Tesla is facing a federal investigation into possible safety defects with FSD, its partially automated driving system that is also known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised).

Media, vehicle owner and other incident reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that in 44 separate incidents, Tesla drivers using FSD said the system caused them to run a red light, steer into oncoming traffic or commit other traffic safety violations leading to collisions, including some that injured people.

In a notice posted to the agency's website on Thursday, NHTSA said the investigation concerns ""all Tesla vehicles that have been equipped with FSD (Supervised) or FSD (Beta),"" which is an estimated 2,882,566 of the company's electric cars.

Tesla cars, even with FSD engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.

The NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation opened a Preliminary Evaluation to ""assess whether there was prior warning or adequate time for the driver to respond to the unexpected behavior"" by Tesla's FSD, or ""to safely supervise the automated driving task,"" among other things.

The ODI's review will also assess ""warnings to the driver about the system's impending behavior; the time given to drivers to respond; the capability of FSD to detect, display to the driver, and respond appropriately to traffic signals; and the capability of FSD to detect and respond to lane markings and wrong-way signage.""

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the new federal probe. The company released an updated version of FSD this week, version 14.1, to customers.

For years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised investors that Tesla would someday be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.

That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.

Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or valets on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed.

In February this year, Musk and President Donald Trump slashed NHTSA staff as part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce, impacting the agency's ability to investigate vehicle safety and regulate autonomous vehicles, The Washington Post first reported.

President Donald Trump has met with Jared Isaacman to discuss another nomination to lead NASA, a source familiar with the talks confirmed to CNBC's Morgan Brennan.

Isaacman, who has close ties with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, was at the White House in September for Trump's dinner for tech power players. Musk did not attend.

Trump and Isaacman have had multiple in-person meetings in recent weeks to talk about the Shift4 founder's vision for the space program, according to Bloomberg,  citing a person familiar with the meetings.

After a fiery back-and-forth between Musk and Trump over government spending, the president pulled Isaacman's nomination for the post, saying he was a ""blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.""

""I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 6.

Trump named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA in July.

Isaacman, who declined to comment, was initially nominated in December to lead the space agency.

Isaacman is a seasoned space traveller, having led two private spaceflights with SpaceX in 2021 and 2024. Shift4 has invested $27.5 million in SpaceX, according to a 2021 filing.

Isaacman stepped down as CEO from Shift4, the payments company he founded in 1999 at the age of 16, after his nomination was pulled, and now serves as executive chairman.

""Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again,"" Isaacman wrote about the NASA nomination process in a letter to investors announcing the Shift4 change.

Now, it looks like he gets to do it all over again.

Tensions between Musk and Trump have cooled in the months since, but big challenges face the U.S. space program..

Trump has proposed cutting more than $6 billion from NASA's budget.

As a result of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative, which Musk led in the first half of 2025, around 4,000 NASA employees took deferred resignation program offers, cutting the space agency's staff of 18,000 by about one-fifth.

During the October government shutdown, NASA has made exceptions that allow employees to keep working on missions involving Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.

The U.S. Treasury finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina and bought pesos in the open market on Thursday, making good on President Donald Trump's pledge to prop up the wobbling country and sending the peso and Argentine dollar bonds sharply higher.

""The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in announcing the actions on X.

Argentina's 2035 bond rose 4.5 cents to trade at 60.5 cents on the dollar, while the peso closed at 1,418 per dollar, up 0.8% on the day after falling 3% earlier.

Local stocks rose 5.3% Thursday. Last month, they touched a 2025 low, days before Bessent's initial support pledge. Argentine stocks traded in U.S. exchanges rallied 13%.

Bessent issued his statement at the end of four days of meetings with Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo that also involved officials from the International Monetary Fund. In April, the IMF granted Argentina a new $20 billion loan program.

A spokesperson for the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. actions.

""Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,"" Bessent said in his post. ""The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly. And act we will. To that end, we directly purchased Argentine pesos.""

A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to provide any further details, including on the amount of pesos purchased and how the $20 billion currency swap line would be structured.

Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate complained that Trump was moving to provide financing to bail out a foreign government and global investors, even as the U.S. government has been shut down.

Previously, Bessent had pledged the use of the Treasury's $221 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund and its holdings of IMF reserve assets known as Special Drawing Rights to support Argentina.

The backstop is partly aimed at giving Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei, a boost in Argentina's October 26 mid-term legislative elections. His party wants to strengthen its minority position to solidify his agenda to cut government spending and boost private-sector investment.

Argentine lawmakers are working to limit what the president can do via decrees, raising the stakes for Milei's party in the midterms.

Although the effect on financial markets was immediate, there was no guarantee the U.S. backstop will improve Milei's party's election prospects as public dissent over his austerity measures has grown.

UBS's Shamaila Khan, head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific, said the announcement was likely to bolster prospects for Milei's party. Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy, said the midterms remain the major event, as are a policy and FX adjustment after the vote.

Bessent called the success of Milei's reforms of ""systemic importance,"" to the U.S. by helping to anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere.

Milei, who is due to meet Trump next week during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, thanked Bessent and Trump in a message on X.

""Together, as the closest of allies, we will make a hemisphere of economic freedom and prosperity. We will work hard every day to provide opportunity for our people,"" Milei wrote.

Investors greeted the intervention with a sigh of relief.

Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at BankInvest, said markets had been hungry for details of Bessent's support pledge and had been challenging peso valuations.

""If they hadn't come through with a promise they made...we would be talking about a complete collapse of Argentina,"" he said.

Several U.S. Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to bail out Argentina and global investors. The measure is largely symbolic, as Democrats remain the minority in both chambers of Congress.

""It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to the partial government shutdown due to lack of funding.

""Trump promised 'America First,' but he's putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill,"" said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

In the ever-evolving long-term competition between the United States and China, it can be easy to lose sight of the quieter but more enduring risks that lie beneath the headlines.

Case in point: China's new sweeping export controls on rare earth magnets and related technologies, tightening its grip on critical inputs for everything from EVs to fighter jets. Under the new rules, any magnet containing even trace amounts of Chinese-sourced rare earths — or made using Chinese methods — now requires Beijing's explicit approval for export. This marks a significant development in China's export controls and should be understood as the debut of a Chinese version of the ""Foreign Direct Product Rule,"" a signature tool Washington has used for decades to exert power and control and most relevant to China, to choke off semiconductor supplies to Huawei and other Chinese firms.

But the latest rare earths move is about much more than that. As attention turns to the anticipated Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea later this month— or to flashpoint issues like Taiwan, the TikTok deal, tariffs, or semiconductor competition — the deeper structural tensions shaping the U.S.-China long-term relationship, and the rest of the international system, risk falling into the background.

Amid these high-profile developments and the churn of short-term tactical deals, a more subtle but profoundly consequential trend is underway that deserves sustained attention from boardrooms, CEOs, investors, and policymakers: the expanding use of what is commonly referred to as ""lawfare."" Deliberate, strategic deployment of laws, compliance regimes, and regulatory norms are being increasingly used by China to assert power, shape global behavior, and entrench long-term advantages for itself and its companies around the world.

It is not merely the laws themselves that pose a challenge. Many would also be right to point out that the United States and Europe have done these things for decades. The risk lies in the lack of serious understanding about what China is doing, and little in the way of curiosity or forward-looking scenario planning in U.S. boardrooms and C-suites. Too often, executives are unprepared for situations in which compliance with U.S. laws — once routine — now conflicts with obligations under China's expanding legal and regulatory regime. These are no longer edge-case occurrences.

And if China's regulatory framework is relatively new compared to the U.S. or Europe, it is increasingly effective in advancing its geopolitical goals. Any nation with China's level of state capacity, agency, and ambition would use its legal system to extend influence, even extraterritorially. The timing of the latest rare earth restrictions are no coincidence. With a Trump-Xi meeting expected in Seoul this month, China is showing it is fully capable of adapting its legal toolkit to ensure that it is fit for purpose and willing to use law and regulation to maximum effect, both to secure short-term negotiating leverage and longer-term national interests.

The same strategic logic is evident in China's use of a broader legal arsenal.

Beijing has used its Anti-Monopoly Law to launch retaliatory probes — like an antitrust investigation into Nvidia following U.S. chip export controls. It has wielded the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law to sanction defense firms such as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin over arms sales to Taiwan, even banning their executives from China.

China's Unreliable Entities List (UEL), once seen as a theoretical threat, is now a working tool. In 2025, U.S. firms, including Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp. and Illumina, were listed for alleged discriminatory practices, followed by a wave of U.S.-based drone companies, including Skydio and Brinc.

The message is clear: compliance with U.S. law alone can now trigger punishment from Beijing. And that scope widened further this week. On Thursday, China added 14 more Western entities to the UEL, many tied to the defense, intelligence, and semiconductor ecosystem. Among them is TechInsights, a Canada-based leader in semiconductor intelligence, reverse engineering, and market analysis. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce barred Chinese entities and individuals from engaging in any trade, cooperation, or data sharing with the listed firms.

This latest addition to the UEL list signals a new frontier in China's lawfare strategy, targeting not only physical goods and technologies, but the information infrastructure and analytical capabilities that underpin supply chain transparency, compliance assessments, and competitive forecasting. It's a sharp reminder that data is now a contested domain, and Beijing is willing to sever flows of insight as aggressively as it once did flows of minerals or equipment.

Other statutes, such as the Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law, have been used to restrict data flows and discipline firms operating across jurisdictions. Didi Chuxing's delisting and LinkedIn's China exit illustrate how regulatory pressure can be exerted swiftly and unilaterally to great effect.

But it is China's Export Control Law, applied in recent years to gallium, germanium, and now rare earth magnets, that has become its central economic lever. By imposing strict licensing requirements on outbound shipments of these chokepoint materials, China is deliberately slowing the global flow of inputs essential to advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and defense supply chains. This law is no longer a back-office technicality of benign license application processes and approvals — it is an open and active instrument of statecraft.

This legal web is complex and sometimes vague and overlapping, giving Beijing the flexibility to apply pressure when and where it chooses. China now wields over 20 such laws and regulatory statutes — spanning cybersecurity, foreign investment screening, maritime safety, the corporate social credit system, and even anti-food waste and religious activity — creating a dense framework designed to compel, retaliate, and reward in service of national objectives.

There is also an even quieter, long-term battle that China is winning: global standards setting.

Through its China Standards 2035 initiative, and strategic placements in key international bodies like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), China aims to define the technical norms that will govern the future of 5G telecommunications, artificial intelligence (AI), smart cities, and other emerging and advanced technologies. Standards determine what scales, who profits, and which governance models get encoded into global systems.

Chinese firms like Huawei and Hikvision are aggressive participants. U.S. firms are often left to fight it out alone. American regulators, by and large, are absent. If this continues, U.S. firms and consumers will increasingly operate under rules shaped in Beijing, not Washington.

These may not be the sexy issues. And they likely won't be on the agenda of the Trump-Xi meeting on the margins of APEC. But they are critical issues just the same. This is not necessarily about choosing geopolitical sides. It is about building a plan to navigate an adversarial and fragmented global legal environment. The real challenge lies in how global firms respond. Does a company know its full exposure? Does it have red lines — scenarios in which it is clear which legal regime to obey, and are U.S. corporations prepared to make that decision and explain it to shareholders and regulators?

These are not platitudes. They are the foundation of a strategic framework businesses need to build, refine, and rehearse now before the next time they have to choose between obeying U.S. law and remaining viable in China's market. These are not easy questions to answer, nor are the tradeoffs comfortable to make. But ignoring them — or pining for the good old days — is not an option. As Chairman Mao might have said, they are not ""paper tigers."" They are real, active tools used to pressure, compel, and shield Chinese firms from foreign competition — while also placing Beijing's national interest at the center of the global regulatory ecosystem.

In this article

Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt has issued a stark reminder about the dangers of AI and how susceptible it is to being hacked.

Schmidt, who served as Google's chief executive from 2001 to 2011, warned about ""the bad stuff that AI can do,"" when asked whether AI is more destructive than nuclear weapons during a fireside chat at the Sifted Summit

""Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely,"" Schmidt said Wednesday. The proliferation risks of AI include the technology falling into the hands of bad actors and being repurposed and misused.

""There's evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,"" Schmidt said.

""All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature.""

AI systems are vulnerable to attack, with some methods including prompt injections and jailbreaking. In a prompt injection attack, hackers hide malicious instructions in user inputs or external data, like web pages or documents, to trick the AI into doing things it's not meant to do — such as sharing private data or running harmful commands

Jailbreaking, on the other hand, involves manipulating the AI's responses so it ignores its safety rules and produces restricted or dangerous content.

In 2023, a few months after OpenAI's ChatGPT was released, users employed a ""jailbreak"" trick to circumvent the safety instructions embedded in the chatbot.

This included creating a ChatGPT alter-ego called DAN, an acronym for ""Do Anything Now,"" which involved threatening the chatbot with death if it didn't comply. The alter-ego could provide answers on how to commit illegal activities or list the positive qualities of Adolf Hitler.

Schmidt said that there isn't a good ""non-proliferation regime"" yet to help curb the dangers of AI.

Despite the grim warning, Schmidt was optimistic about AI more broadly and said the technology doesn't get the hype it deserves.

""I wrote two books with Henry Kissinger about this before he died, and we came to the view that the arrival of an alien intelligence that is not quite us and more or less under our control is a very big deal for humanity, because humans are used to being at the top of the chain. I think so far, that thesis is proving out that the level of ability of these systems is going to far exceed what humans can do over time,"" Schmidt said.

""Now the GPT series, which culminated in a ChatGPT moment for all of us, where they had 100 million users in two months, which is extraordinary, gives you a sense of the power of this technology. So I think it's underhyped, not overhyped, and I look forward to being proven correct in five or 10 years,"" he added.

His comments come amid growing talk of an AI bubble, as investors pour money into AI-focused firms and valuations look stretched, with comparisons being made to the dot-com bubble collapse of the early 2000s.

Schmidt said he doesn't think history will repeat itself, however.

""I don't think that's going to happen here, but I'm not a professional investor,"" he said.

""What I do know is that the people who are investing hard-earned dollars believe the economic return over a long period of time is enormous. Why else would they take the risk?""

BUCKS CO., Pa. (WPVI) -- Crypto scammers are increasingly using what are called Bitcoin ATMS to carry out their cons.

Bitcoin ATMs don't operate like a traditional ATM. Instead of withdrawing money, you use the machine to insert cash to buy Bitcoin.

The transaction is then sent to a crypto wallet, which is a place where someone can manage, trade, swap or use cryptocurrencies.

What makes the ATMs appealing to criminals is that the transactions are usually untraceable.

Crystal Reale of Bucks County said she was lured to a Bitcoin ATM scam.   It happened this past July when she received a call from a man who identified himself as a Bucks County officer.

""Telling me that I had warrants out for my arrest,"" Reale said.   ""I'm immediately freaking out, and I'm like, 'What do you mean?'""

Reale said she was told it was for missing jury duty.

""And I just was summoned for jury duty back in June and I was released from it,"" she added.

The call caused confusion and panic, and she closely listened to what she was told to do.

The con artist told her it could get worked out, but she needed to pay a bond, or she'd be going to jail in 72 hours.

""Which was like $5,000. I'm just like, 'What am I going to do?'"" she said.

She said the officer instructed her to go to the Bucks County Courthouse.

But first, she said she was told to head to the Sunoco down the road to pay the warrant.   The money would need to be deposited into a Bitcoin ATM.

""He's like, 'I'm going to send you documents to state that this is for real. I'm going to send you a QR code for you to scan on this machine,'"" she said

That QR code ended up being the gateway to the criminal's crypto wallet.   She said scams like buying large amounts of gift cards and even wiring money were on her radar.

But she had never heard of a Bitcoin ATM, so she scanned and deposited $5,000 in cash.

""There was no evidence that I had just put this $5,000 in this machine,"" she said.

The officer then told her that the warrant wasn't settled, and she would need to deposit $2,000 more, which she did.

After the transaction went through, her phone went dead and that is when she knew she had been scammed.

""I'm just crying. I started bawling,"" she said.

Reale, a single mother, said the money was cash she had been saving over the course of a few years to take her two kids on a cruise.

""Vacation is not gonna be for a long time now,"" she said.

Director of Fraud for the American Association of Retired Persons or AARP, Amy Nofziger, say Bitcoin ATM scams are a growing threat, especially among the elderly.

""It is a huge problem,"" said Nfziger.  ""We believe these machines need regulations and strong consumer protections to protect victims of fraud.""

Nfziger said there are an estimated 45,000 of the crypto ATMS located in grocery stores, gas stations and corner stores across the country.   And more pop up every day.

""These ATMS overwhelmingly serve criminals and scammers,"" said Adam Zarazinski.

Zarazinski is CEO of Inca Digital, which does risk-focused intelligence for crypto and banking.

""These are transnational criminal groups,"" he said.  ""These are not one-off guys in grandma's basement, you know, randomly calling old people. These are compounds typically.""

Reale says she reported her crime to police and the Internet Crime Complaint Center or IC3.

It's unclear if any investigation is underway in her case, but these scams are simply too prevalent for authorities to keep up.

""I'm so mad at myself for letting them get to me,"" said Reale.

Experts told the Investigative Unit if you're found in a similar predicament, breathe, slow down, and think about what's going on.

They also said the bottom line is no legitimate organization will ask you to deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM.","{'href': 'https://6abc.com', 'title': '6abc Philadelphia'}","cryptocurrency"

The Ethereum Foundation is launching a new privacy cluster, as part of plans to expand its privacy-related projects and initiatives.

The new cluster is set to include 47 researchers, engineers, coordinators, and cryptographers. It will be led by Igor Barinov, founder of open-source block explorer Blockscout and the Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain Gnosis Chain.

The privacy cluster will not operate in a silo but will collaborate with other clusters across the Foundation on projects such as the Institutional Privacy Task Force (IPTF), which works to ensure that the organization's projects comply with privacy regulations worldwide.

The Ethereum Foundation is committed to working alongside the ecosystem to make privacy a priority.

The move comes as Ethereum has some significant privacy-focused product launches on the horizon. The Foundation recently announced the official launch of Kohaku, a privacy-centric browser wallet and SDK, which is expected to debut at EFDevcon in late November. The project aims to enable Ethereum wallets to securely process private transactions, with minimal dependencies on trusted third parties.

Many of the Foundation's most prominent members have also been outspoken about privacy-related issues in recent weeks. Founder Vitalik Buterin took to X last week to denounce a controversial piece of potential EU legislation, the EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation, which would enable automatic scanning of private messages for abuse material, including encrypted messages.

The fact that the government officials want to exempt themselves from their own law is… https://t.co/OY5NXyk58j

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 27, 2025



The news comes as interest in privacy coins more generally seems to be piquing. Privacy blockchain Zcash's native token hit three-year highs earlier this month, with its value doubling in under a fortnight. Experts told Decrypt that endorsements from high-profile figures like venture capitalist Naval Ravikant, praising the blockchain's privacy, may have contributed.

Privacy advocates have hailed the Ethereum Foundation's move. Harry Halpin, founder of privacy-first network infrastructure framework Nym, told Decrypt that blockchain network privacy is now becoming a more serious issue in the blockchain world.

""I'm very happy the Ethereum Foundation has finally put Vitalik's support of privacy into action,” Halpin said.

He pointed to concerns around ETH's current suite of privacy tools, noting that popular wallets such as MetaMask can expose users' IP address to provider ConsenSys's infrastructure tool Infura when making transactions (unless the user employs their own Ethereum node, or tools like VPNs and the Tor browser).

This feature was controversial with the ETH community when it was revealed in 2022, though ConsenSys has since made numerous assurances about how it stores and deletes the data.

Halpin argued that the Foundation should look to Zcash's technical implementation when it comes to privacy, and work with industry experts.

The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has paused many SEC operations, including the review and approval of crypto ETFs. Filings and enforcement actions remain on hold, leaving investors waiting. The Senate is expected to vote for the seventh time today to end the shutdown. Current market odds, such as those from Polymarket, say the shutdown may only conclude after October 15.

This delay temporarily slows institutional entry into crypto markets, particularly through ETFs, but it does not diminish long-term momentum. Experts are now looking for altcoins positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity returns.

Altcoin 1: Sei SEIUSDT

Sei is gaining attention from institutional players, including BlackRock and Brevan Howard, who have launched tokenized funds on its network.

Sei's combination of institutional backing and growing on-chain activity makes it a strong buy ahead of ETF approvals.

Altcoin 2: Sui SUIUSDT

Sui continues expanding through gaming and DeFi applications.

Price still lags behind network growth, offering potential upside as market attention shifts back to altcoins.

Altcoin 3: Solana SOLUSDT

Solana is positioned to benefit from upcoming ETF approvals and growing adoption.

Solana's strong infrastructure and ETF catalysts make it a top choice for near-term accumulation.

Altcoin 4: XRP XRPUSDT

XRP remains an institutional favorite despite retail uncertainty.

Market sentiment shows oversold conditions, setting XRP up for gains toward $4 once regulatory clarity returns.

 Afghanistan's internet blackout highlighted the need for more decentralized internet infrastructure solutions to bolster blockchain's resistance to censorship. 

Afghanistan's recent nationwide internet outage underscored a critical weakness in the world's leading decentralized blockchains: their dependence on centralized internet providers that remain vulnerable to government intervention and technical failures.

The country suffered a near-total internet shutdown that lasted about 48 hours before connectivity was restored on Oct. 1, Reuters reported. The disruption was reportedly ordered by the Taliban administration, though officials later blamed “technical issues” involving fiber optic cables.

While blockchains aim to provide people with a public, censorship-resistant network for value transfers, their reliance on centralized internet providers makes these use cases challenging during outages.

“The Afghanistan blackout is not just a regional connectivity crisis: It is a wake-up call,” according to Michail Angelov, co-founder of decentralized WiFi platform Roam Network. “When connectivity is monopolized by a handful of centralized providers, the promise of blockchain can collapse overnight,” he said.

The nationwide internet and mobile data services outage affected about 13 million citizens, according to a September report from ABC News. This marked the first nationwide internet shutdown under the Taliban rule, following regional restrictions imposed earlier in September to curb online activities deemed “immoral.”

The Taliban denied the ban, blaming the internet outage on technical issues, including fiber optic cable problems.

Iran has also been facing internet censorship issues since the start of its conflict with Israel.

The Iranian government shut down internet access for 13 days in June, except for domestic messaging apps, prompting Iranians to seek out hidden internet proxy links for temporary access, The Guardian reported on June 25.

The Afghanistan blackout adds momentum to calls for decentralized connectivity solutions that remove single points of control. 

Decentralized wireless networks are emerging as alternatives to centralized internet providers, as part of a broader technological shift known as a decentralized physical infrastructure network, or DePIN.

Roam aims to build a smartphone-powered decentralized wireless network that crowdsources mobile signal measurements to create a “living map of connectivity.” 

Along with the project's incoming eSIM implementation, this enables devices to automatically select the best available internet options, including public carriers, a private mesh or a peer-powered local network.

“Roam users can see in real time what works where: No guesswork during outages,” which ensures a connection even when “centralized backbones fail,” said Angelov

World Mobile is the largest decentralized network with 2.3 million daily active users, spanning over 20 countries, according to data from worldmobile.io

The project surpassed $9.8 million in total revenue in August, which represents revenue distributed across AirNode operators, stakers and other contributors.

Helium is the second-largest decentralized wireless network, with over 190 countries and 112,000 total hotspots worldwide. It claims to have over 1.3 million daily users on its decentralized network.

Users are incentivized to host a hotspot for internet coverage through Helium (HNT) token rewards.

Advocates say blockchain technology's promise of financial freedom and censorship resistance cannot be fully realized until the underlying internet itself becomes more distributed.

As Angelov put it, “If decentralization stops at the protocol layer, we haven't really solved the problem — we've just shifted where the control lies.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","UK government announces digital champion to accelerate use of blockchain in financial sector","https://www.computerworld.com/article/4070505/uk-government-announces-digital-champion-to-accelerate-use-of-blockchain-in-financial-sector.html","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:25:39 GMT","



The UK government has announced plans to appoint a “digital markets champion” as part of its drive to modernize the way financial transactions are conducted by adopting blockchain-based shared ledgers.

News of the new role was announced by Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby, in a speech on Wednesday at the Digital Assets Week conference in London.

It's not yet clear who might be in line for the job, but the individual will need to be an industry figure with enough knowledge and connections to get competing agencies – the Bank of England, the UK Treasury, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – to agree to a common framework.

The government is also setting up a new group, the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce (DEMAT), to co-ordinate the UK's move away from paper-based share certificates. 

Tech suppliers are also being invited to bid to take part in the government's Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT), a platform to issue sovereign debt, Rigby is reported to have said.

The range of initiatives underlines the complexity of migrating the financial system from the manual, paper-based systems that have been in use for centuries to ones that are fully digital.

In July, the government set out the arguments for change in its Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy policy paper, saying today's financial processes are slow, costly, and rely on manual systems, which together stifle financial innovation.

Adopting blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) would, the paper argued, allow financial assets to exist as tokens on shared ledgers, overhauling markets by lowering costs, dramatically speeding up transactions, and increasing transparency.

“The ‘tokenisation' of assets could deliver a step change in market efficiency, for instance by enabling real-time data sharing which could improve transparency and lower operational costs,” the paper said.

“More broadly, it could enable a fundamental reimagining of the way financial markets operate, creating infrastructures that support both existing and new forms of asset issuance, transfer, and ownership.”

Despite this, the UK is at risk of falling behind its international peers in ways that will soon hinder London's preeminence as a financial hub. The EU already has the EU DLT Pilot Regime and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the US has the Genius Act for stablecoins, and Singapore has Project Guardian.

Additionally, Swift, the global financial messaging network, recently announced that it would introduce blockchain-based ledger as part of its platform, an initiative it has been testing for several years.

The organization is developing a prototype shared digital ledger to accelerate cross-border payments in conjunction with 30 global financial institutions and blockchain company Consensys.

This will eventually extend the Swift platform to validate transactions and enforce rules governing smart contracts, the organization said.

“You may think, ‘Wow, aren't those opposites? Swift and blockchain. Traditional finance and decentralized finance. Can they really go together?' In the regulated system of the future, we believe they can. Banks are ready for it. And they're asking us to play a bigger role,” said Swift CEO Javier Perez-Tasso at the Sibos 2025 conference.

In the UK, progress towards a regulatory environment remains a work in progress, with a lot of detail still unclear. For now, the Treasury and the FCA are still at the stage of producing policy papers.

According to Julia Demidova of FinTech company FIS Global, the first job of the new digital markets champion will be to work with the Bank of England, the FCA, and the Treasury. 

“The champion will try to achieve some kind of consensus between the three parties. We need a champion in this space to reduce some of the frictions that exist,” Demidova told Computerworld. “We haven't been moving fast enough in comparison to other markets such as the EU, which has a consensus on what MiCA is.”

The UK needs to develop a clear set of priorities as soon as possible, especially over how it plans to support asset classes such as stablecoins, she said. Right now, there is a lack of clarity over whether these can be used for payments.

“The champion will have to establish what's missing today from the existing regulatory frameworks.” said Demidova.

The UK government has recognized this need. In Demidova's view, this suggests the digital champion will have the political backing to unblock the regulatory process.

Lurking in the background to all this is the security of technologies that are still unproven under real-world conditions. “These are new, emerging technologies, and this brings some potential cyber security issues that we may not know about. This is a new surface for attacks that might emerge in this ecosystem,” cautioned Demidova.

It's a debate that will interest IT management, an analyst noted. “The challenge for CIOs is integration. Legacy ERPs weren't built for immutable, token-based workflows,” commented Dan Silverman, co-CEO at data intelligence company, Balcony.

“Tokenization isn't just financial, it's foundational for secure, verifiable data exchange across public and private systems,” he added. The risk is that the effect of uncertainty on businesses is ignored in favor of institutional interests, not least because countries are adopting these technologies at different rates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Clearview AI sees red as UK tribunal sides with regulator over $10M GDPR fine","https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/ico_clearview_ai_tribunal/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:42:00 GMT","

The UK General Regulatory Chamber's Upper Tribunal (UT) has ruled in favor of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which appealed against a 2023 decision that it could not fine Clearview AI over GDPR violations.

In what some Reg commenters called a ""knee-capping of the UK GDPR"" at the time, the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decided in October 2023 that the ICO did not have the territorial scope to issue the £7.5 million fine (c $10 million) it planned for the US-based AI company.

The case relates to an ICO fine issued in May 2022 after the regulator accused Clearview of scraping Brits' images uploaded to social media before adding them to a database used to train its AI algorithms.

As we reported at the time, the FTT accepted that it was reasonable to expect UK residents' faces to appear in Clearview's database, given the size of the country and the ample access to the internet most people enjoy.

However, on Tuesday, the UT upheld most of the grounds on which the ICO based its appeal, crucially ruling [PDF] that Clearview's data processing fell within the territorial scope of the UK GDPR.

It also ruled that the FTT incorrectly applied the law when deciding that Clearview's data processing fell out of scope based on the fact that it was doing so as a competent authority for the purposes of assisting law enforcement clients.

In its appeal of the ICO's decision to fine it £7.5 million ($10 million, or $9.43 million at the time) in 2022, Clearview heavily leaned on Article 2(2)(a) of the UK GDPR to clear its data processing activities.

This is the provision that precludes foreign data processing for law enforcement purposes from regulatory penalties.

Clearview said when appealing against the fine that its service is an internet search engine offered only to non-UK/EU law enforcement and national security agencies, whose uses are out of scope of the regulations per Article 2(2)(a).

The Information Commissioner accepted this was valid. Under the principles of international law, one state cannot seek to compel another to meet a legal demand, i.e. a foreign power investigating a Brit for a crime committed on its own soil should not attract interference from the UK, or penalties under the UK GDPR.

The UT's decision this week, however, overturned the FTT's previous decision and this crucial aspect of Clearview's appeal against the ICO's fine.

It ruled that Clearview's processing was related to behavior monitoring of UK residents, per Article 3(2)(b), and was still bound by UK GDPR regulation despite being carried out on behalf of its foreign law enforcement clients.

The UT, citing case law and previous statements from the EU's Advocate General, said that this exclusion only applies to the UK state itself, and not a commercial entity such as Clearview selling services to foreign governments.

Even if the data is, or can be used by a government in the interests of its national security, the data processing still falls within the scope of the GDPR.

The latest ruling, which New York-based Clearview can also appeal against, means that the case will be sent back to the FTT to decide whether the ICO can, in fact, impose the fine.

This case was solely focused on determining the UK GDPR's territorial scope, not the fine, although the ruling suggests the ICO's decision to issue a fine was valid.

The FTT will then decide again whether, in light of the UT's decision, Clearview contravened the UK GDPR.

John Edwards, the UK's Information Commissioner, said: ""The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge.

""The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK.""

Jack Mulcaire, chief legal officer at Clearview AI, told The Register: ""Clearview AI is disappointed by this ruling which misapplied the law to improperly seek to regulate how American companies serve the US government. We do not offer any product or do any business in the United Kingdom. We intend to file an appeal.""

On that point, Jon Baines, Senior Data Protection Specialist at Mishcon de Reya LLP, commented: ""It's worth noting that it was a very strong, three-judge bench (with President of the Chamber Mrs Justice Heather Williams DBE as lead judge) and the judgment very much has the feel of one the bench has tried to make as 'appeal-proof' as possible."" ®

As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, recent legislative proposals such as Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could significantly impact the landscape of crypto payroll regulations across the world. This article examines how tax breaks for modest Bitcoin transactions may not only boost adoption in the U.S. but also prompt similar changes in Europe and Asia. Let's dive into the potential global ripple effects of this legislation and what it could mean for businesses in the shifting digital assets landscape.

The rise of cryptocurrency has ushered in a new era in finance, providing decentralized alternatives to conventional currencies. Bitcoin, in particular, has paved the way for a rapidly growing digital asset market that has piqued the interest of both individual and institutional investors. As businesses increasingly adopt cryptocurrency payments, understanding the regulatory environment is key to successful integration.

Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has grown from an obscure digital currency into a widely recognized financial asset. Its decentralized structure and promise of high returns have made it a popular choice. However, the intricacies surrounding its use, especially regarding taxation, have impeded broader acceptance. Senator Lummis's proposed tax exemption is an attempt to alleviate these issues by clarifying tax implications for small Bitcoin transactions.

Central to cryptocurrency is blockchain technology—a decentralized ledger documenting all transactions across a network of computers. This technology fosters transparency and security, making it an ideal foundation for digital currencies. For businesses exploring crypto payroll solutions, a solid grasp of blockchain's function will help navigate the complexities inherent in cryptocurrency transactions.

Senator Lummis's proposal to exempt small Bitcoin transactions from capital gains tax—specifically for transactions under $300—could have profound ramifications for crypto payroll regulations worldwide. Easing the tax burden on everyday transactions may lead to heightened Bitcoin adoption among U.S. businesses.

This U.S. tax exemption could prompt similar reforms in Europe and Asia. As American companies start using Bitcoin for payroll and other payments, European regulators may feel compelled to consider comparable measures to maintain competitiveness. This could create a more favorable environment for crypto payroll, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that often grapple with regulatory hurdles.

The proposed exemption could simplify compliance for SMEs utilizing crypto payroll. Tax-free transactions up to $300 would enable businesses to pay employees or settle invoices without triggering complex capital gains calculations. This clarity may promote wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments, particularly in tech-savvy industries and among remote teams.

While the proposed tax exemption offers many advantages, it also presents regulatory hurdles.

Aggregation and Abuse Prevention: To prevent taxpayers from breaking transactions into smaller amounts to evade taxes, regulators will need to introduce rules for aggregating related transactions. This could complicate enforcement and compliance.

Cross-Border Compliance: Businesses involved in cross-border transactions might find it challenging to navigate disparate tax treatments. If some jurisdictions adopt exemptions while others do not, compliance could become a major issue.

Tracking and Reporting Difficulties: The pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions complicates accurate tracking and reporting. Businesses will need robust systems to ensure adherence to tax regulations.

Defining Scope and Limits: Clearly establishing thresholds for ""small transactions"" and differentiating personal from investment activities will require careful legislative design to prevent loopholes.

Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could transform crypto payroll regulations not just in the U.S. but globally. By simplifying tax compliance for small transactions, this legislation could drive increased cryptocurrency payment adoption among businesses. However, the effectiveness of such reforms will hinge on how regulators address the resulting challenges and whether other countries follow suit. As the digital asset landscape evolves, businesses must remain vigilant and ready to navigate the complexities of crypto payroll and compliance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Senate Democrats' Leaked Crypto Position Would Strangle DeFi, Industry Insiders Say","https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/10/09/senate-democrats-leaked-crypto-position-would-strangle-defi-industry-insiders-say","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 22:38:17 GMT","

The crypto industry is recoiling from a document reportedly outlining a U.S. Senate Democratic pitch on handling decentralized finance (DeFi) as a component of the wider effort toward regulating crypto in the U.S.



The proposal — a detailed outline describing an approach to DeFi, first reported by Politico — suggests that a firm or individuals that handle customer needs on the front end of a DeFi operation should have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and be regulated as a broker.



The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include ""everyone in crypto,"" according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant.



""Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable,"" he argued. ""This is not a 'first offer' in a negotiation; it's a list of demands that appear designed to kill the bill.""



Summer Mersinger, who runs the Blockchain Association and was recently a commissioner at the CFTC, said the proposal ""would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development and other applications in the United States.""



""The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas,"" Mersinger said in a statement. ""We urge our policymakers to stay at the table.""



Before the Senate's crypto market structure work fell into the shadow of the ongoing negotiation to reopen the federal government, Senate Republicans and Democrats were circling each other over legislative language and seemed to be in range of making progress on a final, combined bill. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto.



This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as ""anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end."" However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as ""sufficiently decentralized"" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter.



The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. This liability question has been among the core concerns of the DeFi space.



Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin, have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over.



However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. While the crypto work has a long list of Democratic allies, they've made it clear that there are a number of changes they're seeking in the previous Republican legislative drafts before they can jump on board.

This Bat Recorded Itself Catching and Eating a Songbird in Midair

Scientists suspected that Europe's largest bats snack on migrating songbirds when they can, but a stunning newly published observation proves it

For the nearly three-year-old female bat soaring into the Spanish skies in March 2023, it was just another night of striving to feed herself. But her overnight exploits were about to become the stuff that scientists' dreams are made of.

The bat—a greater noctule (Nyctalus lasiopterus)—was equipped with a high-tech tag recording its behavior. And from one particular recording, researchers were able to reconstruct a story with both cinematic drama and scientific value. That's because the tag captured the bat pursuing, killing and eating a migrating European robin (Erithacus rubecula)—all in midair and while echolocating to navigate.

“There was this crazy noise and movement and a lot of echolocation, and I thought, ‘I've never heard this before on any recording,'” says Laura Stidsholt, a biologist at Aarhus University in Denmark and co-author of new research about the observation, published on October 9 in Science. “It was quite magical.”

Greater noctules are among the largest and most endangered bats in Europe. Their usual fare is meatier insects—beetles and moths and the like. But in previous work, scientists analyzing the DNA found in bat poop had been surprised to find evidence of greater noctules feasting on songbirds—which are much larger than insects—during spring and fall migrations, when birds are active at night instead of during the day.

The bats are typically difficult to study, but scientists at Doñana Biological Station, an outpost of the Spanish National Research Council, have microchipped the bats that nest locally and can track when they enter and leave a nest box. The researchers paired that system with cutting-edge recording tags that captured an animal's altitude and movement, as well as the sounds around it. During the springs of 2022 and 2023, the researchers tagged 14 different bats, gathering incredible reports of the furry mammals' adventures.

“It's like flying with the greater noctule bat,” says Elena Tena, a conservation biologist at Doñana Biological Station and co-author of the new research. “We could interpret everything that the bat was doing.”

And from that recording that startled Stidsholt, the researchers constructed quite an interpretation: The female bat soared to an altitude of three quarters of a mile, searching for prey, until it apparently locked in on a migrating songbird. Then it engaged with the bird and made a steep dive, during which the bat made its echolocation calls amid the sounds of an ongoing tussle between the two animals. As the bat approached the ground, the bird let out a string of panicked cheeps before ominously falling silent.

Then—for an incredible 23 minutes—the bat's echolocation squeaks were punctuated by chewing and crunching, even as the animal kept flying. “They're basically screaming with their mouths full,” Stidsholt says, noting that, proportional to their body size, these bats' calls are among the loudest noises known to scientists.

Haunted by the incredible recording, the researchers asked some additional questions. First, they compared the bird's distress calls with existing recordings of songbirds gathered by other scientists whose work requires catching the birds in nearly invisible “mist nets” to handle them. The cries of the bird caught by the bat matched those of the European robin.

The researchers also gathered torn-off bird wings found on the ground of known greater noctule hunting grounds. DNA testing confirmed saliva from these bats on the wings—supporting scientific hypotheses that, just as the bats do with their usual insect prey, the animals bite off and discard songbird wings after making a kill, likely to reduce the weight they carry while snacking.



Elena Tena

That makes the finding particularly interesting, says Riley Bernard, a bat biologist at the University of Wyoming, who was not involved in the new research. “Even though these species do eat insects, and that might be their predominant food behavior, they have this behavioral plasticity to be able to tap into resources when they're available,” she says. Such flexibility could help see the bats through the many challenges they face, she hopes.

Bernard admits to some envy of the European researchers, noting that North America's bats are all much smaller than the greater noctule—too small to carry the tags used in this experiment.

Danilo Russo, an ecologist at the University of Naples Federico II, who was also not involved in the new research, agrees. “I'd really love to fit a small bat with this kind of technology,” Russo says.

“Now we have this amazing means of penetrating the darkness and their hidden world,” he says. “I think it would be a complete game-changer, just like in this case.”

Birds Went Silent during the Great North American Eclipse—Here's What Researchers Discovered

The “Great North American Eclipse” of April 2024 was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study how birds and other wildlife respond to total solar eclipses

When a total solar eclipse plunged North America into darkness on the afternoon of April 8, 2024, the songbirds in Bloomington, Ind., suddenly fell silent. In the middle of the forest, the only sounds biologist Kimberly Rosvall could hear were the croaks of nocturnal frogs and the distant howl of a coyote. But when sunlight returned after four minutes of “night,” the songs did, too, as hundreds of birds greeted the “morning” in unison with a cheerful dawn chorus.

“It was just so incredible,” Rosvall says.

Together with her team at Indiana University Bloomington, Rosvall worked with hundreds of people to crowdsource information about how the solar eclipse altered the biorhythmic behavior of birds. The results, published today in Science, represent the largest effort yet to study such effects, and provide important information for developing conservation strategies against ecological threats such as light pollution, the authors say.

“Our research shows how sensitive organisms are to these changes in light in their natural environment,” Rosvall says. “Even a four-minute disruption is enough to reset their day.”

Few studies have analyzed in detail how specific bird species respond to solar eclipses, which occur when the moon is aligned just so to momentarily mask the sun. Some observational reports suggest that birds sing as if dawn has returned when the sunlight comes back, while others show an increase in bird sounds during the darkness—a discrepancy that could come down to some birds being more active at night and others being more active during the day.

To help distinguish such species-based differences, Rosvall's team built a smartphone app called SolarBird, and it was downloaded by volunteers all across the eclipse's path through North America, from Canada to Mexico. The app guided users to watch a bird for 30 seconds and tap icons describing its behavior, from singing and flying to feeding. Users did this three times: before, during and after the eclipse.

“Focal observation,” or observing one animal for a specific amount of time, “is the gold standard of quantitative behavioral science,” Rosvall says. “It gives you an unbiased view of behavior.”

The team promoted the app through schools, local media and birding groups. But they were not prepared for what came next. In total, they received nearly 7,000 usable observations. “Our jaws dropped,” Rosvall says.

To complement the crowdsourced data, the researchers deployed autonomous recording units at 14 sites around Bloomington. These microphones captured nearly 100,000 bird vocalizations before, during and after the eclipse. The sounds were later analyzed using BirdNET, an artificial intelligence platform developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany that is capable of identifying thousands of species from audio alone.

During the eclipse's four minutes of totality—the period when the moon fully blocks the sun in the sky—bird vocalizations spiked, while other activities such as flying, feeding and perching decreased. After totality ended, many species changed their vocalization rate. In total, 29 of the 52 species analyzed through BirdNET showed changes in their singing in at least one of the three time periods—before, during or after the eclipse—suggesting a widespread but species-specific sensitivity to light. Many species that naturally sing a dawn chorus produced an increased number of vocalizations in the period shortly after totality.

Some birds that sing most often when it is still dark out, such as American Robins and Barred Owls, showed increases in the number of calls overall during the study. American Robins, ubiquitous songbirds known for their boisterous predawn calls, had the largest increase in vocalizations during the afternoon of the eclipse of any species studied: they increased their vocalizations by more than fivefold. Barred Owls, typically active at night, called four times as much as usual. Birds without a pronounced morning routine, such as House Sparrows, showed little change.

The new study is an “incredible natural experiment” that provides a “rich and unique new dataset” to challenge what scientists think they know about how birds of different species respond to radical changes in light, says ornithologist Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University. “There might be additional kinds of behaviors that are probably buried in their recordings and that the authors are going to be able to analyze further,” says Farnsworth, who was not involved in the new study. “There will be additional questions to be answered with their data.”

Rosvall's first idea, for instance, is that those 29 species showing drastic changes in their singing behavior should be flagged on a list of birds considered extremely sensitive to changes in light, she says. This could be useful for planning conservation strategies to limit light pollution, for instance, in and around the birds' natural habitats.

Scientists have only recently taken a stronger interest in studying the effects of eclipses on animals, says biologist Adam Hartstone-Rose of North Carolina State University. It's not for lack of curiosity, he adds, but because total solar eclipses are extremely rare events that almost never occur multiple times in the same location, complicating plans for in-depth site studies.

The next opportunities to conduct research of this kind will come in August 2026, during the total solar eclipse that will cast parts of Iceland and Spain into darkness, and in August 2027, when another eclipse will cover some of North Africa.

Rosvall's study is an example of how these phenomena are an “amazing opportunity” to engage communities in the development of science, says Hartstone-Rose, who is also studying how eclipses influence people's connection to the natural world.

Besides being a rare phenomenon, the 2024 eclipse happened during North America's bird migration season, offering what could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for professional and amateur scientists alike to do an experiment of this type. “So much got aligned,” Rosvall says. “The next time that there will be a total solar eclipse in North America at an especially interesting time for birds is beyond the time that I will be alive.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","There Are 5 Sleep Personalities, Scientists Say. Yours Could Be Making You Exhausted.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a68915663/five-sleep-profiles/","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

These five profiles—including general poor sleep, interrupted sleep, and sleep assisted with medical aids—strengthen the physical and mental connections between our waking and sleeping hours.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Although sleep is a universal trait among every living species, scientists have only begun to understand the immense intricacies of our brain's nighttime reset. While more sleep has always been associated with healthier outcomes, it wasn't until the 1950s—with the arrival of electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and the discovery of the rapid eye movement (REM) cycle—that sleep experts began to connect the dots between human physiological/mental health and sleep. 

Now, a new study led by a team of Canadian scientists has taken this correlation one step further by identifying what they call five “biopsychosocial profiles” of sleep, which connect characteristics of certain types of sleep with individual health and cognition. The results of the study were published in the journal PLOS Biology. 

“Our study showed that different aspects of sleep are related, but can also be separable domains with specific connections to biopsychosocial factors (lifestyle, mental and physical health and cognitive performances),” Aurore Perrault, a co-lead author of the study from Concordia University, said in a press statement. “This highlights the importance of considering the full picture of an individual's sleep to help clinicians make more accurate assessments and guide treatment.”

To develop these five distinct profiles, Perrault—along with her fellow co-author Valeria Kebets from McGill University—relied on a treasure trove of data from the Human Connectome Project, which is an NIH-funded project to map macroscale connections across the human brain. Luckily, this included detailed data on hundreds of participants, at least 770 of which were used in this study, thanks to detailed notes of their sleep characteristics and brain imaging data. 

The scientists performed an analysis that discovered five general sleep profiles among the project's participants. The first profile discerns generally poor sleep, which in turn produced increased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. New Scientist reports that this group also showed signs of decreased connectivity in brain areas associated with self-reflection, meaning participants ruminated on their inner thoughts and feelings instead of taking in the external world. 

The second profile similarly showed signs of worse mental health, but none of the reported characteristics of bad sleep—this was known as “sleep resilience.” The remaining three groups focused on participants that used sleep aids, didn't achieve the minimum recommended seven hours of sleep per night, or woke up several times during the night, respectively. 

“The dominance of mental health markers in most of the profiles is not surprising as sleep is one of the five key domains of human functioning likely to affect mental health,” Kebets said in a press statement.

The authors hope this study will empower clinicians to use these profiles as a means to target treatment that's unique to each individual. By understanding how certain sleep characteristics impact other factors (such as mental health or social behavior), doctors can analyze symptoms to identify the sleep problems at the root of the issue. 

No two people are 100 percent the same, and now, science is showing us that this age-old maxim applies to our sleep as well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found a molecule that could stop Parkinson's in its tracks","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251008030949.htm","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 03:36:12 GMT","

Scientists from the University of Bath, working together with researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, have created a molecule that stops a key protein linked to Parkinson's disease and certain dementias from clumping together. The research team has shown that this molecule works in an animal model of Parkinson's and believes it could one day form the basis of a treatment that slows the disease's progression.

Alpha-synuclein is a protein found mainly inside brain cells (neurons), where it helps control the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the chemical that allows neurons to communicate with each other.

In Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein begins to stick together, forming toxic clusters that kill nerve cells. This cell loss leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulty with movement. Although existing therapies can ease these symptoms, none currently stop or reverse the underlying damage.

In its normal or ""native state,"" alpha-synuclein is a flexible strand, but when it becomes active it folds into a helix. This shape is crucial for its role in carrying and delivering dopamine within the brain.

The researchers designed a short peptide that locks alpha-synuclein into its healthy helical shape, preventing it from transforming into the harmful clusters that cause cell death.

Lab experiments revealed that the peptide remains stable, can enter brain-like cells, and reduces the buildup of toxic protein deposits while improving movement in a worm model of Parkinson's disease.

Published in the journal JACS Au, the study highlights how rational peptide design can turn large, unstable proteins into smaller, more drug-like molecules.

The findings mark a significant step towards developing new peptide-based treatments for currently untreatable neurodegenerative conditions. Professor Jody Mason, from the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Bath, said: ""Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems.

""This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited.""

Dr. Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, which funded the research, said:

""Dementia isn't an inevitable part of ageing; it's caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases.

""Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein.

""By stabilizing alpha-synuclein in its healthy form, this could open the door to a new class of treatments that could slow progression in diseases like Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies. We look forward to seeing this research taken to the next stage, potentially exploring how it would work in people.

""We're delighted to see such promising advances from Alzheimer's Research UK funded work opening up new avenues for treatments of the future, and the potential to change the lives of those affected by neurodegenerative diseases.""

Further research is needed, but the team hopes that continued progress will enable these and similar molecules to advance towards clinical testing in the coming years.

Of the 202 Nobel laureates who have been awarded prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows').

Among the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.

Source: nobelprize.org

Immigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That's because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that's the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”

The new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain'. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. Meanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.

Among those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.

Of the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds'). “What we have in the US is unique. It's a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.

But, the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of depature'), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.

Source: nobelprize.org

Among the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ'). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.

Source: nobelprize.org

The future of immigration's interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.

Already, international researchers are making moves to leave the United States, with other nations ready to woo them. France, South Korea and Canada have set up programmes to attract US researchers with awards and scholarships, for example. The European Research Council, which funds research in the European Union, is offering as much as €2 million ($2.3 million) to scientists who move their laboratories to the EU, with the goal of helping those moving from the United States.

In drug discovery processes, changing the core structures of lead compounds to a variety of other ring systems is often needed, which typically requires laborious de novo syntheses of individual analogues. Here we report a conceptually different approach that allows rapid access to diverse core structures from a common intermediate using 1,2-oxaborines as a versatile molecular platform. A soft enolization/6π-electrocyclization strategy has been developed to efficiently synthesize 1,2-oxaborines from readily available enones or enals. Taking advantage of their multifaceted reactivities, 1,2-oxaborines can undergo further C−H functionalization and be transformed into a diverse range of arenes, heteroarenes and non-aromatic heterocycles. Finally, late-stage preparations of a suite of analogues that contain Lipitor substituents but with different aromatic cores are demonstrated using the 1,2-oxaborine-based core diversification strategy.

Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges.

Scientists have developed a blood test that analyses epigenetic changes in immune cells. They say it could be used to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Credit: TEK Image/Science Photo Library

Researchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome may have a new weapon in their armoury. In a study published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on 8 October1, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.

A debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.

The results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.

Others in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.

A reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research

The underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.

The researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.

The authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.

“I think it's really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”

Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge

Many studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.

Behavioural addictions, characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding activities despite adverse consequences in the long term, are more heterogeneous and less well-understood than substance addictions, and there is a relative lack of translational research. This study investigates “excessive toy motivation” in domestic dogs as a potential parallel to behavioural addictions in humans. Employing a combination of a behavioural test and an owner questionnaire, we examined whether a subset of highly play-motived dogs meet key behavioural addiction criteria, including craving, salience, lack of self-control, and mood modification. Data from 105 highly play-motivated dogs revealed that 33 subjects exhibited behaviours consistent with addictive-like tendencies, including an excessive fixation on toys, reduced responsiveness to alternative stimuli, and persistent efforts to access toys. Owner-reported behaviours not only corroborated these findings but also demonstrated significant associations with behavioural test scores. Our results highlight parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and human behavioural addictions, with dogs as the only non-human species so far that appears to develop addictive-like behaviours spontaneously without artificial induction. This exploratory study provides foundational insights and proposes future research directions that have the potential to significantly deepen our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying behavioural addictions across species.

What is play? Why do many large-brained mammals engage in play throughout their lives? And what makes playing potentially addictive? Despite numerous publications on play and its possible functions, play has remained somewhat of a mystery1, being associated with no immediate adaptive function, although it has been suggested to allow animals to practice species-typical behaviours such as hunting, mating, or fighting with a competitor in a non-serious context1. Notwithstanding, play behaviour is ubiquitous among (at least young) mammals and some birds2,3, and in large-brained species in particular – from humans to dogs – it persists throughout life4,5. Still, no unified definition of play exists to date6, although there is some agreement that, at a proximate level, play makes us feel good7. Even in non-human animals, observers will often agree that playful activities look like fun7, with neurotransmitter systems mediating the rewarding aspects of play (opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine)8,9 appearing to be highly conserved across mammalian taxa10.

Bateson (2014) proposed a set of characteristics that are generally accepted to define play: it is spontaneous, intrinsically rewarding and “fun”; it is separate from serious consequences; it often involves novel or exaggerated actions and role reversal; it is repetitive, but distinct from stereotypies; and it usually occurs only in healthy, stress-free animals, making it a marker of well-being7. However, regarding the latter point, it has been highlighted that play can also represent an attempt to cope with suboptimal conditions (e.g. in nonhuman animals, play may occur as displacement behaviour in stressful situations5 or may serve to reduce social tensions)11. Also, in humans, playing computer games or gambling represents a way of coping with stress. Moreover, in some instances, what started as a fun activity can become compulsive and develop into a behavioural addiction12,13,14.

A behavioural addiction can be defined as “repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person (at least in the short-term), despite longer-term harm to the individual or others” (ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision))15. Unlike in compulsive disorders, where performance of the compulsive behaviour primarily serves to provide some relief from a negative affective state, i.e. via negative reinforcement, addictive behaviours originate because their performance generates positive affect, i.e. via positive reinforcement. However, as the addiction develops, the behaviour becomes compulsive and may even cease to be rewarding (reviewed by Freimuth et al.16. Behavioural addictions share underlying neurobiological processes17 and behavioural symptoms (such as craving, lack of self-control, tolerance, withdrawal and risk of relapse) with substance addictions17,18. Still, they are more heterogeneous and less well-understood19.

While a wide range of behaviours have the potential to become addictive in people (e.g. exercise, sex, shopping, work, etc.)19,20,21,22,23,24,25, to date, only the two disorders related to playing – gambling and internet gaming – are officially recognised as behavioural addictions in the two psychiatric manuals of psychological disorders (DSM-5 and ICD-11). The ICD-1115 included both gambling and internet gaming as behavioural addictions. In the 5th edition of DSM-526, gambling, previously classified as an impulse control disorder, was included under “substance-related and addictive disorders”19,26, while internet gaming was listed separately as “internet gaming disorder”26.

What would make behaviours related to playing so addictive? Play involves neurotransmitter systems (opioids, cannabinoids, and dopamine) that are also engaged in the rewarding aspects of food and drug rewards8,9. Thus, video games can provide players a hedonic experience and a high degree of relaxation27. Pathological gaming is an example of how seemingly normal and enjoyable behaviours can develop to disrupt regular social and environmental functioning28,29,30.

Compared to substance addiction, there are only a few animal models of behavioural addictions. Moreover, these are restricted to controlled laboratory settings, and addictive-like behaviour has to be actively induced31. Rodent models have been used to investigate compulsive eating (e.g. reviewed in31, exercise addiction (wheel running32,33), gambling34, and responses to sexual reward35. Mice selectively bred for excessive wheel-running, sometimes referred to as an addiction-prone phenotype, develop physiological withdrawal symptoms similar to those found in drug addiction after abstinence36. As with excessive exercise in humans, wheel-running in rodents may become disruptive to everyday activities, leading to impaired nest-building and sheltering behaviour37,38. The animals may continue to wheel-run despite disrupted sleep39 or even in the face of injury40, thus fulfilling the behavioural addiction criterion “persistence of the behaviour despite adverse consequences”41. This suggests that behavioural addictions are not unique to the human species.

There is, however, only one species that appears to display addictive-like behaviour spontaneously, without intentional experimental induction: the domestic dog (although inadvertent promotion of addictive-like behaviour by the caretakers cannot be ruled out). A small subset of dogs – colloquially referred to as “ball junkies” – appear to demonstrate an addictive-like desire for object play42.

Like humans, domestic dogs frequently remain playful throughout their lives1, engaging in both social and object-related play, as well as combinations (e.g. tug-of-war9. Solitary object play appears to be related to predatory behaviour9; accordingly the development of social and object play may reflect different selective histories of dog breeds, which were selected for various purposes such as hunting, guarding, herding, and other functions6,7,8.

Toy play is a potent reinforcer, especially in working dog training43,44,45. For instance, detection dogs working in public settings are typically not rewarded with food due to concerns about undesirable food-seeking behaviours in the field. Still, they will work persistently for their toy rewards. It has been argued that artificial selection has exaggerated play behaviour in adult dogs, especially in working breeds or working lines, where high toy motivation is often actively selected as a predictor of performance46. For example, in Labrador retrievers, working lines demonstrate higher playfulness than show lines, indicating a genetic basis for play motivation and potential for artificial selection47.

Playing with toys allows dogs to express instinctive predatory sequences such as chasing, catching, possessing and “dissecting”, considered to be intrinsically rewarding to them based on their species and breed histories48. None of this is pathological, nor is gambling or computer gaming in people. However, such highly rewarding activities have the potential to become obsessive in humans49,50, and the same may be true for dogs.

While addictive-like behaviour towards toys in dogs has not been studied to date, the phenomenon has been described in the lay literature (where affected dogs may be referred to as ‘ball junkies'), and it has been (rarely) alluded to in the scientific literature. Lazarowski et al.48 describe how some dogs show behavioural and physiological signs of high arousal in relation to toys, lack of self-control, and behaviours such as whining, barking, spinning, and other behavioural signs of stress when access to a toy is prevented (e.g. because the dog is restrained), suggested as an expression of their inability to manage the frustration of anticipation46. All these signs could be interpreted as indicative of craving (and frustration when the urge cannot be fulfilled).

In humans, addictive behaviours are often associated with deficits in inhibitory control and heightened cue-reactivity and craving, which are likely key mechanisms in addiction, particularly when exposed to behaviour-specific cues51,52,53.

In animal models of addictions, not only is an increased motivation to work for the rewarding substance notable, but the animals also continue seeking the reward even when it is signalled to be unavailable54. Similarly, excessively toy-motivated dogs may continue to try to gain access to a toy even when the caretaker has put it away (anecdotal evidence55. Dogs that appear obsessed with toys cannot be easily distracted from their fixation on the preferred object – demonstrating the high salience of the toy. Such dogs may even lose interest in other stimuli or social interactions as long as they have access to the toy, or sometimes even when it has been removed from reach55 – i.e., everyday functioning may be affected. Moreover, some dogs may continue playing (e.g., running tirelessly after balls thrown for them) despite adverse consequences, such as over-exertion or even injury in the short term and damage to joints and ligaments in the longer term56.

Thus, we suggest that ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs may show parallels to behavioural addictions in humans. Domestic dogs share many complex behavioural traits with us57,and they are commonly used as model species to explore compulsive behaviours58,59; cognitive ageing60,61,62, ADHD63,64,65, neuroticism66 and autism67,68,69.

Here, we aim to provide the first scientific evaluation of ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs, develop methods to assess this phenomenon, and investigate whether ‘excessive toy motivation' in pet dogs meets the defining criteria of behavioural addictions. Due to the heterogeneity of behavioural addictions, the number and description of diagnostic criteria are inconsistent in the scientific literature, even in humans19. We decided to explore whether the most common behavioural addiction criteria can be adapted to dogs: (1) craving, (2) salience, (3) mood modification through carrying out the behaviour, (4) lack of self-control, (5) tolerance, (6) withdrawal symptoms, (7) external consequences (the addictive behaviour causes conflict with other activities, other individuals, or within the individual), and (8) relapse after abstinence from the activity (cf28,41,70,71. Two additional criteria are used for diagnosing behavioural addictions in humans: having problems at home or work and lying to/deceiving people close to them26,72. Since these criteria cannot be applied to animals, we focused only on the eight abovementioned criteria.

We developed a behavioural test exposing pet dogs to various situations where behavioural addiction criteria in relation to toys can be expressed. Only the first four of the criteria mentioned above can be measured in a single behavioural assessment. The remaining criteria were included in an accompanying questionnaire, in which the dogs' owners were asked about their dogs' everyday behaviour.

While this study is exploratory, given the lack of prior research in this area, we used convergent methodologies in an attempt to assess internal and external validity. We predicted that dogs classified as having a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour based on our continuous Addictive-like Behaviour Test score, would:

Show higher scores for the individual behavioural addiction criteria: Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control in the behaviour test,

Show higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an unavailable toy in the behaviour test,

Receive higher scores on the owner questionnaire designed to measure dogs' addictive-like behaviour in everyday life,

than dogs classified as having a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour.

The study was assessed and approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland (Licence number BE115/17). All procedures were performed in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioral Research and Teaching” of the Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. All dog owners provided written informed consent for their participation.

One hundred twenty-six dog-owner teams were recruited via advertisements on social media. In the first call, any play-motivated dog was welcome to participate. In a second call, we specifically sought dogs showing ‘excessive' motivation for toy play.

Twenty-one of the 126 tested dogs were excluded from the analysis as they were (1) outside the target age range (< 1 year or > 10 years old; N = 9), (2) did not complete the test due to fatigue (N = 1), (3) did not play at all or were too fearful for pulse measurements (N = 7), or (4) due to disturbances during the test (e.g. owners bringing young children along, N = 4). The final sample (N = 105) included 56 males (34 neutered or chemically castrated, 20 intact and 2 cryptorchids) and 49 females (34 neutered and 15 intact), ranging in age from 12 months to 10 years (mean age = 5.09 years, SD = 2.6). The dogs belonged to various breeds (for demographics, see Supplementary Table 1). Eighty-two owners (72 women and 10 men) participated in the study.

Behaviour tests took place in an experimental room (Fig. 1), measuring 5.22 m x 3.36 m. A wooden partition wall divided the room into two parts so that the effective testing space was 3.60 m x 3.36 m. The room was furnished with two chairs and several shelves on the walls. One of the chairs was placed in front of the wooden partition wall (facing the entrance door), and the other was placed at a 90° angle against the wall to the left. In front of both chairs, a taped line marked a one-meter distance from the chairs. During the habituation phase, the opaque box in which a toy or food was enclosed during several subtests (hereafter, unsolvable task box) was placed next to the experimenter's chair.

Four video cameras (IB8377-H; 4 MP, 30 fps, H.264, WDR Pro, IR, PoE, IP66, 2.8–12 mm) were placed in the room, and recordings were made using the recorder system (ND9441P NVR, 16-CH, 4HDD, H.265, HDMI/VGA, 16x PoE).

Experimental room with the experimenter and owner in the starting position.

The test battery consisted of 14 subtests assessing various aspects of toy motivation in dogs. Play behaviour per se cannot be used to infer addictive-like behaviour, which is characterised primarily by reactions when the reward is unavailable; therefore, only subtests relevant to exploring behavioural addiction criteria are described in detail hereafter. The complete description of the play motivation test is available under: https://figshare.com/s/dfd6d12d922f7543b96c.

After the owner and the dog had entered the test room, the dog was unleashed, and a 3-minute habituation phase commenced (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the owner and the experimenter were seated on their allocated chairs, and the experimenter explained the test procedure. The owner signed the consent form. The owners were instructed to interact with the dog only when asked to perform one of the subtests and not to use food during testing unless absolutely necessary (such as exchanging food for a toy if the dog was unwilling to relinquish it).

After the habituation phase, the experimenter retrieved a box containing various commercial dog toys of different sizes and textures, with and without squeakers, etc., from the adjacent storage room. Only toys that might be associated with food enrichment were excluded. The owner was asked to select three toys (one ball, one tug toy and one plush toy) which they thought the dog would like the most. If the owner had brought the dog's favourite toy from home, this toy was used in the subsequent preference test along with two other toys. 

After removing the toy box from the room, the experimenter returned to the test room. The owner recalled the dog and sat down on their chair, holding the dog behind the Line marking the 1 m distance from the chair. Opposite the dog at the front of the room, the experimenter placed the three toys on the floor in a row, 40 cm apart. After the experimenter had returned to her chair, the owner released the dog, who could now explore and play with the toys for 30 s. The two people present did not interact with the dog during this time. The toy the dog spent the most time interacting with was used for subsequent testing. Forty-five dogs selected a ball, nine selected a tug toy, 39 selected a plush toy, and 12 selected a hybrid toy (plush ball: N = 3; tug with a ball: N = 6; plush tug: N = 3). On rare occasions, the dog did not show interest in any of the toys. In this case, the owner was asked to choose the type of toy the dog was usually most interested in at home. The chosen toy was used throughout the experiment, and the remaining two toys were placed on the shelf out of reach and sight of the dog. If the preferred toy was not a tug toy, the tug toy was used in subtests where the owner or experimenter played tug-of-war with the dog.

A description of the subtests and, when applicable, their relevance for addiction criteria coding is given in Table 1.

Videos were coded using Solomon Coder (Solomon Coder beta 19.08.02, Copyright 2006–2019 by Andràs Péter).

For most subtests, the starting point for coding was when the experimenter and the owner were sitting on their chairs, and the dog was behind the Line, which marked a 1 m distance from the owner's chair (Fig. 1).

Qualitative and quantitative coding was performed by coders who were not involved in the experiments.

Three different coding approaches were employed:

Scoring of individual variables that may be indicative of addictive behaviour each minute, which were later summed up as Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (Table 2); coder: KS.

Coding of presence/absence of the four addiction criteria in each minute of each subtest; coder: KS.

Quantitative coding.

Scoring and point sampling of behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” (Table 4); coder: FL.

Coding of absolute durations of behaviours in subtests where the toy was rendered inaccessible (unsolvable task box and toy on a shelf, see Table 4); coders: DZ and AH.

A second coder (AM) performed reliability coding of addictive-like behaviours and behavioural addiction criteria and point sampling for 15 dogs. Reliability between the two coders who coded the durations was also analysed for 15 dogs. Reliability was good or excellent for all included variables (ICC, absolute agreement, single measures, two-way mixed-effects model, computed in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) (see Supplementary Table 3 for full results).

To quantify dogs' propensity for addictive-like behaviour as objectively as possible, we introduced the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (AB-T score). Applicable sub-criteria were rated for each minute of the test, and for analysis, each sub-criterion was assigned a score between 0 and 2 points, as detailed in Table 2. The points from all the subtests, including the cool-down period, were added to yield the AB-T score. The maximum possible value of the AB-T score was 120 points. A cut-off point for addictive-like behaviour was defined by a data range split divided into two halves. Dogs scoring equal to or above the mid-point (44.2 points) are referred to as dogs showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour or high-AB dogs.

Dogs scoring less than 44.2 points are referred to as low-AB dogs (dogs with a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour). The sub-criteria included in the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (as detailed in Table 2) were selected as they were assumed to be relatively independent of the level of obedience and training. Dogs might have been trained to drop a toy on a cue and to exert impulse control and refrain from jumping towards the toy in the experimenter's hand; therefore, these variables were not included in the AB-T score. However, behaviours such as staring at the toy or pacing are believed to be less subject to training and were included.

Separately from the AB-T variables, in each subtest, the addiction criteria Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control were rated each minute as present or absent based on the occurrence of pre-defined behaviours. For instance, Salience was inferred from searching for a toy although there was an »attractive alternative« (food, owner inviting the dog to play). Craving was based on the dog focusing mainly on the toy (> 50%) and medium to high arousal directed at the inaccessible toy (inferred from behaviours such as panting, restlessness, and high muscle tension). We further coded behaviours that are usually characteristic of high arousal in some dogs, e.g., pacing, jumping towards the toy, and vocalising (see Table 3). If at least one of the pre-defined behaviours was expressed, the respective addiction criterion was coded as present. Tolerance, Withdrawal symptoms and Risk of relapse after abstinence could not be tested in the setting of the play motivation test since they develop over time.

For each subtest, a summary score for each of the four addiction criteria was computed by summing up the points for each minute of the subtest.

Selected behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” were coded by point sampling at 3-second intervals and then extrapolated to proportions of time (Table 4). Based on a subsample of dogs coded using both point sampling and absolute durations of behaviour, we determined sufficient agreement between the two measurement methods, justifying the use of point sampling. During subtests where a reward was inaccessible in the unsolvable task box, the absolute duration of interacting with the box (with low or high effort) was coded (Table 4). For detailed definitions of quantitatively coded variables, see Supplementary Table 2.

A questionnaire was developed (available in English and German) (for inter- and intra-rater reliability based on over 1500 dogs recruited via an online survey; see Supplementary Table 6). The questions relating to behavioural addiction criteria relevant to the present manuscript are shown in Table 5. They were rated on a 5-point Likert scale indicating the extent of agreement with the statement (1 – strongly disagree; 2 – partly disagree; 3 – neither agree nor disagree; 4 – partly agree; 5 – strongly agree). The dog owners were asked to complete this questionnaire during the cool-down period of the behavioural test.

SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) was used to compute a Categorical Principal Component Analysis and Mann-Whitney U tests. R version 4.1.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021) was used to create boxplots and to calculate linear models.

We calculated summary scores for the four addiction criteria for each subtest by summing up the points for each minute. Using Mann-Whitney U tests, we tested whether there was a difference in the addiction criteria Craving, Lack of self-control, Mood modification and Salience between dogs classified as high-AB dogs (AB-T score ≥ 44.2 points) and low-AB dogs (AB-T score < 44.2 points). Note that although components of Salience and craving were used to calculate the AB-T score, these are not identical to the 1 − 0 variables of Salience and craving here. While the addiction criteria were coded as 1/0 for each minute, the variables included in the AB-T score were more detailed, and individual elements potentially indicative of addictive-like behaviour were differentiated. Mood modification and Lack of self-control were not used in the designation of the AB-T score. See Sect. 1.6 and Table 3 for more details.

We performed Mann-Whitney U tests to assess whether high-AB and low-AB dogs differed in quantitatively coded variables such as time engaging with the toy during different subtests, attempting to attain an unavailable toy, etc. (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

Linear models were used to assess associations between the addictive-like behaviour score and the 19 questionnaire questions targeting addictive-like behaviour. Model requirements were checked by visually assessing normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals. If applicable, the dependent variable was transformed.

Additionally, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test whether the 19 questionnaire scores differed between high-AB and low-AB dogs. This was the case for fifteen questions; therefore, these were summed up to generate an Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score). Cohen's R was used as a measure of effect size.

Both intra-rater reliability (available for 274 dogs, including dogs from the online survey) and inter-rater reliability (available for 24 dogs) of the AB-Q score were very good (see Supplementary Table 6).

Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no correction for multiple testing was performed (as recommended by73.

The mid-point of the data range of the AB-T score was 44.2 (range 6.6–95). Therefore, dogs scoring 44.2 or higher were classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour (high-AB dogs). This was the case for thirty-three of the 105 highly play-motivated dogs tested, with a mean score of 59.7 points and a median of 58.6. The mean AB-T score for low-AB dogs (< 44.2 points) was 23.1, and the median was 22.8. For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 7.

Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that high-AB dogs scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on craving (U = 217, p < 0.0001), salience (U = 208, p < 0.0001), and lack of self-control (U = 756.5, p = 0.002), but not mood modification (U = 1022, p = 0.157), in the behaviour test (see Supplementary Table 4, Figs. 2a-d). For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 8.

High-AB dogs interacted significantly longer with the box than low-AB dogs in the ‘toy in the box' subtest (U = 675.5, p < 0.0001). They also spent more time looking at the toy on the shelf during the ‘toy on shelf' subtest (U = 414.5, p < 0.0001) and the ‘social play without toys' subtest (U = 942.5, p = 0.021), while focusing less on the owner in the latter (U = 819.5, p = 0.011) compared to low-AB dogs (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 2e and f). However, time spent interacting with the toy while the owner and experimenter were out of the room did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs (U = 994, p = 0.135; Supplementary Table 5). For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 9.

Linear models demonstrated significant associations between the AB-T score and 18 out of 19 individual questions (Table 6). However, according to Mann-Whitney U tests, only fifteen questions differed significantly between dogs classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour in the behaviour test (AB-T score ≥ 44.2) and those that did not. These fifteen questions (Cohen's R > 0.2 – see Table 6) were summed up into the Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score) (see Table 6).

This study represents the beginning of the exploration of addictive-like behaviour in domestic dogs. Convergent behavioural measures support the existence of an addictive-like behavioural phenotype in 33 of the 105 tested highly play-motivated dogs. Note that we specifically sought dogs exhibiting extreme behaviour; thus, this proportion is not a reflection of the general population. Perhaps not surprising, working breeds – many of which are known to have been artificially selected for high toy or predatory motivation74,75,76 – were overrepresented in the sample.

As predicted, dogs classified as high-AB dogs based on the detailed AB-T score (Addictive-like Behaviour Test score) scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on the individual criteria craving, salience, and lack of self-control in the behaviour test. Contrary to the prediction, mood modification (when given access to a toy) did not differ between high and low-AB dogs. In retrospect, however, this lack of difference between the two groups strengthens our argument that we were measuring a phenotype beyond mere enjoyment of play. Still, despite the significant differences between high- and low-AB dogs in the other investigated addiction criteria, Salience, Craving and Loss of Self Control, there was generally high variation between individuals.

In line with the predictions, high-AB dogs showed higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an inaccessible toy than low-AB dogs, often prioritising attempting to access the toy over eating or interacting with the owner. Thus, there was general agreement between the three alternative methods of coding the data (detailed behaviour score, addiction criteria, and quantitative coding), indicating internal consistency.

The external validity of the behaviour test was demonstrated by significant associations of the AB-T score with 18 out of 19 questions from the addictive-like behaviour questionnaire filled in by the dogs' owners, intended to measure addictive-like behaviour in everyday life. Nonetheless, although significant, the effect sizes were relatively low, indicating that no single question would have predictive value for assessing a tendency for addictive-like behaviour in dogs.

In studies using animal models of substance addiction, one way to differentiate an addiction from drug use that occurs due to lack of choice is to present the subject with a choice between the addictive substance and other highly desirable stimuli. If an individual continues to take the drug at the expense of these other options (such as consumption of a food reward), this points to the possibility of addictive-like behaviour77,78. Consistent with this, high-AB dogs showed a loss of interest in other relevant stimuli, focusing on the inaccessible toy and foregoing the opportunity to consume food or to engage with their owner. The latter is also reminiscent of behavioural addictions in humans, leading to a decline in social interactions79.

The intense toy-seeking and loss of interest in other stimuli, despite the availability of food or social interaction – considered as indicators for salience and persistence – might resemble “hyperfocus,” a trait associated with ADHD and autism in humans80,81. However, unlike typical hyperfocus, which often emerges in the absence of competing stimuli, dogs in our study were presented with alternative salient rewards (e.g., the toy was placed on a shelf while the owner actively invited the dog to engage in social play; in another subtest, food was available in a puzzle toy while the preferred toy was inaccessible in a closed container), and they still showed a preference for the inaccessible toy. Like dogs with ADHD, dogs in the current study with high AB-T scores in general exhibited high impulsivity (labelled as “loss of self-control”), and some individuals displayed heightened activity (which could be interpreted as the hyperactivity component of ADHD64,65 in particular during the cool-down period. Thus, further research is needed to explore commonalities and differences between addictive-like behaviour and ADHD-like behaviour in dogs. While dogs with a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour might exhibit many characteristics of dogs with ADHD, the converse is not necessarily true – dogs might show ADHD-like behaviour without displaying any hyperfixation on toys.

Another characteristic of addicted individuals is that they are willing to pursue their addiction even if it has adverse consequences82. In the current study, “adversity” was elicited by the owner and the experimenter leaving the room in order to assess the effect of social isolation on the behavioural addiction criteria. Isolation in an unfamiliar place is well-established as a stressful experience for dogs83,84,85,86. However, this subtest was not a good measure of addictive-like behaviour: Time spent interacting with the toy while the dog was alone did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs. For welfare reasons, we decided against exposing the dogs to more severe stressors; however, it cannot be ruled out that this subtest was not “aversive” enough. The dog was left alone for only 30 seconds, and the subtest took place in the middle of the test when the dogs were already habituated to the test room. It is also possible that individual differences in subjects' separation distress, independent of play motivation, affected the results. Additionally, there was no clear contingency between interacting with the toy and the ‘adverse' outcome (owner leaving). Future studies could potentially enhance the design by providing the dog with an explicit choice, such as by placing the toy in a separate room, away from the owner and the experimenter. This could help determine whether the dog is willing to risk being alone in an unusual or new environment when it normally prefers the safety of being near its owner. Such a design would better reflect the conflict between competing motivations (social security vs. reward seeking) and could offer a more valid test of the criterion of persistence under adversity.

Still, the importance of continued efforts to engage in the behaviour despite adverse consequences was demonstrated in the questionnaire, where one of the highest associations with the AB-T score was found with the question, “My dog will continue to play with a ball/toy despite adverse consequences”. This suggests that some dogs may fulfil the criterion of continuing the addictive-like behaviour despite adverse consequences in real life, even if this could not be demonstrated in the behaviour test.

A critical factor in addiction is the propensity to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards87,88. In humans, cues associated with addictive behaviours, such as specific locations or objects, can induce craving and drug administration88,89. In dogs, a toy such as a ball could represent such as a conditioned cue. It may achieve its value, for example, by the experience of chasing and catching. For many domestic dogs, balls or other toys possess incentive salience, according to the three criteria by Robinson and Berridge49: they (1) “elicit approach” (i.e. they become “wanted” and act as “motivational magnets”); (2) “they can energise ongoing actions by eliciting cue-triggered wanting”; (3) “they can act as reinforcers in their own right, reinforcing the acquisition of a new instrumental response (measurable by conditioned reinforcement)” (cf49, p. 3139].).

The perceived value of the toy was demonstrated in our study by many dogs having difficulty relinquishing the toy. It can be speculated that balls become ‘motivational magnets' by being associated with species-typical predatory behaviour (cf48. The high salience of the toy was especially apparent in subtests where dogs were foregoing available alternatives such as freely available food or social play with the owner, at the expense of trying to regain their inaccessible toy.

In both rodents and humans90,91, individuals with a higher tendency to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards (sign trackers) are more vulnerable to addiction than goal trackers, who focus primarily on the (location of the) reward itself88,92, see the meta-analysis by93. Tendency to sign-track vs. goal-track is associated with the risk of addiction and is also related to variations in the dopaminergic system and stress physiology88.

While it was not explicitly measured in the current study, in dogs, a tendency to sign track might be advantageous in a training context – i.e., maintaining motivation would be easier in dogs that are not only sensitive to rewards but also attribute value to the cues predicting these rewards, even if not always followed by a primary reinforcer. Sensitivity to reward – and propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward-predictive cues – would thus be highly relevant traits in relation to trainability and might be selected for especially in working dog breeds.

Several publications state the importance of ‘obsessive' play motivation for working dog success42,94,95,96,97,98,99. Dogs with extreme toy motivation are believed to show better focus, reduced distractibility and greater trainability97,99. However, if such motivation becomes addictive-like, it needs to be questioned whether the well-being of these dogs may be compromised. If dogs prioritise toy interactions over other essential aspects of their daily lives this may have maladaptive effects, as is the case in humans with behavioural addictions100,101. Certainly, adverse health consequences may arise from repetitive ball chasing, like straining ligaments and joints56. Moreover, welfare would be compromised when dogs experience a high level of frustration when access to their reward is prevented (cf102.

Anecdotally, when play motivation becomes excessive, irritability, high arousal levels, and frustration may negatively affect dogs' trainability and work103. Indeed, as stated by Mathews96, the high ‘drive' of search dogs often makes them unsuitable as family pets, which is also supported by owner reports that pet dogs with extreme motivation for toys are often problematic to control102.

Thus, it needs to be questioned when play becomes maladaptive. Do high-AB dogs still ‘like' to play, or have they progressed to primarily ‘wanting' and the compulsive need to continue104?. Similar to the escalating engagement seen in human behavioural addictions105, some dogs would repeatedly spin, jump, focus or bark towards the unavailable toy on the shelf for the duration of the subtest. Two dogs even managed to destroy the box enclosing their favourite toy. These behaviours might be likened to the repetitive actions observed in individuals with behavioural addictions41. Nonetheless, such behaviours may also occur in other behavioural phenotypes such as canine compulsive disorder or autism spectrum-like behaviours106. Further research is needed to elucidate commonalities and differences between such phenotypes in dogs.

Behavioural addictions in humans often involve emotional dependency on specific activities107. Whether dogs similarly seek comfort, stimulation, or stress relief through persistent engagement with the toy could not be determined in the context of the behaviour test. In the questionnaire, “Is attached to the favourite toy” was the only question not significantly associated with the AB-T score. Thus, further research is required to determine whether dogs develop an emotional dependency on their toys (as described anecdotally).

To better understand the origin and possible functional underpinnings of excessive toy-directed behaviour in dogs, future research should examine whether similar patterns of excessive object play occur in non-domesticated canids. While data are limited, recent studies have shown that both hand-reared and wild wolf pups engage in object play108. For instance, wolf pups have been observed developing a preference for toys and spending increasing amounts of time with them over time108. Hand-reared wolf pups will even retrieve objects to humans109. In the wild, wolves have also been seen interacting with human-made objects110. These findings suggest that object play is not unique to dogs but rather could represent a broader trait shared by canids. Comparative studies are needed to assess how common and functionally relevant such behaviours are in wolves, which would help clarify the biological basis of the addictive-like behaviours observed in some dogs.

Being the first of its kind, this study has its limitations. As no gold standard exists, the study is exploratory, and our categorisation of dogs into high and low addictive-like behaviour groups, determined by a data range split, was somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, the assignment of high- and low-AB categories corresponded well to the first author's personal assessment of addictive-like tendencies in the participant dogs.

In interpreting the questionnaire results, it is important to acknowledge the potential biases associated with using owner-reported questionnaires. Owners may unintentionally project their perceptions or expectations onto their dogs' behaviours, potentially leading to discrepancies between reported and observed behaviours in behavioural test. This is particularly relevant in cases where owners have multiple dogs, as they are likely to compare their pets to one another, influencing their assessment, such as by underestimating or overestimating certain behaviours. For instance, an owner with a highly active dog may rate their less active dog as overly calm. Integrating owner reports and objective testing allows for a more comprehensive and accurate canine behaviour evaluation.

To conclude, there appear to be parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and behavioural addictions in humans. Interestingly, also in humans, the first officially recognised behavioural addictions (gambling and internet gaming) originate in play28,29,30,111. Generally, play is an activity that induces a pleasurable emotional state6. In humans, much evidence suggests that video games can affect people's lives positively. They make players feel better about themselves, help raise their self-esteem and assist people in dealing with everyday stress111. Some people are excessive gamers, but only a minority would be classified as addicts111,112,113. Similarly, many dogs may greatly enjoy toy play without developing harmful compulsions (cf. in humans28,29,30,111).

Despite the observed parallels between high-AB dogs and humans affected by behavioural addictions, we refrain from conclusively characterising high-AB dogs as exhibiting addictive behaviour, given the absence of established benchmarks or standardised criteria. It is important to be cautious when pathologising behaviour, especially given that even in humans, addictive behaviours are still difficult to define and measure114. To further understand possible parallels in the processes underlying behavioural addictions in humans and excessive toy motivation in dogs, subsequent research endeavours should seek to correlate individual differences in addictive-like behaviour in dogs with characteristics associated with addictive behaviours in humans, such as high impulsivity, impaired reversal learning, heightened perseveration, and delayed extinction of previously rewarded responses115,116.

The developer behind Eyes Up, one of the many Immigration and Customs Enforcement-related apps removed by Apple in recent days, was busy on Wednesday evening at a local planning session for the nationwide “No Kings” protest, scheduled for later this month. When WIRED eventually reached him by phone, he asked to be only identified by his first name, Mark, for safety reasons. “The administration will act on their grudges,” he says. “And they are not afraid to do so, frequently.”

He should know.

Mark's app, a platform built to serve as a repository for videos and other materials documenting ICE activity, is not alone in getting kicked off Apple's App Store. Earlier in October, ICEBlock was among the first ICE-related apps Apple removed. The decision followed claims from US attorney general Pam Bondi that such tools endanger ICE officers. Apple has also removed other tracking apps—including Red Dot and DEICER—as well as Eyes Up.

Like Mark, ICEBlock's developer, Joshua Aaron, is determined to reverse the app store bans. “While I cannot speak to specifics right now, I can tell you that ICEBlock has an incredible legal team behind it and we are going to do everything in our power to fight this,” Aaron tells WIRED.

Apple did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

Regarding Eyes Up, Mark says he has already appealed Apple's decision to delist the app, twice.“I will appeal every single time they reject me, until it's back in the App Store,” he says. “Because it's pure cowardice, what they're doing. I'm not gonna let off the gas with Apple.”

The ban ignited a fire under Mark, who's performing more community outreach to let people know about Eyes Up and encouraging them to upload publicly documented encounters with ICE agents to the app, which is still currently available on the Google Play store and the Eyes Up website.

Rafael Concepcion, who was previously a professor at Syracuse University, first designed DEICER to be a “rights app,” with the ICE-location map added on as an accountability tool. Concepcion was heavily inspired by musician Peter Gabriel and his WITNESS organization, started in the 1990s, that documented human rights violations. While gone from Apple's App Store, DEICER is also still available via Google Play and a website.

While Apple has not yet commented on its decisions to remove ICE monitoring apps from the App Store, Migrant Insider reported this week that in the case of the DEICER iOS app, the company justified removal under a developer guideline that prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content” toward “religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups.” Google, which has also removed ICE monitoring apps in recent days, told 404 Media last week that it also considers ICE officers to be a vulnerable group.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tools that include a law enforcement monitoring or transparency mechanism are not unprecedented in mobile apps, though. In fact, Apple and Google both develop apps with these features. The driving directions and traffic app Waze—which is owned by Google and can also be downloaded for iOS—has long offered a crowdsourced tool for reporting and receiving alerts about police sightings on public roads. Apple Maps and Google Maps offer similar features.

“I am not in favor of Apple removing ICE-tracking apps from the App Store, nor the app that simply let users archive videos of ICE,” says Riana Pfefferkorn, a policy researcher at Stanford University. “This seems like more needless kowtowing by Tim Cook.” The Apple CEO has appeared at several events with President Donald Trump and reportedly donated $1 million to attend his inauguration.

Legal experts WIRED spoke with say that the ICE monitoring and documentation apps that Apple has removed from its App Store are clear examples of protected speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment. “These apps are publishing constitutionally protected speech. They're publishing truthful information about matters of public interest that people obtained just by witnessing public events,” says David Greene, a civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

This hasn't stopped the Trump administration from attacking the developers behind these ICE-related apps. When ICEBlock first rose to a top spot in Apple's App Store in April, the Trump administration responded by threatening to prosecute the developer. “We are looking at him,” Bondi said on Fox News of ICEBlock's Aaron. “And he better watch out.”

Neither the White House nor ICE immediately responded to requests for comment.

Digital rights researchers say that the situation illustrates the dangers when key platforms and communication channels are centrally controlled—whether directly by governments or by other powerful entities like big tech companies. Regardless of what is officially available through the Google Play store, Android users can sideload apps of their choosing. But Apple's ecosystem has always been a walled garden, an approach that the company has long touted for its security advantages, including the ability to screen more heavily for malicious apps.

For years, a group of researchers and enthusiasts have tried to create “jailbreaks” for iPhones to essentially hack their own devices as a way around Apple's closed ecosystem. Recently, though, jailbreaking has become less common. This is partly the result of advances in iPhone security, but partly related to the trend in recent years of attackers exploiting complex chains of vulnerabilities that could potentially be used for jailbreaking for malware instead, particularly mercenary spyware.

""The closed ecosystem motivation sort of dwindled as Apple added capabilities that previously required a jailbreak—like wallpapers, tethering, better notifications, and private mode in Safari,"" says longtime iOS security and jailbreak researcher Will Strafach. “But this situation with ICE apps highlights the issue with Apple being the arbiter and single point of failure.”

Stanford's Pfefferkorn warns that while US tech companies are not state-controlled, they have in her view become “happy handmaidens” when it comes to “repressing free speech and dissent.”

“It's especially disappointing,” Pfefferkorn says, “coming from the company that brought us the Think Different ad campaign, which invoked MLK, Gandhi, and Muhammad Ali—none of whom would likely be big fans of ICE today.”

Reflection AI, a startup founded just last year by two former Google DeepMind researchers, has raised $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation, a whopping 15x leap from its $545 million valuation just seven months ago. The company, which originally focused on autonomous coding agents, is now positioning itself as both an open source alternative to closed frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, and a Western equivalent to Chinese AI firms like DeepSeek.

The startup was launched in March 2024 by Misha Laskin, who led reward modeling for DeepMind's Gemini project, and Ioannis Antonoglou, who co-created AlphaGo, the AI system that famously beat the world champion in the board game Go in 2016. Their background developing these very advanced AI systems is central to their pitch, which is that the right AI talent can build frontier models outside established tech giants.

Along with its new round, Reflection AI announced that it has recruited a team of top talent from DeepMind and OpenAI, and built an advanced AI training stack that it promises will be open for all. Perhaps most importantly, Reflection AI says it has “identified a scalable commercial model that aligns with our open intelligence strategy.”

Reflection AI's team currently numbers about 60 people — mostly AI researchers and engineers across infrastructure, data training, and algorithm development, per Laskin, the company's CEO. Reflection AI has secured a compute cluster and hopes to release a frontier language model next year that's trained on “tens of trillions of tokens,” he told TechCrunch.

“We built something once thought possible only inside the world's top labs: a large-scale LLM and reinforcement learning platform capable of training massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models at frontier scale,” Reflection AI wrote in a post on X. “We saw the effectiveness of our approach first-hand when we applied it to the critical domain of autonomous coding. With this milestone unlocked, we're now bringing these methods to general agentic reasoning.”

MoE refers to a specific architecture that powers frontier LLMs —  systems that, previously, only large, closed AI labs were capable of training at scale. DeepSeek had a breakthrough moment when it figured out how to train these models at scale in an open way, followed by Qwen, Kimi, and other models in China.

“DeepSeek and Qwen and all these models are our wake-up call because if we don't do anything about it, then effectively, the global standard of intelligence will be built by someone else,” Laskin said. “It won't be built by America.”

Laskin added that this puts the U.S. and its allies at a disadvantage because enterprises and sovereign states often won't use Chinese models due to potential legal repercussions.

“So you can either choose to live at a competitive disadvantage or rise to the occasion,” Laskin said. 

American technologists have largely celebrated Reflection AI's new mission. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, posted on X: “It's great to see more American open source AI models. A meaningful segment of the global market will prefer the cost, customizability, and control that open source offers. We want the U.S. to win this category too.”

Clem Delangue, co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face, an open and collaborative platform for AI builders, told TechCrunch of the round, “This is indeed great news for American open-source AI.” Added Delangue, “Now the challenge will be to show high velocity of sharing of open AI models and datasets (similar to what we're seeing from the labs dominating in open-source AI).”

Reflection AI's definition of being “open” seems to center on access rather than development, similar to strategies from Meta with Llama or Mistral. Laskin said Reflection AI would release model weights — the core parameters that determine how an AI system works — for public use while largely keeping datasets and full training pipelines proprietary.

“In reality, the most impactful thing is the model weights, because the model weights anyone can use and start tinkering with them,” Laskin said. “The infrastructure stack, only a select handful of companies can actually use that.”

That balance also underpins Reflection AI's business model. Researchers will be able to use the models freely, Laskin said, but revenue will come from large enterprises building products on top of Reflection AI's models and from governments developing “sovereign AI” systems, meaning AI models developed and controlled by individual nations.

“Once you get into that territory where you're a large enterprise, by default you want an open model,” Laskin said. “You want something you will have ownership over. You can run it on your infrastructure. You can control its costs. You can customize it for various workloads. Because you're paying some ungodly amount of money for AI, you want to be able to optimize it as much as much as possible, and really that's the market that we're serving.”

Reflection AI hasn't yet released its first model, which will be largely text-based, with multimodal capabilities in the future, according to Laskin. It will use the funds from this latest round to get the compute resources needed to train the new models, the first of which the company is aiming to release early next year.

Investors in Reflection AI's latest round include Nvidia, Disruptive, DST, 1789, B Capital, Lightspeed, GIC, Eric Yuan, Eric Schmidt, Citi, Sequoia, CRV, and others.

The explosion of AI companies has pushed demand for computing power to new extremes, and companies like CoreWeave, Together AI and Lambda Labs have capitalized on that demand, attracting immense amounts of attention and capital for their ability to offer distributed compute capacity.

But most companies still store data with the big three cloud providers, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, whose storage systems were built to keep data close to their own compute resources, not spread across multiple clouds or regions.

“Modern AI workloads and AI infrastructure are choosing distributed computing instead of big cloud,” Ovais Tariq, co-founder and CEO of Tigris Data, told TechCrunch. “We want to provide the same option for storage, because without storage, compute is nothing.” 

Tigris, founded by the team that developed Uber's storage platform, is building a network of localized data storage centers that it claims can meet the distributed compute needs of modern AI workloads. The startup's AI-native storage platform “moves with your compute, [allows] data [to] automatically replicate to where GPUs are, supports billions of small files, and provides low-latency access for training, inference, and agentic workloads,” Tariq said. 

To do all of that, Tigris recently raised a $25 million Series A round that was led by Spark Capital and saw participation from existing investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The startup is going against the incumbents, who Tariq calls “Big Cloud.” 

Tariq feels these incumbents not only offer a more expensive data storage service, but also a less efficient one. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have historically charged egress fees (dubbed “cloud tax” in the industry) if a customer wants to migrate to another cloud provider, or download and move their data if they want to, say, use a cheaper GPU or train models in different parts of the world simultaneously. Think of it like having to pay your gym extra if you want to stop going there.

According to Batuhan Taskaya, head of engineering at Fal.ai, one of Tigris' customers, those costs once accounted for the majority of Fal's cloud spending.

Beyond egress fees, Tariq says there's still the problem of latency with larger cloud providers. “Egress fees were just one symptom of a deeper problem: centralized storage that can't keep up with a decentralized, high-speed AI ecosystem,” he said. 

Most of Tigris' 4,000+ customers are like Fal.ai: generative AI startups building image, video, and voice models, which tend to have large, latency-sensitive datasets.  

“Imagine talking to an AI agent that's doing local audio,” Tariq said. “You want the lowest latency. You want your compute to be local, close by, and you want your storage to be local, too.” 

Big clouds aren't optimized for AI workloads, he added. Streaming massive datasets for training or running real-time inference across multiple regions can create latency bottlenecks, slowing model performance. But being able to access localized storage means data is retrieved faster, which means developers can run AI workloads reliably and more cost-effectively using decentralized clouds. 

“Tigris lets us scale our workloads in any cloud by providing access to the same data filesystem from all these places without charging egress,” Fal's Taskaya said.

There are other reasons why companies want to have data closer to their distributed cloud options. For example, in highly regulated fields like finance and healthcare, one large roadblock to adopting AI tools is that enterprises need to ensure data security. 

Another motivation, says Tariq, is that companies increasingly want to own their data, pointing to how Salesforce earlier this year blocked its AI rivals from using Slack data. “Companies are becoming more and more aware of how important the data is, how it's fueling the LLMs, how it's fueling the AI,” Tariq said. “They want to be more in control. They don't want someone else to be in control of it.” 

With the fresh funds, Tigris intends to continue building its data storage centers to support increasing demand — Tariq says the startup has grown 8x every year since its founding in November 2021. Tigris already has three data centers in Virginia, Chicago, and San Jose, and wants to continue expanding in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia, specifically in London, Frankfurt, and Singapore.

Many businesses that provide goods and services to the EU's 450 million consumers must comply with new accessibility standards that took effect in June. Like the GDPR before it, this new act had companies scrambling to adjust their websites, e-commerce platforms, and banking apps. But despite similar standards existing in the U.S., many still have a long way to go.

“One thing that surprised us was companies, even massive companies, coming to us two weeks before [the deadline] saying, ‘Oh we didn't know anything about this,'” said Irish entrepreneur Cormac Chisholm.

His startup, DevAlly, is among the first to leverage technology to make it easier for businesses to detect accessibility problems. It also helps them comply with regulations like the European Accessibility Act (EAA), which promises hefty fines for new products and services that aren't in compliance. (Existing ones get a grace period to comply until 2030.)

Launched in 2024, DevAlly audits for accessibility barriers such as videos lacking captions on corporate websites. It also tracks customer-reported issues and helps companies create roadmaps for fixes and generate accessibility reports.

While human consultants can also conduct audits, Chisholm, DevAlly's CEO, believes such an approach can't scale to meet demand or adapt to the realities of shipping digital products and features. DevAlly has accessibility experts, too, but it leverages AI and accessibility LLMs to automate testing and issue tracking. This, Chisholm believes, helps integrate accessibility with the product development life cycle.

This tech-first approach mirrors the path taken by cybersecurity compliance company Vanta, now valued at $2.45 billion. 

The regulatory tailwinds and growing awareness around accessibility helped DevAlly secure €2 million (approximately $2.3 million) in pre-seed funding, TechCrunch exclusively learned.

With this new capital, the company plans to grow its team from 5 to 15 people by the end of the year — mostly in Dublin, where it participated in the NDRC accelerator program operated by Dogpatch Labs on behalf of state body Enterprise Ireland.

NDRC and Enterprise Ireland participated in the round, but it was led by Belgian fund Miles Ahead Capital, with participation from European angels. According to DevAlly's founders, that's in part thanks to tech conference Slush, where they made the top 3 of the startup competition and connected with their future lead investor.

“Traditionally in Ireland, the approach is to go with an Irish VC, but we went with Europe, and one of the things that we're super excited about is to explore what that unlocks from this investor,” Chisholm said.

DevAlly will use Miles Ahead's support to launch U.S. operations, starting with sales in San Francisco. The city proved valuable for connecting with heads of accessibility at large B2B software companies after DevAlly participated in TechCrunch Disrupt's Startup Battlefield 2024. “A lot of our customers right now are on the West Coast,” co-founder and chief revenue officer Patrick Guiney told TechCrunch. 

The startup has seen traction in Europe thanks to the EAA coming into force. So have other players, such as Barcelona-based QualiBooth, which recently reviewed the state of European e-commerce accessibility — retail is one focus of the EAA. But both startups also see opportunities in the U.S., where DevAlly is betting on procurement as a major driver of demand.

With estimates that disabled consumers and their households represent $8 trillion a year in disposable income, Chisholm is adamant that “good design is accessible design.” One in five people live with disability, and disability can also be situational — because heavy glare makes it impossible to read your screen in sunlight, or you are holding a baby and can't access control buttons, he said. “So you want to try and create as much universal design as possible.”

The actions a company may take to address this range from screen reader support to higher contrast and gradients that work for the color-blind. But recent analysis conducted by UX/UI design agency Tenscope found that 94% of the top 1,000 US websites fail basic accessibility standards.

The travel industry was the worst performer, preventing many users from completing basic functions like contact forms, account creation, and online purchases. Even before the EAA, Spanish airline Vueling was fined for failing to make its website accessible.

With the EU-wide EAA now involving multiple jurisdictions, each with its own fines, Big Tech companies that operate in multiple countries could find themselves in search of help. “That's why we're positioning ourselves as a bridge to Europe for these U.S companies,” Chisholm said.

If they do, this will be good news for DevAlly and its investors, and possibly for all of us, Chisholm said. “The improvements that come with accessibility, like subtitles at Netflix, become massive advancements in terms of how we all use technology. It's a much better form of design.”

Every time we scroll, hover, or trigger an animation, the browser goes through a whole routine. It calculates styles, figures out layout, paints pixels, and puts everything together on screen. All of that happens in just a few milliseconds.It's kind of wild how much is happening behind what feels instant. And the way we write code can make that process either smooth and fluid or heavy and janky.I wrote an article that walks through this step by step, with a small demo showing exactly how these browser processes work and how a few CSS choices can make a big difference.

If you go back far enough, the IBM graphics cards used a text mode where text was accelerated by the graphics card, software would write a attribute byte and a data byte and the card had a bitmapped font to render text. VGA text mode at least could use hardware windowing so scrolling could also be accelerated; not every system used it, but you can set the start address and a line number where it returns to the start of the data area. That makes it easy to scroll without having to rewrite the screen buffer all at once. (If you set the stride to something that evenly divides the screen buffer and is at least as wide as your lines, it makes things even easier)

IMO all the ""user"" code must run in a dedicated thread, completely decoupled from the rendering loop. This code can publish changes to a scene tree, performing changes, starting animations, and so on, but these changes ultimately are asynchronous. You want to delete an element from a webpage, but it'll not be deleted at this JS line, it'll be deleted at the next frame, or may be after that, if rendering thread is a bit busy right now.Animations must stay fluid and UI must react to the user input instantly. FPS must not drop.Browser does it wrong. Android GUI API does it wrong. World of Warcraft addons do it wrong.

All animation is inherently discrete. No matter how many threads you have, there always has to be the last rendering thread, the thing that actually prepares the calls to the rendering backend. It always has to have frames, and in every frame, in the timestamp T, it will be interested in getting the world state in the timestamp T. So, the things that work on the world state - they have to prepare it as it was in T, not earlier, not later. You cannot completely decouple it.In one of game projects that I worked on, a physics thread and a game thread actually were pretty decoupled, and what the game thread did was extrapolating the world state from the information provided by physics, because it knew not only the positions of physics objects, but also their velocities. Can we make every web developer to set velocities to the HTML elements explicitly? Probably not.

This week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law new legislation that will give Californians the ability to easily opt out of digital data collection with a simple portal that should apply to all websites in their browser. The move promises to make the state's digital privacy protections that much easier to take advantage of, and could set a new precedent for future privacy regulations.

In a press release shared this week, Newsom's office announced the passage of two new laws, SB 361 and AB 566, that will strengthen the state's landmark California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA, created in 2018, notably gave state residents the ability to request that companies share with them—but also delete—information that had been collected about them as part of their business practices.

The passage of the CCPA was a big deal, but, as is often the case with landmark legislation, its execution has left something to be desired. While the CCPA did, indeed, force companies—for the first time—to give web users a certain amount of control over their data, the mechanisms by which that control can be exerted have always been quite imperfect.

In other words, loopholes in the law have created a situation in which every single time a web user visits a website, they are forced to go through the annoying process of selecting their privacy preferences. In some cases, companies have capitalized on this process by making it confusing or difficult to navigate, thus tilting the scales in their favor.

Now, however, due to the passage of AB 566, Californians should—theoretically—be able to opt out of all data collection via a simple portal made available through their web browser. The legislation “helps consumers exercise their opt-out rights” under the CCPA by “requiring browsers to include a setting to send websites an opt-out preference signal to enable Californians to opt out of third-party sales of their data at one time instead of on each individual website,” Newsom's press release states.

This is a great step towards giving web users more control over their data, although—given that the bill was just passed into law—it's not yet clear how the regulation will manifest for consumers. Hopefully, it will be as easy as checking a box in your browser.

The legislation puts California miles ahead of the rest of the country when it comes to digital privacy enforcement. In recent years, the state has also taken strides towards improving its ability to police and punish companies for infringing upon this law. Currently, enforcement is operated through the state Attorney General's office. This year, a number of companies—including a tractor company and a health information publisher—were fined upwards of a million dollars for alleged CCPA violations. However, in 2020, the state also approved the creation of a new agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency (or CPPA—which has been dubbed the nation's first “privacy police”), which is tasked with administering and implementing the CCPA.

Also signed into law this week was SB 361, which is designed to strengthen California's already existing data broker registry. The law will give consumers “more information about the personal information collected by data brokers and who may have access to consumers' data,” Newsom's office said.

Generative AI remains a lightning rod in the arts, with directors and producers often fumbling their stance and sparking backlash when they stop short of denouncing it. On the flip side, fans have grown wary of new releases, frequently scrutinizing for signs of generative AI involvement and feeling deflated whenever it does rear its head. DC Comics president Jim Lee has come forward to reassure fans the company doesn't—and won't—use it.

According to The Verge, Lee gave these remarks while speaking at a retailer's day panel at New York Comic Con. During the panel, Lee remarked on projections for fads and conspiracies that would affect retail, such as NFTs and Y2K, but never materialized in a meaningful way. He then rebuffed, declaring that AI would not either.

“History has a way of humbling predictions. The future rarely turns out the way the headlines warn us it will. But let me make one prediction I know I can stand by today: DC Comics will not support AI-generated storytelling or artwork—not now, not ever, as long as Anne De Pies and I are in charge,” Lee said, in reference to DC Comics' senior vice president and general manager.

Lee expanded upon his declaration, saying what DC Comics does is rooted in humanity.

“It's that fragile, beautiful connection between imagination and emotion that fuels our media. The stuff that makes our universe come alive,” he said. “It's the imperfect mind, the creative risk, the hand-drawn gesture that no algorithm can replicate.”

He continued: “When I draw, I make mistakes. A lot of them. But that's the point. The smudge, the rough lines, the hesitation—that's me in the work. That's my journey. That's what makes it come alive.

Lee then went on to address fans' “instinctive reaction” to authenticity and, inversely, folks recoiling at generative AI work simply because it is fake and devoid of human creativity.

“AI doesn't dream. It doesn't feel. It doesn't make art. It aggregates it,” Lee said.

Lee's words come downwind of the comic book industry putting its foot down on its stance on generative AI. Key among them is Dark Horse Comics, which, last year, released a statement saying it does not support the use of AI-generated material and instead supports the “human creative professionals.”

As The Verge notes, Lee's stance on AI follows scandals involving the company, where variant comic book covers were suspected of using generative AI. As The Verge posits, these scandals likely led DC Comics, through Lee, to firmly establish its stance on generative AI from hereon out. Now, if only the rest of the industry could wise up to this refrain instead of flirting with generative AI as some creative albatross that's here to stay.

Here's a new element of the East Coast vs. West Coast beef: The City of New York is reaching across the country to sue tech giants headquartered in California over allegations that their platforms have created a youth mental health crisis. The city, along with its school districts and health department, alleges that “gross negligence” on the part of Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance has gotten kids hooked on social media, which has created a “public nuisance” that is placing a strain on the city's resources.

In a 327-page complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the city alleges that tech companies have designed their platforms in a way that seeks to “maximize the number of children” using them, and have built “algorithms that wield user data as a weapon against children and fuel the addiction machine.” The city also alleges that these companies “know children and adolescents are in a developmental stage that leaves them particularly vulnerable to the addictive effects of these features,” but “target them anyway, in pursuit of additional profit.”

The claims that social media is addictive to underage users aren't necessarily new. New York state, in fact, is part of a coalition of states that have sued social media companies for allegedly exploiting young users. But the New York City suit does bring some unique and jurisdiction-specific information. It cites data from the New York City Police Department, for instance, that show at least 16 teens have died while “subway surfing”—riding outside of a moving train—a dangerous behavior which the lawsuit claims has been encouraged by social media trends. Two girls, ages 12 and 13, died earlier this month while subway surfing.

It also cited survey data collected from New York high school students, which shows that 77.3% of the city's teens spend three or more hours per day on screens, which it claims has contributed to lost sleep and, in turn, absences from school—corroborated by the city's school districts, which provided data to show that 36.2% of all public school students are considered chronically absent, missing at least 10% of the school year.

According to Reuters, this lawsuit from New York City is part of a larger effort by other governments to hold social media firms accountable. There are more than 2,050 similar lawsuits in litigation. The city withdrew a previous lawsuit, announced by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024, to join this wider effort in federal court. By doing so, New York City immediately becomes one of the largest plaintiffs, with a population of 8.48 million and nearly two million residents under the age of 18.

“These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works, and the allegations are simply not true. YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports, to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends,” José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, told Gizmodo. “We've also developed dedicated tools like Supervised Experiences for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.”

Gizmodo reached out to Meta, Snap, and ByteDance for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

A mere 1 cent per GB


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


You might want a superfast M.2 SSD for gaming or booting Windows on your PC, but what if you just want the most economical storage solution possible? Seagate's BarraCuda range is synonymous with massive storage at low cost, and right now you can score its 24TB version for just $249 at Newegg, the cheapest this drive has ever been, and $10 less than the last time we highlighted it. 

With 7200 RPM speeds, this is a capacity-over-performance play, but a huge HDD like this is a great solution for those who just want to get as much storage as possible without paying a premium.

While we have previously reviewed the Seagate Barracuda 8TB HDD, the 24TB version, which is faster and doesn't use SMR tech, isn't a fair comparison. While not our favorite HDD by any stretch, you'll struggle to find this much storage for $249 anywhere else. To give you an idea, this is six times the capacity of a similarly priced 4TB M.2 SSD, and should be considered an economy-of-scale purchase accordingly.

The 24TB edition of the Seagate BarraCuda HDD is available at Newegg for $249. This is an excellent option for anyone looking to expand their storage capacity without incurring significant costs. It operates at 7200 RPMs and can achieve transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s.

As noted, a 7200 RPM HDD isn't a drive for those who want speed and performance, but the transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s — and SATA 6GB/s connectivity — are respectable enough given the capacity.

The Seagate BarraCuda line is generally reliable, and crucially, this drive (unlike the aforementioned 8TB model) uses Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology as opposed to Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR), avoiding some of the pitfalls of the latter. You'll also get a two-year limited warranty.

The FDA has approved nerandomilast tablets for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in adults, according to an FDA press release.

Nerandomilast, marketed as Jascayd by its manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim, is the first therapy approved in more than 10 years for IPF. The drug is a preferential inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4B and is the first of its kind to be approved for IPF, according to a company press release. 

The recommended dose is 18 mg twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, according to the FDA.

The approval was supported by data from a pair of randomized, controlled trials. In the study, FIBRONEER-IPF, adult IPF patients aged 40 years and older who were randomized to nerandomilast had significantly smaller declines in forced vital capacity compared to placebo patients after 52 weeks. 

The difference was evident at doses of 18 mg or 9 mg, with adjusted mean declines of -114.7 mL and -138.6 mL compared to -183.5 mL in placebo patients. 

The adverse events that were reported in at least 5% of participants were more common in the 18-mg and 9-mg nerandomilast groups vs placebo. The adverse events were diarrhea, COVID-19, upper respiratory tract infections, depression, weight loss, appetite loss, nausea, fatigue, headache, vomiting, back pain, and dizziness. Of these, diarrhea was most frequently associated with treatment discontinuation. An earlier study showed safety, efficacy, and improved lung function with nerandomilast vs placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. 

Regulatory submissions are also under review in China, Japan, and the European Union, according to a company press release. Full prescribing information is available here. 

The studies were supported by Boehringer Ingelheim.

Several noninvasive tests (NITs) used in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) treated with semaglutide for 72 weeks showed significant reductions in relevant parameters, with changes evident as early as 28 weeks.

""NITs may be used for assessing a treatment response in patients with MASH. Further studies should confirm the treatment effect of NITs and evaluate the association of NIT changes to outcomes ,"" the authors wrote. 

This study, led by Louise Maymann Nitze, associate director at Novo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark, was published online in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics.

This exploratory analysis was not corrected for multiple comparisons and may need cautious interpretation. The small and predominantly White study population limited generalizability. Histological sampling and reader variability meant NITs may not perfectly match biopsy findings.

This study received funding from Novo Nordisk A/S. Five authors reported being employees and shareholders of Novo Nordisk. Several authors reported receiving consulting fees, grants, owning stock, and having other financial ties with multiple pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare companies, including Novo Nordisk, Gilead, and Roche. One author reported being the co-founder of Illuminatio Medical Technology Limited.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Dr Joanna Scoon, a pulmonologist at CLS Health. I've been seeing more and more patients with sleep apnea at a much younger age. I'm diagnosing it in my patients who are in their 20s to their 40s. Before, we would think of it as a disease that we would typically diagnose and treat in much older patients, but I'm seeing it at a much earlier age in clinic.

Maybe it's because we have more patients who have obesity, and there's a direct correlation between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity. I'm happy that these patients are coming in, getting tested, getting on the right treatment, and making a significant improvement in their quality of sleep and in other comorbidities that they may have, like high blood pressure.

The great thing is that it's much easier to get testing done, and my younger patients love that they can do these home sleep studies. Many of them didn't even know that they could do it at home. We do a large amount of home sleep study testing, which is very easy to do, and for these patients to get the testing done as soon as possible in the clinic.

While registered nurses (RNs) told Medscape in a survey that their total compensation on average rose by about 4% last year, licensed practical nurses (LPNs) reported that their pay was flat. Around 83% of RNs and 77% of LPNs said that their compensation either was flat or rose by no more than single digits, in percentage terms.

This infographic presents key insights from a newly published report on the latest pay data and trends for RNs and LPNs in the US. To learn more, check out the Medscape RN/LPN Compensation Report 2025.

The FDA has approved cemiplimab (Libtayo, Regeneron) for the adjuvant treatment of adults with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) at high risk for recurrence after surgery and radiation.

It's the anti-PD-1 antibody's fifth indication, with two prior approvals for non-small cell lung cancer as well as basal cell carcinoma and advanced/metastatic CSCC not eligible for curative surgery or radiation, an indication also carried by rivals pembrolizumab and cosibelimab.

The new approval makes cemiplimab the only immunotherapy approved for adjuvant CSCC, Regeneron said in a press release.

The approval was based on the C-POST trial in 415 patients at high risk for recurrence after surgery and radiation, with radiation completed within 10 weeks of study entry. Patients were randomized equally to either cemiplimab monotherapy or placebo.

The estimated 24-month disease-free survival (DFS) was 87.1% with cemiplimab and 64.1% with placebo. Median DFS was 49.4 months in the placebo group but not reached in the cemiplimab group (hazard ratio, 0.32; P < .0001).

There were no new cemiplimab adverse events in C-POST. The most common side effects in 10% or more of patients were rash, pruritus, and hypothyroidism. Serious adverse events occurred in 18% of patients; those that occurred in 1% or more included pneumonia, rash, diarrhea, adrenal insufficiency, and arrhythmia, according to Regeneron.

The recommended dose is 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by 700 mg every 6 weeks or 350 mg every 3 weeks until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 48 weeks.

Cemiplimab costs $10,679.40 for 350 mg/7 mL intravenous solution, according to drugs.com.

In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), left ventricular hypertrophy was independently associated with PKD1 gene mutations, and mitral valve prolapse was associated with truncating PKD1 mutations.

""Knowing a patient's genotype, particularly distinguishing PKD1 from PKD2 and identifying truncating PKD1 mutations, could potentially guide the frequency and intensity of cardiovascular screening (echocardiography, blood pressure monitoring) and inform therapeutic decisions,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Giulia Condello, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy. It was published online on October 01, 2025, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

The retrospective, single-centre design may have introduced selection bias and limited generalisability. The reliance on clinical echocardiographic reports could have led to interobserver variability, and left ventricular hypertrophy was defined by interventricular septum thickness rather than by the potential left ventricular mass index, which may be less robust. Additionally, the cross-sectional approach also prevented establishing causality or assessing disease progression over time.

No funding information was provided for this study. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

NEWPORT, Wales — Family doctors across the UK are facing an escalating youth vaping crisis and need clear national guidance and training to manage the issue, according to new study data presented here at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Annual Conference 2025 .

“Vaping has outpaced policy and guidance,” said Yasmin Baker, a final year medical student at Imperial College London, who presented the findings alongside fellow final year medical student, Maneth Warnapala, from the same university.

“GP education and established organisations need to release guidance on how to deal with the vaping epidemic, especially in those who do not smoke, and in particular, on vaping cessation,” Baker said.

“One in five UK adolescents have tried e-cigarettes, and almost half of them never smoked traditional cigarettes,” added Warnapala, “Yet GPs don't have the tools, data, or guidance to address it proactively.”

The study entitled From Puffs to Prevention: Battling the Vaping Epidemic in UK Primary Care, highlights the widening gap between the scale of adolescent e-cigarette use and the readiness of general practice to respond.

Speaking to Medscape News UK after their presentation, the researchers said most healthcare professionals feel confident in the evidence that supports vaping as a positive step towards tobacco use cessation, but its role among youth is entirely different. 

“What we're focusing on is the youth who have never smoked a cigarette,” said Warnapala. “We were the generation that were never meant to smoke, and now we're picking up e-cigarettes.”

The researchers combined a systematic review of 16 studies (2000-2024) with a national survey of 284 UK GPs and qualitative interviews with 11 clinicians to map knowledge, attitudes, and practice in primary care. 

Findings revealed that, while 86% of GPs believe vaping should be routinely discussed in consultations with young people, only 1 in 4 GPs regularly ask ‘do you, vape?'. Almost all (95%) reported being unsure how to quantify vaping, and just 12% felt confident counselling patients about associated risks.

“These are not reluctant clinicians, they're clinicians without a framework,” said Warnapala. “Most GPs recognise vaping as a public health issue, but they lack evidence-based materials, documentation fields in electronic records, and standardised referral pathways. It's like being asked to tackle smoking before the anti-tobacco guidelines existed.”

The series of qualitative interviews revealed several consistent barriers: time pressure in consultations, absence of coding fields in electronic health records, and lack of clarity about whether vaping should be treated as harm reduction or a behavioural risk factor.

GPs felt caught between mixed messages of whether to discourage vaping entirely or support it as a harm-reduction tool for adult smokers. 

Baker explained that when advising on how to stop cigarette smoking, GPs have quantitative tools to refer to. “By knowing how many cigarettes a patient smokes per day and for how long, clinicians can estimate their level of nicotine dependence and tailor nicotine replacement therapy accordingly,” she said. But “with e-cigarettes, there's no standardization — different brands and devices contain widely varying nicotine concentrations. As a result, GPs often lack the knowledge and tools to determine appropriate nicotine replacement therapy or even how best to counsel these patients.”

However, the study also identified strong drivers for change. Education, resources, and a change towards structured training at all levels were seen as priorities. Updated NHS resources including leaflets, Ardens guidance, and Continuing Professional Development modules, as well as better documentation within electronic health records, were also recommended. 

“There are no updated guidelines on this from, for example, the RCGP or from [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] that talk about vaping cessation in absence of smoking,” said Warnapala. “GPs have nothing to rely on. It's a massive gap.”

“There's an urgent need for a national strategy,” Baker added. “That means alignment between RCGP, [Department of Health and Social Care], and public health agencies, updated training resources, and better documentation systems within GP software. Otherwise, we're leaving an entire generation exposed.”

Commenting on the data, session moderator, GP, and member of Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board, Dr Onyinye Okonkwo, remarked that this was a pressing and huge issue. “Recently our public health message has been if you smoke, then move to vaping, and if you don't smoke than don't vape. Unfortunately, young people interpret this as ‘it's okay to vape' and we as GPs just don't have the skills with vaping as we do with smoking. Now we have adolescents that need help and they are turning to us as the people to help them, but there's a paucity of knowledge and information for us as GPs.”

Okonkwo also drew parallels between the marketing of e-cigarettes and cigarette advertising in the 1940s. “We see manufacturers returning to this and attracting young people who are led to believe vaping is ‘cool.' We as professionals need to start pushing back and say, ‘if you smoke, vape; but if you don't smoke, please don't vape.'”

Findings related to the study have been published in BJGP Open .

Baker and Warnapala report no relevant financial relationships. Okonkwo also reported no financial relationships. The project was supported by Imperial College London Business School.

In a groundbreaking 12-week trial, researchers discovered that a daily dose of fermented soy could sharpen memory in older adults, especially women over 70, hinting at a simple, diet-based way to support brain health with age.

Study: Effects of Fermented Soy on Cognition in Older Adults: Outcomes of a Randomized, Controlled Trial. Image credit: Garna Zarina/Shutterstock.com

A recent Nutrients study investigated the effects of fermented soy on cognitively healthy older adults. It found that fermented soy intake significantly improved memory in these adults.

The increased life expectancy has contributed to an aging population, along with an overwhelming increase in dementia cases worldwide. A healthy diet and other lifestyle factors reduce the risk of cognitive decline.

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation increase the risk of neuronal damage and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Several studies have highlighted the neuroprotective effects of plant-based foods due to the presence of high levels of antioxidants, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, such as polyphenols. Phytonutrients reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, promoting cognitive and cerebrovascular function.

Asian people commonly consume soy, which is rich in important secondary metabolites, such as phenolic flavonoids and isoflavones (daidzein and genistein). These metabolites possess antioxidant and estrogen-like properties, which benefit skeletal, cardiovascular, and cognitive health.

The available observational studies and clinical trials on soy and cognition in older adults have presented contradictory results, possibly due to the limited bioavailability of key isoflavones in their native glycoside forms. Previous studies have shown that fermented soy has an improved nutritional profile because, in this form, isoflavone glycosides are converted into aglycones, which are highly bioactive and are readily absorbed. Furthermore, fermentation enhances soy's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are plausible mechanisms for improving its neuroprotective effects.

Most human-based research has assessed the cognitive benefits of fermented soy in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For instance, a 12-week trial revealed the potential benefits of a probiotic fermented soybean powder on improving attention and memory composites. This treatment also enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in older adults with MCI. Considering the benefits of fermented soy, it is essential to understand its effect on cognitively healthy older adults.

The current study performed a 12-week, triple-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the cognitive effects of a non-probiotic, fermented soy product in cognitively healthy older adults. Healthy men and postmenopausal women 65 years and older were recruited from Loma Linda, USA. Any individuals with neurodegenerative disease and MCI, undergoing kidney dialysis and cancer treatment, and those who were intolerant or allergic to soy or dairy products were excluded.

Participants were advised to continue their usual physical activities, diet, and other lifestyle habits and refrain from taking any supplements that could affect cognition and immunity during the study period.

A total of 76 participants met the eligibility criteria, of whom 61 agreed to participate in this study. These candidates were randomized into either one of two groups: fermented soy (n = 33) and control (n = 28), stratified by sex. Household members were also randomized together into the same group. Participants consumed two pre-measured packets of Q-Can Plus® (fermented soy powder) or whey-based placebo powder each day for 12 weeks.

Q-Can Plus® is a non-probiotic fermented soy product, patented by BESO Biological Research Inc. The fermented soy powder contained 4.5g of fat, 8.4g of carbohydrates, 9.4g of protein, 5.6g of fiber, and 36.3mg of isoflavones per day. The placebo powder contained 15.6g of carbohydrate, 1.0g of fat, 8.5g of protein, 0g of fiber, and 0mg of isoflavones. Both fermented soy and placebo powders were flavored with cocoa and monk fruit sweetener.

Participants completed questionnaires on demographics, diet, stress, sleep, physical activity, and use of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Participants' height, body mass index (BMI), and body composition were measured at baseline.  Every month, the participants met the study clinician and completed questionnaires about their experience with the intervention product. At baseline and after 12 weeks, all participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests.

The majority of the randomized participants were postmenopausal women 70 years and older. An individual assigned to the placebo group was removed because of a recent MCI diagnosis. The overall dropout rate was 22%, comprising five participants in the placebo group and eight in the fermented soy group. The reason for most dropouts was linked to the palatability of the intervention.

A total of 47 participants completed the study (fermented soy group: 25 and control: 22). The mean age of participants who completed the study was 74.0 years, and the mean age of participants who dropped out was 71.7 years. Interestingly, Hispanic participants exhibited a higher dropout rate compared to Whites and other racial groups.

The fermented soy and control groups did not significantly differ in participant characteristics or cognitive scores. Approximately 90% of participants adhered to the fermented soy and placebo interventions. After adjusting for baseline scores, the fermented soy group exhibited a modest yet statistically significant improvement limited to memory scores (p = 0.041) compared to the placebo group. No significant between-group differences were found in other cognitive domains or in overall global cognition.

Exploratory analyses revealed a more prominent effect among postmenopausal women who were 70 years and older. These post hoc analyses indicated that women in this subgroup experienced improvements in both memory and global cognition. However, the authors cautioned that these findings should be interpreted carefully due to the analyses' small sample size and exploratory nature. A mean improvement in memory scores of 8.47% was estimated for the fermented soy group, compared to 2.05% for the placebo group.

The current study suggests that fermented soy may support memory function in older adults. Modest improvements in memory, and exploratory evidence for global cognition, were observed among postmenopausal women 70 years and older. However, the authors emphasized that these results are hypothesis-generating and that causality cannot be inferred. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

Rather than recommending consumption outright, the researchers propose that fermented soy could be a promising dietary component to help maintain cognitive health and potentially delay cognitive decline when integrated into an overall healthy lifestyle.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on August 22, 2025, titled, ""The impact of long-term social housing on biconditional association task performance and neuron ensembles in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampal CA3 region of aged rats.""

The research team led by Anne M. Dankert from Providence College and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, showed that aged rats who lived in socially enriched environments throughout life retained better memory and cognitive flexibility than those housed alone. This study highlights the importance of social interaction in protecting the aging brain.

Cognitive decline, such as memory loss and reduced problem-solving ability, affects many people over the age of 65. While many factors contribute to age-related cognitive decline, this study suggests that one key factor may be surprisingly simple: long-term social connection. To explore how social interaction might influence memory performance and brain activity, the researchers designed a study using rats as a model for aging in humans.

""Cognitive decline and changes in neuronal activity are hallmarks of aging.""

They compared three groups of rats: young adults, aged rats housed alone, and aged rats housed socially in groups. All groups had access to the same physical enrichment, such as exercise and stimulating objects, but only some experienced lifelong social companionship. The team tested these animals on a complex memory challenge known as the biconditional association task, which requires animals to make context-based decisions-an ability that typically declines with age.

The results showed that aged rats living in social groups performed just as well as young adults on the memory task, while those housed alone showed significant impairments. Socially housed rats also made fewer working memory errors and required less effort to complete cognitive tasks, suggesting not only better performance but more efficient brain function. These benefits were not observed in aged rats who received only environmental enrichment without social interaction.

Brain imaging revealed additional differences between the groups. Socially housed aged rats showed increased activity in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA3 region, which plays a key role in forming and separating memories. In contrast, aged rats that lived alone had lower activity in this region, which may explain their poorer performance. Interestingly, socially housed rats also showed reduced overactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex-a brain area involved in attention and decision-making-suggesting a more balanced and efficient neural response.

This research provides new insight into how lifelong social experiences shape brain health during aging. While earlier studies have shown that physical activity and cognitive stimulation help preserve cognitive function, this study identifies social interaction as an independent and powerful protective factor. The findings are consistent with human studies showing that older adults who remain socially active tend to experience slower cognitive decline and stronger brain function.

Overall, these results emphasize that brain aging is not inevitable but may be influenced by our social environments. This research suggests that fostering lifelong social connections could be a critical, low-cost strategy to protect memory and mental flexibility in older adults.

The Portland Hearts of Pine are engaged in early stage discussions about adding a women's soccer team, something the franchise's founder has long stated as a goal.

“We have belief and interest in the women's game and would want to be there to support it and we think it would be successful here,” said Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, the Hearts of Pine founder and chief community officer.

The first-year men's team is a professional club in USL League One. The women's team is targeted to be in the pre-professional USL W League, with 2027 the earliest it would likely see the field.

Hearts President Kevin Schohl added, “it's always been part of our vision, part of Gabe's vision, to add a women's team. We've begun initial exploration of that, including initial discussion with the city of Portland.”

Earlier this week, Vermont Green, a well-established pre-professional men's team in Burlington, Vermont, announced plans to field a women's USL W team in 2026.

“If we were to launch in 2027, what would be our third men's season, that would be a pretty fast follow,” Schohl said. “Certainly we would want to make sure some (organizational) positions are solely focused on making sure the women's team is successful. A head coach would be one, obviously. There would be other roles, too, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.”

The club, which built community support for the men's team over several years, must first work with the city to be sure Fitzpatrick Stadium, and/or Memorial Field at Deering High, can accommodate six to eight women's home games and the team's practice schedule. The Hearts of Pine's 10-year, rent-free lease of Fitzpatrick Stadium allows the club to reserve 25 game dates, which includes three dates for playoff games. This year the team had 18 home matches. Next year, with USL League One scheduled to expand from 14 to 21 teams, the club is anticipating 20 home matches.

The USL W season runs from mid-May to late-June, followed by the postseason.

Ethan Hipple, director of Portland's Parks, Recreation and Facilities department, believes the city can find space for a women's team.

“If we're really talking 10 dates, it could be a much simpler operation, similar to how we book dates for (other organizations),” Hipple said. 

Hipple noted that a lease agreement was needed for the Hearts of Pine men's team because of the “quantity of dates and they were also making physical improvements to the stadium.”

The franchise invested over $2.5 million in field and facility renovations, including putting in a new artificial surface, improving the lighting, upgrading the press box, and installing home and visiting team locker rooms on site. 

The Hearts of Pine men's team is winding down its inaugural season in USL League One, a third-tier pro league. The club is currently sixth in the USL1 standings and on the verge of clinching a playoff berth.

The Hearts have been even better off the field. Portland has sold out every game at Fitzpatrick Stadium, currently averaging 5,737 fans, well above the league record (4,786, Richmond Kickers in 2023). It has added investors to the ownership group, sells merchandise around the world, and has been featured as a model of growing soccer in national and regional publications.

Those are major reasons why the USL wants Portland in its women's ranks, said Joel Nash, the organization's senior vice president for youth and pre-professional opportunities.

“When a club has become a beacon for a passionate community that represents an entire state, you can't help but have excitement,” Nash said in an email to the Press Herald. “The opportunity for a W League team to inspire and educate young women to pursue their dreams and turn them into reality is completely in line with how the club has grown in a short time.”

In 2025, the USL W had 93 teams across 15 regional divisions that played 10- or 12-game regular-season schedules. Several teams are affiliated with either USL Championship, USL1, or USL2  men's teams. Many others are the top competitive team for a regional soccer club.

Rosters consist of mostly college-age players who are not paid.

Vermont Green joining USL W is pending the creation of a new Northeast Division. The Vermont Green men's team won the 2025 USL2 (pre-professional) national championship. It routinely sells out its games at 2,500-seat Virtue Field on the University of Vermont campus.

The past two years, Vermont Green has held three women's exhibition matches with the expressed purpose of preparing to join a pre-professional league. With former U.S. Women's National Team standout Sam Mewis as the coach, each of the women's games has sold out quickly, said Meg Linehan, who covers women's sports and especially women's soccer for The Athletic. A Vermont resident and Vermont Green season-ticket holder, Linehan said 10 years ago people would have laughed at the notion that “Burlington and Portland would be two of the hottest soccer markets” in the United States.

“But both Vermont Green and Hearts of Pine are becoming part of the community fabric,” Linehan said. “Adding a women's team extends that larger mission and provides extra opportunities to engage with the club.”

Linehan said some USL W teams have consistently drawn large crowds, pointing to the Minnesota Aurora. “They have a 5,600-seat capacity and they regularly sell out,” Linehan said.

Portland already has one pre-professional women's soccer team. The Maine Footy completed their third season this past summer, playing home games at Memorial Field. Maine Footy played a six-game schedule this past summer in the United Women's Soccer League — which is a different league than USL W.

How a Hearts of Pine women's team would impact Maine Footy is unclear and another step in the development process. Hoffman-Johnson said the Hearts “have a good relationship with Footy.” 

Hipple said it would not be an issue from the city's perspective to have separate pre-professional women's soccer teams. Hipple said city fields are frequently rented to different organizations that offer similar opportunities.

RANCAGUA, Chile (October 9, 2025) – The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team utilized a 15th minute goal from captain Benjamin Cremaschi, a 79th minute free kick from Niko Tsakris and another goal from Cremaschi in the third minute of second half stoppage time to claim a well-earned 3-0 win against Italy in the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Round of 16 match at Estadio El Teniente.

With the result, the USA has beaten both France and Italy by 3-0 scores in this tournament and advanced to its fifth-straight FIFA U-20 World Cup Quarterfinal where it will face the winner of Thursday's other match between Morocco-Korea Republic at Estadio Teniente in Rancagua on Sunday, Oct. 12 at 4 p.m. ET (FOX Soccer Plus, Universo, Peacock). 

Primed to bounce back after the 2-1 defeat to South Africa, U.S. head coach Marko Mitrović made seven changes to the lineup that started Sunday's group finale and the teams played relatively even through the early part of the match. 

The stalemate nearly broke in the eighth minute as the first dangerous chances came from Italy. Attacker Mattia Mosconi earned some space on the right flank and swung in a cross that swerved with the wind before it clanged off the left post and was cleared away for a corner kick. On the ensuing take, the ball found its way to Christian Corradi whose snap header was well-saved by U.S. ‘keeper Adam Beaudry. 

The USA staved off that early danger and then built up to the first goal. In the 14th minute, a cross from the left found Zavier Gozo at the far post. He settled and touched the ball to the top of the penalty box for Cremaschi and the U.S. captain fired a first time effort that was turned out for a corner kick by Italy ‘keeper Jacopo Seghetti. On the ensuring corner kick, Tsakiris hit a service from the right that was headed down by Nolan Norris, forcing another save from Seghetti, but Cremaschi was there on the doorstep to poke home the rebound and claim his fourth goal of the tournament.

Italy came close in the 35th minute as Mattia Mannini did well to break through the U.S. midfield before sliding a ball to Cristian Cama on the left. His first-time cross was nodded up in the air, before falling for Jamal Iddrissou whose effort from the ground was well-held by Beaudry.

Italy pressed hard on the U.S. back line in the 42nd minute and nearly unlocked the defense before Beaudry's low clearance made it to midfield where the U.S. found it had numbers in transition. Tsakiris possessed the ball in the center circle and sent Cole Campbell in one-on-one with an Italy defender. The winger drove toward the end line before attempting a chip that sailed just wide of the left post in the 42nd minute and the U.S. went into the locker room holding on to a 1-0 halftime lead. 

The first 15 minutes of the second half was mostly devoid of opportunities, but Italy provided the first danger on the hour mark as Mannini picked up a loose ball from 25 yards out and fired a bouncing effort that Beaudry gobbled up. Italy continued to threaten and in the 73rd minute Javison Idele drove in a dangerous cross from the right that Beaudry stretched out at full extension to claim at the back post. 

The USA bit back in the 75th minute as substitute Luke Brennan chased down a through ball on the right and stretched to send in low cross into the box. An Italy defender deflected it out of the area, but it eventually fell for Tsakiris who unleashed a knuckling blast that forced Seghetti to make a diving save to his right and push the ball out for a corner kick. 

After threatening just moments before, Tsakiris bagged the USA's second. The U.S. midfielder earned the dead ball after being fouled just outside the penalty area on the left in the 78th minute. Both he and Cremaschi stood over the ball and the U.S. captain looked like he would take it, but instead Tsakiris stepped up and hit a curling left-footed effort that bent around the left side of Italy wall and tucked inside the left post to make it 2-0. It was a brilliant set play finish. 

Italy pushed hard to get back in the game and requested not one but two plays to be reviewed by the Video Support System for penalty kicks, but both were correctly denied by the center ref.

The young Americans ended any Italian hope in the third minute of stoppage time when Brennan unlocked the Italian defense with a square ball from the right and then sent Cremaschi in on goal. He lifted the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the center of the goal from about 11 yards out to seal the match and the berth in the tournament's final eight nations.

The U.S. Men's National Team is set to play an important game against Ecuador on Friday night at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. With the World Cup coming up in 2026, Friday night's match is an opportunity for coach Mauricio Pochettino to evaluate his roster before next year.

Star midfielder Christian Pulisic was a big miss for the USMNT's run in the Gold Cup in June and July, as he took time off to let his body heal before playing for AC Milan in Italy. Friday night's match would be a key opportunity for Pochettino to gauge how to scheme Pulisic in the World Cup, but the team isn't sure if he can play.

Per Paul Tenorio of The Athletic, Pulisic, Alejandro Zendejas and Antonee Robinson missed Thursday's training session, and it's unclear if they will play Ecuador. Pochettino didn't specify if Pulisic suffered an injury, but said the star player had an ""issue"" that kept him out of the session.

 “I need to communicate that we have some issues in some players, like Christian, who didn't train today,” Pochettino said. “We need to assess tomorrow (if) they can be available or not.”

Pulisic has had a strong start to the season for AC Milan, earning Serie A Player of the Month for September. He's scored four goals and made two assists in six games played.

During a news conference on Thursday, Pulisic said it's important for the USMNT to gain chemistry during international competition this fall so they can gain confidence for the World Cup. 

“I think we're settling in well,” Pulisic said. “Now it's about building good performances one after the other. After last camp feeling good, now it's a great opportunity.”

Pulisic did not mention anything to the media about having an injury or any other issue that would keep him out of the training session.

Pulisic is expected to play a key role in how far the USMNT goes in the World Cup next year. He scored the lone goal in the USMNT's 1-0 win over Iran in the 2022 World Cup to advance to the knockout stage. He added an assist in the team's 1-1 tie against Wales in the group stage.

United States trio Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, and Alejandro Zendejas are all fitness doubts for Friday's friendly against Ecuador, said head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

""We have some [injury] issues in some players like Christian [Pulisic] that didn't train today and Antonee Robinson, we need to assess tomorrow if they will be available or not,"" Pochettino told a news conference on Thursday.

""Alex Zendejas is going to be ... if it's an [injury] issue, we don't believe that Alex will be part of the game tomorrow.""

- U.S. cruises past Italy to reach U20 World Cup quarterfinals
- Which strikers will the USMNT take to the World Cup?

AC Milan star Pulisic has been in fine form to start the season and contributed an assist in the U.S. men's national team's 2-0 win over Japan last month. América winger Zendejas also impressed in that win, which saw the U.S. bounce back from a loss to South Korea, scoring the team' opening goal.

As for Robinson, a possible absence would highlight the gradual return to full fitness for the Fulham defender.

""Still not quite back to feeling 100% on it, as I was a year ago, kind of before the injury first happened, but getting there slowly,"" Robinson said  on Wednesday about his recovery from a knee surgery in May.

""There hasn't really been a specific conversation about how many minutes I'm going to play this trip, if any.""

Fulham's 2023-24 player of the season has not appeared for the USMNT since November of last year.

With or without the star players, Pochettino shared ahead of Friday's friendly that competition for World Cup spots remains fierce.

""That roster is not the final roster ... it's really open. For everyone, it's open. They need to perform,"" said Pochettino. ""I promise you, no one is sure that he's going to be on the roster of the World Cup 2026.""

That chance for wider squad opportunities and minutes followed an underwhelming finish in March's knockout rounds of the Concacaf Nations League, in which the U.S. fell to fourth place after winning the two previous editions.

""That was really a wake-up call, because I think it showed why ... they called us. Because, Houston, we have a problem,"" said Pochettino.

""With all the information, I think from there we start to work in a very intense way with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation and try to change things that didn't help ... it's not a magic touch that you have and you can completely change things, but I think today, we are so happy.

""I think if you talk with every single [person], player or staff that is here, I think they already start to see the result.""

Since March, the U.S. coach has experimented with different rosters, which has led to a mixed bag of results. The team has suffered four losses in its last 10 games, but also reached the final in the summer's Gold Cup.

Following Friday's match against Ecuador, Pochettino and his roster will  close out the international break with an additional friendly against Australia on Oct. 14.

After this month, the USMNT has just four friendlies before Pochettino calls in players for a pre-World Cup training camp: against Paraguay and Uruguay in November plus another pair of games in March.

AUSTIN, Texas – U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said Christian Pulisic did not train on Thursday and is a question mark for Friday's game against Ecuador.

“I need to communicate that we have some issues in some players, like Christian [Pulisic], who didn't train today,” Pochettino said, not offering any other further specifics but also indicating that Alejandro Zendejas and Antonee Robinson sat out Thursday as well. “We need to assess tomorrow [if] they can be available or not.”

Pulisic had spoken to the media earlier in the day but did not mention any issues, injury or otherwise. Instead, he focused on the importance for the U.S. team to come out of this international window with not just good performances, but also good results. After meeting La Tri, the U.S. will host Australia, another World Cup-bound opponent, next Tuesday in Colorado.

“It's as simple as that,” Pulisic said. “We want to kind of understand and know where our team is at and have a good feeling going forward as we get closer to the summer.”

Pulisic arrived in Austin in strong form with AC Milan. The U.S. No. 10 was named Serie A player of the month and has six goals and two assists for Milan across all competitions. Pulisic missed a penalty kick in Sunday's draw with Juventus, but he remains one of the most important players for both club and country.

The run of form has been validation for Pulisic, who asked to take the Gold Cup off so that he could let his body heal ahead of preseason with Milan. The decision created controversy among fans, media and former players, but Pulisic insisted at the time that it would prove to be the right decision.

On Thursday, he made sure to point out that he didn't just spend his summer on the beach.

“I worked really hard this summer,” Pulisic said. “It's not like I just took a break. I wanted to make sure that my body was in the perfect spot coming into the season, and I wanted to start really strong, and I worked really hard. And it's just been consistency and the work I've put in, and it's good to see it come to fruition and (to be) playing well. But it's just the start of the season. I have so much more I want to accomplish.”

The U.S. will need Pulisic to be at his best if it's to advance in next summer's World Cup.

Pulisic has mostly started on the wing for the U.S., but in the 3-4-2-1 formation utilized by Mauricio Pochettino in a 2-0 win over Japan last month, Pulisic played underneath the striker. It's a position he believes could be a good one for his skillset.

“I think I can do well in a lot of the attacking positions, but I've always felt comfortable coming off the left side, but also being in sort of pockets in behind the striker,” he said. “I've always been pretty comfortable in that position. It allows me to use some of my strengths, get in the box, make runs in behind. So I think it's a good spot.”

The key for the U.S. now isn't just unlocking Pulisic's club form on the international stage, but continuing to build momentum from the Japan win into this window. While friendlies are a proving ground in which the result isn't as important, the American team is in need of some validation to the process under Pochettino.

Wins now build trust and momentum, and piling up those results is crucial as the World Cup nears.

“I think we're settling in well,” Pulisic said. “Now it's about building good performances one after the other. After last camp feeling good, now it's a great opportunity.”

Take a look at every World Cup ball made by Adidas since 1970. (1:27)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said everyone in football needs to keep ""an open mind"" about the scheduling of all future World Cups -- not just the 2034 tournament in Saudi Arabia.

The calendar governing international football is fixed until 2030 with discussions ongoing about how it will look after that. World Cups have traditionally been played in June and July, with the exception of the 2022 finals staged in Qatar, played in November and December to avoid the oppressive desert heat.

A similar solution is expected for the Saudi finals in nine years' time but Infantino insists climate change means consideration around scheduling needs to be given to all future tournaments at international level.

Infantino told delegates at the European Football Clubs General Assembly in Rome: ""If you want to play at the same time everywhere, then you can play in March or in October -- most likely because in December, you're not playing in one part of the world, and in July, we're not playing in another part of the world.""

He later told reporters outside the hall that FIFA was into the ""nitty gritty"" of discussing scheduling for the Saudi finals but added: ""We are discussing all the time. It's not just about one World Cup -- it's a general reflection -- even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think.

""Actually the best month to play football, which is June, actually is not used very much, in Europe. Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions.

""We just have to have an open mind.""

Infantino also gave a strong hint about the expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams during his speech, saying he wanted to discuss ways to make it ""even better, even bigger.""

The competition featured 32 teams for the first time this summer in the United States, with Infantino labelling it a ""huge success"" in terms of attendances, engagement and the revenue generated.

The scheduling of the competition has sparked legal challenges from domestic leagues and player unions, who have criticised FIFA over what they see as a failure to properly consult over the international fixture calendar.

- 2034 World Cup: Why Saudi Arabia is hosting, explained
- Jude Bellingham is England's best player. So why has he been dropped?
- The new World Cup ball is here! How a century of evolution led to it

However, clubs are keen to see an expansion of the competition, with Chelsea reported to have banked around £85 million for their successful run in the U.S., and Infantino indicated a willingness to allow more clubs to join for the next edition, due to be played in 2029.

""It was a success, and now we work together to see how we can make it even better, even bigger, even more impactful,"" he told the General Assembly of European Football Clubs, formerly the European Club Association, in Rome.

He said that would involve collaboration with ""all the clubs, with all the stakeholders who want to discuss and speak and develop it with us.""

He added: ""It will benefit everyone in this room, and also outside of this room. There are, going forward, a lot of challenges obviously, and we are all equipped to deal with all these challenges.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Borussia Dortmund's Ramy Bensebaini secured FIFA World Cup qualification for Algeria, and Bayern Munich's Nicolas Jackson has the chance to do the same for Senegal before their Klassiker clash on Matchday 7. They're among several African Bundesliga eyeing spots at next summer's tournament…



Algeria called upon five Bundesliga representatives as they sealed World Cup qualification with a 3-0 win in Somalia. Mohamed Amoura opened the scoring with his seventh goal in CAF qualifying while Bensebaini, Farès Chaïbi, Ibrahim Maza and Badredine Bouanani were involved in the team and squad.

Ivory Coast, meanwhile, will travel to face Seychelles with Bazoumana Toure, Yan Diomande and former Eintracht Frankfurt and Dortmund striker Sebastian Haller in their ranks. They're unbeaten so far in qualifying after winning six and drawing two of their eight games until now, and will hope to push themselves over the line on Friday.

Watch: Mohamed Amoura on target in Heidenheim win





Led by former Dortmund, Mainz and Hannover midfielder Otto Addo, the Black Stars of Ghana will look to edge closer to booking their World Cup ticket with a win over a Comoros side that will be without injured Hamburg defender Warmed Omari.

Having opened his Bayern account in their Champions League win over Pafos, Jackson will hope to guide Senegal to a victory over South Sudan on Friday. They've only conceded three goals so far in eight qualifying games, and come into this fixture having won two on the bounce against Sudan and DR Congo.





He'll be joined by a former Bayern forward, Sadio Mané, and ex-Mainz defender Moussa Niakhaté in his efforts, as well as former Cologne full-back Ismail Jakobs.



Cologne's Saïd El Mala is enjoying a breakout campaign, but which other youngsters are on the rise?

Famed for nurturing some of the finest forward-thinking stars in the game, the Red Bulls are at it again with a fresh, young attacking line set to test Dortmund this weekend. 

Bayern Munich's Tom Bischof is one of 14 Bundesliga youngsters on the latest shortlist for the fan-based Golden Boy Web award 2025.

The United States rolled to a 3-0 victory over Italy at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup on Thursday, booking a quarterfinal spot with their Round of 16 triumph in Rancagua, Chile.

Inter Miami CF midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi, who's on loan at Italian Serie A side Parma, scored twice to take the Golden Boot lead. San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Niko Tsakiris also scored his second goal of the tournament, while Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Adam Beaudry posted a shutout.

Cremaschi found a 15th-minute opener, stabbing a close-range finish past Italian goalkeeper Jacopo Seghetti after FC Dallas left back Nolan Norris' header was saved off the line. He then added an exclamation point in the 93rd minute, chipping over Seghetti following a powerful run out of midfield.

Tsakiris ensured the US win with just over 10 minutes remaining, curling a low free-kick around the wall and inside the near post.

The Italians battled back throughout the middle stages of the match, including hitting the woodwork once, but couldn't find a way past the US backline that included Norris and Philadelphia Union defender Frankie Westfield.

Perhaps now more than at any other point in the modern history of football, the subject of stadia is increasingly dominant. Manchester United are trying to completely rebuild Old Trafford to the cost of £2 billion ($2.7bn). Spurs are six years into the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium experience and at last have a trophy to put in their new cabinet. Chelsea's dispute over land in west London continues to cast a shadow over the future and suitability of Stamford Bridge. Newcastle's Saudi owners are still deciding whether they should expand St James' Park or make use of the space on the adjacent land to start from scratch.

And then we have Arsenal, who must feel like the J. Robert Oppenheimer of these lavish new builds. Back in 2006, the Gunners made the short move from their iconic Highbury home to a plush arena on the site of Ashburton Grove, known nowadays as the Emirates Stadium.

Almost 20 years on, the north Londoners are looking into the prospect of expanding their home. It has been reported throughout 2025 that this was becoming much more of a topic of discussion within the club's walls, and the Telegraph broke the news on Tuesday that they are indeed planning what has been described as 'major expansion'. There is, however, a pitfall that will affect match-going supporters. 

In order to undertake the works necessary for renovations, Arsenal would have to temporarily up sticks and play their home matches elsewhere for an undetermined period of time. The most likely venue would be Wembley, which boasts a capacity of 90,000 and is only about 10 miles across the capital city. On the face of it, that's hardly a negative, but it's only when you dig deeper that you realise the major downsides of such a move.

Iga Swiatek beat Belinda Bencic 7-6 (2), 6-4 to reach the Wuhan quarterfinals, and Coco Gauff booked her spot in the final eight with a routine 6-3, 6-2 win over Zhang Shuai. The two Top 5 players could meet in the semifinals.

In Thursday night's first match, No. 2-seeded Iga Swiatek became the fifth WTA 1000 champion to advance to the quarterfinals at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. In the nightcap, No. 3 Coco Gauff made it six.

Gauff was a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Chinese wild card Zhang Shuai, while Swiatek defeated No. 13 Belinda Bencic 7-6 (2), 6-4.

They could meet in the semifinals, but first there is the matter of Friday's supercharged quarterfinals.

Swiatek meets No. 7 Jasmine Paolini, who came back to defeat No. 10 Clara Tauson 3-6, 6-1, 3-1 via retirement.

Gauff has an unexpected match against unseeded Laura Siegemund, who advanced with a 6-4, 7-6 (2) win over Magdalena Frech. At 37, and the oldest player left in the draw, the German is looking for her second Top 10 win of the tournament following a second-round upset of No. 5 Mirra Andreeva.

Playing Wuhan for the first time, Swiatek has looked a lot like a six-time Grand Slam champion. The win over Bencic was the 125th WTA 1000 victory of her young career, and Friday will be her 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal.

Swiatek finished with eight aces and converted four of six break-point opportunities in a match that clocked in at 2 hours and 8 minutes.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

“For sure I wanted to play with confidence and make great decisions and not let her dictate,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview after the match. “It was super hard and every game was tough. That's why it was two sets in over two hours. I'm happy that I was there in the deciding moments to be solid and play one more shot.”

This was Swiatek's fifth win in six matches against Bencic, but it did not come easily. Since giving birth to daughter Bella in the spring of 2024, the Swiss player has steadily returned to her championship form. She was the winner in Abu Dhabi back in February and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Swiatek.

After dropping the first three games to Swiatek, Bencic came back to win five of six games and found herself serving for the first set at 5-4. Two loose forehands, however, gave Swiatek the equalizing break.

The tiebreak wasn't competitive. Bencic has made a career of taking the ball early, playing fast and aggressively. But in this instance, Swiatek was sharper. With Bencic serving at 2-4, Swiatek was standing inside the baseline when she sent a first serve back with an eye-opening forehand winner. Winning her third straight point, Swiatek converted her first set point.

In the second set, the two were even at 3-all when Swiatek made her move. A snappy forehand winner, followed by another faulty forehand from Bencic, gave her the decisive break.

Gauff's victory wasn't nearly as taxing -- it was over in one hour. At 21, some 15 years younger than Shuai, Gauff scored a break in the sixth game of the opening set and was never seriously threatened.

Through two matches, Gauff has dropped only six games. She won 60 of 100 points against Shuai.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Into her second consecutive quarterfinal in Wuhan, Gauff has now won all four matches against Shuai; over the past three years, no woman has won more times (19) in China.

“It was a little bit up and down,” Gauff acknowledged in her on-court interview. “But happy to be into the next round.”

Swiatek, 24, is looking for her 12th career WTA 1000 title. The 11th came this summer in Cincinnati, where she defeated Paolini in the final. Swiatek has won all six previous matches against Paolini, five of them in straight sets.

It's customary for players to thank fans at the championship trophy ceremony, but after her opening win Swiatek felt compelled to express her appreciation to the crowd.

“I think it's always nice to get support during the match,” Swiatek explained. “And in China, I feel it more than in other countries. So yeah, just happy to be here, and hopefully I'm going to be able to experience that as much as possible.”

And now, she'll live to experience that support for at least another day.

We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina. There's plenty on the line in the home stretch of the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025.

We're down to the final eight at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, a shorter-than-usual WTA 1000 tournament (didn't it just start?) and the final 1000-level event of 2025.

There's plenty on the line as we enter the weekend: the final three spots in the WTA Finals are still up for grabs, and it's one last opportunity to take home a signature title (Finals aside) and snag 1,000 ranking points.

There are plenty of familiar faces in the quarterfinals, including six players who have won WTA 1000 titles already. But there are also a couple of surprises, as always, who have the potential to create some chaos as we enter the home stretch of the tournament.

Here's a breakdown of the Wuhan Open quarterfinalists, and who they'll need to go through to get to the semis. 

Might as well call her the queen of Wuhan.

It was a fitting tournament for the World No. 1 to return to the Hologic WTA Tour post-US Open, as she's been dominant here in ways we've rarely ever seen.

The three-time defending champion came into Wuhan with a 17-0 all-time record, and the tournament favorite has looked the part this week. She's improved to 19-0 here with wins over Rebecca Sramkova -- she did need three sets to win that one -- and 16th seed Liudmila Samsonova, and appears to be in form after some much-needed R&R in Greece.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Needing to pick up wins to quality for the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Rybakina has has a productive week thus far following an earlier-than-expected exit in Beijing. After beating Jaqueline Cristian in her opening match, the World No. 9 had a rather easy time with Linda Noskova, who was coming off a run to the final at the China Open.

Rybakina currently trails Jasmine Paolini, who's No. 8 on the WTA Finals leaderboard, by a slim margin. 

The top seeds have only needed two wins to get to this point.

Siniakova, on the other hand, has already gotten five.

The top-ranked doubles player in the world, ranked 62nd in singles, came through qualifying to reach the quarterfinals. After defeating American Caty McNally and China's Wang Yafan to get into the main draw, the 29-year-old upset 15th-seeded Diana Shnaider before taking out Maya Joint and Iva Jovic.

She's yet to drop a set in Wuhan, and she's into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2018. 

“I can't remember the last time I played two sets.""

We love the self-awareness from Pegula, who has been continually tested and pushed to the limit during the Asian swing.

As for her last straight setter, we can help: It was on Sept. 27, a 6-0, 6-3 win over Ajla Tomljanovic in Beijing. Since then, the American has played a ridiculous six three setters, winning five of them. (The lone loss, to Noskova in the China Open semis, ended in a heartbreaking 8-6 tiebreak.)

She narrowly escaped her first match against countrywoman Hailey Baptiste, saving six match points and eking out the deciding tiebreaker 8-6. Her second match wasn't quite as excruciating, but certainly no walk in the park. She came back from 5-2 down in the opening set to take it, then dropped the next one before winning yet another third set. 

The World No. 5 is into the Wuhan quarterfinals for the first time, and if she wins the title she'll become the sixth player to qualify for the WTA Finals.

What a week for the German veteran, 37, who's into the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000 tournament for the first time in her career. (Hard to believe, considering she's made the quarters of both the French Open and Wimbledon.)

After beating Dayana Yastremska in the first round -- Yastremska retired down 4-1 in the third set -- the World No. 57 upset World No. 5 Mirra Andreeva, her third Top 10 win of 2025. On Thursday against Magdalena Frech, Siegemund was on the ropes twice. She came back from 4-1 down in both the first and second sets to win 6-4, 7-6 (2).

Siegemund is also into the doubles quarterfinal, partnering with Fanny Stollar. (The pair upset Andreeva and Shnaider in the the third round, a double whammy for Siegemund over Andreeva.)

The American is into her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal in as many weeks, and has gotten to the final eight in Wuhan with ease. She dropped just one game in her dominant effort against Moyuka Uchijima, and then followed it up with a routine win over the ageless wonder Zhang Shuai.

Already qualified for the WTA Finals, and admittedly feeling less pressure post-Slam season, the 21-year-old should be loose and rested for her quarterfinal match.

Clinging to the No. 8 spot on the WTA Finals leaderboard, the Italian has taken care of business this week with three-set wins over Yuan Yue and 10th-seeded Clara Tauson, who retired trailing 3-1 in the third set. (Kudos to Paolini, always empathetic and caring, for being a great sport after the match.)

A year after making two Grand Slam finals, the 29-year-old has matched her career-high win total (40) from last year. She'll need a few more to secure her spot in Riyadh. (It is worth nothing that she's already punched her ticket in the WTA Finals doubles field, alongside partner and countrywoman Sara Errani.)

Swiatek just won her 125th match at a WTA 1000 tournament. 125! We had to double check -- and then triple check -- that stat because it's so absurd. (Yeah, she's 24...). But alas, it's true, a testament to how incredibly dominant she's been over her relatively young career.

But back to Wuhan ... the six-time Grand Slam champion, playing here for the first time, dropped just two games in her opening-round win over Marie Bouzkova, and though she won Thursday's match in straights as well, it wasn't easy. She needed a tiebreak to win the first set over Belinda Bencic, who served for it at 5-4, before ultimately prevailing 7-6 (2), 6-4 in 2 hours and 8 minutes.

She's now into the 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career.

These two have history. It's round 13 for the Grand Slam champions and perennial Top 10 players. 

Sabalenka owns a 7-5 advantage in their head to head, and they've split their last six meetings. Rybakina won the most previous matchup, a 6-1, 6-4 upset this summer in Cincinnati. Can she pull off another upset against the greatest player in this tournament's history?

Both of these players have played a lot of tennis recently. Siniakova came through qualifying to get here, and Pegula has played what feels like 50 straight grueling three setters. Who has more left in the tank?

Pegula, No. 6 in the PIF WTA Rankings, is the obvious favorite, especially considering she's won four of their five previous matchups. They played once this year, a 6-2, 6-3 Pegula win on grass in Bad Homburg. 

Gauff defeated Shuai, some 15 years her senior in the third round. Now she'll play an even older player in 37-year-old Siegemund. It's an interesting observation -- and it speaks to the incredible longevity that we see on tour now -- but it doesn't say a whole lot about this particular match, especially considering Siegemund came from behind to beat 18-year-old Andreeva earlier this week.

What is relevant, though, is the fact that Gauff hasn't spent much time on court this week, dropping just six games in two matches, and no woman has won more matches in China over the past three years.

They've split their two career meetings, the most recent of which was at the US Open two years ago. Gauff won that first-round match in three sets. (Their other match, in Auckland in 2020, also went the distance.)

Needing a win to keep pace on the WTA Finals leaderboard, this is likely the last player Paolini wants to see on the other side of the net. Swiatek has utterly dominated the Italian in her career, winning all six of their matchups and dropping just one set in the process. Two of those wins have come this year, the most recent of which was a 7-5, 6-4 victory for Swiatek in the Cincinnati final this summer.

 

We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina. There's plenty on the line in the home stretch of the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The best of the best. The ATP and WTA Finals pit the top eight singles players and doubles teams in the season's final battle. It's a culmination of the tour calendars, serving as both a grand finale and a showcase for the sport's elites. The year-end No.1 ranking is often on the line, as is a huge payday and momentum into next season. Outside of the four Grand Slams, this is the tournament the players covet.Here's what you need to know about one of the crown jewels in tennis:How do players qualify?Throughout the calendar year, players and teams earn points based on their tournament results. The points accumulate in a “race” to see who can finish first. At season's end, the top seven producers punch their ticket to their tour's Finals. The eighth spot is reserved for a Grand Slam winner ranked 8-20 in the standings. If no player meets that criteria, the final spot goes to the player who finished eighth in the race.In other words, it's the year's top performers going head-to-head.

Instead of single elimination, both tour Finals employ a round-robin format. The eight players and teams are divided into two groups of four, based off their final standings in the points race. Each singles player in a group will face off against each other in best-of-three tiebreak sets. Doubles uses a 10-point match tiebreaker in lieu of a third set.The top two from each group move on to the semifinals. A single loss doesn't eliminate a player or team, leading to secondary advancing criteria, such as head-to-head results. The winner of one group will play the runner-up of the other. The semifinal winners then play for the championship.When and where are they held?The Finals are a week-long event that take place at single venue.

Federer wants quicker conditions at Laver Cup, joining a growing number of players asking to halt the rise of slower courts.ByPete BodoPublished Oct 09, 2025 copy_link

Published Oct 09, 2025

Some debates in tennis take place so deep in the weeds of policy or administration that they're of little interest to all but the most geeked-out aficionados. But that changes when an icon wades into the fray, at which point the issue may suddenly generate headlines and become digital fodder for everyone.That's what happened just a few weeks ago, and suddenly the long-simmering complaint that the game has been slowed down too much, especially on hard courts, has popped high on the radar.Near the end of a long, live broadcast of Andy Roddick's Served podcast from the Laver Cup event, tournament founder Roger Federer enthusiastically embraced Roddick's suggestion that courts had been slowed down to the detriment of the game.Federer then lit the tinder, suggesting that tournament directors like slow courts because it increases the odds that Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz (preferably both) will arrive in the final. Alexander Zverev heaped fuel on the ensuing fire soon thereafter, revealing how he “hated” how uniform surfaces had become, and he endorsed Federer's theory of favoritism.

Alexander Zverev heaped fuel on the ensuing fire soon thereafter, revealing how he “hated” how uniform surfaces had become, and he endorsed Federer's theory of favoritism.

The next thing you know Sinner, halfway around the world, was addressing the criticism in a press conference in Beijing. “You know, me and Carlos [Alcaraz], we don't make the courts,” he told reporters. “It's not our decision. We try to adapt ourselves in every situation. I still feel like every week (the surface) is a bit different.”The favoritism issue, while legitimate, has overshadowed the original point, that we're losing one of the game's most distinguishing features—meaningful differences in surface/court speed from one event (or tour segment) to another, and the unique challenges that poses for players. The criticism is valid, in that the ATP and WTA surfaces these days range from slow to medium-fast. The high end has been loped off.Over time, tennis has developed a prejudice against fast courts. It was partly due to those serving duels hosted by Wimbledon in the pre-2001 years, before it switched the surface to a rougher (slower) ryegrass. Changes continued: In 2008, the ITF put pace limitations on courts that could be used by host nations in Davis Cup ties. When Cup stalwart Roddick learned that a certain, commonly used court was rated as “too fast” for official DC competition, he asked how the ITF determined if a court was “too slow.”There was no such category, he was told. Point made.

Unfortunately, there is no commonly embraced or understood yardstick for court speed, and the entire business can become very confusing if you venture down the data rabbit hole.The ITF does a sophisticated Court Pace Rating (CPR) based on laboratory and actual on-site testing with various scientific instruments. It groups those ratings in five categories, just like hurricanes: The five categories range from slow to fast, with 10-point gradations within each, topping out at 50.Thus, a French Open rating of, say, 23, falls into category 2 (slow, but not extremely so) while a typical Australian Open rating of 42 puts it in the medium-fast category 4. By CPR metrics, most hard-court Masters events in 2024 fell into the ""medium"" or ""medium-fast"" categories of 3 to 5, Paris leading the way with a CPR of 45.5 (category 5). The Indian Wells Masters nestled in alongside Roland Garros in category 2.The other way to establish a quantifiable court speed is “predictive,” based on data-driven, match-play metrics including aces, unreturned serve, rally length. Broadcasters rely on researchers and entities like Hawkeye to create a more dynamic Court Pace Index (CPI), showing the real-world result of surface speed. These ratings generally align with CPR values.The Tennis Abstract website has its own surface speed rating, also created by match-play metrics and statistics. It uses the number “1” to represent average court speed. By TA metrics, the 15 fastest tournaments (led by Basel, with a rating of 1.54) include only two Masters events (Paris Indoor, No. 7 and Cincinnati Masters, No. 15).

I tend to disagree with the claim that courts are getting slower across the board. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower. John Isner

The metrics used by TA are complicated, but the easiest way to frame it is that at Basel, players hit 54 percent more aces than at an average tournament.But for all the number crunching, those who count most (the players) frequently experience court speed subjectively. Their opinions on a specific court often end up all over the board, heavily influenced by considerations ranging from ambient conditions to how well—or badly—an individual happens to be playing. A court that seems too fast to one player might be right in the comfort zone of another's.For all the palaver about slow courts, many players claimed that the courts at the Citi Open in Washington D.C. this year were much faster than usual. After advancing to the third round, Frances Tiafoe described the conditions as ideal for a ""servebot-fest.”Similar observations were made at the Canada Masters, where Taylor Fritz described the courts as ""lightning-fast.” Meanwhile, most players agreed that the courts at the Cincinnati Masters were significantly slower than in previous years. The US Open was a toss-up, as far as opinions went.John Isner, the godfather of servebots, logged some of his best Grand Slam results in Paris—and not indoors, but at Roland Garros. He can explain how slow courts counter-intuitively help big and tall players who serve better than they move. Taking on Zverev's disenchantment with the perceived uniformity of court speeds in the Nothing Major podcast recently, Isner said: “I tend to disagree with the claim that courts are getting slower across the board. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower.”Note to Roger: perhaps it's time to speed up those Laver Cup courts, even if the days of lightning fast indoor and outdoor courts are a thing of the past.

A court that seems too fast to one player might be right in the comfort zone of another's.For all the palaver about slow courts, many players claimed that the courts at the Citi Open in Washington D.C. this year were much faster than usual. After advancing to the third round, Frances Tiafoe described the conditions as ideal for a ""servebot-fest.”Similar observations were made at the Canada Masters, where Taylor Fritz described the courts as ""lightning-fast.” Meanwhile, most players agreed that the courts at the Cincinnati Masters were significantly slower than in previous years. The US Open was a toss-up, as far as opinions went.John Isner, the godfather of servebots, logged some of his best Grand Slam results in Paris—and not indoors, but at Roland Garros. He can explain how slow courts counter-intuitively help big and tall players who serve better than they move. Taking on Zverev's disenchantment with the perceived uniformity of court speeds in the Nothing Major podcast recently, Isner said: “I tend to disagree with the claim that courts are getting slower across the board. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower.”Note to Roger: perhaps it's time to speed up those Laver Cup courts, even if the days of lightning fast indoor and outdoor courts are a thing of the past.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson give their views on how the Singapore Grand Prix panned out for Racing Bulls.

The Singapore Grand prix did not go to plan for Racing Bulls, who had both cars finish outside the points despite at times showing enough pace to mix with the top teams in practice and Qualifying. Isack Hadjar was forced to nurse an engine issue on his way to a P11 finish, while Liam Lawson finished down in 15th.

Hadjar had the best chance to score for the team at Marina Bay, the rookie starting in the top 10 and running ninth in the early stages. But the team radioed to say his car was suffering an issue just before the first round of pit stops.

The Frenchman dropped two places before pitting for fresh tyres, but the problem remained and he dropped down the order. As the rest pitted, somehow Hadjar found himself back in the top 10 – only to get picked off by a freshly shod Carlos Sainz late in the race.

“[It] was not a good race. We had an issue I think just before pitting. And from there was just a very, very long race,” he explained.

“I couldn't do anything, I was just hoping for the others not to catch up too quickly but they did and we got impacted a lot by the blue flags, we lost a lot there. And Carlos [Sainz] pitted before the blue flags so he benefited from that, but we should have done better.”

Team Principal Alan Permane said after the race that the issue with Hadjar's powertrain was costing him 0.5s a lap, so just to make the finish was impressive – let alone hang onto the coattails of the top 10. Hadjar was asked how it felt in the car once the issue became apparent.

“Really not good, you feel powerless in the corners, on the straights we were pretty much there. It's not nice but I know it is not my fault, nothing I could have done. I gave my all and even like this we finished P11 so not that bad.”

It is first time Racing Bulls have failed to score with either car since the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, but Lawson believed more was possible from his race. He opted for a very long first stint in the hopes of a Safety Car but dived into the pits when it became apparent one was not likely to materialise.

He was running ahead of Sainz when he pitted two laps before the Spaniard and yet finished five places lower than the Williams man – leaving him baffled as to how Sainz pulled off such a result.

“We just went very, very long, [and] stayed out most of the race on that set of mediums. Honestly, I don't really know, I need to have a look what happened because Carlos was behind me and he ended up finishing 10th so I have no idea what happened,” Lawson explained.

“For me, I came out behind the train [of cars], and he came out in front of the train so I need to have a look why. It's frustrating but the damage was mostly done yesterday from me. Something to reflect on for sure going forward.”

With two crashes marring his weekend, Lawson could be forgiven for being relieved to come out of the race with his car in one piece, especially after coming perilously close to Yuki Tsunoda through the first few corners at the start. But the Kiwi racer was searingly honest about what was possible out there.

“Had we started higher up the grid, we could've potentially ended up in the points with our pace, but a tough Quali meant it was going to be tricky from the outset,” he concluded.

	Upstart New York distributor 1-2 Special has added another indie gem to its fast-growing slate, picking up all rights in North America to Mark Jenkin's Rose of Nevada, one of the highlights of this year's Venice Film Festival. 


George MacKay and Callum Turner star in the eerie drama, playing fishermen in a remote village in Cornwall who board a mysterious ship that appears to be caught in a time loop. Jenkin's third feature, following the acclaimed dramas Bait (winner of 2020 BAFTAs for outstanding debut and outstanding British film) and Enys Men (which took best sound at the 2023 British Independent Film Awards), Rose of Nevada premiered in Venice in the Horizons sidebar and had its North American debut in Toronto.

Less than a year after the rapper filed his stunning lawsuit, a federal judge says nobody thought Kendrick was really calling him a pedophile.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	A federal judge on Thursday (Oct. 9) dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” ruling that a “war of words” during a “heated rap battle” did not violate the law and that some of the case was “logically incoherent.”


	Drake's case, filed earlier this year, claimed that UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track, which tarred his arch-rival as a “certified pedophile.” He believed that millions of people took that lyric literally, severely harming his reputation.


	But just 10 months later, Judge Jeannette Vargas granted UMG's motion to dismiss the case at the outset — ruling that Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of “hyperbole” that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact.


	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” the judge wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	The ruling marks an abrupt end to a legal battle that stunned the music industry. Few expected a rapper to respond to a diss track with a lawsuit — a move that drew ridicule in the hip-hop world and condemnation from legal scholars. Fewer still expected him to file it against UMG, his longtime record label and the biggest music company in the world.


	In a statement sent to Billboard, Drake's attorneys say they “intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it.”


	In a statement to Billboard, a spokesman for UMG said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleged that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG argued those allegations were clearly meritless — that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	The dispute got even nastier in February, when Lamar made “Not Like Us” the centerpiece of his Super Bowl halftime show. After speculation about whether he'd play the track at all, Lamar used the show to mock his rival, looking directly into the camera as he rapped, “Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young.”


	In her decision on Thursday, Judge Vargas sided entirely with UMG, ruling normal listeners would not expect “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.”


	She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting from a line in “Family Matters” in which the star was “heavily implying that Lamar is a domestic abuser” and another in which Drake says he heard that “one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his.”


	“The recording was published as part of a heated public feud, in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,” Judge Vargas wrote. “This is precisely the type of context in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole rather than factual assertions.”


	The judge also rejected Drake's arguments about the popularity of “Not Like Us,” saying she could not make that kind of “retroactive analysis” of artistic expression. She wrote that when Lamar wrote his song, he “could not have been aware” that it would later break streaming records, win Grammys, or be the centerpiece of a Super Bowl halftime show.


	“Yet plaintiff would have the court divorce the recording from the context in which it was created because of these subsequent events,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Whether publications constitute actionable fact or protected opinion cannot vary based upon the popularity they achieve. Constitutional guarantees do not rest on such a flimsy foundation.”


	The judge was equally unimpressed with Drake's claim that the song became defamatory because UMG repeatedly republished it and drove its success: “This argument is logically incoherent,” the judge wrote. “If the recording was nonactionable opinion at the time it was initially produced, then its republication would not expose UMG to liability.”

You know she talked about the bread during the three-segment sit-down on Wednesday night (Oct. 8). 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Taylor Swift continued her Life of a Showgirl promo push on Wednesday night (Oct. 8) with a three-segment sit-down on Late Night with Seth Meyers during which she closed the circle on the story of Zoë Kravitz losing her Burmese python at the singer's house and had some fun tweaking fiancé Travis Kelce about that time he mixed up Hugh Grant's wife with Greta Gerwig at the Eras Tour.

	











	The latter story involved the Kansas City Chiefs tight end attending Swift's June 2024 Eras show in London, where he was sat in the VIP box alongside actor Grant and his wife, Anna Eberstein, who Kelce apparently confused with Barbie director Greta Gerwig. In describing her mega-FOMO about looking out at the raucous celeb-packed box that night — also at the London show were Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, Liam Hemsworth, Tom Cruise and all of Kelce's best friends from Cleveland — Swift described being jealous at the shot-taking and party atmosphere in the roped-off section, with Taylor worrying that her 6'6″ intended's hard dancing might actually shake the tent to the ground.


	“The most fun thing about having Travis out on tour is that he would go to the tents and give me the tea afterward,” she said of their post-show car chats. Before the gig, she let him know that his “favorite director,” Gerwig, was in the tent, so she encouraged him to tell her how much he loves her films. “She's the sweetest, giggliest person,” Swift said.

	











	In the car ride after the show, a shot-filled Kelce said that it was “the most fun tent” of the tour thus far, gushing about what a blast it was mingling with the A-listers, though Swift noticed he didn't mention meeting Gerwig. “I think I told an annoying joke that she's heard too many times,” Kelce admitted, explaining that he told Gerwig how much he loved Barbie, pointing up to the stage at Swift and saying “I'm just Ken, too.”


	Swift thought it was a totally solid joke, with Kelce describing how Gerwig “smiled politely” at the quip, something Taylor thought was “very out of character,” surmising that maybe she had heard the bit too many times. “‘She was talking to Hugh Grant all night, so I think they might be doing a movie together,'” Kelce explained. “‘They were really, really close. They were dancing all night, had all these inside jokes that kind of seemed like they were soul mates,'” he told her. “‘The tea is crazy tonight,'” Swift recalled thinking.


	As Kelce kept talking about it, Swift was scrolling through pics on her phone, seeing photos and videos of Travis dancing with Gerwig “like they're best friends.” She showed him a video of Gerwig laughing, surmising that she did think the joke was funny, only to have Kelce say “‘that's not Greta.'”


	“‘Is there any chance at all, baby, that you complimented Hugh Grant's wife Anna on her movie Barbie, said ‘I'm just Ken, too' and she politely nodded because she didn't have the heart to tell you she didn't direct it?,'” Swift asked Kelce. “‘And is there any chance that the people who look like soul mates are Hugh Grant and his soul mate?'” 


	“The bad news for you is he has face blindness,” Meyers joked. “The good thing is he recognized true love. He saw soulmates, and he knew they were soulmates.”

	











	In her first appearance on the show in five years, Swift also told Meyers that the Life of a Showgirl roll-out has “absolutely been my favorite one,” calling it the “most joyful” promo run she's had to date. And, for the first time, she said her whole family, including her mom, dad and brother, have all been with her on the global press tour, joking that her mom was struggling to find Wheel of Fortune on British TV. “I'm floored, I'm blown away by this week. I don't know how to say thank you enough for everything that you guys have put into caring about the music and caring about this week. We're doing this together,” she said.


	She also, of course, talked about her oft-noted bread-baking obsession, with Meyers trying to keep up by busting out some of the loafs larded with lyric-inspired puns, with both agreeing that the “Fate of Doughphelia” bread puns need to stop. He then played a clip from the Showgirl movie event in which Swift gets super excited about getting some of her bread into “The Fate of Ophelia” video, which she directed. “It was a huge moment for me because obviously my bread has always been for texture and taste, but this was for camera,” she joked. “This is a huge challenge, for me, for the bread, for my starter. Like, ‘okay, are you showbiz bread?'” 


	As for the Kravitz incident, the actress previously told Meyers about losing her mom Lisa Bonet's pet Burmese python at Swift's house after the singer generously invited the mother-daughter to stay with her during the L.A. wildfires earlier this year, and how they had to “completely” destroy one of the bathrooms to extricate the pet. Swift told Meyers she “can't even be mad” about the bit, prefacing the “Taylor's version” of the story by saying “we've all got that one friend.”

	











	“I just remember getting a call from my head of security and him trying to explain this story to me,” Swift said, noting that her first question was “what snake?”


	“I kind of found myself listening to this,” Swift said. “And I'm like, ‘Uh-huh, OK, OK.' And I hate to first-and-last name a friend, but it's important in this situation. OK, so Zoe Kravitz and Lisa Bonet are holding on to a Burmese python. It's halfway in the wall. There's a man standing with an ax, who has just chopped up a custom vintage antique cupboard. There's splinters on the floor. They're looking — in my mind, this is an Annie Leibovitz shoot… It just sound incredible. I'm sad I didn't see it.”


	Meyers had a special Tay/Kover blue mug on his desk and the entire night was devoted to Swift, with the host sprinting through his traditional “A Closer Look” segment to get to the main event. He also, super casually, asked about the invitations for her wedding to Kelce, which Swift, shockingly, said she had not even thought about it yet. Meyers, who graciously agreed to an Evite for the blessed event, then suggested Swift send the invites in a picture frame, since people will probably frame it up anyway.

	Ten months after initially filing the lawsuit, accusing Lamar of defaming him while labeling him a “certified pedophile,” it was thrown out by Judge Jeannette Vargas, who granted UMG's motion for dismissal.

	While Drake can still appeal the ruling to a federal appeals court, fans from both sides of the coin didn't waste any time flooding social media with their reactions. 


	Lamar fans and Drake detractors mocked the OVO faithful on X and IG, while the rivalry was seemingly renewed with the famed 2024 battle now in the rear-view. 


	“From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,” UMG relayed to Billboard in a statement. “We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”

	











	“Not Like Us” arrived in May 2024 and served as the killshot in Kendrick's battle against Drake. The scathing diss track produced by Mustard topped the Billboard Hot 100 and swept all five of its nominations at the 2025 Grammy Awards, including record of the year and song of the year.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I don't think Drake and Kendrick tweeted one diss during their back and forth. That's Hip Hop. Keep it in the music. We are all tired.

This happening in the month of October is actually poetic. Talk about some Poetic Justice.

I still don't understand why Drake didn't just walk away from the battle. He lost to Kendrick Lamar but still earned some respect from accepting the challenge and taking on multiple opponents at once. The lawsuit was a terrible look, even more so now! 🤦🏾‍♂️

Drake went up against the “Machine” and lost… yall think im crazy for saying Drake will be blackballed.. There will be consequences from the “Machine”… he will always have fan support but the Machine will be whacking him behind the scenes for that lawsuit 🌚

Executive Editor, Television


Hulu keeps releasing trailers with Kim Kardashian in them and people keep watching.


	The streamer has touted that the trailer for All's Fair, its upcoming legal drama starring Kardashian, Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash-Betts, has become its biggest ever in just 24 hours.


	It launched the promo yesterday and it has received 57.3M views across YouTube and social media. The Google-owned service was responsible for just over 16M of those views.


	The trailer introduces audiences to a group of highly skilled, tenacious female divorce attorneys who have left their male-dominated firm to open their own powerhouse practice, all of them dead set on helping women best their husbands in messy divorces.

	











	It beats Season 3 of reality series The Kardashians, which was Hulu's biggest ever trailer launch with 47.2M when it was released in 2023.


All's Fair, which comes from Ryan Murphy, will premiere on November 4. The trailer also highlights the drama between Kardashian and Paulson's characters, which appears to be extending beyond the courtroom and into their own ranks when Paulson takes on Kardashian's husband as her client.


	The series also stars Teyana Taylor and Matthew Noszka.


All's Fair is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television. The series is written and executive produced by Murphy, who also directs. Other executive producers include Jon Robin Baitz, Joe Baken, Jamie Pachino, Lyn Greene, Richard Levine, Kardashian, Close, Watts, Nash-Betts, Paulson, Kris Jenner, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson and Nissa Diederich. Anthony Hemingway executive produces and directs as well.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Chris Pratt has saved the galaxy, battled velociraptors and is now playing an LAPD detective accused by an AI court of slaying his wife in Amazon MGM Studios‘ upcoming Mercy from Timur Bekmambetov.


	The trailer just dropped at New York Comic Con, and we see that Pratt's Detective Raven, the architect of a system whereby accused felons have 90 minutes to prove their innocence, is now convicted. He's up against an AI judge (Rebecca Ferguson), and he doesn't know how this occurred. Pratt's Raven gets help from his partner (Kali Reis), who helps him retraces his steps.


	Pratt said the movie, which is set in the near future, was shot like a stage play with 60-minute full-length takes. Ferguson's judge is on a monitor, as you can see in the trailer, with Pratt buckled down in a chair. The actor said he literally was strapped in during the shoot, creating “a natural claustrophobia.”

	











	Said Bekmambetov about having the movie set in real time: “We live in a world today where AI is knocking on the door and we don't have time to understand what happened. AI could be our enemy, our friend or our child. This ticking clock is metaphorical of the time we live in now.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Oscar-winning Oppenheimer producer Charles Roven, who also was on today's NYCC panel, said: “We got a pitch from a writer, Marco [van Belle], who wrote the script. When we first got the script, people were talking about AI, and it wasn't happening yet. When we started talking about the movie, all of a sudden companies were dealing with AI, and the future wasn't definitely not far away. The fact that the movie takes place in 2029, I think every day, every week, every month that goes by, there's something more that makes our movie true.”


	Give Mercy props: It was shot in downtown Los Angeles. Bekmambetov shot a truck-chase scene over six days. Talk about taking DP equipment to another level: The director revealed that in addition to shooting the movie with bodycams and drones, he used robo-dogs to film crowd scenes.  The pic comes hits theaters January 26 via Amazon MGM Studios.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Westeros has never looked less dour than in A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms teaser","https://www.avclub.com/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-teaser-hbo-game-of-thrones","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:52:00 GMT","

While A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms is set 100 years before the events of Game Of Thrones, its first teaser brings some welcome change to Westeros. Until now, all we've known of the on-screen Game Of Thrones universe are the sweeping, epic tales of its original series and prequel spin-off House Of The Dragon. There is still a bunch of new characters (some with either the familiar Targaryen blonde tresses or Baratheon antler crown) thrown at us here, but it's clear that the series is primarily concerned with only two: Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). 

Further differentiating the new series from what came before, the half-hour (!) drama appears to be a more cut-and-dry—and, dare we say, somewhat lighthearted—hero's journey than the complicated, interwoven tales of Jon, Arya, and the rest of the original gang. It's also refreshing to spend so much time with a character who doesn't seem to have any aspirations of sitting on the throne or holding any real power at all; he just wants to be taken seriously. “A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros… a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg,” the series' logline reads. “Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.”



The show, which is based on George R.R. Martin's Tales Of Dunk And Egg novellas, was co-created by Martin and showrunner Ira Parker. The six-episode season premieres January 18 on HBO and HBO Max.

Despite recent success, Zohran Mamdani still faces many challenges toward becoming mayor of New York City, particularly Islamophobia and biases against Democratic Socialists. In addition to being the Big Apple's first Muslim candidate for mayor, he's running against disgraced former Governor and establishment-approved sex pest Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't miss an opportunity to provoke said establishment's prejudices against his opponent. But even the would-be high-profile fighters for Democracy can't seem to treat an outsider candidate with due respect. In a New Yorker profile on Mamdani, the candidate revealed the dismissive line of questioning The Late Show With Stephen Colbert's producers used to work around Mamdani's belief that Israel shouldn't be allowed to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

Mamdani appeared on The Late Show alongside New York City Comptroller Brad Lander during the June Democratic primary. The two candidates had recently endorsed each other in hopes of shutting out Cuomo, a plan that ultimately worked. Ahead of their appearance, Colbert's producers held a prep call with Mamdani, Lander, and their aides to go over some basic political questions about their positions. It seemed to go well enough, but right before they went on stage, producers threw a couple of curveballs at Mamdani. Per The New Yorker, hours before the segment, a group of prominent Jewish Zionists (the article only names Elie Wiesel's son, Elisha) demanded that Colbert “grill” Mamdani on Israel. A Colbert producer thought of a “thumbs-up or thumbs-down” segment, as in “Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: Hamas. Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: a Palestinian state,” would do the trick. Mamdani was unimpressed. “I just couldn't believe what was happening,” Mamdani told The New Yorker. “That a genocide could be distilled into a late-night game.”

Mamdani's advisers were just as unhappy, with a senior adviser telling producers that they wondered why the producers didn't want to ask about “the first Muslim candidate for mayor in the history of New York.” It's an Islamophobic line of questioning foisted on Mamdani throughout the campaign, despite, as the candidate frequently tells people, he's not running for mayor of Israel. Nevertheless, he offered an answer: “Yes, like all nations, I believe it has a right to exist, and a responsibility also to uphold international law.”

Dolly Parton's late husband, Carl Dean, quietly finalized his estate plans years before his passing — and now, the details have officially been made public. Court documents obtained by Us Weekly reveal the provisions Dean made for Parton and their family, as well as how he planned to distribute his assets if she had passed first.

Dean died on March 3 at the age of 82. According to the filing, the will — signed on January 16, 2013 — was never amended. The country music icon, 79, has since been appointed executor of his estate.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

Dean's will names the Carl Thomas Dean Trust as the sole beneficiary of his estate, with Parton serving as trustee. The documents, obtained by US Weekly, state that the couple had no children and that Dean did not own real property in Tennessee, but he did possess personal property and cash. He also had no controlling interest in any active business or enterprise.

The will lays out specific instructions for the division of personal effects. Dean wrote that he intended to leave a handwritten note specifying who would receive which household and personal items. If that note could not be found, Parton would take responsibility for distributing the property.

Dean designated that Parton would receive “all of his right, title, and interest in any personal effects relating to her music and entertainment career, including, without limitation, pictures, costumes, jewelry, musical instruments and equipment.” If she had passed before him, those items would have been distributed through the trust.

Parton will also inherit his interests in furniture, art, automobiles, and other assets. If she had predeceased him, those items would have been divided equally among Dean's five nieces and nephews and Parton's 14 nieces and nephews.

If Parton could not serve as executor, Dean nominated his niece to take her place.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

The will's release comes as Parton continues to address public speculation about her health. Last week, the singer postponed her Las Vegas residency, and her sister called on fans to pray for her.

“I know lately everybody thinks that I am sicker than I am,” Parton said in a video shared to Instagram on Wednesday, captioned, “I ain't dead yet!” Filming between commercial shoots, she told fans, “Do I look sick to you? I'm working hard here!”

She explained that following Dean's death, she “didn't take care of myself” and “let a lot of things go.” Doctors recently told her it was time to address “some problems,” prompting her to cancel certain commitments to stay closer to home.

“Nothing major,” she assured. “But I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home.”

Parton concluded the video with a message to put fans at ease: “I wanted you to know that I'm not dying! I don't think God is through with me, and I ain't done working.”

DOLLY YOU ARE AN AMAZING  singer I love  the way you sing and please you need to really take good care of yourself  life is precious  I am 80 years of age and I  do my best to keep going with God in my life it's  been going good thank God. Because  in reality  I believe that He has the last say in our lives  especially if  a person  has a humble and loving person  because  God is love.😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏 God bless you.

For cinephiles of a certain age, the emergence of cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed was a watershed moment in American movies. His work on Spike Lee‘s “Clockers,” on which he made his feature debut in 1995 as director of photography, is still stunning in its audacity over 30 years later — it's a master class in how to harness light, color, and composition toward specific and devastating emotional effects. 

Sayeed used a then largely antiquated film stock, Ektachrome, to find an appropriate visual grammar for Lee's harrowing portrait of a crack-devastated neighborhood, and the result was one of the most original and striking films of its (or any other) era. It was also a big risk that paid off — at the time, Sayeed told American Cinematographer magazine that Kodak warned him that the reversal stock he was shooting on might not survive the shoot.

It did, and the successful experiment led to a series of collaborations between Sayeed and Lee that included “Girl 6” and “He Got Game,” films as revolutionary in their technique as they were lively and playful. No one else in the 1990s was making movies that looked like these, or like Sayeed's gorgeous work on Hype Williams' crime movie “Belly”; it was impossible to deny that Sayeed was a major talent.

 










One moviegoer who took notice was Luca Guadagnino, who was a few years away from making his directorial debut with “The Protagonists” when he saw “Clockers” for the first time. “I hadn't done my first movie yet, but I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to work with this guy,'” Guadagnino told IndieWire. “His sense of cinema was astonishing, and he has a technical approach to his work that is mind-blowing.”

There was only one problem: by the time Guadagnino started directing movies, Sayeed had left feature films behind for a life shooting commercials, motivated largely by his desire to be present for his kids. “We give all of ourselves to make films,” Sayeed said. “I started a family, and I just felt at a certain point that I needed to focus on that, because I'm not a good multitasker. And it wasn't like I was deliberate about not doing a film, it was just that the right one would have to come.”

The “right one” that brought Sayeed back to feature filmmaking after a 25-year hiatus was “After the Hunt,” Guadagnino's academia-set thriller about a philosophy professor (Julia Roberts) whose life is upended when a colleague and former lover (Andrew Garfield) is accused of assault by a student (Ayo Edebiri). Guadagnino had never stopped dreaming of working with Sayeed in the years since he fell in love with “Clockers.” 

 










“I was very consistent because I truly kept wishing to work with Malik,” Guadagnino said. “So being consistent and setting myself the task of getting what I want in life and waiting and being a very patient person, years later, I convinced him to do this movie with me.”

As cinephiles, Guadagnino and Sayeed immediately bonded over their shared references, as they crafted a visual grammar for “After the Hunt” derived from a variety of sources. While Guadagnino acknowledges that there's a Hitchcockian quality to the narrative, he and Sayeed looked beyond the master of suspense to European arthouse cinema and the New Hollywood of the 1970s to figure out how they wanted to mount Nora Garrett's ambiguous screenplay.

“Luca's very precise,” Sayeed said. “He's very precise with language, and very precise with the way he shoots. I liked that he was specific with the references for this.” One key influence was cinematographer Sven Nykvist's work with Ingmar Bergman, specifically the films they made together between 1961 and 1972. “In particular, ‘Persona' and ‘The Silence,' but we also screened a print of ‘Cries and Whispers.' ‘The Passion of Anna' spoke to me as well.”

While Bergman and Nykvist were key inspirations in terms of the portraiture in “After the Hunt,” a film that derives a great deal of its power from staring unwaveringly at human faces, Sayeed and Guadagnino looked at another legendary cinematographer, Gordon Willis. They focused on his work between 1977, when he shot Woody Allen's “Annie Hall,” and 1988, when he photographed James Bridges' underrated “Bright Lights, Big City.” 

 










“With Gordon Willis, it's world-building,” Sayeed said. “With Ingmar Bergman, it's about faces and how they're composed in the frame.” Sayeed also looked to the late, great cinematographer Harris Savides for inspiration in lighting the world of academia in which “After the Hunt” takes place. “It was about creating atmosphere in those spaces,” Sayeed said.

Interestingly, although “After the Hunt” very specifically takes place at Yale, the film was not shot there — or even in America. Sayeed and production designer Stefano Baisi had to recreate Yale in London, where Guadagnino enjoyed making a film in the old Hollywood style, where everything was recreated on massive soundstages and sets. Baisi and Sayeed toured Yale together to examine the architectural styles and study the light in both the interiors and exteriors.

The illusion of reality Sayeed, Baisi, and Guadagnino created is extremely impressive in its craftsmanship, but in spite of his reputation as a master technician, Sayeed feels cinematography is as much about the energy on set as it is about the tools of the trade. “I think the energy on the set gets transduced to the film, always,” Sayeed said. “I think it's Ozu's cinematographer who believed that the energy of the person who touches the camera is actually reflected on the film.”

 










On “After the Hunt,” Sayeed credited not only Guadagnino but actors like Julia Roberts and Michael Stuhlbarg with creating the right kind of energy to make something special happen. “ It starts at the top, and Julia created a calm, comforting space,” he said. “I think Michael usually needs more space, but he was extremely accommodating and very gracious about what everyone else needed.”   

The relaxed energy on set served as both a contrast to the material and the resource that was needed to execute it. “Because of the material and how tough it was, it was important for us to feel like we could do what we needed to do clearly and comfortably in those moments,” Sayeed said. “It was a special place for us to function in, and I'm really thankful I was a part of it, because we are just there to be in the moment, and it was a calm, comfortable space to be in.”

Taylor Swift released her 12th album The Life of a Showgirl last week — and before it was even out for a full day, listeners were already pointing out similarities between her new songs and existing tracks by other artists. The comparisons were harmless, at first, but some of them escalated into full-blown accusations of musical plagiarism. Some of the songs in question include the album's title track, the buzzy diss track “Actually Romantic,” and the Travis Kelce-inspired “Wood.” 


	“The internet loves to sleuth, doesn't it,” forensic musicologist and professor at Berklee College of Music Dr. Joe Bennett tells Rolling Stone. “But similarity alone is not evidence of influence, still less copyright infringement. Coincidental partial similarity is way more common than many people think — but songwriters actually copying from each other is way less common than many people think.”


	Dr. Bennett points out that popular music is a “constrained art form” where most songs have a “fixed tempo, limited topline pitch range, stay with in the home key, and are based on looping chord progressions,” he explains. “Of course, you're going to get slight overlaps from time to time.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Following the rush to point out sonic similarities between Swift's new songs and some older ones, some people on the internet were quick to call for legal action to defend artists they believed had been ripped off. (A rep for Swift declined to comment.) But Dr. Bennett thinks there is not much of a case there for any of the most popular melody comparisons. Here, he breaks down why.

	











	For Dr. Bennett, this one is a false flag. Listening closely will make it clear that “most of the notes are different and they use entirely different chord progressions.” What many are likely picking up on is similar keys and tempos used by both artists. 


	“I would describe them as objectively dissimilar, and it's easily possible that two separate songwriting teams could have arrived at these melodic choices independently of each other,” he says. “Most of the notes are based on the first three pitches of the major scale – literally, do-re-mi. Melodic coincidences happen.”

	“In the case of Actually Romantic, the only similarity is the chord progression (E C#m G# A) and key center (E major),” Dr. Bennett explains. “There are no similarities of topline melody, lyric, or any other part of the composition. But inevitably, songs that use the same chord progression will sound subjectively similar.” The Berklee professor points out that while this particular chord progression —  I-vi-III-IV (1 major, 6 minor, 3 major, 4 major) — is not super common, it is also not entirely unique. “As well as Pixies, I found it in songs by Ellie Goulding, Arctic Monkeys, Demi Lovato, and others. Taylor herself loves to re-use common chord progressions, but always makes a fully original song out of them.”

	To Dr. Bennett, this accusation holds up least. “Every funky guitar player knows licks like this,” he says. He adds that there are several popular songs from the peak disco and funk era that bear the same production tropes and musical elements that she and her co-producers Max Martin and Shellback pulled from: Earth, Wind, and Fire's “September” or “Shining Star,” Michael Jackson's “Don't Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Bee Gees' “Jive Talkin,'” and Taste of Honey's “Boogie Oogie Oogie.”


	Like the rest of the comparisons, Dr. Bennett does not see any reason for Swift to add interpolation credits to her songs. “She's just using commonplace musical elements and having fun with production tropes,” he explains. “When Taylor does choose to interpolate another artist's work, she does so with intentionality and credit. See ‘Look What You Made Me Do' and ‘Father Figure.'”

Drake has lost his defamation suit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” with a federal judge ruling that the allegedly defamatory statements in the hit diss track qualify as “nonactionable opinion.” 


	In a ruling published Thursday, Oct. 9, Judge Jeannette A. Vargas stated: “The issue in this case is whether ‘Not Like Us' can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors. In light of the overall context in which the statements in the Recording were made, the Court holds that it cannot.” 


	In a statement shared with Rolling Stone, a UMG spokesperson said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”

	











	A rep for Drake did not immediately return a request for comment. 


	Drake filed his lawsuit in January, alleging that “Not Like Us” was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile.” Notably, however, the rapper chose to sue UMG — which also releases Drake's music — rather than Lamar directly.


	He claimed the label defamed him by using “every weapon in its arsenal” to turn “Not Like Us” into a hit — including allegedly seeding it with fake bot streams — because it “understood” that the song's “inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.” UMG denied the allegations and moved to dismiss the suit.

	











	In tossing the suit, Judge Vargas compared rap diss tracks to forums like YouTube and X where people are able to spout off, as opposed to anything resembling journalistic reporting or straight news. “The average listener is not under the impression that a diss track is the product of a thoughtful or disinterested investigation, conveying to the public fact-checked verifiable content,” she wrote.

	She also said the defamation claims needed to be examined within the context of the specific Drake-Kendrick rap battle, “in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations.” Judge Vargas even cited the song Drake released before “Not Like Us,” “Taylor Made Freestyle,” which contained an AI-generated Tupac voice trying to goad Lamar into talking about Drake “liking young girls.”

	While Drake tried to argue that “Not Like Us” should be considered as a single entity, Judge Vargas rejected this notion, saying it “must be placed in its appropriate factual context.” She wrote that Lamar's lines — such as, “Say Drake, I hear you like ‘em young” — “must be assessed” in relation to “Taylor Made Freestyle,” stating, “The similarity in the wording suggests strongly that this line is a direct callback to Drake's lyrics in the prior song.” 


	The judge also addressed Drake's allegations that UMG tried to artificially inflate the popularity of “Not Like Us” through fake streams, and found those claims lacking, too. She said Drake's evidence essentially amounts to “Tweets by individual users and reporting from fans,” and called his “reliance on online comments and reporting insufficient to meet the plausibility standard.”

Colorado Republican congresswoman kicks off fourth term run with email to potential donors: ‘They tell us we're crazy'

The Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert has kicked off her run for a fourth term in the US House by pledging to pursue “the truth about UFOs”, said an email from the Colorado politician's re-election campaign to potential donors.

“For decades, our government has shrouded the truth about UFOs in a veil of secrecy,” the Boebert campaign's message on the topic read. “Strange crafts have been spotted soaring through our skies, defying the laws of physics, and yet the bureaucrats in Washington act like we're too NAIVE to handle the facts.”

It continued: “They tell us we're crazy like we can't see these things flying through the air with our own eyes.”

“I SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! The American people aren't children to be spoon-fed half-truths or dismissed with vague excuses. We deserved to know what's really going on up there.”

In an interview with the Colorado news station KDVR, the Democratic political analyst Andy Boian interpreted the bizarre message to be “almost a cry for help … to be honest,” as Boebert vied to retain her seat during the November 2026 midterms.

Boain told the outlet he believed Boebert would be better off facilitating ways to get the federal government to reopen after shutting down on 1 October, when Senate Democrats demanding concessions on healthcare and other spending priorities refused to provide the votes necessary to ratify a Republican-backed funding bill.

But Boian said to KDVR that outlandish ads are often used when candidates are desperate for money or voter support – “neither of which I am seeing right now”.

KDVR reported that Boebert's campaign shrugged off Boain's commentary, claiming the message was performing extremely well among prospective donors because people want answers.

Boebert has demonstrated her focus on aliens and UFOs – also referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) – in public before.

At a congressional hearing on UAPs on 13 November 2024, Boebert asked if there was evidence aliens had ever erected a secret underwater base on earth.

“I think it's about 5% of our ocean that's actually been studied by man,” Boebert, who has occasionally adhered to the QAnon conspiracy theory, asserted during the hearing. “Are there any accounts of UAPs emerging from or submerging into our water which could indicate a base or presence beneath the ocean's surface?”

Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of the news site Public who has reported that the Pentagon runs a secret UFO retrieval program, replied to Boebert that he had never heard of an underwater alien base, but did recount hearing from a source who described an “orb coming out of the ocean and being met by another orb”.

In 2022, Boebert won her second term in Congress by defeating Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by just 546 votes. She moved to a more solidly conservative district in 2024 to duck a congressional rematch with Frisch and clinched a third House term by defeating first-time Democratic candidate Trisha Calvarese.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Diocese of Lincoln: Vibrating St. Gemma relic ‘not of supernatural origin'","https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/diocese-of-lincoln-vibrating-st-gemma","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:46:01 GMT","

After investigating a reliquary that appeared to move on its own this week, the Diocese of Lincoln has determined that the phenomenon is not a supernatural occurrence.

Bishop James Conley of Lincoln told The Pillar Thursday that diocesan officials think a slight vibration in the wall, from the HVAC and electronic systems, was enough to cause the delicate reliquary to shake.



Share

On October 8, the diocese received reports of a reliquary holding a relic of St. Gemma Galgani that appeared to be moving without an apparent cause.

The relic was displayed in a shadowbox with a number of other relics at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, located at the Newman Center on the University of Nebraska – Lincoln campus.

Videos posted online showed the reliquary of St. Gemma appearing to vibrate and move, while the other reliquaries around it remained still.



Having received several reports of the phenomenon this week, the diocese conducted an investigation.

“Tests were conducted including moving the reliquary of St. Gemma from the hook it was on to a different hook. At that point, the reliquary stopped moving,” the diocese said in its statement.

“When a different reliquary was placed on the hook that previously contained the St. Gemma reliquary, the other reliquary also moved. This and the entirety of our full investigation has led us to conclude this incident was not of supernatural origin.”

Conley told The Pillar that this is the first time as bishop that he has investigated a potentially supernatural occurrence.

“There's a canonical process on any kind of unusual [phenomenon], whether it be somebody claiming to have an apparition, a statue claiming to be crying,” Conley said. “These kinds of things are not that uncommon, and sometimes they're real and sometimes they're not.”

When the relic stopped shaking after it was moved to a new pin - and another relic started shaking when placed on the first pin - officials were able to conclude that something was causing the pin at that particular location to vibrate, separate from the relic itself.

The bishop added that students at the Newman Center observed the same phenomenon last year, and mentioned it to their parish priest.

This year, he said, non-students were visiting the church to pray and noticed the vibrating relic. Videos of the relic began to make the rounds in the local community and on social media, drawing widespread interest.

While the shaking relic seems not to be a miracle, Conley is glad the incident has drawn attention to the relics displayed at the church — and to the Eucharist, which he said is the greatest miracle of all.

Conley noted the church where the relics are displayed has Eucharistic adoration all day long.

“Not only is that a great thing to encounter the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist,” the bishop said, “but also to get to know more about St. Gemma.”

St. Gemma Gilgani, who lived at the turn of the 20th century, was a young Italian laywoman. She had numerous mystical experiences during her short life, as well as the stigmata. She was known for her devotion to prayer, penance, and care for the poor.



I posit that the cause is not the HVAC, rather it is the faith of the students shaking the walls and foundation of the Church.

I appreciate the Church being rational when investigating miracles- it highlights the real miracles all the more (in my humble opinion)

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Left-wing Antifa violence, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a handwritten message.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly.”

A photographer captured the text with a long lens (see below). “Very close,” read the scrawl, with the two words underlined.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” it added.

Some have likened the image of Mr Rubio and Mr Trump to that of George W Bush and his chief of staff Andy Card on the morning of September 11 2001, when Mr Card whispered into the president's ear as he read a story called The Pet Goat to children at Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. 

Mr Card told Mr Bush that a second plane had hit the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and “America is under attack”.

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform. A few hours later, it dropped.

“I am very proud that Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” it said.

“BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS,” the post concluded.

The statement capped a frenetic period of diplomatic activity in which Mr Trump has applied the full heft of the White House towards reaching a deal.

If it holds – and it is a big if – the president would have a good case to achieve his long-held dream of being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Insiders said the latest round of negotiations kicked off in earnest exactly a month ago, on Sept 9, when Israel carried out its failed air strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, the capital of Qatar.

Missiles crashed into the terror group's headquarters, killing the son of chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, just as its political bureau was weighing up the latest US proposal.

Mr Trump was furious. The strike had embarrassed the United States, sparked fury among the Arab and Gulf allies crucial to any deal, and achieved none of its military goals.

The president's impatience with Mr Netanyahu hardened. He delivered via backchannels and, later, in person a message: if you do not go along with us on this path to peace, the US will withdraw from its position as Israel's chief ally.

At the same time, Mr Trump tightened his alliance with Qatar, ensuring its leaders would do everything in their power to bring Hamas to heel.

Soon afterwards, Al Jazeera, the state-owned broadcaster, began to promote calls for the Islamist terror group to lay down arms, while watering down anti-Israel coverage.

Another breakthrough came in a meeting between Mr Trump and leaders from Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

The US president said he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. But diplomats from those countries were surprised when the president's 20-point plan dropped the following week.

They felt it reflected Israeli interests much more strongly than the recommendations they had made to Mr Trump and his officials.

A diplomatic source familiar with discussions told The Telegraph: “The output didn't quite add up to the inputs shall we say.”

But Mr Trump and Qatar were now at the head of a process with growing momentum. The source said Arab and Muslim leaders were still discussing how best to raise their worries about the peace plan when Hamas announced they would accept it.

Mr Trump then invited Mr Netanyahu to the White House on Sept 29 and presented a draft of the peace plan pulled together with input from Sir Tony Blair.

Some of it was hard to swallow for the Israeli prime minister. Point 12 stated that Gazans would not be forcibly displaced from the Strip. Point 19 outlined how the deal would help create a “credible pathway” to a Palestinian state.

The Israeli team managed to make last-minute tweaks, but Mr Trump's team rejected an amendment that would allow it to restart the war if it deemed Hamas had broken clauses of the agreement.

To cap off Mr Netanyahu's sudden reversal of fortunes, he was brought into another of the president's “Made For TV” moments in the Oval Office.

Handed a phone by the president, he was forced to call up the Qatari prime minister and personally apologise, more like a naughty schoolboy than the political colossus who has devastated Gaza and humiliated Iran and its proxies.

Next, the plan was presented to Hamas. The group, Mr Trump warned, had three or four days to respond – and, if it refused, Israel would be let off the leash to “destroy” it.

On the night of Oct 3, Hamas issued a full-throated agreement to release the 48 hostages it holds (20 alive, 28 dead).

But it skirted the demand to disarm, and remove itself from post-war governance in Gaza. Analysts characterised it as a carefully calibrated “Yes, but”. Mr Netanyahu saw it as a flat-out rejection – and phoned Mr Trump to persuade him of that view.

A key dividing line between the two men appears to be their approach to the Israeli hostages. Mr Netanyahu spends little time with the hostage families, many of whom accuse him of continuing the war for personal political gain.

By contrast, Mr Trump knows some hostages by name and keeps tabs on their recovery, while Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, regularly texts with the families praying for the release of their loved ones.

Hamas took a gamble: the clear “win” for Mr Trump would be enough for him to overlook its murky views on other parts of the 20-point plan.

It paid off. When Mr Netanyahu phoned the president in an attempt to torpedo the deal, he replied: “Why are you always so f---ing negative?” Axios reported.

The president told the news website he had given Mr Netanyahu no choice but to move towards peace.

“I said, ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it,” Mr Trump said. “He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you've got to be fine.”

Instead of nitpicking the Hamas reply, the president ordered Israel to “stop bombing” in Gaza City, where its troops had begun a full-scale offensive.

Mr Netanyahu accepted, this time. He could not outmuscle the commander-in-chief, as he had with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israel Defense Forces halted offensive operations and began to prepare to receive the hostages.

On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister gave a brief, televised address to the nation. He said Israel had achieved its war goals and cast the move towards diplomacy as his decision, rather than one taken at the behest of the White House.

Hostage families protested in Tel Aviv and other cities, warning against any attempt to sabotage the deal by Mr Netanyahu or his far-Right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who abhor the prospect of an agreement with Hamas.

By Monday, delegations from Israel and Hamas had arrived in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh.

Following reports of progress, Mr Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, joined the talks on Wednesday morning.

However, there were several sticking points to iron out before the “72-hour” window in which Hamas would release the hostages opened.

Israel objected to some of the individuals the terror group wanted to be among the 250 life prisoners freed, including Marwan Barghouti, who was jailed for his role in the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.

In a rare interview, Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader who dodged the missile strike in Qatar, said his group was seeking “real guarantees” that the war would not resume after the release of the hostages, as it had after two earlier ceasefires. The terror group also demanded the body of its former leader, Yahya Sinwar.

By Wednesday night, it appeared that enough progress had been made behind closed doors.

In the White House, Mr Trump was handed the note. True to his style, the president went on to take a further 11 questions, spanning the government shutdown, sanctioning Antifa and on his Nobel Peace Prize hopes, before departing the state dining room to address the matter of ending the war in Gaza.

One of the new cadre of softball reporters who are now routinely admitted to such events pointed out that several nations had nominated Mr Trump for the prize. “By many… by many, many countries,” he agreed. “That's right.”

Mr Trump had, by his own count, ended seven wars and was on the brink of an eighth, he continued. The claims are greatly exaggerated, critics contest.

“I don't think anybody in history has settled that many, but perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me,” he said.

Minutes later, he was gone, heading back to the Oval Office, flanked by JD Vance and Mr Rubio.

Then a Truth Social post dropped, buzzing on journalists' phones all across Washington and beyond. Thumbs scrambled to see if it meant peace in the Middle East.

“Democrats,” intoned the sombre narrator of a political video, “the party of open borders, transgender for everybody, lawlessness in our streets, are shutting down the government in an effort to appease the radical Left”.

A false alarm, as it turned out. But the world was listening, and it did not take long for the big announcement to drop.

Some 50 minutes passed before the president finally declared: “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan.”

All hostages would be released and the IDF would withdraw to “an agreed-upon line”, his post said.

That leaves most of the rest of the 20-point peace plan, including a stabilisation force, aid and a future Palestinian state, to be negotiated. But that is a problem for another day.

Report reveals Maricopa county spent huge sums on items not connected to court-ordered overhaul of agency

The sheriff's office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert's report.

The report released on Wednesday criticized the use of compliance money by the Maricopa county sheriff's office to fund personnel costs and tasks, either in part or in full, that are not connected to the overhaul.

It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8m for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court's orders; $1.5m in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3m to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location.

For over a decade, Maricopa county taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then sheriff Arpaio's traffic patrols targeting immigrants.

The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency's traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.

The county says $323m has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff's department's progress and the agency's compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352m by July 2026.

The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff's office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case's monitor.

The report concluded 72% of the $226m in spending by the sheriff's office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or “improperly prorated” to a compliance fund.

Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.”

Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff's office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.

Sheriff Jerry Sheridan's office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.

Raul Piña, a longtime member of a community advisory board created to help improve trust in the sheriff's office, said the report opens up a broader conversation about the integrity of the sheriff's office.

“You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said.

Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn't still be under the court's supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn't still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30m to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.

The report criticized Maricopa county and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.

Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county's governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board's legal counsel is reviewing the report. “The board has confidence in MCSO's budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said.

Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff's office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency's also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn't yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israel's government ratified a ceasefire with the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday, clearing the way for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours and the freeing of Israeli hostages held there within 72 hours after that. 

The Israeli cabinet approved the deal early Friday morning, roughly 24 hours after mediators announced the agreement, which calls for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the start of a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza under U.S. President Donald Trump's initiative to end the two-year war in the enclave.

“The government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages – the living and the deceased,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's English-language X account said.

The war has deepened Israel's international isolation and upended the Middle East, having evolved into a regional conflict that has drawn in Iran, Yemen and Lebanon. It also tested the U.S.-Israeli relationship, with Trump seeming to lose patience with Netanyahu and pressuring him to reach a deal.

Israelis and Palestinians alike rejoiced after the deal was announced, the biggest step yet toward an end to two years of war in which more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, and the return of the last hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly attacks that started the assault.

Hamas' exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said he had received guarantees from the United States and other mediators that the war was over.

An Israeli government spokesperson said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of government approval of the deal. After that 24-hour period, the hostages held in Gaza would be freed within 72 hours.

Twenty Israeli hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza, while 26 are presumed dead, and the fate of two is unknown. Hamas has indicated that recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing those who are alive.

Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities to dust.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

The accord, if fully implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt the war.

Much could still go wrong. Even after the deal was signed, a Palestinian source said the list of hundreds of Palestinians to be released was not finalized. The group is seeking freedom for some of the most prominent Palestinian convicts held in Israeli jails, as well as hundreds of people detained during Israel's assault.

Hamas wants Marwan Barghouti freed in prisoner exchange, but Israel so far refuses

Further steps in Trump's 20-point plan have yet to be discussed. Those include how the shattered Gaza Strip is to be ruled when the fighting ends and the ultimate fate of Hamas, which has so far rejected Israel's demands it disarm.

Netanyahu also faces skepticism from within his governing coalition, as many have long opposed any deal with Hamas. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would vote to bring down the government if Hamas is not dismantled.

But the announcement of an end to fighting and return of hostages was greeted with jubilation.

 

The Associated Press

“Thank God for the ceasefire, the end of bloodshed and killing,” said Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “All of the Gaza Strip is happy, all the Arab people, all of the world is happy with the ceasefire and the end of bloodshed.”

Einav Zaugauker, whose son Matan is one of the last hostages, rejoiced in Tel Aviv's so-called Hostages Square, where families of those seized in the Hamas attack that triggered the war two years ago have long assembled.

“I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't explain what I'm feeling ... it's crazy,” she said.

In Gaza, Israeli attacks continued before the official start of the ceasefire, but there were far fewer fatalities than the scores killed on a daily basis in recent weeks. Local health authorities reported seven dead in two separate Israeli strikes on Thursday.

Trump said he would head to the region on Sunday to possibly attend a signing ceremony in Egypt, and Israeli Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana invited him to address the legislative body, which would be the first such speech by a U.S. president since 2008. The deal received support from Arab and Western countries and was widely portrayed as a major diplomatic achievement for Trump.

Successful completion of the deal would mark a significant accomplishment for the Republican president, who has struggled to quickly deliver on his promises to bring peace to the Gaza conflict and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Trump praised the 'momentous' Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the 'complicated' hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. 

The Associated Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney congratulated Trump and others whose efforts had helped to bring the deal about. “I want to salute, of course, President Trump, whose decisive leadership has made this possible. Mr. Kushner, Mr. Witkoff, the Qataris, the Egyptians, Turkey, who have been essential to getting to this moment,” Carney told reporters on his way into a cabinet meeeting Thursday morning, referring to Jared Kushner, who is Mr. Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East. 

“The next 48 hours are crucial. We urge the parties, particularly Hamas, to follow through, release all the hostages – including the deceased hostages.”

Western and Arab countries met in Paris to discuss an international peacekeeping force and reconstruction assistance for Gaza once the fighting stops. The United States will deploy 200 troops as part of a joint task force for Gaza stability, with no Americans on the ground in the Palestinian enclave, two senior U.S. officials said on Thursday. 

The officials, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said the 200 would be a core part of a task force that would include representatives from Egypt's military, Qatar, Turkey and probably from the United Arab Emirates. 

More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza, launched after Hamas-led militants stormed through Israeli towns and a music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages. 

Joyful families of hostages and their supporters gathered at a square in central Tel Aviv to celebrate the deal reached by Hamas and Israel.

Texas National Guard troops have arrived at an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, near Chicago. The Trump administration says they deployed troops there to protect ICE facilities and federal law enforcement. In recent weeks, protestors have clashed with federal authorities outside of the facility. CNN's Omar Jimenez reports.

President Donald Trump spoke to some families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza after the news of the ceasefire agreement was announced. Trump told the families that the hostages are “all coming back on Monday.”

Noem said she threatened the mayor during the meeting to send “four times the amount of federal officers” to Portland if he doesn't follow through on security measures for government officers.

The government shutdown is having major impacts on air traffic control capabilities at some of the nation's busiest airports. CNN's Pete Muntean has the latest.

President Donald Trump told reporters he could potentially invoke the Insurrection Act, a law that allows the deployment of troops in the US in certain limited situations, as civilians continue to protest against immigration raids in cities such as Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles.

Video shared with CNN shows a crowd of people in Chicago help stop two masked US Border Patrol agents from detaining an unidentified man. The video of the confrontation lasted more than four minutes before agents released the man, got in their car, and drove away.

When Ann Walter looked outside her rural West Texas home, she didn't know what to make of the bulky object slowly drifting across the sky.

She was even more surprised to see what actually landed in her neighbor's wheat field: a boxy piece of scientific equipment about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, attached to a massive parachute, adorned with NASA stickers. She called the local sheriff's office and learned that NASA, indeed, was looking for a piece of equipment that had gone lost. 

“It's crazy, because when you're standing on the ground and see something in the air, you don't realize how big it is,” she said. “It was probably a 30-foot parachute. It was huge.”

Walter said she soon got a call from NASA's Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, which launches large unmanned, high altitude research balloons more than 20 miles into the atmosphere to conduct scientific experiments.

Officials at NASA, which is impacted by the ongoing government shutdown, did not return messages Thursday. A message left with the balloon facility also was not immediately returned.

A launch schedule on the balloon facility's website shows a series of launches from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of where the equipment landed.

Hale County Sheriff David Cochran confirmed that NASA officials called his office last week in search of the equipment.

Walter said she ultimately spoke with someone at the balloon facility who told her it had been launched a day earlier from Fort Sumner, and uses telescopes to gather information about stars, galaxies and black holes.




“The researchers came out with a truck and trailer they used to pick it up,” she said.

But not before Walter and her family, who live in Edmonson, Texas, were able to capture some photos and videos.

“It's kind of surreal that it happened to us and that I was part of it,” she said. “It was a very cool experience.”

A California company has recalled nearly 245000 pounds (111130.04 kilograms) of pre-cooked pasta linked to a deadly listeria outbreak and potential contamination of dozens of products sold at grocery stores nationwide. 

Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California, recalled thousands of cases of linguine, fettucine, penne and other pastas sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads on Sept. 25, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration notice posted Thursday. 

The move came after tests showed that pasta made by Nate's Fine Foods contained the same strain of listeria found in chicken fettucine Alfredo and meatball linguine products linked to an outbreak that has killed four people and sickened 20 since August 2024. The most recent illness reported occurred on Sept. 11. 

FreshRealm, the San Clemente, California, company that produced those meals, used genetic sequencing to confirm the link to the outbreak. 

Several grocery stores have recalled products made with pasta from Nate's Fine Foods. The FDA and the U.S. Agriculture Department have warned consumers not to eat the foods and to discard them or return them to stores for refund. 

Here are the recalls to date: 

1. Sprouts Smoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad sold from the deli service counter or Grab & Go section with best-by dates from Oct. 10 to Oct. 29.

2. Giant Eagle smoked mozzarella pasta salad — expiration dates Sept. 30 through Oct. 7. 

3. Kroger stores recalled deli bowtie and penne pasta salads — sold Aug. 29 through Oct. 2.

4. Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls 9.6-oz — best if used by dates of March 12 and 13 and March 17 and 21 2027.

5. Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettucine Alfredo 16-oz plastic tray packages with “best if used by” dates Sept. 20, Sept. 24, Sept. 27, Sept. 28, Oct. 1, Oct. 3, Oct. 5, Oct. 8 and Oct. 10.

6. Albertsons stores recalled store-made deli pasta salads — sell thru dates from Sept. 8 to Oct. 4.

7. Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce 12-oz. — best-by dates of Sept. 22, Sept. 24, and 25 and Sept. 29 to Oct. 1.

8. Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine 12.3-oz – best-by date of June 26, 2025, or prior; and 32.8-oz — best-by date of June 27, 2025, or prior.

9. Home Chef Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo 12.5-oz — best-by date of June 19 or prior.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States directly purchased Argentine pesos on Thursday and finalized a $20 billion currency swap line with Argentina's central bank, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a social media post, a rare move aimed at stabilizing turbulent financial markets in the cash-strapped Latin American ally.

“U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” Bessent said, adding that the Treasury Department held four days of meetings with Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo in Washington D.C. to cement the deal.

Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei, a fervent admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, thanked Bessent for his “strong support” and Trump for his “powerful leadership.” 

“Together, as the closest of allies, we will make a hemisphere of economic freedom and prosperity,” Milei said in a social media post.

Bessent, under fire from U.S. farmers and Democratic lawmakers, has insisted that the credit swap is not a bailout. Farmers are angry about the idea of rescuing Argentina, whose own farmers have benefited from a recent gush of sales of soybeans to China at the expense of their U.S. counterparts. Lawmakers have pushed Trump to explain how this financial help aligns with his “America First” agenda.

After the announcement Thursday, a group of Democratic Senators introduced the “No Argentina Bailout Act,” which would stop the Treasury Department from using its Exchange Stabilization Fund assist Argentina. 




“It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Trump promised ‘America First,' but he's putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill.”

It doesn't help that repeated bailouts have failed to stabilize the crisis-stricken economy of Argentina. As the International Monetary Fund's biggest debtor, it owes the global lender a staggering $41.8 billion.

Milei, a wild-haired far-right economist, came to office in late 2023 on the bold promise that this time would be different.

He vowed to take a chainsaw to reckless public spending that he inherited from his left-wing predecessor. But his radical austerity program has been painful, with no economic revival in sight and Argentines are losing patience.

Now Milei faces his greatest test yet as he heads into a midterm congressional election on Oct. 26 that could decide the fate of his free-market experiment. A disastrous defeat in local elections last month triggered a sudden exodus from Argentine assets as investors fretted over the country's political dysfunction, overvalued peso and rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves. 

The U.S. financial help offers Milei a crucial reprieve. On Thursday, Argentina's dollar-denominated bonds rose about 10% on Bessent's confirmation of the credit line and the Buenos Aires stock market surged 15%.

Economy Minister Caputo expressed his “deepest gratitude” to Bessent following the announcement.

“Your steadfast commitment has been remarkable,” he wrote.

Bessent made no mention of any economic conditions attached to the swap line for Argentina, leading many observers to criticize the intervention as a pre-election reward for a loyal friend rather than an investment in a strategic partner.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.

The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can't get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage. 

But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.

That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.

The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.




“The kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That's why we're taking action now to continue strengthening California's insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,” Newsom said in a statement.

Republican state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil said the measure was a good step to help stabilize the FAIR Plan.

“This bill doesn't solve everything. But it does help to ensure that the FAIR Plan customers can rely on coverage in their time of greatest need,” she said in September during a floor debate.

Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board. 

Supporters, including the state's top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.

California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.

Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.

Osama El Khatib, 26, was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail after prosecutors allege he assaulted police officers to help fellow agitators escape arrest.

Pro-Palestinian agitators accused of being behind a riot Tuesday are now being charged with ""promotion of anarchy"" after the melee left several officers injured.

The Boston Herald reported that the Suffolk District Attorney's Office on Thursday upgraded charges for all 13 suspects, who are now accused of violating a state law that makes ""promotion of anarchy"" illegal and is a felony charge, according to court documents.

On Tuesday night, between 200 and 300 people participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston that quickly descended into a riot. Thirteen people were arrested after police allege they became violent toward law enforcement officers.

A spokesperson for the district attorney's office told the Herald the upgraded charges come after a Boston Police Department review of posters promoting the so-called protest, which feature a quote from a Hamas spokesperson and a burning police cruiser.

""Peace be upon your souls that will one day soar in the skies of your liberated Al Quid's and Al Aqsa, purified from the defilement of your killers,"" the poster read, according to police.

Because of that, police determined there was probable cause that the group ""intended to conduct their rally and march in such a way that it induced fear, caused destruction and disruption, caused injury and promoted anarchy.""

Four police officers were injured during the riot.

""Further investigation revealed violent imagery and rhetoric used in promotional media for the Oct. 7 incident,"" the DA's spokesperson said. ""This organizing material promoted violence against police and presented an immediate threat to public safety which, combined with the actions of the individuals arrested, provided clear justification for the enhanced charges.""

Boston police said the group ""surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts,"" adding that ""several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face.

""As violence escalated,"" police said, more officers were sent to the area while the agitators ""continued to resist dispersal.""

Officers reported that the rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment.

""During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear,"" the agency said.

Police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and obstruction of emergency response efforts, along with a slew of other charges including assault.

Osama El Khatib, 26, Roder Atwood, 21, Atalanta Carrig-Braun, 20, Haley MacIntyre, 24, Madeline Weikel, 27, Jacob Pettigrew, 22, Amun Prophet, 25, Laith Hintzman, 19, Benjamin Choucroun, 20, Owen Woodcock, 26, Prahlad Iyengar, 25, Styx Hatch, 19, and Gabrielle Smith, 28, were arrested on Tuesday night.

Bail was set on Wednesday and Thursday for those arrested, ranging from $500 to $10,000.

Notably, bail for Atwood, El Khatib and Hatch was set at $10,000. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office alleges that Khatib punched police officers to help fellow suspects escape without being arrested. While the district attorney's office requested $5,000 cash bail, the judge set bail at $10,000.

The Boston Herald reported that Atwood allegedly broke a police officer's nose during an assault, according to prosecutors.

Suffolk County DA Kevin Hayden sent a message to future protesters in a statement on Wednesday: Remain peaceful or face prosecution.

""These defendants were not in court today because they were protesting,"" Hayden said. ""They were in court because they committed crimes. If you assault police and commit other offenses, you're going to be arrested and prosecuted, period.

""Peaceful protests happen all the time in this city,"" he said. ""We support everyone's right to protest. But these individuals chose against protesting peacefully, and they are now facing the consequences of those choices.""

According to Boston.com, the initial protest was organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, which coincided with the two-year mark of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas.

The protest was intended to ""flood downtown for Palestine.""

According to the report, people yelled ""F--- you, Nazis"" and ""BPD is KKK"" as they refused to leave the area.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise joins ‘America Reports' to discuss Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's reaction to the ongoing government shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., appears to be holding firm on his strategy for pressuring Senate Democrats to agree to end the government shutdown, he indicated in both public and private comments Thursday. 

But even as he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., continue with their plans, some House GOP lawmakers are growing nervous about the potential fallout.

House Republicans held a private call Thursday where Johnson briefed them on the current state of play. And while GOP lawmakers were largely unified behind their leader, Fox News Digital was told, several did express concerns about optics coming from the House and Senate as the shutdown is poised to enter a tenth day.

Johnson had previously canceled House votes this week to keep national attention on Democrats' resistance to the GOP's plan to fund the government. 

SENATE GOP RESISTS 'NUCLEAR OPTION' AS DEM SHUTDOWN STANDOFF DEEPENS

The speaker told House Republicans he would give them 48 hours' notice before the next House votes were called but did not say when that would be, Fox News Digital was told — after publicly stating multiple times that their return would depend on Senate Democrats.

He said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Wednesday: ""As soon as [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.] decides to stop playing games, we'll bring everybody back here and get right back to regular session.""

But at least three House Republicans are advocating for the chamber to return next week whether the shutdown is resolved or not, including two on the Thursday call.

Reps. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., and Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., both spoke up in favor of returning next week, sources told Fox News Digital.

SENATE DEMOCRATS DEFY WHITE HOUSE WARNINGS, AGAIN BLOCK GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT

Obernolte told Johnson the House had more work to do beyond spending bills, adding, ""None of that is getting done,"" Fox News Digital was told.

""I think we're going to get to a point where it's damaging to continue to keep the House out of session. I think we've gotten to that point,"" Obernolte said, Fox News Digital was told.

Fedorchak said she believed House Republicans would be in a better strategic position if they were in D.C., sources said.

But Johnson reiterated his 48-hour pledge and said a recess next week was not a ""final call"" but pointed out that most House Republicans thought it was the right decision, sources said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., made his concerns public on Wednesday, writing on X, ""What the House has done is pass a 7-week Continuing Resolution. The entire reason a CR is necessary is that Congress has not done its job in passing a timely budget. The Speaker shouldn't even think about canceling session for a third straight week.""

On the Thursday call, Johnson also indicated he would not hold a standalone vote on keeping the military paid during the shutdown, sources said.

The speaker argued it was a push led by Democrats who were seeking political cover despite rejecting the GOP's funding plan — which would keep the military paid and the entire government open through at least Nov. 21.

As it stands, service members on active duty are deemed ""essential"" and must keep working, but they could miss their next paychecks on Oct. 15 if the shutdown is ongoing.

""The entire government has to be reopened simultaneously,"" Johnson said, sources told Fox News Digital.

But that's also been met with some concern by House lawmakers.

Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., who is leading a bill to ensure troops are paid during a shutdown, wrote on X Wednesday, ""The President has made it clear: we must pay our troops. I'm urging the Speaker and our House leadership to immediately pass my bill to ensure our service members, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck while supporting their families, receive the pay they've earned.""

Meanwhile, two other House Republicans — Reps. John Rutherford, R-Fla., and Tom Barrett, R-Mich. — spoke up during lawmakers' call on Thursday with concerns about the Senate GOP not moving to bypass Democrats altogether to reopen the government.

Under current Senate rules, most legislation needs to meet a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster and allow for debate.

But there have been several exceptions made in modern times, triggered by the Senate majority leader, in which rules have been changed to lower the threshold to 51 votes for certain issues. Senate Republicans most recently used it earlier this year to overcome Democrats' blockade on President Donald Trump's nominees.

However, Federal funding legislation still needs 60 votes, something Rutherford and Barrett said the Senate should consider changing.

Rutherford specifically warned he was concerned it could open Republicans up to ""bad messaging"" if the Senate did not use the so-called ""nuclear option"" to ensure the military was paid on time when it was used so recently for presidential nominees.

Johnson, as leader of the House of Representatives, does not have a say over what the Senate does. But he addressed a similar query during a Q&A with Americans on C-SPAN Thursday morning.

""The filibuster is a tradition there that people on both sides cherish, and the reason is if you blow that up, and you go nuclear on something like a CR, their argument is you would open a Pandora's box,"" Johnson said.

""What if the socialists take over the Senate, and Democrat socialists are in charge, and they want to grow government to take over the means of production, and they don't have any safeguard there, and they could do it with a bare-minimum majority next time?""

The government shutdown is poised to roll into a tenth day on Friday after Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's funding plan a seventh time.

Republicans are pushing a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 funding levels, called a continuing resolution (CR), to give lawmakers more time to reach a deal on FY2026 spending levels.

But Democrats, infuriated at being sidelined in the discussions, are demanding serious concessions on healthcare provisions in exchange for their support for a spending deal.

Benny Safdie has built a career by capturing men on the downswing.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The Upper West Side deli where I meet Benny Safdie is filled with a particular kind of grumpy old-school Manhattanite. They're the type of figure who has tended to populate the filmmaker's movies: many of them neurotic, and more concerned with finding a means to their own ends than placating the people around them. With his brother, Josh, Benny has built a career on his fascination with these occasionally surly characters, often men on the downswing. For his first solo directing effort, The Smashing Machine, Safdie focuses on a somewhat unexpected figure: a sports champion, albeit one who is learning what it's like to fail. “I want to know what it feels like to go through that,” he told me, over a plate of eggs, discussing the film. It's an uncomfortable portrait—of who the winner becomes when he starts to lose.

Safdie has zeroed in on one athlete in particular: the mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played here by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Kerr—an absolute wall of a man, and thus a role befitting of Johnson—became renowned for his unassailable winning streak throughout the late '90s and early aughts. The film's basic plot resembles that of many traditional sports biopics. It follows the height of Kerr's career, as well as his eventual battle with a painkiller addiction and his rocky relationship with his girlfriend, Dawn (played by Emily Blunt). But the emotional core was built upon Safdie's animating question: “If you take somebody in a position like that, that's really unrelatable, that's the best in the world, but then they start faltering?” It's a sly, sad turn in the other direction; observing Kerr's descent, Safdie said, “allows you to learn something about yourself and the rest of the world.”

For a film of this size, it's an unusual angle to take. The movie certainly has the biggest budget of any Safdie has directed, featuring two blockbuster stars angling for awards attention. And although Kerr is a well-known name in UFC history, his notoriety came years before the sport had gone mainstream; the film illustrates its early days of semi-lawlessness, when it was dodging a perception of being both seedy and violent. Safdie's approach is warts-and-all, delving into Kerr's personal setbacks and the small-scale, late-'90s griminess that defined his profession. Rocky this is not, and viewers will not exit theaters punching the air.

Read: ‘Warrior culture' offers a lot, but not everything

In fact, when I asked Safdie about his influences, he pointed to Rocky III as the clearest comparison for his film. “In Rocky III, he starts as the best,” Safdie said of the titular boxer's journey. “Then what happens?” Rocky, in that movie, has to shed the trappings of fame to recapture his magic; in The Smashing Machine, Kerr has to shed his entire macho ego. Safdie's unabashed desire to plumb a seeming invincible figure's decline made Kerr a wise choice for a subject, but also a somewhat bold one. Whatever desire the audience might have to root for Kerr is undermined by his mounting failures in the ring and his growing friction with Dawn. And whereas with Rocky III audiences had two movies' worth of time already invested in the protagonist, to most theatergoers, Kerr will be practically a stranger.

Johnson's familiarity is key to bringing audiences close to Kerr and helps the film overcome its potentially alienating storyline. Unlike Kerr, Johnson might be the most famous professional wrestler who ever lived: a man who made his name in the WWE, a business that blended brute-strength athleticism with performance. He's since evolved into a family entertainer with a sparkling smile—a larger-than-life hero that little kids can look up to, no cape-and-spandex necessary.

Kerr's story attracted Johnson in part because he was interested in challenging his own broad popularity. He initially approached Benny and Josh—who, together, had become known for directing high-stress crime dramedies—with the idea of a Kerr biopic in 2019. It's easy to see what drew Johnson to them; the Safdies had given Adam Sandler, the star of the gorgeous, stomach-ache-inducing Uncut Gems, one of his meatiest and most-acclaimed dramatic roles. But COVID disrupted any planning, and when the dust settled, the Safdie brothers publicly (and, according to Benny, amicably) split. Through it all, Safdie kept thinking about the Kerr project, eventually buying a copy of a yellow Nautica sweatshirt Kerr wears in an HBO documentary about his career and sending it to Johnson. “What really affected him about that was he was like, ‘Nobody's ever asked me to do this. They all look to me for that other stuff,'” Safdie recalled of Johnson. The project offered a rare opening for the actor to take a risk.

Read: You've never seen Adam Sandler act this well

That risk includes the fact that the role required a dramatic physical transformation—involving facial prosthetics to better resemble Kerr, which could've diminished his usual appeal. Yet the director resisted making Johnson totally unrecognizable. “You can still see Dwayne underneath it,” he said. “There's a vulnerability that he allows,” which makes “you feel even closer to him.” That blend of actor and character works best when Kerr tries to get what he wants, be it a better contract or, in one of the film's more wrenching scenes, better painkillers from an MMA-affiliated pharmacist. Seeing Johnson turn off his pro-wrestler, movie-star charm beneath Kerr's heavy brow is somehow heartbreaking, and a little unsettling. “That was what Mark said when he saw it,” Safdie said, referring to Kerr. “He was like, ‘Wow, I know how hard it is to be that vulnerable.'”

The beginning of The Smashing Machine shows us what a force Kerr could be, while demonstrating his limits as a star. His approach of pinning and pummeling rarely made for good TV; as mixed martial arts fought for airtime, it began changing its rules to keep Kerr's overpowering style from dominating. The game starts to slip away from him and Safdie gets his camera closer and closer, trying to home in on the human beings in the ring. The darkest stuff comes not with Kerr's addiction (which is painful, yet sad and recognizable), but in how he pushes Dawn away and belittles her at home while he contends with his losing streak. At moments during the film, I was reminded of the Safdie brothers' 2013 documentary, Lenny Cooke, which told the story of a top-ranked high-school basketball player who went toe-to-toe with a young LeBron James, only to go undrafted by the NBA and end up struggling to support himself. That endeavor to find one's humanity after a slump is threaded through The Smashing Machine, too.

The intimate focus extends to the characters around Kerr, many of whom are played by real-life MMA fighters such as Ryan Bader and Satoshi Ishii, and the boxer Oleksandr Usyk. The film highlights mundane details of camaraderie behind the scenes of every fight, emphasizing the bonds between the fighters, who would often root for one another after their bouts were over. “They're all friends. They all know each other. They feel bad because he gets hurt,” Safdie said. As the plot develops, we watch as Kerr goes from someone needing to stabilize his career, make money, and afford drugs to someone going into his final fight more engaged with the community around him. Sure, he still wants to win, but the pressures have changed.

Perhaps above all, the film demonstrates that Kerr, in spite of his brute force in the ring, is a vulnerable guy looking for love and attention. Despite the intensity of the fights we see, we're meant to understand that this isn't a sport in which the competitors hate each other. Safdie recalled watching a boxing match that captures this element. “This corner man is yelling at the fighter, yelling at him, yelling at him, yelling at him. And then at the end of his speech, the fighter just grabs the guy and kisses him on the lips,” he said. “That's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life. He's basically saying, No, I'm okay. Don't worry about me. I've got this. And I just want to show stuff like that, where it's just genuine care for each other.”

The Smashing Machine can hardly be called warm—it's standoffish in a way that is, if not unfamiliar to Safdie's fans, perhaps a more difficult sell to the average moviegoer. But Safdie has tended to seek out complicated characters, who strive for something better amid their harsh environments; I've left many of his films feeling shaken to the core yet undeniably moved.

Some of that earnest earthiness comes through in how Safdie interacts with the moviegoing public. When his first film, 2009's low-budget Daddy Longlegs, was playing at a single theater in New York, Safdie stood by the entrance wearing a sandwich board, one that loudly proclaimed THIS MOVIE EXISTS! and bade passers-by to check it out. The Smashing Machine is in many more theaters than that, but Safdie is still donning the sandwich board and hanging out in lobbies. His advertising is just like his approach to storytelling: unselfconsciousness.

Serve Robotics is trying to get as many businesses as possible to use its cooler-shaped delivery robots — even if it means teaming up with an apparent rival.

The autonomous delivery company's latest partner is DoorDash, which is also developing its own delivery robots. On Thursday, the companies said Serve's robots would start making deliveries for DoorDash in Los Angeles, a city where Serve already works with Uber Eats.

Ultimately, the goal is to roll out the partnership across the US, the companies said.

Serve, which was spun out of Uber-owned Postmates in 2021, operates delivery robots in five cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami.

Working with DoorDash, which unveiled its own delivery robot last month, might seem counterintuitive. But Ali Kashani, Serve's CEO, said that DoorDash's Dot is more complementary than threatening to his company. Right now, he said, there are far more deliveries than robots that can make them, and different robots will be best for different circumstances.

""We are all going to try different approaches and see which one of them makes the most sense,"" Kashani told Business Insider in an interview..

The goal is to make delivery robots more like ride-hailing drivers, who switch between working for Uber and Lyft depending on where they can pick up work.

""We want to be a shared platform,"" Kashani said. ""We want to be an infrastructure that everybody can use.""

Shares of Serve were trading 26% higher on Thursday after the announcement.

Besides DoorDash and Uber Eats, the company also works directly with some restaurants and retailers, including 7-Eleven and Shake Shack.

Autonomous vehicles — be they cars or delivery bots — are becoming more common on the sidewalks and streets of US cities.

Robotaxis are appearing in more metro areas: Waymo, which has offered rides in self-driving cars for years in some cities like San Francisco, started making its vehicles available to Uber users in Atlanta and Austin earlier this year. Tesla also started its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin around the same time.

Smaller self-driving delivery vehicles are also gaining ground, though executives say that using robots for delivery presents a different set of challenges, such as handing off orders from the restaurant to the robot.

Last month, DoorDash unveiled Dot, a stroller-sized delivery robot it developed in-house. The robot can travel up to 20 miles an hour and traverse sidewalks and bike lanes on roads.

While getting around through ride-hailing has become a habit for many consumers, Kashani said that having things delivered is more ubiquitous — and is, potentially, a bigger market for self-driving technology.

""Everybody is very distracted by self-driving cars to move people,"" he said. ""But for every person, there are so many items that we consume or we touch every day. I actually think it's as big, if not bigger, than the movement of people.""

New York City is taking on some of the biggest names in tech.

In a 327-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in the Manhattan federal court, the city alleged that Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance created a ""public nuisance"" and a ""youth mental health crisis"" by intentionally exploiting the psychology of young users to keep them hooked.

The city alleged in the complaint that the platforms' algorithms are designed to maximize engagement at the expense of children's mental health, contributing to sleep loss, chronic absenteeism, and risky behavior such as ""subway surfing,"" meaning riding on top of moving trains. All these behaviors, the complaint said, are heavily costing schools, educators, and the public health system.

""Social media use by teens has recently been implicated in alarming increases in dangerous and even deadly off-campus activity in New York City,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""One such dangerous type of conduct known to be spreading through viral social media posts is 'subway surfing.'""

The lawsuit cited data from the NYC Police Department that at least 16 teens have died in such incidents since 2023, including two girls aged 12 and 13, who died this month.

""Defendants should be held to account for the harms their conduct has inflicted on New York City youth and on the NYC Plaintiffs' educational and public health ecosystems,"" the plaintiffs wrote in the complaint. ""As it stands now, NYC Plaintiffs are left to abate the nuisance and foot the bill.""

The NYC Mayor's office, Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The NYC Law Department said in a statement to Business Insider that social media has resulted in ""substantial interference"" with school district operations and public hospitals that provide mental health services to youth.

The City School District of the City of New York and New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation are also plaintiffs in the case. The NYC's health commissioner said social media was a public health hazard in January 2024.

Among the defendants, Meta is the owner of Facebook and Instagram, Snap runs Snapchat, and Alphabet owns Google and YouTube. The Trump administration is facilitating a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok, but the Chinese company still owns the platform as of now.

""These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true,"" José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson, told Business Insider. ""YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports, to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends.""

Owners of social media giants have previously been in the crosshairs of lawmakers and brought into Senate hearings over allegations of harming and exploiting children. In 2024, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, faced a room full of families who said their children had suffered harm from social media.

NYC withdrew from a similar litigation announced by Mayor Eric Adams in February 2024, which was pending in California state courts, so that it could join the new federal litigation.

In this article

Levi Strauss's profits are growing more than Wall Street expected despite higher costs from tariffs, thanks to targeted price increases and a shift away from wholesalers, the company said Thursday as it reported fiscal third quarter results. 

During the quarter, Levi's gross margin grew 1.1 percentage points to 61.7%, up from 60.6% in the year-ago period and better than the 60.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

In an interview with CNBC, CEO Michelle Gass said the company has started to raise the price of some of its jeans and clothes and will hike more prices in the U.S. and other markets next year.

""As we've been taking these targeted actions, we've not seen an impact to demand. We'll of course, stay very, very close to that but … we're taking a surgical, thoughtful approach on any pricing,"" said Gass. ""We know that we're a brand that is known for great quality and value. We don't take that for granted. We know we have to earn that every day."" 

Finance chief Harmit Singh added demand is ""really strong"" and most of the company's revenue growth is not coming from price increases.

Price hikes are helping Levi's margins, but the company is also discounting less and selling more through its own website and stores instead of wholesalers, which comes at a higher margin. 

The denim maker said its strong results led it to raise its full-year outlook, but added it's still taking a ""prudent"" and ""conservative"" look at the rest of the year as it navigates ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Singh said. 

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Though Levi's posted better-than-expected results, shares dropped more than 6% in extended trading. Its stock had climbed about 42% this year through Thursday's close.

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 31 was $218 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $20.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to impairment and restructuring charges, among other expenses, Levi posted adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $1.54 billion, up 7% from $1.44 billion a year earlier.

Levi's is now expecting its full year sales to rise 3%, up from its prior guidance of between 1% and 2% growth, far exceeding expectations of a 2.9% decline, according to LSEG. 

It's expecting its full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.27 and $1.32, up from a prior range of between $1.25 and $1.30. At the high end, the outlook is in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.31 per share, according to LSEG. 

The jeans company said it's expecting its operating margin to be between 11.4% and 11.6%, which is also in line with expectations of 11.6%, according to StreetAccount. It's now expecting its gross margin to rise by 1 percentage point, which is the outlook Levi's delivered earlier this year before it factored tariffs into its forecast. At the time, its guidance didn't reflect any tariff impact. The following quarter, it cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points because of the new duties. 

Now, Levi's is returning to that original outlook, as long as U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and rest-of-world duties stay at 20% for the remainder of the year. 

Under the direction of Gass, Levi's has been working to grow its direct sales, expand beyond jeans and win over more female shoppers – strategies that helped the business grow both its top and bottom lines. 

During the quarter, direct-to-consumer revenue, or sales from Levi's website and stores, grew 11%, driven by strength in the U.S. market, while women's was up 9%. Levi's is benefiting from strong momentum in the denim category, but the company is growing its assortment outside of just jeans, which gives it a hedge if fashion trends change.

Other types of clothes beyond denim bottoms, including tops, now make up nearly 40% of the business. The company's efforts to sell more tops is also resonating with consumers, as that category was up 9% during the quarter.

The U.S. Treasury finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina and bought pesos in the open market on Thursday, making good on President Donald Trump's pledge to prop up the wobbling country and sending the peso and Argentine dollar bonds sharply higher.

""The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in announcing the actions on X.

Argentina's 2035 bond rose 4.5 cents to trade at 60.5 cents on the dollar, while the peso closed at 1,418 per dollar, up 0.8% on the day after falling 3% earlier.

Local stocks rose 5.3% Thursday. Last month, they touched a 2025 low, days before Bessent's initial support pledge. Argentine stocks traded in U.S. exchanges rallied 13%.

Bessent issued his statement at the end of four days of meetings with Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo that also involved officials from the International Monetary Fund. In April, the IMF granted Argentina a new $20 billion loan program.

A spokesperson for the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. actions.

""Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,"" Bessent said in his post. ""The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly. And act we will. To that end, we directly purchased Argentine pesos.""

A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to provide any further details, including on the amount of pesos purchased and how the $20 billion currency swap line would be structured.

Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate complained that Trump was moving to provide financing to bail out a foreign government and global investors, even as the U.S. government has been shut down.

Previously, Bessent had pledged the use of the Treasury's $221 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund and its holdings of IMF reserve assets known as Special Drawing Rights to support Argentina.

The backstop is partly aimed at giving Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei, a boost in Argentina's October 26 mid-term legislative elections. His party wants to strengthen its minority position to solidify his agenda to cut government spending and boost private-sector investment.

Argentine lawmakers are working to limit what the president can do via decrees, raising the stakes for Milei's party in the midterms.

Although the effect on financial markets was immediate, there was no guarantee the U.S. backstop will improve Milei's party's election prospects as public dissent over his austerity measures has grown.

UBS's Shamaila Khan, head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific, said the announcement was likely to bolster prospects for Milei's party. Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy, said the midterms remain the major event, as are a policy and FX adjustment after the vote.

Bessent called the success of Milei's reforms of ""systemic importance,"" to the U.S. by helping to anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere.

Milei, who is due to meet Trump next week during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, thanked Bessent and Trump in a message on X.

""Together, as the closest of allies, we will make a hemisphere of economic freedom and prosperity. We will work hard every day to provide opportunity for our people,"" Milei wrote.

Investors greeted the intervention with a sigh of relief.

Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at BankInvest, said markets had been hungry for details of Bessent's support pledge and had been challenging peso valuations.

""If they hadn't come through with a promise they made...we would be talking about a complete collapse of Argentina,"" he said.

Several U.S. Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to bail out Argentina and global investors. The measure is largely symbolic, as Democrats remain the minority in both chambers of Congress.

""It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to the partial government shutdown due to lack of funding.

""Trump promised 'America First,' but he's putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill,"" said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

In this article

YouTube is offering creators who were banned from the platform a second chance.

On Thursday, the Google-owned platform announced it is rolling out a feature for previously terminated creators to apply to create a new channel. Previous rules led to a lifetime ban.

""We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance,"" wrote the YouTube Team in a blog post. ""We're looking forward to providing an opportunity for creators to start fresh and bring their voice back to the platform.""

Tech companies have faced months of scrutiny from House Republicans and President Donald Trump, who have accused the platforms of political bias and overreach in content moderation.

Last week, YouTube agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit involving the suspension of Trump's account following the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021.

YouTube said this new option is separate from its already existing appeals process. If an appeal is unsuccessful, creators now have the option to apply for a new channel.

Approved creators under the new process will start from scratch, with no prior videos, subscribers or monetization privileges carried over.

Over the next several weeks, eligible creators logging into YouTube Studio will see an option to request a new channel. Creators are only eligible to apply one year after their original channel was terminated.

YouTube said it will review requests based on the severity and frequency of past violations.

The company also said it will consider off-platform behavior that could harm the community, such as activity endangering child safety.

The program excludes creators terminated for copyright infringement, violations of its Creator Responsibility policy or those who deleted their accounts.

YouTube's 'second chance' process fits with a broader trend at Google and other major platforms to ease strict content moderation rules imposed in the wake of the pandemic and the 2020 election.

In September, Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan sent a letter to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, that announced the platform had made changes to its community guidelines for content containing Covid-19 or election-related misinformation.

The letter also claimed that senior Biden administration officials pressed the company to remove certain Covid-related videos, saying the pressure was ""unacceptable and wrong.""

YouTube ended its stand-alone Covid misinformation rules in December 2024, according to Donovan's letter.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and gold (GC=F) climbed to record highs this week, underscoring two sides of the so-called debasement trade as investors hedge against weakening fiat currencies.

Even traditional gold bulls are taking notice of bitcoin's growing role as “digital gold.”

“The bitcoin trade is too large to ignore,” Paul Karger, Twin Focus co-founder and managing partner, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. “Everybody that's been calling bunk on bitcoin the last decade has been proven wrong.""

On Thursday, bitcoin hovered below $122,000, down from Monday's all-time high north of $125,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency is up 31% year to date.

Karger said he still favors a larger 5% allocation to gold, with a smaller holding in bitcoin across client portfolios, but acknowledged that the world's largest cryptocurrency “has a place in a diversified portfolio.”

Karger suggested restructuring the fixed-income portion of the traditional 60/40 portfolio, which typically allocates 60% to equities and 40% to bonds.

He recommended diversifying away from long-dated bonds in favor of shorter-term debt, real estate, digital assets, gold, and broader commodities such as copper and AI-infrastructure plays.

Gold has been a stellar trade this year, surging to a record high above $4,060 per ounce. The precious metal retreated slightly from that level on Thursday, but is still on pace for its best annual return in more than four decades. 

“Absolutely, you should own gold,” said Karger. “It's just a great store of value. Gold has had a 2,000-year history of calling bunk on currencies.”

For those holding physical bullion, he recommended coins over bars, which can be harder to resell, though either form should be stored securely.

Gold futures have risen in nine of the past 10 sessions, setting new all-time highs for 10 straight trading days, an extraordinary run that's driven year-to-date gains of around 55%.

 Ethereum devs have introduced Kohaku to enhance wallet privacy and security with modular tools, zero-knowledge recovery options and decentralized transaction handling. 

Ethereum developers unveiled Kohaku, a roadmap that aims to improve wallet privacy and security through a modular framework designed for developers and advanced users. 

The project, announced in a Thursday blog post by Ethereum Foundation coordinator Nicolas Consigny, outlines plans to build a set of privacy and security primitives for the Ethereum ecosystem.

At its core, Kohaku aims to create a software development kit (SDK) for building secure wallet functions, and a reference wallet that demonstrates how these tools work in practice. The first version will come as a browser extension based on the Ambire wallet, designed for advanced users who want more control and privacy.

Kohaku is being developed in collaboration with well-known Ethereum ecosystem teams, including Ambire, Railgun, DeFi Wonderland, Helios and Oblivious Labs. The project is open source, and developers are encouraged to contribute through its GitHub repositories.

Kohaku's primary goal is to reduce the reliance of wallets on centralized services that can track transactions. The project will include features like private sending and receiving, hiding IP addresses, separate accounts for each DApp and P2P transaction broadcasting that bypasses normal remote procedure call (RPC) servers. 

It also plans to add social recovery options using tools such as ZK Email or Anon Aadhaar, making it easier to restore access without giving up privacy. ZK Email uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable anonymous verification of emails, while Anon Aadhaar allows users to prove their identity in a privacy-preserving way.

In the long run, the team aims to bring wallet security even closer to the device level, which they refer to as “as close as possible to the silicon.” This means creating a native Ethereum browser where users can safely interact with DApps, IPFS content and decentralized networks without data leaks.

On Wednesday, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new initiative called the Privacy Cluster, bringing together 47 leading researchers, engineers and cryptographers to develop privacy features at the protocol level of the Ethereum network. 

The group will work alongside the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team to introduce tools such as private payments, confidential identity systems, and zero-knowledge infrastructure designed to protect user data directly on Ethereum's layer-1 blockchain.

The Privacy Cluster includes multiple Ethereum Foundation and PSE initiatives, with Kohaku being one. Other notable projects are Private Reads & Writes, Private Proving, Private Identities and more.

Dogecoin failed to sustain above $0.26, triggering heavy institutional profit-taking that dragged price back toward $0.25. Despite the short-term retreat, on-chain flows show large holders adding 30M tokens (approximately $8M), suggesting accumulation remains intact even as resistance caps upside momentum.

DOGE traded a 6% range between $0.24 and $0.26 in the 24 hours to Oct. 9. The token rallied into $0.26 during the afternoon session but met strong institutional selling pressure. Whale addresses added more than 30M DOGE, reinforcing longer-term positioning despite near-term weakness. Analysts highlighted parallels to prior historical cycles where key resistance breaks have unlocked exponential upside, with $0.41 flagged as a critical longer-term trigger.

Resistance is reinforced at $0.26 after repeated rejections on elevated volume. Support at $0.25 failed late in the session under liquidation flows, raising near-term downside risk. Still, accumulation patterns — with 30M DOGE added by large wallets — point to institutional confidence in the broader structure. A sustained reclaim of $0.26 would open the path toward $0.27–$0.30, while $0.24 is now the near-term floor to watch.

RFK, Jr., Says Tylenol Use for Circumcision Causes Autism. Here's Why That Claim Is Flawed

Studies suggesting circumcision rates are linked with autism are “riddled with flaws”

By Allison Parshall

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Today, in a cabinet meeting, U.S. secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., claimed that there is a link between autism and circumcision. “There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It's highly likely because they are given Tylenol,” he stated, without citing the studies.

Kennedy was probably referring to a 2013 study of eight countries and a 2015 study from Denmark, both of which claimed to show a link between circumcision and autism rates. Helen Tager-Flusberg, an autism researcher and a professor emerita at Boston University, calls the methods used in those studies “appalling.” Tager-Flusberg leads the Coalition of Autism Scientists, a group that advocates for high-quality autism research.

Neither study shows a causal link between circumcision—or the pain relief medications that are often prescribed along with the procedure—and higher rates of autism. In the decade-plus since each was published, autism researchers have heavily criticized these studies. And after reviewing both studies, scientists last year found no evidence supporting the claim that circumcision leads to autism or any other adverse psychological effects.

There is also very little evidence that giving acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) to babies or children increases their risk of being diagnosed with autism. There is also very little evidence, as the secretary of health and human services recently suggested, that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy increases a baby's risk of developing autism.

For the 2013 study, researchers compared rates of circumcision in eight countries, including the U.S., with rates of autism. They found that countries with higher rates of autism tended to have higher rates of circumcision. “They are looking at an association involving a sample size of eight countries,” an extremely small number for establishing such a link, “and they don't take into consideration any other factors about those countries,” Tager-Flusberg says. Factors such as the average age of becoming parents in each country, as well as genetics are known to affect autism rates. Awareness of autism and diagnostic practices also vary between countries. All of these factors could explain the correlation, but they weren't controlled for in the analysis. “I'm ashamed that there are colleagues in my field who would actually go out and conduct a study that is so flimsy and that it was actually published,” Tager-Flusberg says.

Experts say that circumcision rates are not a reliable stand-in for acetaminophen use in babies anyway. The researchers of the 2013 study explained they chose to look at circumcision because acetaminophen is often prescribed following the procedure. The medication is commonly taken for numerous childhood ailments, and it may not always be prescribed for circumcision. This means that relying on circumcision to estimate acetaminophen use in newborns is flawed, Tager-Flusberg says.

Scientists who conducted the 2015 study examined rates of autism among 3,347 predominantly Jewish and Muslim boys who were ritually circumcised in the hospital or in doctor's clinics. That study showed a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with autism among that group than among those who hadn't been circumcised. “That study is riddled with flaws, which others have written about,” said psychologist David S. Mandell in a statement sent to Scientific American on behalf of the Coalition of Autism Scientists. It had a small sample size, limiting the power of its conclusions, and did not account for many Muslim circumcisions that are not done by doctors, which likely skewed the results. The association between circumcision and autism was only significant for those aged 0 to 4 years old, not those aged 5 to 9 years old, which suggests there may be an alternative explanation for the results.

These kinds of observational studies are inherently limited—even if they show a link between two variables, they cannot explain what causes it. Relying on weak evidence like this to make claims about the causes of autism is “terribly alarming,” Tager-Flusberg continues, and is ultimately confusing and distressing to families.

Sora's rapid adoption drove a number of App Store scammers to try to get in on the act. Following the launch of OpenAI's invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apple's App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be “Sora” or “Sora 2” — the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app.

These apps somehow made it past Apple's App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that's trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app's debut. 

According to research provided to TechCrunch upon our request by app intelligence platform Appfigures, there were over a dozen “Sora”-branded apps that went live on the App Store after the official app's launch. Over half of them used “Sora 2” in their names specifically. (One of those was spotted by Apple blogger and pundit, John Gruber, who called it the “App Store scam of the week.”)

Many of the apps were not newcomers, either. Some had been live on the App Store — sometimes using other names — since earlier in the year or even last year. The impostors, which include those live on Google Play as well, had seen around 300,000 collective installs to date, with north of 80,000 installs coming in after Sora's official app launch. (OpenAI has since announced that Sora's official mobile app has been downloaded 1 million times, for comparison.)

Nearly all of the impostors had been updated just after OpenAI's Sora app launch to capitalize on consumer demand and searches, often by changing their name. 

It's unclear how these apps were able to slip past Apple's reviewers; Apple did end up pulling many of them from its App Store, Appfigures said.

Of the imposter apps, the largest one was named “Sora 2 – AI Video Generator” — an obvious attempt to game App Store searches for the keyword “sora.” It saw more than 50,000 installs after the launch of the official app.

As of the time of writing, a few Sora-branded apps are still live, despite the potential for consumer confusion. One, “PetReels — Sora for Pets,” has seen only a few hundred installs, however. Another one, “Viral AI Photo Maker: Vi-sora” is trying to squeeze the word Sora in there but hasn't gained traction, either.

Doing slightly better is the app using the branding “Sora 2” in its name (Sora 2 – Video Generator Ai). It's pulled in north of 6,000 downloads and counting.

Collectively, the apps earned more than $160,000 — decent money considering their short lives.

Apple was asked for comment on how Sora-branded apps were able to go live and if these remaining Sora-branded apps would be removed. It did not respond prior to publication.

I studied Greek and Hebrew in college, Latin in high school. In each the very first night's homework was to memorize the characters and their pronunciation.Multiple ANE cultures used cuneiform (Ugaritic, Akkadian, Sumerian, Hittite, and so on). The time to master each depends on your native language, the target language, and exposure to similar languages. The writing system is not the hard part.

All of the examples you mentioned are derivatives of the Phoenician alphabet, which have around 20 to 30 characters each. Even with case sensitiveness and diacritics, I think they still add up to under a hundred characters.Cuneiform character sets are in the order of magnitude of the several hundreds or even thousands, depending on the language[1], so I imagine that the experience is closer to learning to read Chinese or Japanese and less like Hebrew and Greek.That being said, I've never tried to learn neither cuneiform or hanzi, so I'm just guessing based on the number of characters.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#Sign_inventories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_BatteryThe Baghdad Battery is the name given to an artifact consisting of a ceramic pot, a tube of copper, and a rod of iron fixed together with bitumen. It was discovered in present-day Khujut Rabu, Iraq in 1936,[1][2] close to the ancient city of Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian (150 BC – 223 AD) and Sasanian (224–650 AD) empires, and it is believed to date from either of these periods.[3]Its origin and purpose remain unclear. Wilhelm König, at the time director of the laboratory of the National Museum of Iraq, suggested that the object functioned as a galvanic cell, possibly used for electroplating, or some kind of electrotherapy. There is no electroplated object known from this period, and the claims are universally rejected by archaeologists. An alternative explanation is that it functioned as a container for magic spells for protection, defense or curses.[2]Ten similar clay vessels had been found earlier. Four were found in 1930 in Seleucia dating to the Sassanid period. Three were sealed with bitumen and contained a bronze cylinder, again sealed, with a pressed-in papyrus wrapper containing decomposed fiber rolls. They had been held in place with up to four bronze and iron rods sunk into the ground, and their cult meaning and use are inferred. Six other clay vessels were found nearby in Ctesiphon. Some had bronze wrappers with badly decomposed cellulose fibers. Others had iron nails or lead plates.[2]

    How to Write in Cuneiform, the Oldest Known Writing System in the World

Of course, if you're a fallibilist you believe that it's always possible that you're making a mistake. It seems unnecessary to always add “unless I am mistaken,” because that hedge always applies.

Writing has only been invented independently a few times in history, so it seems reasonable that cuneiform could be the first.

Why do we not see more writing in the archeological record? Maybe agrarian societies both motivate writing and are required to provide the free time to invent it? Or perhaps it was written on media that's subject to decay? If some society developed writing on tree bark 100,000 years ago, none of that is going to survive and we'd never know.

Just don't call it Celestial

As part of its recent Tech Tour US event, Intel took the wraps off its trio of upcoming Panther Lake SoCs. It also walked us through the improvements and expected performance of its new Xe3 graphics architecture, which is coming to market in the form of two integrated GPU tiles for Panther Lake. For more details on the three primary configurations of Panther Lake SoCs, as well as a more general overview of Panther Lake's CPU resources, check out our dedicated article. 

First things first: Intel emphasized that Xe3 is not based on the Celestial architecture, even though its name conveniently maps to that codename's place in Intel's past roadmaps. Let us repeat: this is not Celestial. Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products. Therefore, it will include Panther Lake iGPUs under the Arc B-series umbrella. The company admits this naming scheme isn't ideal, but it appears to be the least worst option for the time being.

Indeed, once you start digging into the changes Intel highlights for Xe3, you'll see that it's more of a continuous improvement of the existing Battlemage architectural lineage than an all-new design. The next ""clean"" generational leap will come with Xe3P Arc GPUs, but it's unclear when those parts will arrive. Intel was understandably mum about Xe3P products during the Panther Lake event.

The basic Xe3 Xe Core (henceforth Xe3 Core) keeps the same basic layout of Xe2: eight Xe Vector Engines for floating-point and integer math, eight XMX engines for acceleration of matrix math for AI applications, and one ray-tracing unit. Intel says the changes within Xe3 are meant to improve two pain points: better utilization of available resources, an ongoing project for Arc GPUs, and making the architecture more scalable, which is important for building larger and higher-performance products.

The prior Xe2 render slice included up to four Xe Cores, from which graphics processors as small as Lunar Lake's iGPU (two render slices) and as large as the Arc B580 (five render slices) were all constructed.

 




The Xe3 render slice, on the other hand, starts with six Xe Cores, and it's been used to make two iGPUs so far.

 




The headliner is the two-render-slice, 12 Xe3 Core part that will power gaming, content creation, and AI workloads in the highest-performance variant of the Panther Lake SoC.

The other is a four-Xe3-Core part that provides graphics functionality on lower-end Panther Lake products.

Observant readers may be wondering why, given that an Xe3 render slice starts with six Xe Cores, the smaller Xe3 GPU on Panther Lake only includes four Xe Cores. Intel has always maintained a level of fine-grained control over the size of its graphics engines (stretching well into the pre-Arc days) to meet various product demands, so even if Xe3 starts with six Xe Cores per render slice, it's no surprise that it can be scaled down.

Intel says each Xe3 Xe Core can keep up to 25% more threads in flight - from eight to 10 - versus its predecessor, and the core can variably allocate partitions of each Xe Vector Engine's register file per thread in order to achieve better utilization.

Variable register allocation is truly new to Xe3. Previous Arc GPUs used a coarser per-thread register allocation strategy that posed challenges for fully utilizing the core's available resources. Intel says this is a key improvement in the Xe3 architecture and says that it has ""dramatic effects on performance.""

One of Xe3's other big structural changes — at least for an Arc iGPU — is an increase in shared local memory per Xe core. Xe3 now includes 256KB of shared local memory, up from 192KB in Xe2 on Lunar Lake and the improved Xe-LPG architecture on Meteor Lake. Intel says that workloads spilling out of this shared local memory is a major reason for performance pitfalls on older Arc iGPUs, so adding more of it is a sensible and relatively simple architectural refinement with a major performance payoff.

It's worth noting that this change simply brings Xe3 iGPUs in line with the basic resources offered by desktop Xe2 products. The Arc B580 and B5700 already had 256KB of local memory per Xe Core, so don't expect performance miracles from this increase. The fact that Intel is adding more local memory here probably shows that the size of this structure on Battlemage discrete GPUs was the right decision and one worthy of carrying through the Arc B-series graphics stack.

More big changes occur further out in the cache hierarchy. In its largest 12-Xe-Core configuration, Panther Lake's Arc GPU now sports 16MB of shared L2 cache, double that of Lunar Lake's eight-Xe-Core graphics engine. This is an absolutely massive L2 for a GPU of this size; the Arc B580, by comparison, only sports 18MB (or 12.5% more) L2 for a chip with 67% more Xe Cores to feed.

 




Intel says a larger L2 cache reduces traffic on Panther Lake's on-package fabric that connects the graphics processor to main memory - an important consideration for an integrated graphics processor that might be contending with a CPU and NPU for access to RAM. Intel showed a chart claiming anywhere from a 17% to 36% reduction in fabric traffic compared to a product with an 8MB L2 as a baseline.

 




Xe3 also features a number of smaller, but still important, refinements. Xe2's ray tracing engine allows for asynchronous evaluation of ray-triangle intersection, but the results of those tests have to be resolved in order. That responsibility falls to a thread sorting unit that could previously cause backups in the ray-tracing pipeline. Intel says the improved ray tracing engine in Xe3 can dynamically slow down dispatch of new rays while the sorting unit catches up to work in flight.

Intel also increased the performance of a cache called the Unified Return Buffer, or URB, which is a means of passing data between functional units on the GPU. The company equipped the Xe3 URB with a new management agent that can make partial updates to this buffer without requiring a full flush for each context switch, lowering the cost of cross-functional-unit communication.

Xe3 also includes improvements to fixed-function hardware in order to improve performance in some common graphics tasks. The company says to expect up to 2x the anisotropic filtering rate, and up to a 2x improvement in stencil test rate.

 




In a range of proprietary microarchitectural benchmarks versus the Xe2 GPU on Lunar Lake, you can see that the performance of the 12 Xe3 Core GPU in some operations hasn't changed between Xe2 and Xe3, simply because the available resources per render slice haven't grown. Intel demonstrates that some other operations have scaled linearly with the 50% increase in Xe Cores from Lunar Lake to Panther Lake's 12 Xe configuration.

Operations like ray-triangle intersection tests, anisotropic filtering, mesh rendering, and scattered reads from memory, start to demonstrate microarchitectural as well as scaling improvements in Xe3; they all enjoy 2x or better speedups relative to Xe2.

For shaders that place a large amount of pressure on registers, Xe3's dynamic register allocation can deliver anywhere from 1.9x to 3.1x faster performance in Intel's internal microbenchmarks. Depth testing operations—an incredibly important and fundamental part of the modern render pipeline—enjoy anywhere from a 1.9x to an incredible 7.4x speedup.

Intel isn't talking about detailed specs like clock speeds for Xe3 GPUs just yet, but the company did provide a set of ballpark power-versus-performance plots that are typical of early looks at silicon.

 




The first claim shows that the 12 Xe Core GPU has a much broader range of scaling than Lunar Lake. If given a large amount of extra power over Lunar Lake, the 12 Xe Core Arc GPU can offer 50% or greater performance in exchange. If we eyeball the same power level as Lunar Lake in this chart, performance gains are much more modest, but still present.

When discussing performance-per-watt improvements, Intel instead points to the Arrow Lake-H iGPU, against which the company claims a greater than 40% improvement in efficiency for the same performance. We would certainly hope that Panther Lake provides a performance-per-watt improvement in this match-up, as the Arrow Lake-H iGPU is based on the aging Xe-LPG architecture that first made its debut in the almost two-year-old Meteor Lake and has its roots in the three-year-old Alchemist architecture.

If you directly compare Panther Lake to Lunar Lake for efficiency, Xe3 still delivers a performance-per-watt improvement, but it's smaller (probably under 20%, if we had to eyeball it). Gripes about relevant comparisons aside, what we should take away here is that the Lunar Lake iGPU (at least in its 12 Xe Core form) delivers both performance per watt improvements and a broader range of performance scaling possibilities compared to the company's past integrated GPU efforts.

What is impressive, however, is that these improvements have all come by way of architectural refinements. Intel says it hasn't changed the process technology it's using to fabricate the GPU tile (presumably relative to Arrow Lake), so these boosts to both power and performance come exclusively from the architectural improvements discussed above.

 




Another way Intel talks about performance with Xe3 is by walking through the time it takes for a hypothetical frame to be rendered on both Lunar Lake and Panther Lake. As any graphics performance enthusiast knows, a lower frame time on average means higher frame rates. One frame isn't terribly useful as a benchmark, but Intel's trip inside the frame time journey shows several key improvements related to the microarchitectural refinements in Xe3. Overall, this same frame renders in 22.84 ms on the 12 Xe3-Core GPU, or 50% less time.

Of course, GPUs these days aren't just a chip - they're part of an entire hardware-software stack. Intel is continuing to invest in its XeSS suite of technologies to keep pace with Nvidia and AMD. On top of upscaling and 2x framegen support in XeSS 2, an upcoming XeSS release will add AI-accelerated multi-frame generation to Intel's arsenal.

Like Nvidia's DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, XeSS MFG will offer 2x, 3x, and 4x modes (one, two, or three generated frames). It also won't require game developers to update their XeSS 2 titles to explicitly support the feature.

 




Any of the (small) list of titles that already support Xe Frame Generation will work with XeSS MFG through an override in the Intel Graphics Software control panel.

We had an opportunity to go hands-on with XeSS Multi Frame Generation on a Panther Lake engineering system at the Tech Tour event. Based on my limited time with the demo system, the image quality of XeMFG is impressive. I didn't see any distracting artifacts that would have given the framegen-boosted frame rate away.

However, input lag was just a bit too far over the line of tolerability for a great experience in a fast-paced shooter like the upcoming Painkiller, although I'm sure I could have tuned upscaling and quality settings to arrive at a more responsive experience.

I was somewhat frustrated by Intel's use of baseline frame rates as a proxy for acceptable input lag with XeMFG. We've already performed some high-level testing that demonstrates how the two measurements are not necessarily correlated, and Intel's representatives threw around what seemed to me to be unreasonably low baseline frame rates for a good framegen experience.

We'll need to see how PresentMon interacts with XeMFG going forward in order to see whether it can be used reliably to gauge a game's input lag and its suitability for use with XeMFG on a given Arc graphics platform.

 




To improve game load times and in-game smoothness, Intel also plans to begin distributing pre-compiled shaders from the cloud for compatible installed games on a user's system using the Intel Graphics Software utility.

Anybody who's loaded a modern AAA title knows the pain of long load times and in-game stutter as shaders compile for the first time, and Intel seems to think it's a worthy investment to allocate cloud resources to make this problem go away entirely. This isn't a game-changer, but it is a straightforward and handy perk for users of Arc graphics products.

Overall, our first experiences with Xe3 and the larger 12-Xe3-core GPU on Panther Lake are promising. At least for now, Intel remains committed to Arc graphics despite its recent earth-shaking deal with Nvidia, and we can't wait to test Xe3 in greater depth once shipping Panther Lake systems arrive late this year or early next.

Even though electronic cigarettes do not contain any illicit substances, the liquid can cause serious health problems. Often, the nicotine concentration in these products is several times higher than in conventional cigarettes, promoting rapid addiction. Furthermore, in countries like Brazil, which have banned electronic cigarettes, it Is observed that the products offered to users do not undergo any quality control. A resolution by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, distribution, storage, transportation, and advertising of electronic smoking devices. 

Some of these liquids contain up to 100 times more nicotine than a regular cigarette, whose legal maximum limit is 1 milligram of nicotine per cigarette. In addition, additives such as vitamin E acetate have been found in the liquids, which have caused deaths and permanent lung damage in users in the United States.""

Luciano Arantes, researcher and member of the management committee of the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology on Psychoactive Substances (INCT-SP)

The scenario becomes even more concerning when considering the clandestine use of synthetic cannabinoids in these devices. These substances are created in laboratories to mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component found in Cannabis sativa, or marijuana. However, synthetic cannabinoids are much more potent and can trigger neurological effects such as seizures, psychotic episodes, and even death from overdose.

""What we're seeing is a chemical race. Clandestine groups are producing drugs with increasingly potent structures, requiring minimal doses to achieve the desired effect. As there's no labeling or warning, users consume without knowing what they're ingesting,"" Arantes warns.

To address the problem, Brazilian researchers, in partnership with international colleagues, have developed a portable sensor that can accurately detect synthetic cannabinoids in e-cigarette liquids and biological fluids, such as saliva. The device is described in an article published in the journal Talanta.

""We developed an electrochemical method that identifies different synthetic cannabinoid molecules with high selectivity and sensitivity. The analysis can be done anywhere, with a small sample, and the sensor responds with a characteristic electrochemical signal,"" describes Larissa Magalhães de Almeida Melo, the first author of the study, alongside student Cecília Barroso.

The device uses a boron-doped diamond electrode manufactured in collaboration with a group from the University of Technology in Bratislava, Slovakia. ""It's a simple system: the electrode is connected to a portable potentiostat, which can be connected to a cell phone via its USB-C port or even via a wireless Bluetooth connection. The response is a current-voltage graph, with specific peaks that identify and quantify the substances present,"" Melo explains.

""This sensor represents a major innovation in the field of portable devices, as it combines the portability of printed sensors with the high stability of boron-doped diamond materials, which can be reused countless times,"" emphasizes Wallans Torres Pio dos Santos, a professor at the Federal University of Vale do Jequitinhonha and Mucuri, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and coordinator of the study.

The sensor was tested with two of the most common and dangerous synthetic cannabinoids, AB-Chminaca and MDMB-4en-Pinaca. It demonstrated the ability to detect concentrations as low as 0.2 µM, even in the presence of high levels of nicotine and other interferences. In chemistry, µM (micromolar) is a unit of measurement for the concentration of a substance in solution. One µM is equal to one millionth of a mole per liter.

""The great advantage of our device is its selectivity. Even with the complexity of the samples, we were able to focus only on the substances of interest. It's like entering a dark room and illuminating only the spot we want to observe,"" Santos compares.

In addition to its use as a screening tool by forensic police, the device can be used in public health to provide emergency care to individuals experiencing overdoses or other complications, as well as for preventive harm reduction initiatives. To this end, the research group partners with the ""BACO Project: Toxicology and Toxicological Analysis as Sources of Information for Drug Policy"". ""The goal of this project is to evaluate the use of new psychoactive substances at parties and festivals by analyzing oral fluid samples. Our partnership with BACO researchers aims to extend the initial objective of the project to allow not only saliva analysis, but also the immediate screening of substances that partygoers intend to consume,"" Arantes explains.

""These synthetic cannabinoids are constantly changing. New variants are emerging all the time, and many of them are extremely potent and dangerous. Our goal is to develop technologies that can be put into practice. We want users to know what they're consuming and be able to make informed decisions. This can prevent serious poisoning and even save lives,"" Melo points out.

""Our surveys show that 63% of users don't know what they're consuming. Many think they're using a known drug, but in fact, they may be using a much more potent substance. By identifying the substance on the spot, the sensor gives users the chance to make an informed decision about its use. This alone reduces risks and saves lives,"" Santos points out.

The adaptability of the method is another strength highlighted by the researchers. ""We've already developed sensors for other classes of substances, such as LSD and its synthetic analogues, cathinones, and phenylethylamines. We're also working on incorporating colorimetric reagents into the sensors to facilitate visual interpretation of the results,"" Arantes explains.

FAPESP supports the project through research grants awarded to José Luiz da Costa of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, who is a toxicology expert and partner in the group. Part of the analysis was done in collaboration with his laboratory, using real saliva samples collected in environments where the products are used.

""The saliva samples used in the study were collected as part of the BACO Project, developed at UNICAMP in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security [MJSP]. This project, in turn, is an offshoot of the research 'The Toxicology of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS): Epidemiology of Consumption through the Analysis of Hair and Oral Fluid Samples', also supported by FAPESP, in which we conducted the first epidemiological survey in Brazil on NPS at parties and festivals. Based on the results of this research, the MJSP decided to support and expand the study, allowing for a much larger number of samples to be collected, from 500 samples in the initial project to 2,500 in the current one. This allowed us to form new partnerships, including this one with Professor Wallans' group,"" says Costa.

""The goal is to take science where it can have a direct impact. Experts, doctors, and health professionals need accessible, fast, and reliable tools to face the challenges posed by new drugs. What we propose is a practical, portable, and scalable solution,"" Arantes summarizes.

The Portland Hearts of Pine are engaged in early stage discussions about adding a women's soccer team, something the franchise's founder has long stated as a goal.

“We have belief and interest in the women's game and would want to be there to support it and we think it would be successful here,” said Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, the Hearts of Pine founder and chief community officer.

The first-year men's team is a professional club in USL League One. The women's team is targeted to be in the pre-professional USL W League, with 2027 the earliest it would likely see the field.

Hearts President Kevin Schohl added, “it's always been part of our vision, part of Gabe's vision, to add a women's team. We've begun initial exploration of that, including initial discussion with the city of Portland.”

Earlier this week, Vermont Green, a well-established pre-professional men's team in Burlington, Vermont, announced plans to field a women's USL W team in 2026.

“If we were to launch in 2027, what would be our third men's season, that would be a pretty fast follow,” Schohl said. “Certainly we would want to make sure some (organizational) positions are solely focused on making sure the women's team is successful. A head coach would be one, obviously. There would be other roles, too, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.”

The club, which built community support for the men's team over several years, must first work with the city to be sure Fitzpatrick Stadium, and/or Memorial Field at Deering High, can accommodate six to eight women's home games and the team's practice schedule. The Hearts of Pine's 10-year, rent-free lease of Fitzpatrick Stadium allows the club to reserve 25 game dates, which includes three dates for playoff games. This year the team had 18 home matches. Next year, with USL League One scheduled to expand from 14 to 21 teams, the club is anticipating 20 home matches.

The USL W season runs from mid-May to late-June, followed by the postseason.

Ethan Hipple, director of Portland's Parks, Recreation and Facilities department, believes the city can find space for a women's team.

“If we're really talking 10 dates, it could be a much simpler operation, similar to how we book dates for (other organizations),” Hipple said. 

Hipple noted that a lease agreement was needed for the Hearts of Pine men's team because of the “quantity of dates and they were also making physical improvements to the stadium.”

The franchise invested over $2.5 million in field and facility renovations, including putting in a new artificial surface, improving the lighting, upgrading the press box, and installing home and visiting team locker rooms on site. 

The Hearts of Pine men's team is winding down its inaugural season in USL League One, a third-tier pro league. The club is currently sixth in the USL1 standings and on the verge of clinching a playoff berth.

The Hearts have been even better off the field. Portland has sold out every game at Fitzpatrick Stadium, currently averaging 5,737 fans, well above the league record (4,786, Richmond Kickers in 2023). It has added investors to the ownership group, sells merchandise around the world, and has been featured as a model of growing soccer in national and regional publications.

Those are major reasons why the USL wants Portland in its women's ranks, said Joel Nash, the organization's senior vice president for youth and pre-professional opportunities.

“When a club has become a beacon for a passionate community that represents an entire state, you can't help but have excitement,” Nash said in an email to the Press Herald. “The opportunity for a W League team to inspire and educate young women to pursue their dreams and turn them into reality is completely in line with how the club has grown in a short time.”

In 2025, the USL W had 93 teams across 15 regional divisions that played 10- or 12-game regular-season schedules. Several teams are affiliated with either USL Championship, USL1, or USL2  men's teams. Many others are the top competitive team for a regional soccer club.

Rosters consist of mostly college-age players who are not paid.

Vermont Green joining USL W is pending the creation of a new Northeast Division. The Vermont Green men's team won the 2025 USL2 (pre-professional) national championship. It routinely sells out its games at 2,500-seat Virtue Field on the University of Vermont campus.

The past two years, Vermont Green has held three women's exhibition matches with the expressed purpose of preparing to join a pre-professional league. With former U.S. Women's National Team standout Sam Mewis as the coach, each of the women's games has sold out quickly, said Meg Linehan, who covers women's sports and especially women's soccer for The Athletic. A Vermont resident and Vermont Green season-ticket holder, Linehan said 10 years ago people would have laughed at the notion that “Burlington and Portland would be two of the hottest soccer markets” in the United States.

“But both Vermont Green and Hearts of Pine are becoming part of the community fabric,” Linehan said. “Adding a women's team extends that larger mission and provides extra opportunities to engage with the club.”

Linehan said some USL W teams have consistently drawn large crowds, pointing to the Minnesota Aurora. “They have a 5,600-seat capacity and they regularly sell out,” Linehan said.

Portland already has one pre-professional women's soccer team. The Maine Footy completed their third season this past summer, playing home games at Memorial Field. Maine Footy played a six-game schedule this past summer in the United Women's Soccer League — which is a different league than USL W.

How a Hearts of Pine women's team would impact Maine Footy is unclear and another step in the development process. Hoffman-Johnson said the Hearts “have a good relationship with Footy.” 

Hipple said it would not be an issue from the city's perspective to have separate pre-professional women's soccer teams. Hipple said city fields are frequently rented to different organizations that offer similar opportunities.

As October unfolds, autumn is setting in across much of North America – although the US men's national team discovered that it's not quite cozy season in sunny Austin just yet.

The USMNT encountered toasty temperatures well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit as they set up camp in the Texas capital this week ahead of Friday's friendly vs. Ecuador at Austin FC's Q2 Stadium (8:30 pm ET).

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino wants his players to feel that the heat is still on in more ways than one.

“I promise you: No one is sure that he's going to be on the roster in the World Cup 2026,” the Argentine told reporters in his matchday-1 press conference on Thursday afternoon.

“I don't believe before that it was the same way. And today, I promise, all the guys feel that they need to fight to be there. That is priceless.”

Even with only a scant few full international windows remaining between now and next summer's big event on home soil, a small and shrinking period in which to hone his squad, ‘Poch' remains focused on stoking competition and battling the complacency he says he encountered upon his arrival a year ago.

The overarching message, again and again: Get out of your comfort zone, and stay there. To drive home the point, Pochettino pointed to one of the players he didn't call into the group in central Texas: Sebastian Berhalter and the impressive brace he bagged in the Vancouver Whitecaps' 4-1 trouncing of San Jose last weekend.

“I think too many things that we still need to see. And it's open; it will be open for everyone. They need to perform,” said Pochettino. “That is how you force the players that are here – seeing that type of behavior, attitude and performance – to improve.”

Towards that end, Pochettino and the Yanks expect a “difficult” test from Ecuador, who surprised many observers by finishing second in Conmebol's World Cup qualifying table, behind only Lionel Messi-led Argentina.

Pacey, creative and aggressive, La Tri are well equipped to exploit even the most fleeting of errors, especially with injury concerns around a couple of key US figures: Pochettino said Christian Pulisic, Alex Zendejas and Antonee “Jedi” Robinson did not train in full on Thursday and thus are availability doubts for this match.

“Players are very good in depth, who interpret very well the open spaces,” said Pochettino in Spanish of the South Americans. “You cannot give them the channels; if you give them that opportunity, they have players who are aggressive, who'll hit you quickly in attack, and can quickly recover the ball at the moment that they lose it.

“It's important to play these kinds of opponents.”

After an unsightly loss to South Korea in the first of last month's two friendlies, the Yanks utilized a new-look 3-4-2-1 shape to rebound with a solid win over Japan. Naturally, there's curiosity about whether that system will remain in place for Friday, as well as Tuesday's meeting with Australia at the Colorado Rapids' Dick's Sporting Goods Park.

“I think the mentality is focused,” Seattle Sounders FC midfielder Cristian Roldan, one of the September window's big winners, said on Monday, explaining how the 3-4-2-1 allowed the USMNT to adopt a more assertive posture with their pressing.

“We had a good game against Japan, and how can we build off that, right? How can we establish the formations, the tactics, the ideas that coach Pochettino wants to bring to the team, and then show it on Friday against a tough Ecuador side? Focus, high intensity, aggressive: I think those are the style, the characteristics we want to have on the field come Friday.”

Back in the mix after two years away from the national team, Roldan faces stiff competition for central-midfield minutes this month, with European-based MLS academy alums like Weston McKennie, Aidan Morris and Tanner Tessmann returning to the fold on the strength of quality performances for their clubs.

That, though, is just the storyline for everyone around the USMNT for the foreseeable future.

“It's obviously a very competitive national team,” said Tessmann, an FC Dallas product currently on an excellent run of form at French side Olympique Lyon.

“We want to be the best national team and fight to win the World Cup, and with that comes a lot of competition in the team. So each time you're in camp, you have to make the most of it and try to fight your way into the next one.”

The United States rolled to a 3-0 victory over Italy at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup on Thursday, booking a quarterfinal spot with their Round of 16 triumph in Rancagua, Chile.

Inter Miami CF midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi, who's on loan at Italian Serie A side Parma, scored twice to take the Golden Boot lead. San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Niko Tsakiris also scored his second goal of the tournament, while Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Adam Beaudry posted a shutout.

Cremaschi found a 15th-minute opener, stabbing a close-range finish past Italian goalkeeper Jacopo Seghetti after FC Dallas left back Nolan Norris' header was saved off the line. He then added an exclamation point in the 93rd minute, chipping over Seghetti following a powerful run out of midfield.

Tsakiris ensured the US win with just over 10 minutes remaining, curling a low free-kick around the wall and inside the near post.

The Italians battled back throughout the middle stages of the match, including hitting the woodwork once, but couldn't find a way past the US backline that included Norris and Philadelphia Union defender Frankie Westfield.

Less than a year after the rapper filed his stunning lawsuit, a federal judge says nobody thought Kendrick was really calling him a pedophile.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	A federal judge on Thursday (Oct. 9) dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” ruling that a “war of words” during a “heated rap battle” did not violate the law and that some of the case was “logically incoherent.”


	Drake's case, filed earlier this year, claimed that UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track, which tarred his arch-rival as a “certified pedophile.” He believed that millions of people took that lyric literally, severely harming his reputation.


	But just 10 months later, Judge Jeannette Vargas granted UMG's motion to dismiss the case at the outset — ruling that Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of “hyperbole” that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact.


	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” the judge wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	The ruling marks an abrupt end to a legal battle that stunned the music industry. Few expected a rapper to respond to a diss track with a lawsuit — a move that drew ridicule in the hip-hop world and condemnation from legal scholars. Fewer still expected him to file it against UMG, his longtime record label and the biggest music company in the world.


	In a statement sent to Billboard, Drake's attorneys say they “intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it.”


	In a statement to Billboard, a spokesman for UMG said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleged that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG argued those allegations were clearly meritless — that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	The dispute got even nastier in February, when Lamar made “Not Like Us” the centerpiece of his Super Bowl halftime show. After speculation about whether he'd play the track at all, Lamar used the show to mock his rival, looking directly into the camera as he rapped, “Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young.”


	In her decision on Thursday, Judge Vargas sided entirely with UMG, ruling normal listeners would not expect “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.”


	She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting from a line in “Family Matters” in which the star was “heavily implying that Lamar is a domestic abuser” and another in which Drake says he heard that “one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his.”


	“The recording was published as part of a heated public feud, in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,” Judge Vargas wrote. “This is precisely the type of context in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole rather than factual assertions.”


	The judge also rejected Drake's arguments about the popularity of “Not Like Us,” saying she could not make that kind of “retroactive analysis” of artistic expression. She wrote that when Lamar wrote his song, he “could not have been aware” that it would later break streaming records, win Grammys, or be the centerpiece of a Super Bowl halftime show.


	“Yet plaintiff would have the court divorce the recording from the context in which it was created because of these subsequent events,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Whether publications constitute actionable fact or protected opinion cannot vary based upon the popularity they achieve. Constitutional guarantees do not rest on such a flimsy foundation.”


	The judge was equally unimpressed with Drake's claim that the song became defamatory because UMG repeatedly republished it and drove its success: “This argument is logically incoherent,” the judge wrote. “If the recording was nonactionable opinion at the time it was initially produced, then its republication would not expose UMG to liability.”

Turning Point USA, the group co-founded by Charlie Kirk, said that it is planning its own Super Bowl halftime show to counter Bad Bunny, whose booking as the featured entertainment has generated opposition on the right.


	“It's true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon,” the group, now led by Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, announced on X.

	Bad Bunny has been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the raid on homes and businesses being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That triggered a number of commentators on the right over the choice. Tomi Lahren said that he was “not an American artist,” but Bad Bunny is a native of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.

	











	After Bad Bunny was announced last month as the performer, Corey Lewandowski, the chief adviser to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said that ICE agents would be present for the NFL title game, which is set for February 8 on NBC.

	“We're going to do enforcement everywhere,” Lewandowski said. “We are going to make Americans safe. That is a directive from the president. If you're in this country illegally, do yourself a favor: Go home.”

	











	Turning Point has not announced a venue or other details, such as whether any media outlet will carry the performance.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) expressed his opposition to Bad Bunny earlier this week, calling it a “terrible decision.” “In my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or role models doing that, not somebody like this,” he told reporters.

Can't t really complain too much I never watch the first half of the stupidbowl or half time stuff anyway and never watch anything that has to do with  that hatred promoting Turning Point USA but it it does seem like the bowl should consider its audience and this entertainment does.
Remember the Superbowl is pretty much a live entertainment for the wealthy.

It's crazy to turn to a klan concert instead of celebrating American diversity.

Yes! Please do a half tune show! God bless Turning Point and I know HE is! I support this effort!

I had never heard of Lee Greenwood before. So I googled him. I've never heard of any of his songs before. But he looks a lot like the manager of a Western Sizzlin'

Lee Greenwood? With all due respect, he's not on anyones top 1000 list. Bad Bunny is currently one of the top artists in the world. However my bet, he gets cancelled before the SB :-(

Leah Lewis is breaking her silence after her Matlock co-star David del Río was fired from the CBS legal drama amid sexual assault allegations.


	In a post on Instagram Stories, Lewis shared a photo with her mom and thanked the people for the support she has been receiving during this time.


	“Mom is here, we're moving forward in love and strength. I'm in good hands,” she posted. “Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care.”


	She continued, “Truly, we're moving forward in strength. Key word, strength. Please, let that be the takeaway.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Lewis plays Sarah Franklin in the primetime drama, which stars Kathy Bates. Sarah is a first-year associate at Jacobson Moore, where the series takes place.

	











	Earlier today, Deadline reported that after an investigation, Del Río was fired from Matlock following an incident on September 26 that involved Lewis. Following the internal investigation, Del Río was fired and escorted off the lot, the same day that the alleged assault was reported.


Matlock Season 2 is set to premiere on October 12, with the first half of the season already wrapped in filming. The show will be on a pre-planned hiatus and resume production after Thanksgiving.


	Del Río played Billy Martínez, another first-year associate at the law firm, like Lewis' Sarah. 


Matlock also stars Skye P. Marshall as Olympia Lawrence and Jason Ritter as Julian Markston. The series also features recurring characters played by Eme Ikwuakor, Aaron Harris, Sam Anderson and Beau Bridges, among others. Justina Machado is set to join the cast in a recurring role for Season 2.

Dude chose to throw his career away instead of being professional. Crazy world

sS crazy that others get elected to high office and appointed to cabinets…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Heartracing anime 100 Meters finds it all in a few glorious seconds","https://www.avclub.com/100-meters-review","Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

Like a naturally gifted athlete asked to learn the fundamentals now that he's entering into the big leagues, the scrappy talents of director Kenji Iwaisawa (On-Gaku: Our Sound) chafe against the best practices of typical anime in his sophomore film. After rotoscoping his own indie film about slackers in a DIY punk band, his follow-up, 100 Meters, jogs along a well-trod path: It adapts a hit sports manga, one about two young rivals finding meaning in competition, told over a series of races across the years. Like the distance its sprinters dash over and over again, it's predictable—even mundane at times. But also like those short bursts of all-out adrenaline, it can be transcendent in the moment.

The division between Togashi (Atsumi Tanezaki as a child, Tori Matsuzaka when grown) and Komiya (Aoi Yūki; Shota Sometani) won't surprise anyone familiar with the “spo-kon” formula found in shōnen stories: The former is the fastest kid in school, the latter a shy transfer student with the need for speed. It's talent against passion, favorite against underdog, complacency against hunger. Across the decades, the two egg each other on as they grow up and go pro, helping assuage the disillusionment that always threatens single-minded devotion. 

This kind of emotional connection by proxy, the excuses of running or video games or volleyball or fighting aliens, is standard-issue for the genre, undergirding plenty of platonic masculine relationships and the existential questions lurking beneath. Why do they push themselves? If they're not the best, why race at all? Why devote so much of your life to one hyper-specific, seemingly juvenile pursuit? These typical concerns are surely answered with artful elegance in  Uoto's manga, but in Iwaisawa's hands, there's another layer underneath the athletic navel-gazing—something primal and raw.

100 Meters stalls and cramps when it's stuck in hallways and auditoriums, where older side characters like Kaido (Kenjiro Tsuda) and Saizu (Koki Uchiyama) wax on about running at such length that even Haruki Murakami would be checking his smartwatch. But when it's on the track, Iwaisawa's film unleashes the myriad shifting styles that made On-Gaku such a vital garage rocker. 

Iwaisawa's rotoscoping weighs down the characters, adds realistic heft to their muscles and movements, their bodies hyper-physical set against more painterly backgrounds. The world fades away behind the athlete's legs and feet. Nothing else matters when they're running, and that's clear in every frame. Then, mid-race, the animation bursts free from reality. Faces grimace against the wind, eyes bulge, heartbeats and the percussive smack of sneakers blend into a single thump. It's animalistic, all that philosophizing about sport reduced to a heartracing sensory experience. Some races are captured in long unbroken takes, some are blacked-out and only communicated through sound. One, set during the pouring rain, is as exciting and beautiful as anything in animation this year.

If the rest of the film matched these transcendent moments, 100 Meters would have built up a personalized rivalry worthy of the sports-movie pantheon. But despite the plot's template, the friction between its racers is off-handed; this isn't a movie about one sprinter running against another, but several sprinters running against themselves—against the dozen-second dash they've chosen as their lifelong foe. There's beauty in that, if not a lot of drama. It's just another part of the film's uneasiness, the same kind that comes up when auteurs find themselves consumed by the Marvel machine after a heartfelt indie or two. Iwaisawa's punk spirit resists being trampled by the sports drama's game plan, but it does feel limited when confined to a single stretch of track.

“Dancing with the Stars” contestant Danielle Fishel is bringing ‘90s nostalgia to the ballroom and making “Boy Meets World” fans' dreams come true. The actress is reuniting with her former on-screen teacher, William Daniels, for a special performance on the show's Dedication Night, airing live Tuesday, Oct. 14.

On her “Danielle with the Stars” podcast, Fishel announced that the 98-year-old actor, best known as Mr. Feeny, will join her and professional partner Pasha Pashkov on the ballroom floor. “Mr. Feeny himself is going to be on the ballroom floor with me,” she said, revealing that Daniels will also “participate in the dance as well.”

Fishel shared that she and Pashkov will perform a jive to the “Boy Meets World” theme song, calling the tribute “crazy” but deeply meaningful. “It's really a dedication to Bill and the role he has played in my life and the role ‘Boy Meets World' has played in my life,” she said on the podcast.

She told Entertainment Weekly that Daniels continues to motivate her as both a performer and a person. “He is 98 years old. He was a child actor. He's had the most incredible career,” Fishel said. “To see him at 98 still going to conventions — he's gonna be on the ballroom floor next week — it's amazing.”

A post shared by Bill Daniels (@mrbilldaniels)

Dedication Night on DWTS gives contestants a chance to honor the people who've shaped their lives — and for Fishel, that person is her lifelong mentor. “He's such an inspiration to so many of us,” she said. “To be able to say thank you to him and give him this kind of platform for him to receive the love that he deserves is going to be very memorable.”

Fans flooded the “Pod Meets World” podcast's Instagram post confirming the news, which read: “IT'S OFFICIAL. NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT. Danielle brings John Adams High to the ballroom for Dedication Night on Dancing with the Stars. Get ready for F…F…F…Feeny.” One user commented, “Giving the people what we want. YESSSSSSS!” while another added, “This will be a special dance especially for the millennials ❤️🥹.”

Daniels' wife, actress Bonnie Bartlett Daniels, previously told People that her husband “adores the whole cast of “Boy Meets World” and “misses that experience with them.” She explained that he thrives on community: “He likes to be part of a group. That's what really keeps you going.”

A post shared by Bill Daniels (@mrbilldaniels)

Daniels, who turned 98 in March, remains an enduring figure for fans of the '90s sitcom. He's continued to make appearances at conventions and on the “Pod Meets World” podcast with Fishel and co-stars Rider Strong and Will Friedle, celebrating milestones together and revisiting fan-favorite memories.

Fishel hinted that Dedication Night will be even more special, teasing that some of her “Boy Meets World” co-stars will be in the audience. “Some people I'm shocked are able to be there, but I'm so happy are able to be there. It's gonna be really special,” she said.

For Fishel, returning to television through DWTS has been more than a career milestone — it's a reflection of how far she's come since her Topanga days. “I have really felt like Dancing with the Stars has been a second act for me in my career and as a performer,” she said.

The creative forces behind the play “Paranormal Activity” pose on set in Chicago, where the production opens this week. Chicago's Levi Holloway (left), wrote the play based on the horror movie franchise, and worked alongside Felix Barrett (right), the director, to bring it to life.

On the stage of Chicago Shakespeare Theater right now sits a two-story, life-size doll house, looming under overly dimmed lights and veiled by an ominous haze pumped in from offstage. The set, designed by Fly Davis, creepily beckons an audience that will soon fill the seats of the Navy Pier theater.

“Paranormal Activity,” the new stage play written by Levi Holloway (whose last work in Chicago was the Michael Shannon-led “Turret,” which he wrote and directed) makes its North American premiere at Chicago Shakespeare this week. The play is based on the award-winning film series of the same name, notable for its original press run in 2009, when the trailer famously didn't show any clips from the actual movie — opting instead to show test audiences watching the movie, visibly horrified.

The film series, produced by horror aficionado studio Blumhouse, now spans seven movies, and is known for its found-footage style of filmmaking. The producers of the play version are betting they can do the same thing in a theater — despite the obvious limitations of a live action staging. They also are intent on giving the story a new look and feel.

To create this new installment to the well-known franchise, Holloway teamed up with Felix Barrett, artistic director of Punchdrunk, an innovative theater company in the United Kingdom that is known for its immersive approach to theater. Each creative brings a slew of relevant credits: Holloway's suspenseful 2019 play “Grey House” made it from A Red Orchid, where he's an ensemble member, to Broadway; Barrett's Punchdrunk production “Sleep No More,” a fully immersive supernatural flip of Shakespeare's “Macbeth,” had a 14-year run in the McKittrick Hotel in New York.



The play “Paranormal Activity” is based on the award-winning film series of the same name and also uses the theme of found footage.

But “found footage” remains a theme, even in a theatrical setting. “It's a found footage genre,” said Holloway. “So they're saying that what the audience is experiencing is real. That became really interesting in terms of a way in. How do you do that to a theater audience? How do you displace them from reality and make them feel unsafe, even for a moment?”

Part of the answer is that set. The house, even at first glance, is off-putting. From a seat in the audience, it feels almost voyeuristic, reminiscent of Hitchcock's “Rear Window,” when the audience peers into the home and lives of a married couple whom you quickly figure is doomed.

“We needed a set that was hyper naturalistic,” said Barrett, the show's director. “We wanted to create a sense of peering in and not wanting to look too close, because you see yourself there.”

Holloway's script is original, but lives in the world of the films. He centers the story on a married couple (played by Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger), who are troubled by secrecy in their relationship — and that's before being haunted.

Barrett, who typically produces shows outside of theaters, saw the idea of scaring people in their seats as a new challenge. “I spend all my working life trying to invoke a sense of feeling in an audience,” he said. “Wouldn't it be rad to do it in a theater for an audience in the safety of an auditorium? To actually make that space crumble and be a bit threatening?”

In interviews a few days before the show is to be test driven for previews, the creative team stays tight-lipped on the details of how they will scare the audience. But they have employed Chris Fisher, who worked as illusion designer for “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” during which actors used actual illusions and slight of hand on stage. His list of impressive tricks for that show included performers transforming into each other before the eyes of the audience.

“Paranormal Activity” was first staged at Leeds Playhouse in England, with Heusinger in the original cast. (Chicago will be the first North American city to stage it.) Of playwright Holloway, “he has the kind of brain, and intellectual energy, to tap into the scary qualities of human beings and what is frightening,” Heusinger said.

During a recent practice run for the creative team, Heusinger said there were vocal screams in the theater. “There's new stuff in it that didn't happen before [in England], in the illusion territory, and in the horror territory. I'm curious how people are gonna react.”

Álvarez said the real horror potential lives within the characters' relationship. “It's kind of like the audience is a fly on the wall,” she said. “And we're letting them into this marriage and this life that we're trying to rebuild and transition. I think people should feel uncomfortable. We welcome the uncomfortable. It's like we are all going to face our fears together.”

“I really wanted to talk about marriage and trust and how somebody's past can catch up with them,” said Holloway, who tapped into some childhood trauma for the scripting.

“We're introduced to a couple who seem very familiar to us. And sometimes our weaponry is in the mundane. They're not extreme characters. They're very human. So, when they're met with the uncanny or the impossible, we ask ourselves an audience, ‘What would I do' and ‘Would I survive?'

That question of survival exists not only in the pair's interaction with the paranormal, but also with each other. “That intersection is where we try to drop the audience into moments of being unsafe,” Holloway added.

The movies found ways to be scary without the use of actual ghouls, ghosts or monsters. Barrett said the show leans into a similar style. “There's a sort of strange poetry and magic to the things you don't quite see,” he said. “And that restraint was what drew us to the film, because actually, it's the ultimate slow burn. You see very little, and it just peaks and then crescendos at the very end.”

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Digital Currency Group subsidiary Yuma, focused on scaling the decentralized AI network Bittensor, is launching an asset management division, according to an announcement on Thursday.

Yuma Asset Management will be anchored by a $10 million investment from DCG, the crypto investment giant.

According to the announcement, the asset manager will kick off with two flagship strategies that invest in Bittensor subnet tokens: the Yuma Subnet Composite Fund, designed for market-cap weighted exposure across all active subnets, and the Yuma Large Cap Subnet Fund, focused on larger subnets.

The Bittensor network is a decentralized, blockchain-based network that enables collaborative machine learning and AI model development across specialized subnets. The network rewards validators and miners in its native TAO token for contributing computational resources.

Yuma, founded in November 2024, said earlier this week it is ""actively validating"" over 120 subnets and mining on others. It has also ""provided capital to 15 subnet operators"" and has onboarded firms like BitGo, Copper, and Crypto.com as validator partners.

On Tuesday, TradeBlock's co-founders Greg and Jeff Schvey, brothers, joined Yuma as chief operating officer and chief technology officer, respectively.

When news broke last month that H1-B visa holders in the US would be subjected to a new hefty fee of $100,000, chaos and confusion ensued for a lot of tech workers and their employers. It's the latest in a string of restrictive visa measures imposed by the Trump administration that has been making tech talent wonder if they should look elsewhere.

Lauren Goode sits down with senior writer Zeyi Yang and senior editor Louise Matsakis to discuss the short-term and long-term effects of these measures, and how China is seizing the moment and offering a new visa program to bring tech talent into the country.

Lauren Goode: Hey, Louise. How are you doing this week?

Louise Matsakis: I'm good. I'm excited to be here covering for Mike this week,

Lauren Goode: Especially considering that it sounds like there's a lot going on outside of your apartment.

Louise Matsakis: Yes, there is a giant sinkhole on my block, so I currently have no running water. Very exciting.

Lauren Goode: And yet you're podcasting through it? Incredibly grateful.

Louise Matsakis: Of course, Lauren. Nothing would get in the way between me and podcasting.

Lauren Goode: Well, thank you for being our guest co-host two weeks in a row. It's a really busy time for everyone. And I'm particularly excited to have you on the pod today because of the topic we're going to be discussing. Before we dive into it, we have another colleague joining us today too, Zeyi Yang. Hey, Zeyi. How's it going?

Zeyi Yang: I'm good. I'm joining the last warm day of New York. I think the highest is 80 degrees today, but it's all downhill from now.

Lauren Goode: So, Zeyi, you recently reported on something that went down right after the Trump administration announced last month that H-1B visa holders, which is one of the most popular work visa programs in the country, would need to pay a hefty new $100,000 fee. You spoke with a source at the time, who you identify as Xie Yun, about her direct experience. Tell us briefly what happened to her.

Zeyi Yang: So, Xie Yun, she works for semiconductor companies in Silicon Valley, and she has just been on a six-week business trip that ended in Bangkok. So, after that, she was planning on, I think, spending two or three weeks time at home in China. So, she was just on this flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong to her home city in Wuqi. And then, right as the plane was touching down, she connected to the internet and saw that Trump announced this new $100,000 H-1B visa fee that could apply to her. Within the next three hours, she was panicking, and she was talking with her friends about what she could do. And then, she immediately got on the plane back to the United States through Shanghai and then to Los Angeles. So, really, it's one of the examples of a lot of people like her who are on H-1B Visas, but outside of the United States, who are really struggling to figure out whether they will have to pay $100,000 if they just didn't return to the United States in 24 hours. And that was really the latest of a series of immigration changes under the current Trump administration that's making a lot of people unsure what their official life will be as an immigrant worker in Silicon Valley and the broader US.

Lauren Goode: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today, we're talking about the state of work visas for tech talent. The Trump administration's recent announcement that the new H-1B visa holders would need to pay a fee of $100,000 created a wave of confusion for a lot of tech workers and their employers. The move cemented the administration's ongoing crackdown on visas, and it stands in stark contrast to China's approach. China announced a new visa program designed to attract young professionals and people with degrees in science and tech to study and do business there. We're going to dive into the impacts these different approaches could have on the tech industry from the talent pipeline to the future of innovation. I'm Lauren Good. I'm a senior correspondent at WIRED.

Louise Matsakis: I'm Louise Matsakis, senior business editor.

Zeyi Yang: And I'm Zeyi Yang, senior writer covering tech and business in China.

Lauren Goode: So, Zeyi, you were telling us about Xie Yun's experience and how she had to turn all of her plans around and found herself in this migratory limbo when news broke of the new fee for H-1B visas. There's been some additional reporting since then around what the rules and fees actually are for H-1B visas now. But let's take a step back to how these visas actually work for listeners who are not familiar, and then we can talk about why the new directive caused so much chaos. How do they typically work?

Louise Matsakis: So, the H-1B visas were first introduced in 1990, so they have been around for over 30 years. And the best way to understand it is it's really the easiest visa for people with a bachelor or advanced degree to get to be able to work United States legally. And so you're talking about a lot of people who either received their higher education back home or inside the United States, who are relying on this pretty stable visa program to get an office job, a teaching job, a hospital job in the United States. And in the past decade, what we have seen is that the Silicon Valley, the tech companies, have really been taking advantage of this program because this is a way for them to bring thousands of skilled workers who have advanced degrees to work for them. And that's why we're seeing that some of the big tech companies are, every single year, the largest sponsors of H-1B Visas.

Lauren Goode: There is a cap on the number of visas that are allowed, right? And then the employers actually have to submit the workers that they want to sponsor, so talk a little bit about that process.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, exactly. I think the first requirement for H-1B Visa is that you have to have a full-time job, and your employer has to be the one who's willing to pay the lawyer's fee, pay the application fee to sponsor this visa application for you. And then we get to the second part, which is that there's only a certain number of H-1B visas that will be given out every year, and the number of applications are usually above that. So then you go into a lottery system where basically every single person has the equal chance, unless you have a master's degree, which you get a second chance to be drawn as the lottery winner of the H-1B visa this year. And if you don't, you have to wait a full year before you can enter the pool again.

Lauren Goode: Got it. So, in recent years, as you've mentioned, we've seen that companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, along with some really big IT consulting firms, tend to be the entities that hoover up the most H-1Bs for their employees. It's pretty critical to the tech industry; therefore, this directive, this new directive that came out a few weeks ago, really threw the industry into chaos. Why was it so confusing?

Louise Matsakis: Well, first of all, that weekend ... so the policy was first announced on Friday, and then it was updated on Saturday and Sunday. All of the language from different White House officials and documents are different. One of the examples was that when the Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, was announcing this in the White House in front of reporters, he was saying that, ""Oh, people have to pay this H-1B fee every single year."" And then the second day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt came out and said, ""Actually, no, it's only a one-time fee."" It's completely different from what they said just a day ago. So, back then, there was a lot of confusion about how much you have to pay for it. And also, one of the biggest confusions when it was first announced is that if you have already acquired H-1B, going through the sponsorship and a lot of the system that we have just talked about, are you still going to have to pay for it? And then that was again explained the second day that, ""Oh, actually, if you already have a valid visa now, you will be exempted from this new policy."" But a lot of people were already panicking between those two days.

Lauren Goode: Wait, why is the US Commerce Secretary involved in visa decisions? Louise, do you have any insight into that?

Louise Matsakis: Well, Lauren, the main reason is that Congress is not involved. Right? It's pretty clear that it would take an act of Congress to actually change all of these immigration policies in a sound legal way. But instead, what we're seeing is the Trump administration is acting unilaterally to introduce these changes. And one of the main projects that Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, has taken up is raising money for the US government, so this $100,000 fee is one example of that. And another is something called the Gold Visa, which I reported on with our colleague Zoë Schiffer earlier this year, and it's this $1 million visa that seemingly any rich person anywhere in the world would be able to buy in order to immigrate to the US.

Lauren Goode: That sounds incredibly unorthodox.

Louise Matsakis: I think that's very fair. This is not the way that immigration policy usually plays out, and it's not clear at this point if anyone has actually paid for a Gold Visa, or if anyone has paid that $100,000 fee, and if they did, whether they could then take the administration to court.

Lauren Goode: Interesting. Okay. Well, if anyone has paid for that visa, we want to hear from you, so please contact us on our signals. I want us to talk more about what this means for the future pipeline of talent and immigration to the US. But can one of you tell us quickly what are the critiques of the current H-1B program?

Louise Matsakis: I think I can answer that question, Lauren. So, in a lot of ways, the H-1B Visa program has basically become two different programs under the same umbrella. So, on one hand, a lot of these visas are going to some of the best engineers in the world. They're going to AI researchers. They're going to doctors who work at companies all across the country, and hospitals and in clinics at universities. But on the other hand, a lot of these visas are going to these IT firms, which basically are providing IT support for companies, and a lot of these jobs are fairly low-paying. They are technically tech jobs, but it's not necessarily this highly skilled worker that you might have in mind who maybe works somewhere like Google or OpenAI. It's more of a everyday IT job where you're fixing people's computers, maybe troubleshooting a software problem. And so the critique of the H-1B visa is that those are jobs that a lot of Americans could do. Right? Those are not specialized skills necessarily, and there's been a lot of criticism in recent years that those IT firms are essentially abusing the H-1B visa to bring in workers who often are being exploited or who are not really working these super important jobs to our economy, and that those roles could actually be taken by Americans.

Lauren Goode: And is there any sense of whether or not changing the economic structure of the H-1B would actually change that?

Louise Matsakis: There have been a number of proposals that the Trump administration has floated. One of them is not making it a lottery anymore. So instead, they wanted to prioritize people who are making the highest salaries. But a critique of that approach is that you don't necessarily know when, say, someone like Elon Musk comes to the US, whether they're going to be a once-in-a-generation entrepreneur or whether they're going to play a hand in developing something like ChatGPT. And so, having this lottery system essentially allows us to bring in a wide swath of people who are at different points in their career as opposed to only giving these visas to established experts who are at the top of the income ladder already.

Lauren Goode: Right. Yeah, and certainly in academia, the best talent aren't necessarily people who are paid the most.

Zeyi Yang: Lauren and Louise, I don't think you guys have heard this from me yet, but I have been through that process too. After I graduated from grad school here, my first visa that I applied for was an H-1B visa, and I didn't get a lottery. Well, at that point, obviously, I am angry. I was like, ""Why is this a random lottery process? It doesn't really consider into anything."" But if the way to amend that is to only give it to the highest learners, well, I still wouldn't have gotten that visa too. So, I do feel like there are a lot of people who are not sure if a lottery system is the best system for H-1B, but again, I think they would be equally upset if you're just ranking people's salary and giving out visas on that basis only.

Lauren Goode: Great point, and we're glad you made it here to WIRED, Zeyi. Zeyi, what are some of the other stories that you're hearing from your sources in how this is going to affect them?

Zeyi Yang: I think we can separate into the short-term and the long-term impacts. The short-term is that during that weekend, the policy was announced on September 19th. A lot of people were making last-minute travel plan changes because they were not sure if they don't come back to the US soon enough, they will have to pay the fee. So, I'm hearing from people who just landed in China, who was planning on taking a whole month off in China, that just rushed back to the United States as soon as possible. I also heard from Emily, who works in finance in New York City, who was literally on the plane to Paris for a vacation. And then, when the plan was about to take off, she actually heard back from an immigration attorney that she was consulting, who she said, ""I think you should not leave the country at this point."" So she talked to the flight attendant to tell the pilot that she needs to get off the plane, and the pilot actually allowed her, so that was one of the most dramatic experiences I have heard. But what I'm hearing, generally speaking, is that people are losing money. People are missing out on weddings and family holidays just to make sure they don't fall victim to the new policy. And then, on the long term, there are still a lot of things unclear about this H-1B visa policy. For example, people who are changing jobs, people who already got a lottery but have to transfer that to a new employer, would they have to pay this? I think there are a lot of questions unanswered at this point. They still might be impacted even though they have already gone through the H-1B process before.

Lauren Goode: We should also note that there's this interesting caveat to the new fee rule. The administration is going to allow certain industries or employers to secure exemptions from the administration, and this is all per the discretion of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. And critics of this are obviously worried that this could maybe create a mechanism for companies to flatter the administration for special favors, which, in some ways, seems to be the M.O. Any last words from you guys on what you think the short-term and long-term effects of this ongoing hostility towards visa holders could mean for the tech industry?

Louise Matsakis: I think it's worth noting that this new $100,000 fee still does not have a sound legal basis. The H-1B visa program was created through an act of Congress. It is a law, whereas this new fee was basically something that was slapped on top of that via an executive order. I think we could still see potential litigation here. This could be an issue that goes all the way to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, it's creating a lot of uncertainty for companies. It's going to make hiring harder. And I think, like so many of the economic policies that the Trump administration is introducing, it's just creating chaos, and it's making it more difficult for anyone to predict what's going to happen next or to make decisions.

Zeyi Yang: Going back to the potential exemptions that might be given to certain industries or companies, one interesting thing I observed after the announcement of the policy is that some Silicon Valley figures have been trying to see the brighter side of this, namely Sam Altman and Jensen Huang, because when they were publicly being asked about what they think of the new H-1B fees, they were saying, ""Oh, maybe this will help us choose which direction we want to go with legal immigration."" And I think my interpretation of that is that if certain industries like AI or semiconductors can get exemptions while other industries don't, it will create a clear policy advantage for those industries. So, I think some certain companies are also trying to see if maybe this will become a good thing for them. They'll create some advantage for them, but not for the others in the future.

Lauren Goode: So you're saying there's a world in which the most powerful men get to shape the policy.

Zeyi Yang: How surprising is that?

Lauren Goode: Exactly. All right, let's take a quick break. And when we come back, we're going to talk about China's counter approach to all of this. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Today, we're talking about how new rules around visas like the H-1B are shaking up Silicon Valley. Now we're going to turn our attention to China, which, unlike the US, is actively trying to make it easier for tech talent to join its workforce. But the story is a little bit more complicated than it seems. Louise, you recently reported on this new visa, the K visa, that is designed to attract more STEM graduates and workers to go to China. Tell us about this.

Louise Matsakis: So, we don't have all the details of this visa yet, but Chinese authorities have said that applicants won't be required to obtain an invitation letter from a specific company. That means that the visa is not tied to individual employers the way that the H-1B visa in the US is. So that means a foreigner could come and have the flexibility to explore different startups in Shanghai or maybe see if they want to join a hacker house or something in a tech hub like Hangzhou. So, in a way, China is definitely seizing the moment. It's positioning itself to attract leading scientists and researchers who might be shut out of the United States. But Chinese social media has been flooded over the past couple of weeks with angry comments about the K visa. Many people have expressed concerns that it will give foreign workers an edge over domestic STEM graduates. I think in some sense these anxieties are pretty understandable because youth unemployment is already really high in China, and there are a ton of super qualified STEM graduates and just college graduates, in general, who are struggling to find work. But on the other hand, when Zeyi and I started looking through some of the commentary about this visa program, there was definitely a lot of nationalism and xenophobic rhetoric, if not just outright racism.

Lauren Goode: What's an example of that?

Louise Matsakis: So, for example, there were some Chinese influencers who were spreading these conspiracy theories that Indians were plotting to use the visa to immigrate to China en masse.

Lauren Goode: Interesting. You've both covered China's businesses and workforce for years. Was this backlash surprising to you?

Zeyi Yang: I would say yes, but also no. The no is because I know China has never been an immigrant country, so the idea to introduce a lot of foreign talents to the country, giving them some kind of preferential treatment over others, it's definitely going to cause some kind of outrage from the population. That part I am sure. The thing is that I feel that after China has been trying to open up to the world for quite a few decades at this point, I was expecting there to be a little bit more patience from the Chinese people because China also wants to be an AI leader at this age. And right now, the only model they can look after is the United States, which has been building on a ton of immigrant talent to build the AI industry. So, I was thinking maybe that kind of policy orientation will push them over the xenophobic obstacles that we are seeing, but unfortunately, the situation that seems to have happened is that it cannot.

Lauren Goode: So there are some cultural challenges to this. I mean, what do you think are some of the other challenges that China will face as it tries to roll out this K visa and attract foreign talent?

Louise Matsakis: I mean, I think the main thing is just that China, like Zeyi said, is absolutely not a country of immigrants. In 2020, only about 0.1% of the mainland population was made up of foreigners, according to one estimate. And it's also worth noting that that estimate includes people from Taiwan, Macau, and Hong Kong. These are places that are very culturally similar to China. So, the number of people who come from Africa, or North America, or Europe is just astonishingly small compared to the population size of China. In the US, about 15% of the people who live in this country are immigrants. That's a huge difference. So, I think that it can be hard for new arrivals to adjust. It's a difficult language. There's an entirely different ecosystem of apps and programs that you have to use. I remember the first time I went on a business trip to China, I needed to get the receipt for my expenses, and I was like, ""Can you email me a PDF of my receipt?"" And the people at the hotel looked at me like I was crazy. And they were like, ""We're just going to send it over WeChat."" And I was like, ""Oh."" There are a lot of small things like that that are really different, whereas, because for the last few decades, American culture and American tech companies have been so ubiquitous in the rest of the world, someone who comes to the US from India or from Europe, they're probably going to be using the same email platforms, the same social media networks. And a lot of the business norms are similar, right? Of course, there's still cultural differences. And if those people get homesick, they can find an immigrant community wherever they are. They can find food that reminds them of home. That's not necessarily the case in China. And so, I think the idea of a city like Shanghai or Beijing becoming a truly cosmopolitan hub that is a mix of different cultures is something that I think is really far off from now. I think it could happen, and I think it's likely that it will happen as the shifts of global power tilt away from the US. I think in this era where we're not making a lot of good choices, and we're not really making a lot of friends around the world, it's certainly possible, but China is just starting from a really different place than a city like San Francisco.

Lauren Goode: And also, Zeyi, you're a native Mandarin speaker. Louise, you've been trying to learn Mandarin. You spent three months last year doing an intensive, and you were telling me just how hard it is. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, I mean, I think I'm at a disadvantage because I started learning Chinese when I was 25. And as I can attest, in China, English is part of the high school exam that you use to go to college, which is a very famous and really hard test called the Gaokao. So, throughout elementary school and high school, students in China learn English, so that's also a reason that it can be harder to adjust because English is, for better or worse, the language of global business. So, a lot of immigrants who come to a place like the United States already have a lot of familiarity with the language. And yes, I can attest personally that if you wish to learn Chinese, it is incredibly rewarding, but I would see it as a journey for the rest of your life. It's not something you're going to master. It is something you're going to be doing forever. And I think it's great, and I encourage other people to do it, but it's not a stepping stone to a career in China. It's something you're going to have to really dedicate yourself to, and I think that that's another important barrier.

Lauren Goode: There's also, though, this growing curiosity in the US right now around specialty Chinese exports. And Zeyi, you just did this incredible feature for WIRED about the Labubu phenomenon. Can you talk a little bit about that too, and whether or not this growing curiosity, or you might even call it an acceptance of elements of Chinese culture, translates into people actually maybe considering moving to China?

Zeyi Yang: Yeah, I mean, this trend definitely didn't start this year. I would say probably the last time that people were all reminded of it was when TikTok became a global social platform, and then people started to realize that, ""Oh, a Chinese software, a Chinese social media platform can become just so popular around the world."" But then I think Labubu is another good example because it is a cultural product, and it's tied to China's manufacturing advantage too. But primarily, people love it for the design, for the culture around it. So, this is another time where we see that China or Chinese companies are able to produce something that is adored around the world. And it does beg the question of when people see enough things like that, will they start to have more interest in learning the Chinese language, in moving to China to explore opportunities that are related to China? I think we are seeing that happening right now, especially this year. I'm sure there are a lot of influencers who are going to China to figure out if they can have a career there, but it's still going to take a long time. And like Louis said, the language is hard to learn. The way people live in China is so different from the rest of the world. Actually, I have one thing that I'm keen to observe is that I do wonder if the K visa will attract more people from the neighboring countries of China or people who may already have some foundation of speaking Chinese, like from Malaysia, from Singapore, from Japan, or those places that may find it easier to move to China and adjust to life there. So, in that sense, it might not have the kind of global appeal of the H-1B visas, but it will help China build influence around itself more.

Lauren Goode: All of this is happening, of course, as we have been covering this, I think, completely unprecedented AI race. There is a massive AI race happening right now between the US and China. We have these regulations in the US right now in the form of export controls that are really meant to stifle China's competitiveness. It's pretty specific to hardware chips, in particular. How is this competition playing out in the talent front? Could these new immigration policies play a really significant role in the AI race?

Louise Matsakis: I definitely think that we could see a lot of top talent either go to China from other parts of the world, or stay in China, or return to China. Even before Trump returned to the White House, over the last, I would say, decade or two, there's been sort of periodic crackdowns on Chinese researchers in the US. There was this witch hunt under the first Trump administration that was called the China Initiative, and it was basically a program that was supposed to catch Chinese researchers that were allegedly involved in improper research collaborations with their colleagues in China who were taking funding. That was problematic in some way, but I think it sent a chill through universities across the US, and I think it made a lot of some of the top Chinese researchers reconsider whether they wanted to stay in the US or whether they felt comfortable here. So I think the first thing I'm looking out for is a drop in the number of Chinese PhD STEM students in the US, big names that might be going back to China, professors who were giving up their tenureship here and taking positions at prestigious Chinese universities. I definitely think that we're going to see that, and I think we're already seeing that, but I think the other big shoe to drop would be whether we see Chinese startups and Chinese tech companies that are able to recruit high-profile international talent. I think that would definitely be a major shift in the landscape. If you see someone who's like, ""You know what? I don't want to put up with living in San Francisco. I'm going to go to Shanghai, and I'm going to take on the adventure even though the language is hard, even though there are all these other barriers."" That to me would really say, ""Okay, things have shifted.""

Lauren Goode: Zeyi, any last thoughts on that?

Zeyi Yang: Yeah. I really want to emphasize the point that H-1B visa is one part of the broader immigration policy or process, right? It is a very essential part connecting higher education and a stable employment in the United States. And as we have seen in the past, this is a pathway that will create people like Elon Musk and Microsoft's Satya Nadella. And when we are looking at H-1B being impacted right now, the effect will also extend to all the upstream, downstream immigration pathways and the reasons why people come to the United States. Like Louise mentioned, I think one thing we're going to see is that a lot of international students, when they're considering where they want to pursue higher education, they might think more about countries other than the United States because they see the H-1B visa is being hit with this new fee. Maybe the other immigration visa, maybe the student visas will be restricted in the future too, and all of those forces will come to this result that the US is just harder and harder to attract talents from student level to entry-career, mid-career level to work here, to start companies here, and to innovate here.

Lauren Goode: Thanks to you both for your insights on this. And I should mention to our listeners too that Zeyi and Louise have a fantastic newsletter for WIRED called Made in China, where they've been covering this and a lot of other topics, so please subscribe to that. We're going to take another quick break, and we're going to come back with recommendations. All right, Zeyi Louise, before we go, we always like to share our personal recommendations with our listeners. Zeyi, I'll start with you. What's your recommendation this week?

Zeyi Yang: Sure. Just last night, I went to the screening of a documentary called Made in Ethiopia. It's a very interesting story. It's this Chinese entrepreneur who built a gigantic industry zone for manufacturing companies in Ethiopia by attracting Chinese investment, trying to replicate the Chinese way of development in Ethiopia. And the filming crew really spent five years there documenting the whole process of how this industry zone was first celebrated, was adored by local people, and then became a point of contention in the end. So, really, really good, insightful, and a very complicated topic to discuss in that documentary, so I would recommend everyone to watch it. I believe it's available on demand on PBS right now.

Lauren Goode: Amazing. I'm definitely going to check that out. Louise, what's your recommendation?

Louise Matsakis: First of all, I really want to see that movie, and I was just looking at the screening, Zeyi, and I'm jealous that you got to see what looks like the last one in the US for a while, but I am relieved to hear that it's streaming on PBS. I'm going to recommend another publication, which is called The New York Review of Architecture. This is an incredibly grassroots, funny, self-referential, whimsical publication that covers our environment and why the buildings around us are the way that they are. I went to a launch party on Saturday for a special edition, which was the Los Angeles Review of Architecture, and I just found the vibes of the people who wrote for this publication, the people who were editing it, to be such a breath of fresh air, and I recommend everybody subscribe.

Lauren Goode: That's great. Did you say that it's a monthly magazine?

Louise Matsakis: I think it comes out every other month, and it's a print publication. It looks like a newspaper, which is a fun format.

Lauren Goode: We love print.

Louise Matsakis: Yes, we do. Lauren, what's your recommendation this week?

Lauren Goode: I was actually going to recommend your Made in China newsletter, which I already gave a plug to earlier in the podcast, because it really is so good. I learn so much from reading you guys every week, but now I have to come up with something else, and so on the fly, I'm going to recommend ... this is a very geographically specific recommendation, the Greek yogurt from Souvla. Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

Louise Matsakis: No.

Zeyi Yang: I think I do, actually.

Lauren Goode: Souvla is this contemporary Greek restaurant. It's like a chain. It is a chain restaurant here in San Francisco that makes this really, really good frozen Greek yogurt with all kinds of toppings, and lately, I've been pretty obsessed with the one that has olive oil and sea salt on top. It's sweet because it's yogurt, but then it has the savory kick to it, and I've been trying to replicate it at home too, so that I'm not spending all of this money on Souvla Greek yogurt. I have not yet found the perfect combination, but I would recommend that if you're in the area and you have the opportunity to try it, try it. Or if you are a frozen yogurt aficionado, try putting a little bit of olive oil and sea salt on it because it is so good.

Zeyi Yang: You know what, Lauren? I'd also try swapping a little bit of that olive oil with chili crisps.

Lauren Goode: Ooh.

Zeyi Yang: Let's see how that works.

Lauren Goode: Ooh, that's a good one. Just the chili crisps? No salt?

Zeyi Yang: Well, you can pair it with something else too, some other condiments. Don't do it too much because you don't want your frozen yogurt to be completely spicy, but just a little bit of that will make it interesting.

Lauren Goode: I love that. All right, I'm going to do that next time. Thank you, Zeyi. Thanks to all of you for listening to Uncanny Valley.
