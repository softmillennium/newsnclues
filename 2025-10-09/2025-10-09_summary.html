Report reveals Maricopa county spent huge sums on items not connected to court-ordered overhaul of agency

The sheriff's office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert's report.

The report released on Wednesday criticized the use of compliance money by the Maricopa county sheriff's office to fund personnel costs and tasks, either in part or in full, that are not connected to the overhaul.

It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8m for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court's orders; $1.5m in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3m to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location.

For over a decade, Maricopa county taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then sheriff Arpaio's traffic patrols targeting immigrants.

The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency's traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.

The county says $323m has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff's department's progress and the agency's compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352m by July 2026.

The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff's office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case's monitor.

The report concluded 72% of the $226m in spending by the sheriff's office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or “improperly prorated” to a compliance fund.

Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.”

Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff's office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.

Sheriff Jerry Sheridan's office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.

Raul Piña, a longtime member of a community advisory board created to help improve trust in the sheriff's office, said the report opens up a broader conversation about the integrity of the sheriff's office.

“You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said.

Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn't still be under the court's supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn't still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30m to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.

The report criticized Maricopa county and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.

Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county's governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board's legal counsel is reviewing the report. “The board has confidence in MCSO's budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said.

Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff's office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency's also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn't yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.

Data shows a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns

Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US's major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns.

Personnel data obtained by Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, and shared with the Guardian, suggests the Trump administration has moved 45% of FBI agents in the country's 25 largest field offices to support the Department of Homeland Security's immigration crackdown. Across all of the FBI's offices, 23% of the roughly 13,000 total agents at the bureau are now working on immigration, according to Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.

Warner's office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau's mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities.

The data, first reported by the Washington Post, suggests the FBI is dramatically shifting its objectives in an effort to back Trump's increasingly aggressive immigration raids, with the administration targeting 3,000 daily arrests and seeking to expand its detention capacity to detain more than 100,000 immigrants.

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner. The senator's office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents' total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.

“When you pull a quarter of the FBI's top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement.

The transformation of the FBI has raised alarms about the potential consequences for communities targeted by immigration raids and the impact on the work the bureau is abandoning, experts said.

Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI's mandate. Some agents might be eager to support the president's immigration agenda while others likely oppose the redirection, he said: “Part of the reason FBI leadership would be doing this at such scale is to separate those two – to identify who are the loyalists and who are potential impediments to the administration's goals.”

The move is in line with FBI director Kash Patel's efforts to purge the bureau of agents seen as disloyal to Trump, German said, noting reports of the termination of personnel involved in the January 6 investigation.

FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said.

There has been extensive documentation of the violent and indiscriminate nature of the Ice raids, which have often been carried out by masked men and have at times led to the detention of US citizens, and adding FBI personnel to the mix could exacerbate the chaos and potential for abuses, the former agent said.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear. Spokespeople for DHS, Ice, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau's intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don't have capacity to tackle: “That's where the real harm will come.”

Current and former FBI agents told the Washington Post there were growing concerns about low morale within the agency and that agents were stretched thin, which could hamper national security investigations and complex cases.

Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent and professor of practice in the University of New Haven's criminal justice department, said the shift in priorities resembled the post-9/11 reorganization at the FBI, when counterterrorism became the central focus.

“The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.”

Gray, however, said he was not concerned about a temporary shift while DHS engages in rapid recruitment of new Ice officers.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, defended the redirection of FBI resources toward immigration enforcement at a tense Senate hearing earlier this week when she was accused by Democrats of weaponizing the justice department. FBI agents, she said, were working daily with DHS on “keeping Americans safe and getting illegal aliens out of our country”.

Trump administration has been accused of preparing to severely limit journalists' ability to cover the department

With days left before journalists covering the Pentagon must sign on to a new set of guidelines to retain physical access to the department, major US news companies – and organizations representing their interests – remain concerned about specific policies they fear will stifle independent reporting on the Pentagon.

The Trump administration has been accused of preparing to impose severe limitations on the ability of journalists to cover the Pentagon and publish information that had not been officially approved for release.

An “in-brief for Media Members” that updated an earlier set of policies, released last month, drew strong condemnation from media companies and groups advocating for press freedom. On Monday, the Pentagon sent out a revised version.

On Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association, which said it has been “cautious” in communicating about the policy as it worked behind the scenes, said the changes made – including an acknowledgment that signees may not “agree” with the policies – are not sufficient.

In particular, the revised policy still prohibits journalists from the “solicitation” of information from Pentagon employees, “such as public advertisements or calls for tips encouraging [Department of War] employees to share non-public [Department of War] information”. Journalists fear that policy could infringe on their ability to seek information about the agency from employees.

Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to change the name of the defense department to the Department of War. This would require approval from Congress to become official.

“We acknowledge and appreciate that the Pentagon is no longer requiring reporters to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement. “But the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding' of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.”

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), which has worked behind the scenes to relax the policies, said the changes don't go far enough.

“The fact is we still have concerns with the updated language of the policy and expect that it will pose a significant impediment as journalists weigh with their employers whether or not to sign this revised version,” Gabe Rottman, the RCFP vice-president of policy said on Wednesday.

PEN America, an organization that advocates for free expression, also said Thursday that the Pentagon should “revisit” its policies. “National security is strengthened, not threatened, when journalists can investigate and report without fear,” Tim Richardson, PEN America journalism and disinformation program director said.

With the exception of CNN, which does not plan to sign the policy, most news organizations have been tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sign by next week's deadline or risk losing access to the Pentagon compound.

The New York Times said in a statement that it “appreciates the Pentagon's engagement, but problems remain with the policy and we and other news organizations believe further changes are needed”.

A spokesperson for the Atlantic also said that it “[continues] to oppose the Pentagon's proposed press policy”.

Pentagon representatives have been steadfast in rebuffing the protests of media organizations.

“Access to the Pentagon is a privilege, not a right and the Department is not only legally permitted, but morally obligated to impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of that privilege,” chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a post on X, denying that journalists will be forced to “clear stories” with the agency before publication.

Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, said in her own post that “reporters would rather clutch their pearls on social media than stop trying to get warfighters and [Department of War] civilians to commit a crime by violating Department-wide policy.”

In its statement on Wednesday, the Pentagon Press Association called on the agency to reconsider the policies in the remaining days before journalists are asked to sign them.

“Limiting the media's ability to report on the US military fails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” the group said. “The American people deserve to know how their military is being run. They deserve more information from this administration, not less.”

Trump bragged about his administration seeking to ban flag burning, which is protected speech.

President Donald Trump bragged that his administration “took the freedom of speech away” from protesters who burn the American flag during a rant against anti-fascists on Wednesday.

While speaking about “antifa-inspired terror” in a meeting on the anti-fascist movement, Trump touted his recent executive order instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi to find ways to prosecute people who burn the American flag.

“We've made it a one year penalty for inciting riots,” he said. “We took the freedom of speech away.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“Because that's been through the courts, and the courts said you have freedom of speech,” he went on, in a serious tone. “But what has happened is when they burn a flag, it agitates and irritates crowds — I've never seen anything like it on both sides — and you end up with riots. So we're going on that basis.”

Trump appeared to be referring to his August 25 executive order arguing against the decades-old precedent set by the Supreme Court designating flag burning as protected speech. 

The order claims that the Court didn't say flag burning was protected if it was “conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action.” In essence, the administration is seeking to redefine an act of constitutionally protected free speech as “incitement to violence,” which does not traditionally enjoy First Amendment cover. Experts have said that this argument is baseless and an extremist effort to undermine First Amendment rights.

Despite Trump's remarks on Wednesday, the executive order doesn't include anything about imprisoning people who burn American flags. Nonetheless, the president's comment sparked disbelief as a remarkable moment of Trump “saying the quiet part loud.”

Indeed, Trump has spent his second term rapidly accelerating the erosion of free speech rights. 

Trump has imprisoned numerous activists for Palestinian rights and is still trying to deport one of them, Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil. Last month, he designated “Antifa” — a movement frequently vilified by the right as a malicious organized group — as a “terrorist threat,” seemingly casting a wide net for going after those on the left. He has also sicced the National Guard and other federal agents on protesters against his administration's violent immigration raids across the country.

Trump has not been shy about his goal of punishing and silencing his political enemies. His administration has levied an all-encompassing effort to defund, deplatform, or realign his critics in the media — an effort that many outlets and owners have eagerly complied with. Other institutions like universities have followed suit.

A senior Hamas official has rejected Donald Trump's proposal for a transitional “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's post-war administration.

Under the US president's plan, the board would be headed by Mr Trump and Sir Tony Blair, the former prime minister.

Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official who has been involved in previous negotiations between the terror group and the US, said that no Palestinian faction would accept such a plan.

“All the factions, including the Palestinian Authority, reject this,” he told Qatar's Al Araby television network on Thursday.

Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza that will allow for the release of the remaining hostages held inside the Strip, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.

But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, unveiled on Sept 29, also called for post-war Gaza to be governed by a transitional authority headed by himself alongside Sir Tony.

Mr Trump did not address the Hamas spokesman's concerns during his live-streamed cabinet meeting on Thursday. Instead, he said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.

“There will be disarming,” Mr Trump said, adding that Israeli forces would also conduct “pullbacks”.

He was non-committal when asked about a two-state solution, saying he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on. “I don't have a view. I'm going to go with what they agreed to,” he said. 

On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.”

In a speech to the Palestinian public, Khalil al-Hayya, the exiled leader of Hamas, said Israel and Hamas had “reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people.”

He also said Hamas had received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza had permanently ended.

Details of the hostage and prisoner releases also emerged on Thursday. Israel outlined a multi-step process beginning with the IDF pulling its forces back, once its cabinet had formally approved the plan.

After it withdraws to an agreed line – leaving Israel in control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip – Hamas will be required to release the 48 hostages it is holding within 72 hours.

The process will begin with the 20 believed to be alive. The hostages will be handed to the Red Cross, which will transfer them to IDF troops within Gaza. The soldiers will then escort them to the Re'im military base near the border, where their families will be waiting.

Those needing urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation.

The release of Palestinian prisoners will take place only after the initial 72-hour period, during which Hamas is to release all Israeli hostages.

If any of the dead hostages remain in Gaza, a different, “classified” response will take effect, according to a draft of the deal seen by Channel 12. Israel is already anticipating that Hamas may be unable to locate all of the remains.

Hamas has previously said it did not know where the remains of all of the dead hostages were. 

Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt announced on Thursday that they would take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations were unknown.

Thank you for following our live coverage of negotiations over peace in Gaza, and of Trump declaring peace in the Middle East. 

Palestinian media, citing the Hamas-run Gaza Civil Defence agency, has reported that an Israeli strike in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood has trapped some 40 people under rubble.

The agency said that the bodies of four were recovered from the building that was targeted, “and more than 40 people are still under the rubble.”

Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir warned on Thursday that his Jewish Power party would push to topple prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government unless Hamas is ultimately dismantled.

“If the Hamas government is not dismantled, or if they only tell us that it is dismantled while in reality it continues to exist under a different guise – Jewish Power will dismantle the government,” Mr Ben-Gvir said.

Israel's security cabinet meeting to approve the ceasefire and hostage-release phase of the US plan has concluded, The Times of Israel has reported.

The full cabinet will now convene to vote on – and if successful ratify – the deal.

Exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said on Thursday the group has received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza has permanently ended.

He said that Israel and Hamas had “reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people” and that he had received confirmation that the initial ceasefire would lead to a sustained ceasefire.

The United Nations plans to ramp up its delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza in the first 60 days of a ceasefire in the enclave, a top UN official said on Thursday.

“We will aim to increase the pipeline of supplies to hundreds of trucks every day. We will scale up the provision of food across Gaza to reach 2.1 million people who need food aid and around 500,000 people who need nutrition,” said Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.

“Famine must be reverted in areas where it has taken hold and prevented in others,” he added.

The draft ceasefire deal being reviewed by Israel's security cabinet includes the names of 20 living hostages and 28 bodies to be released from Gaza, Channel 12 reports.

The fact that it includes 28 bodies implies that two hostages have died who have not been officially declared dead.

Israel had previously expressed “grave concern” over the health of three hostages through to be alive, said to be Israeli hostage Tamir Nimrodi, Nepali hostage Bipin Joshi and Thai hostage Pinta Nattapong, according to The Times of Israel.

 

Donald Trump has said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.

“I don't have a view. I'm going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters at a meeting of his Cabinet. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.”

Donald Trump said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.

“I'm not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But... there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces.

Donald Trump has said he has agreed to speak to the Israeli Knesset and will do so if requested by officials there.

“They asked me to speak at the Knesset and ... I've agreed to if they would like me to,” Mr Trump told reporters as he met his Cabinet at the White House.

Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby that Hamas rejects Donald Trump's proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's administration, headed by the US president himself.

Israel and Hamas have agreed a ceasefire deal to free hostages held in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails following indirect negotiations in Egypt.

But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, on which the indirect negotiations were based, also calls for post-war Gaza to be ruled by a transitional authority governed by a board headed by Mr Trump.

“No Palestinian would accept this. All the factions, including the Palestinian Authority, reject this,” Mr Hamdan told Al Araby Television Network.

Donald Trump said he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

“I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there, and we're working on the timing, the exact timing,” Mr Trump said.

Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told his US counterpart Donald Trump in a phone call that he “deserves the Nobel Peace Prize” for bringing about a deal to end the war in Gaza.

He invited Trump to “participate in the celebration to be held in Egypt to mark the conclusion of the agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, the first phase of which has been signed during talks in Egypt.

The statement from Sisi's office said the president “stressed the need to move forward toward implementing the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip in all its stages”.

Donald Trump says the US will work with Iran so it can “rebuild” its country.

“We will work with Iran, as you know we have major sanctions on Iran, we would like to see them rebuild their country too, but we they can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said.

He said that Tehran acknowledged that it is in favour of the Israel and Hamas peace deal. 

Donald Trump has said the Hamas-held hostages should be returned on Monday or Tuesday

“I'm going to try make a trip over,” he said. “It will be a day of joy.”

Israel has released details of its hostage handover plan, outlining a multi-step process under the new Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas.

If the deal is approved in today's cabinet meeting, a ceasefire is expected to take hold within 24 hours.

The IDF will pull back its forces to an agreed upon line which will see it retain control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the plan.

Hamas is to release the 48 hostages it is holding – beginning with the 20 believed to be alive – within 72 hours of Israel's troop withdrawal, as outlined by the US-brokered agreement.

They will be passed to the Red Cross who will transfer them to IDF troops within Gaza. The soldiers will then escort them to the Re'im military base near the border, where their families are waiting for them.

Hostages requiring urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation.

Israel's security cabinet meeting – which is being held ahead of the full cabinet meeting to vote on the peace deal – has started after an unexplained delay of an hour and a half.

Israel's Channel 12 has reported that the delay was in part caused by ongoing discussions regarding the list of Palestinian security prisoners to be released.

Donald Trump was due to hold a cabinet meeting at 4pm UK time following the signing of a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but it is currently delayed. We will bring you more updates as we have them. 

The bodies of Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammad, which were reportedly requested by Hamas as part of a hostage release agreement, will not be included in the deal, an Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN on Thursday. 

Benjamin Netanyahu's three core goals have been achieved, his spokesperson has said.

“We have hit a critical point in this war,” said Shosh Bedrosian, the prime minister's office spokesperson. “From day one in this war, the prime minister laid out three objectives – the return of all of our hostages, the defeat and dismantling of Hamas and ensuring Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.”

“All of the prime minister's objectives have now been achieved,” she said.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu held an “emotional” phone call after the first stage of a peace deal was announced between Israel and Hamas.

The US-brokered agreement, signed this morning in Egypt, will lead to a pause in the fighting, the release of all 20 living hostages together and an Israeli military withdrawal from the majority of Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister thanked the US president “for his global leadership to make all this possible” in a call this morning, said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.

“It was a very emotional and a warm conversation as both leaders congratulated each other on this historic achievement,” she added.

Mr Netanyahu called the deal “a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel”. Gideon S'aar, Israel's foreign minister, said Israel has an interest in “expanding the circle of peace” and normalisation in the Middle East.

Iran called on the international community to prevent Israel from violating its obligations in Gaza, its foreign ministry said in a statement, after Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed an agreement to cease fire.

The foreign ministry said Tehran supports any effort that ends the “genocide” and the war in Gaza.

“All of our hostages, the living and deceased, will be released 72 hours later, which will bring us to Monday,” said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.

“Israel is preparing to receive our hostages in all conditions they may be in.”

The UK Foreign Secretary will travel to Paris today to meet ministers from Europe, as well as from Qatar and Turkey, to discuss the next steps of Donald Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan.

The Telegraph understands that Yvette Cooper will take part in meetings with allies to discuss the implementation of the peace plan's first phase, as well as how the second phrase, focused on ending the suffering in Gaza, will be achieved.

The Foreign Secretary will hold meetings with counterparts from France and Germany alongside ministers from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and Spain to discuss building consensus on governance of Gaza after the conflict. 

The high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti will not be exchanged as part of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, Israel has announced.

Asked about rumours of his possible release, a government spokeswoman said: “I can tell you at this point in time that he will not be part of this release.”

Barghouti - from Hamas's rival, the Fatah movement - was among the Palestinian prisoners Hamas wanted to see released as part of the Gaza deal.

Imprisoned since 2002, Barghouti, 66, has been nicknamed the “Palestinian Mandela”, his popularity amongst Palestinians has not wavered and he he is widely considered the only man capable of uniting disparate political factions. 

Israel considers him as one of the masterminds behind a wave of bombings in Israel between 2000-2002 during the second Intifada – which he has always denied. He was convicted of multiple murders and given five life sentences. 

If released, he could challenge Mahmoud Abbas, 89, the long-standing head of the Palestinian Authority and potentially mend the longstanding rift between the Fatah movement and Hamas.

The first phase of a Gaza peace plan “would not have happened without President Trump's leadership”, Sir Keir Starmer said on a visit to India.

Asked whether the US president deserves the Nobel Peace Prize at a press conference in Mumbai, the Prime Minister said: “This is a very significant step forward and it would not have happened without President Trump's leadership on this.

“And I want to be really clear about that and I say that from the informed position of the UK having played a part behind the scenes in this with the US and with the mediators.

“What matters now is to press on and implement this.”

Israel has announced that the ceasefire in Gaza will go into effect “within 24 hours” of the cabinet meeting to approve the deal.

Earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the ceasefire would come into effect this evening after the deal is ratified in a meeting at 3pm BST.

The update suggests Israel might be trying to extend the deadline to start the ceasefire.

After the 24 hours finishes, the 72 hour countdown for the hostages to be released will begin, a spokeswoman for the government said.

Turkey will take part in efforts to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire in Gaza agreed by Israel and Hamas, president Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.

“God willing, we as Turkey will take part in the mission force that will monitor the agreement's implementation in the field,” he said, adding that Turkey will contribute to the reconstruction of Gaza.

Lebanon has arrested 32 people in recent months on suspicion of providing Israel with information on Hezbollah that facilitated strikes on the Iran-backed militant group, a judicial official told AFP on Thursday.

More than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah – including two months of open war – saw Israel batter the group's arsenal and kill a slew of senior commanders, and it has kept up strikes since a November truce.

Requesting anonymity, the official said that “at least 32 people have been arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, six of them before the ceasefire”.

So far, “nine people have been tried by the military court”, while 23 are still under investigation, the official added.

Lebanon remains technically at war with Israel and any contact is punishable with imprisonment.

A senior Hamas official has said that disagreements over what Palestinian prisoners Israel will release are threatening to derail the deal.

“It seems Netanyahu is trying to sabotage the ceasefire agreement before its implementation, by reneging on prisoner release lists in an attempt to derail the understandings,” wrote Mahmoud Mardawi on X.

MPs from both sides of the Commons have warmly welcomed the deal.

Jack Rankin, a Tory frontbencher who was twinned with hostage Avinatan Or as part of a campaigning push last year, said: “The news that Avinatan and the rest of the hostages will be returning home after two years in Hamas captivity brings long-awaited relief.

“I am thrilled that Avinatan will soon be reunited with his partner Noa, his mother Ditza, and his entire family. The suffering endured by the hostages and their loved ones has been unimaginable. Until every last one is safely home, we remain firmly committed to advocating for their release.”

Luke Akehurst, a Labour MP, added: “I'm overwhelmed with relief that the remaining Israeli hostages, including Evyatar David whose family I have met, are finally coming home two years after the horrors of 7 October 2023.

“Their suffering has been appalling and the steadfast campaigning by their families and friends has been essential to ensuring their plight was not forgotten.”

It's interesting to read the latest social media post from Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister.

His lengthy message carries a tone of finality – that the war which started on October 7th is at an end.

Mr Saar praises Benjamin Netanyahu for showing “steadfastness in achieving all the war's objectives.”

He describes the war in the past tense, adding: “It is good for Israel that in these days of conflict, he [Netanyahu] is the one who led it.”

He also discusses the potential of new normalisation agreements and deals to “expand the circle of peace” in the region.

This would suggest that Mr Trump's reported pledge to block Israel re-starting the war after the release of the hostages has been accepted, or at least acknowledged, by the upper echelons of the Israeli government.

It bodes well for the next stages of the peace deal – and the release of the hostages. Hamas is only likely to fulfil the demands placed on it if it believes Israel will not simply return to battle once the first phase is over. 

Around a dozen pro-Palestine gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday morning, writes Emily Smith.

The Court of Appeal will hear a legal challenge today, brought by Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO, arguing that it is illegal for the UK to continue licensing F-35 parts that can be accessed by Israel.

The High Court ruled in June that the issue was for Parliament and not the courts to decide.

The protestors held signs reading, “stop arming Israel, stop the genocide” and “let aid into all of Gaza now”.

Banging drums and waving flags they chanted, “David Lammy shame on you your hands are bloody too”, “Keir Starmer be afraid, Tony Blair go to hell”, and “UK Government you can't hide, UK Government pick a side”.

In September last year, the Government suspended export licences for weapons and military equipment over the risk that UK arms could be used in serious violations of humanitarian law.

Outside the court, a woman who gave her name as Serena told The Telegraph that she would “absolutely not” stop protesting following the ceasefire.

“Of course we will continue,” she said. “Justice for Palestine. An end to apartheid.”

Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt will take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations are unknown.

There are 48 remaining hostages, 28 of whom are believed to be dead. 

Hamas must release their bodies to Israel under the terms of the new ceasefire deal.

Hostage families and campaigners including a former Hamas detainee have welcomed the landmark agreement reached between Israel and Hamas.

Adam Ma'anit, whose cousin Tsachi was kidnapped on Oct 7 and later killed by Hamas, added: “The news that a deal has finally been reached to bring home the remaining 48 hostages is what we have been hoping and fighting for throughout these painful two years.

“It's impossible to describe the mix of relief and heartbreak we feel – relief that they may at last come home, and heartbreak that for some, it will be for burial [...] We couldn't bring my cousin Tsachi home alive, so this is a bittersweet day for our family. But the hostage families have become part of our extended family – their joy is our joy, and their pain is our pain.”

Ada Sagi, a peace activist held by Hamas for more than 50 days, and Noam Sagi, her son, said: “This is an extraordinary day and our hearts are racing to welcome them home.

“We will envelope them with love, with the warmth they've been denied for too long. Trump has shown that the impossible can be made possible”.

At last a breakthrough – though as even Donald Trump conceded, these are but “the first steps”.

The significance of the moment should not be underplayed. Barring any unforeseen complications, there will be no Israeli hostages left in Gaza by early next week. Aid will be allowed into the shattered territory in meaningful quantities. The guns will fall silent.

No wonder they were dancing in the dead of night along Gaza's rubble-strewn streets and on Tel Aviv's Hostages Square. After two years and two days of appalling carnage, first in Israel's kibbutzim and later across the length of Gaza, there is at last cause for genuine hope.

For Hamas, the future is bleak. Once the hostages are released, it will have lost its final leverage over Israel.

A movement that has brought terror to Israel and misery to its own people for decades really now faces only two options: it can declare its own extinction as a meaningful fighting force – preserving an element of dignity and the hope of reinventing itself as a solely political entity – or it can have extinction thrust upon it.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews expressed its “deep appreciation” of President Trump and the families of the hostages, declaring: “It is time for peace”.

Phil Rosenberg, the president of the Board of Deputies, said that the news overnight offered hope of peace for the first time since the Oct 7 massacre.

He said: “The overnight news of an agreement to bring an end to the nightmare unleashed by Hamas on 7 October means that for the first time in two years, we can dare to hope for the release of all the hostages, and the conclusion of this terrible war.

“We convey our deep appreciation to President Trump, the mediators and, most of all, the indefatigable campaigning of the hostage families whose courage, resilience and determination has been a beacon to the world.

“We will celebrate the return of those living and praying for their swift recovery and care, and  we will mourn the returning dead, thinking of their loved ones in their time of grief. It is time for healing. It is time for peace.”

Thousands of jubilant Israelis gathered in what has become known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where for two years, families of the hostages have gathered, hoped and prayed for the return of their loved ones.

Many wore stickers reading “They're coming back”, waving Israeli and US flags and clutching photos of the captives. 

One Israeli woman, Yael Cherni, told The Telegraph:“You must understand this is the first day in two years that I can breathe and the air actually gets into my lungs. We have been waiting to be rescued by someone. That someone is apparently Donald Trump.”

She continued: “So we are really praising this day. I have full faith in Trump and the deal he made which is incredibly wise. I have some doubt about whether all the 48 hostages will come out, that's what scares me most. Not necessarily because Hamas will make it harder but maybe because it will be impossible to find them all. But I hope and pray that we will see them here as soon as possible.”

The office of Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that an agreement to secure the release of hostages in Gaza will take effect only after receiving cabinet approval.

“Contrary to Arab media reports, the 72-hour countdown will begin only after the agreement is approved in the cabinet meeting, which is expected in the evening hours,” Mr Netanyahu's office said.

An Israeli official confirmed to The Telegraph that the cabinet is meeting at 5pm local time (3pm GMT) to discuss and vote on the peace plan.

Once approved, the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners is then set to occur within 72 hours.

Israeli hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released by Monday as part of the first stage of a peace deal.

Under the terms of Donald Trump's 20-point plan, the 20 surviving hostages held by Hamas since the Oct 7 massacre will be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. The terror group will also return 28 bodies.

In a call to the remaining captives' families on Wednesday night, the US president told them: “The hostages will come back, they're all coming back on Monday.”

Under the terms of the deal signed at midday Israel time (10am BST), the hostages must be released within 72 hours, however its unclear exactly when this will take place.

An Israeli official told Reuters that 20 hostages are expected to be released Sunday or Monday.Mr Trump, who signalled he planned to fly to the region as soon as this weekend, hailed the “historic and unprecedented event” as the first step towards peace in the Middle East.Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday expressed his “profound relief” for the hostages and for the population of Gaza who have “endured unimaginable suffering” and called on both sides to keep their promises.

The first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas has been signed, paving the way for nearly two years of war to end.

Nigel Farage hailed Donald Trump's “great achievement” in the Middle East.

The Reform UK leader, who has been a personal friend of Mr Trump for almost a decade, said: “Huge congratulations to President Trump and his team.

“Real progress between Israel and Hamas is a great achievement.”

Mr Farage opposed British recognition of Palestinian statehood last month and refused to rule out “de-recognising” Palestine.

The UK “stands ready to play our part” in implementing the Gaza peace plan, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said.

Britain will help realise not just the initial phase of the plan to end fighting in Gaza, she said, “but also on the crucial work going forward now on phase two as well”.

Speaking to reporters at Hillsborough Castle, she said: “Because that work will continue as nations across the world come together to support a just and lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

“We have seen some of the images of relief and hope on the streets of Gaza and on the streets of Israel overnight, and all nations will want to make sure that that is turned into reality.”

With Donald Trump's hostage deal announcement comes hope of a permanent end to the bloodshed in Gaza and agony in Israel. But many questions remain.

Can Hamas trust the US to prevent Israel restarting the war if they hand over all the hostages? Can they trust the IDF to withdraw in the agreed manner? And can Israel trust Hamas to disarm?

There are still ways this deal could fall through. Israeli negotiators are still working through the list of prisoners Hamas want released, which could include major terrorists with lots of Israeli blood on their hands.

There are also longer-term unresolved issues, including the disarmament and the IDF's withdrawal timetable from Gaza.

And yet, at this moment, battle-hardened Israeli troops are preparing to relinquish territory their colleagues died to capture only a few days ago.

Most ordinary Gazans and a majority of Israelis have craved peace for some time. It seems Mr Trump has now managed to convince the remainder that they want it too.

UN

Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, called for all hostages to be released “in a dignified manner” and for a permanent ceasefire to be secured. “The fighting must stop once and for all,” he said.

Palestine

Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, said he hoped that the deal “would be a prelude to reaching a permanent political solution”, leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

EU

Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, called the deal “a major diplomatic accomplishment”, which was “a real chance” to end the conflict and release the hostages.

Germany

Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor, said the developments were “encouraging” and he was “confident” of a solution this week.

Spain

Pedro Sanchez, Spain's prime minister and one of Europe's most vocal critics of Israel's offensive in Gaza, said the civilian population should now be supported and “the atrocities experienced... never repeated.”

France

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the agreement “must mark the end of the war” and would pave the way for a “political solution”.

Italy

Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, called the deal “extraordinary news” and urged “all parties ot respect the measures already agreed upon”. 

China

Beijing hopes for a “permanent and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, its foreign ministry said, adding that China's position is that Palestinians should govern the territory in the future. 

Israel's ultranationalist finance minister said he opposed the Gaza ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas and insisted he would vote against it. 

Bezalel Smotrich said: “There is immense fear of the consequences of emptying the prisons and releasing the next generation of terrorist leaders who will do everything to continue to pour rivers of Jewish blood here, God forbid.”

“For this reason alone, we cannot join in short-sighted celebrations or vote in favour of the deal,” he added. 

Mr Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist party, has opposed previous deals and insisted the war must continue until Hamas is annihilated.

Meanwhile, Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, welcomed the deal, calling on Donald Trump to speak at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.

“There is nothing more fitting, more symbolic, more moving than a speech by President Trump in Hostages Square with the return home of our hostages. It would be a historic moment. I congratulate the families on the initiative,” Mr Lapid tweeted. 

A Cabinet minister has insisted Gaza must be run by Palestinians in the long run.

Pat McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told Sky News that neither Hamas nor the Israeli government should be in charge of the region.

He told Sky News: “Israel will be clear that Hamas can't run Gaza in the future but it shouldn't be a permanent Israeli-run area either.

“So it has to be in the long term run by Palestinians. In the meantime something will be put together to stabilise, begin to get the rebuilding effort going, and in the long term run by the Palestinians themselves.“That's the exciting prospect here. And it's a prospect that hasn't existed in a long, long time.”

Israeli strikes on Gaza continued overnight and into the morning.

Smoke can be seen billowing above the war-shattered coastal enclave while both Gazans and Israelis celebrate the news that the first stage of a peace had been agreed.

As we reported earlier, a ceasefire is expected to come into effect after the deal is signed at 10am BST.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, expressed satisfaction Thursday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire in Gaza and thanked Donald Trump's efforts to end the war.

“I am greatly pleased that the Hamas-Israel talks... have resulted in a ceasefire in Gaza, I especially thank US President, Mr. Trump, who demonstrated the necessary political will to encourage the Israeli government toward the ceasefire,” Mr Erdogan said in a statement.

Turkey, which has been closely involved in the negotiations and sent a team to the talks in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, would “closely monitor the strict implementation of the agreement”, he added.

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Antifa violence in Left-wing cities, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a note.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly”.

A photographer captured the text with a long lens.

“Very close,” read the scrawl, those first two words underlined. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform.

The Israeli military said Thursday it was preparing to pull back troops in Gaza after Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal to free the remaining hostages.

“The IDF has begun operational preparations ahead of the implementation of the agreement. As part of this process, preparations and a combat protocol are underway to transition to adjusted deployment lines soon,” the military said in a statement.

If phase one of the deal is approved by the Israeli government today, a ceasefire would immediately take effect and Israeli troops would withdraw to an agreed upon line – what the IDF referred to as “adjusted deployment lines”.

A senior Cabinet minister said the British Government had “more hope this morning than we've had for a long time”.Pat McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told Times Radio: “We're very hopeful and I think that's a good word to use. If this holds and if this lasts it will be an enormous moment for the world.“It would mean in the short term that the hostages, those alive and those dead would be released, it would also hopefully mean much more aid getting into Gaza to help the people there and in the longer term and this is probably the greatest prize of all a more stable future for Israel for Palestine and for the whole region.“So of course people are tentative, people want to see exactly what will happen, but I think we've got more hope this morning than we've had for a long time.”Asked if Donald Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr McFadden replied: “Well he will deserve credit. Nobel Prizes are a matter for the Nobel committee but he will deserve credit.”

Israel's minister for diaspora affairs has expressed cautious optimism towards the deal. 

Amichai Chikli told The Telegraph: “We have to wait and learn the details. I still don't know what to think. Overall it looks good.”

Israel's security cabinet and government meetings to approve the first stage of the Gaza deal have been pushed back by two hours.

A source briefed on the details of the agreement told Reuters the meetings would take place at 5pm Israel time (3pm BST).

A ceasefire is expected to come into effect in Gaza once the first stage of the US-led peace deal is signed, a source briefed on the details said.

The signing should take place at 12pm Israel time (10am BST), the source told Reuters.

Israel's military will then finish its partial withdrawal from Gaza within the first 24 hours.

Palestinians living in Gaza expressed hope the deal between Israel and Hamas would end the war.

“All of the Gaza Strip is happy,” Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo told Reuters.

Another resident, Wael Radwan, credited Donald Trump and thanked “anyone who contributed even if verbally to stop the war and to stop the bloodshed”.

Khaled Shaa told Reuters it was an “historic” and “long-awaited” moment after years of bloodshed.

The Prime Minister has welcomed the news that Hamas and Israel agreed to the first stage of the peace plan. 

Sir Keir Starmer said it was “a moment of profound relief” that would be “felt all around the world” and particularly by “hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years”. 

“I am grateful for the tireless diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and the United States, supported by our regional partners, in securing this crucial first step,” Sir Keir said.

“This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza.

“We call on all parties to meet the commitments they have made, to end the war, and to build the foundations for a just and lasting end to the conflict and a sustainable path to a long-term peace. 

“The UK will support these crucial immediate steps and the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan.”

The IDF has told displaced Palestinians that it would be “extremely dangerous” to return to Gaza City.  

Avichay Adraee, the force's Arab spokesman, wrote on X: 

“The area north of Wadi Gaza [the river valley] is still considered a dangerous combat zone.

“IDF forces continue to surround Gaza City, and returning to it is extremely dangerous.

“For your own safety, refrain from returning north or approaching areas where IDF forces are deployed and operating throughout the Gaza Strip, including in the south and east, until official instructions are issued.”

Israeli soldiers have been told “to prepare with strong defence and to be ready for any scenario”.

“The forces' preparations will be carried out in accordance with the directives of the political echelon and the stages of the agreement, with responsibility and safeguarding the security of our soldiers,” the Israeli Defence Forces said in a statement.

“At the same time, the Chief of the General Staff instructed to prepare for leading the operation to retrieve the hostages, expected to be carried out with sensitivity and professionalism.”

It also said the IDF “will continue to act to achieve the war's objectives and to defend the citizens of the State of Israel on all fronts.”

Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, welcomed the peace deal announcement and called on all parties to “abide fully” by its terms.

“All hostages must be released in a dignified manner,” Mr Guterres said. 

“A permanent ceasefire must be secured. The fighting must stop once and for all.”

He stressed that the immediate and unimpeded entry of humanitarian supplies into the war-ravaged territory “must be ensured”.

The war in Gaza finally looks as if it is coming to an end.

Israel and Hamas agreed on terms for a ceasefire and the release of hostages last night, the first part of Donald Trump's 20 point plan for peace.In the 72 hours from the point at which the deal is formally signed – expected at around midday Thursday – all the surviving Israeli hostages held in Gaza, thought to number 20, should be released, together with the bodies of others who have perished.Israel will then start to release 250 convicted Palestinians held in Israeli jails, together with more than 1,000 others arrested and held since the Oct 7 massacre. At the same time Israeli troops will start to pull back.The agreement – of which this is just the first part – is a major breakthrough and one that Trump has every right to be proud of.It should almost immediately end the bloodshed in Gaza – which has been running to dozens of deaths a day – and see a return of hostages who have lived through hell.It should also allow aid to start flooding into the strip, bringing desperately needed relief to the two million people sheltering amid the rubble there; people who are desperate for food, water, and medicine.In the longer term, the deal should result in: a permanent end to the war, the disarmament of Hamas, the complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, the rebuilding of the enclave under Palestinian authority and – eventually – new talks on Palestinian “self-determination and statehood”.It is Trump's personal guarantee that Israel will not be allowed to continue the fighting after its hostages have been released that has made the difference.Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and other Arab states have clearly come to believe Trump's promise is genuine, and have seemingly convinced Hamas of that too.

Some of the relatives of the hostages held by Hamas in besieged Gaza are celebrating news that their loved ones could be returning home this week.

Maccabit Meir, whose nephews Gali and Ziv Berman have been in captivity since the Oct 7 2023 attacks on Israel, said “there is no happiness like this”.

“We were so afraid, and now I'm crying tears of happiness, not tears of fear,” she said in an interview with Israeli television.

Merav Gilboa-Dalal, the mother of hostage Guy Gilboa-Dalal, said her main concern was that her son would return healthy.

“That's what I wish for all of us,” she told Israeli media.

“And the experiences that they will have afterward will be amazing. Because we got him back again, a gift.”

It is believed that 20 of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza are alive. 

The White House posted on X: “ALL hostages to be released very soon!”

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had a “very warm and emotional” conversation with Donald Trump, his office said.

Mr Netanyahu also invited Mr Trump to address the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem.

During a phone call on Wednesday, the leaders discussed the signing of the peace deal and “congratulated each other on the historic achievement”.

“The prime minister thanked President Trump for all his efforts and global leadership, and President Trump congratulated the Prime Minister on his determined leadership and the actions he led,” Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement.

Donald Trump is reportedly planning to visit Israel on Sunday. 

Israeli TV station Channel 12 confirmed the president's travel plans shortly after the announcement that Hamas had agreed to the first phase of the peace deal . 

Earlier, the president said he would visit the Middle East. 

Under Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, Hamas would have to disarm, relinquish power and release its remaining hostages. 

You can read the full details, and the potential sticking points before a final peace deal can be struck, here.

Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed a “national and moral victory” for Israel after striking the “first phase” of a peace deal with Hamas.

The Israeli government will have to approve the agreement before Hamas releases its hostage, a US official told Axios.

“From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals are achieved,” Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement.

With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home. This is a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel.From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals…

“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point.

“I thank President Trump for his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages.”

A US official told Axios the first hostages would be released “72 hours” after the Israeli cabinet approves the Hamas deal.

With Benjamin Netanyahu convening his government on Thursday, it suggests the first hostage handover will not take place until Sunday at the earliest.

“The release is expected to happen by Monday,” the source added.

Donald Trump reportedly reviewed his Truth Social post announcing the agreement between Hamas and Israeli with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, before publishing it.

According to CNN, the US president had been on the phone in the Oval Office since he cut short a roundtable elsewhere in the White House earlier on Wednesday.

When it came, the announcement could not have been a better illustration of how this White House works.

The news was delivered not with a press conference or a sombre Oval Office address. It was done with a post on the president's own Truth Social media platform.

And not just that. It was a post that had been trailed on live television. An AP photographer caught the text of a note handed to the president by Marco Rubio, Secretary of State.

“You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”

Hamas has called on Donald Trump to ensure Israel enacts their agreement without delay.

The terror group said the US president and other mediating countries, in Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, should compel it to “fully implement the agreement's requirements and not allow it to evade or delay the implementation of what has been agreed upon”.

Hamas said it agreed to the “first phase” proposal to end “the war of extermination against our Palestinian people and the occupation's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip”.

Benjamin Netanyahu, hailing a “great deal for Israel”, has said he will summon his government to approve the deal with Hamas on Thursday.

“Tomorrow I will convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home,” the Israeli prime minister wrote on social media.

“I thank the heroic soldiers of the IDF and all the security forces, thanks to whose courage and sacrifice we have reached this day.”

He also praised “from the depths of my heart” Donald Trump and his team for embarking on “this sacred mission of releasing our hostages”.

“With the help of the Almighty, together we will continue to achieve all our goals and expand peace with our neighbours,” he continued.

Some issues still appear to be unresolved following the US president's announcement that Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his 20-point peace plan.

Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the agreement signalled “the first steps towards a strong, durable and everlasting peace”.

However, some thorny issues remain.

Hamas has previously said it won't disarm until a Palestinian state is recognised, and the terror group will be reluctant to disarm until a clearer picture of an independent Gaza emerges, if at all.

The governance of the region is also a sticking point. Mr Trump's plan said an independent Palestinian police force would oversee the region, helped by the president's International Stabilisation Force (ISF).

Not only will this be arduous, it's not clear if all sides will agree.

In the plan, Hamas will “agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form”.

Yet when responding, the group said that Mr Trump's plans for the future of the Strip could only be discussed by a “comprehensive Palestinian national framework” that should include the group.

Israeli hostages will be released on either Saturday or Sunday, a source has told CNN. Earlier on Wednesday, Donald Trump suggested he would travel to the Middle East on Sunday.

Details about the agreement struck between Hamas and Israel will be revealed later, a senior Qatari official has said.

Majed al-Ansari, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, said: “An agreement was reached on all the provisions and implementation mechanisms of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.”

“The details will be announced later,” he added.

In his statement announcing Israel and Hamas' “first steps” towards peace, Donald Trump did not clarify potential sticking points in his proposed peace plan, which include Hamas disarming and leaving power.

Negotiators have been meeting in Egypt for days to hash out Donald Trump's peace plan.

Wednesday began with leaks that Hamas was making difficult demands, including the return of the bodies of symbolic figures such as Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed, both former leaders of the terror group.

But by nightfall, the Times of Israel reported Arab sources as saying that mediators were planning an agreement that would entail an “immediate” release of hostages.

Wednesday's announcement by President Donald Trump marks a major step towards peace in Gaza. It represents a breakthrough on the path towards Mr Trump's ambitious but deliberately vague 20-point plan to end decades of unrest.

It will bring home the hostages in exchange for prisoner releases.

But in so doing it uncouples one of the key elements of the plan, linking together an immediate ceasefire with a plan for stabilising and rebuilding Gaza, and creating conditions that could open a path towards a Palestinian state.

Already Hamas has called for international guarantees to hold Israel to its part of the deal.

This is A deal, and should be celebrated. But it is far from THE deal.

Donald Trump has hailed the “first step” towards peace in the Middle East following negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week. Saying Hamas would release all of its Israeli hostages, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform:

Israeli forces have agreed to withdraw troops to an agreed upon line, Donald Trump has said.

In Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, a map showed lines that forces were expected to retreat to at various stages.

The first withdrawal, along with a hostage release, is depicted in purple.

It would mean the IDF withdrawing from Gaza City and other key strongholds, where Hamas is under heavy assault.

Donald Trump, assuming the role of peace-maker-in-chief, was the first to announce the breakthrough.

“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Earlier, Marco Rubio handed a note to the US president during a press conference asking him to urgently approve the social post so he could be the first to announce the deal.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce the deal first,” the note read.

On Wednesday, the US president said that he is considering travelling to the Middle East.

Mr Trump said: “I think I'll probably go maybe before the hostages are released, or shortly thereafter, pretty much, shortly thereafter.”

We're bringing you the latest updates after Donald Trump announced Hamas and Israel have signed off on the “first phase” of a deal for peace in Gaza.

Before the Spanish study, some scientists had been sceptical about the mammals attacking migratory birds

Bats are generally viewed as harmless, if spooky, creatures of the night. But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe's largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight.

The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude.

“It's fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.”

Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence.

In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southern Spain and fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful.

This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It's night-time, the bird can't see it coming, it can't hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.”

On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat's wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude.

“From a human perspective, I didn't feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn't doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.”

Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats' hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight.

Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.”

The findings are published in the journal Science.

Live Updates


            • Israel's security cabinet is meeting to vote on the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire plan, to be followed by a full cabinet vote. The deal between Israel and Hamas would allow for the release of all hostages in Gaza, Israeli withdrawal to an agreed point and the release of some Palestinian prisoners.
    


            • A ceasefire will take effect immediately following the Israeli government's approval, according to officials. A senior Hamas official said a “formal declaration” ending the war in Gaza must be made before hostages are released.
    


            • US President Donald Trump said the hostages are likely to be released early next week, and he is still aiming to travel to the region soon.
    


            • The plan has been met with both celebration and cautious optimism in Gaza and Israel. Potential sticking points remain, including Hamas disarmament and the governance of Gaza.
    


            President Donald Trump projected optimism that outstanding issues not covered by phase one of his Gaza ceasefire agreement will be sorted out, even as he declined to take a position on an eventual Palestinian state and acknowledged Hamas may not be able to produce all the bodies of deceased hostages.
    


            “There will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there will be a lot of things happening,” he said, referring to arrangements that would force Hamas to give up its weapons and Israel's military to pull back further inside Gaza.
    


            “I think it will take place, and I think you can end up with peace in the Middle East, but we have to get our hostages back. And we weren't going to do it at the end. We're going to do it at the beginning,” he went on, explaining the sequencing of the plan.
    


            Trump stopped short of saying Palestinians would be allowed to remain inside Gaza, suggesting instead his plans included rebuilding the enclave into a livable area.
    


            “We're going to create something where people can live. You can't live right now in Gaza,” he said.
    


            And he said he would go along with whatever is agreed to on a Palestinian state, declining to endorse an eventual two-state solution.
    


            When asked about Hamas's ability to locate all bodies of the deceased hostages, Trump conceded that some “are going to be a little bit hard to find.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's presentation to Arab leaders at the United Nations General Assembly last month was a key turning point in efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
    


            Rubio credited Trump's “close relationships” with the regional leaders that were “forged” during his trip to the Middle East earlier this year, but said the UN meeting turned the tide.
    


                    “You convened a historic meeting, not simply of Arab countries, but of Muslim-majority countries from around the world — including Indonesia was there, Pakistan was there — and created this coalition behind this plan,” Rubio said in highly laudatory remarks at a Cabinet meeting today.
                





            “Then on that following Monday, you met with the Prime Minister of Israel here, and that plan was presented. And then, of course, our great negotiating team followed up on it,” he said.
    


            Rubio said Trump “had some extraordinary phone calls and meetings that required a high degree of intensity and commitment, and made this happen.” He did not say with whom the phone calls and meetings were held.
    


            Rubio also commended Special Envoy Steve Wiktoff and Jared Kushner.
    


            “They're an incredible team working together, facing some substantial impediments to even being there this weekend and doing it,” he said.
    


            Nepal is calling for the release of the hostages held in Gaza, including Nepali national Bipin Joshi, under the first phase of a ceasefire plan.
    


            “We call for the immediate release of all hostages, including Nepali national Bipin Joshi, who has been held by Hamas since 7 October 2023,” Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.
    


            Joshi's father, Mahananda Joshi, told CNN that he was “hopeful” for his son following news of the plan.
    


            Joshi was a student working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped on October 7.
    


            Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs voiced appreciation for mediators in negotiating a plan to release the hostages and called for its implementation.
    


            “We urge all parties concerned to implement the plan in its true spirit, to ensure the smooth flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza, and to pave the way for lasting peace in the region and beyond,” the ministry said on X.
    


            We are hearing more from Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who congratulated President Donald Trump on his “tireless efforts” to bring an end to the war in Gaza, after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire plan drafted by US officials.
    


            The Egyptian president expressed “deep appreciation” for his US counterpart in a statement today, complimenting Trump's “keenness, endeavors, and sincere efforts towards peace.”
    


            El-Sisi reiterated that Trump “therefore deserves to receive the Nobel Peace Prize,” echoing the US president's open ambition to win the highly coveted award.
    


                    “The President stressed the need to proceed with implementing the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip in all its stages, emphasizing the importance of President Trump's support and sponsorship of its implementation,” the statement from el-Sisi's office said.
                





            El-Sisi hosted three days of talks between Israel and Hamas — brokered by US, Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish officials — in a diplomatic squeeze that saw all parties make a promising step toward a permanent end to two years of hostilities.
    


            Substantive discussions have not yet begun over what comes next for the war-torn Gaza Strip, with all eyes on the implementation of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, an Israeli official and another regional source told CNN.
    


            The negotiators in Egypt this week set up committees on multiple tracks to tackle the next steps in the overall plan, the regional source said. But active discussions on those topics — including the complicated issues of disarming Hamas and putting a governing body into place in Gaza — will begin after the first phase of the deal, with the hostage release taking place in the coming days, the source added.
    


Remember: The 20-point proposal for a comprehensive end to the Gaza conflict, which President Donald Trump laid out in recent weeks, includes a specific reference to a Palestinian committee, overseen by an international body and dubbed the “Board of Peace.” It will run Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is ready to take over, according to the plan. The proposal recognizes the aspiration for a Palestinian state and tries to present a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza.
    


            The plan also says that the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip will “proceed without interference from the two parties.” Humanitarian officials who have been involved in overseeing the distribution of such aid say that they have been preparing for a potential surge into Gaza, given the plan that Trump laid out, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. But they do not know when that surge will begin, they said.
    


            The head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom said the emerging Gaza ceasefire deal is a welcome “first step” for Palestinians but questioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to fully end the war.
    


                    “Netanyahu is simply maneuvering and he's just waiting for another opportunity for a loophole somewhere to come back to this. I don't see him taking a decision to end the entire war and to withdraw his forces,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot told CNN's Becky Anderson.
                





            “And that's why we want to make sure that while we take that deep sigh of relief, we also keep that pressure, that work to make sure that we keep going in the direction of ending the whole war,” he added, arguing that the driver of that pressure must be US President Donald Trump.
    


            Zomlot is a senior member of Fatah, the main Palestinian political movement rivalling Hamas, and a strategic adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
    


            Pressed repeatedly on whether he believes Hamas will fully disarm and have no role in Gaza, a key stipulation of Trump's 20-point plan for a comprehensive peace, Zomlot signaled Hamas accepted those terms.
    


            “My understanding is that Hamas accepted long ago and confirmed in that agreement that they will have no role in the governance in Gaza,” he said.
    


            Zomlot voiced support for reforming the Palestinian Authority, as laid out in Trump's plan, describing it as a grassroots Palestinian demand.
    


            Palestinians in Gaza were pictured celebrating a potential ceasefire in the enclave on Thursday, while others spoke to CNN about the bittersweet prospect of peace after two y﻿ears of brutal war.
    


            A small group of Palestinians in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp danced and sang on Thursday, while waving Palestinian flags. One man held aloft a cardboard key, a common symbol for Palestinian refugees, many of whom still hold the keys to the homes their ancestors left behind when Israel expelled them in 1948.
    


                    “I feel joy,” Nour al-Din Toutah told CNN. Originally from Zeitoun, he was displaced to Deir al-Balah over the course of the war. “Two years of torment and repression, displacement and lack of food and water. Now, I am happy that the war will stop.”
                





            “True, there are no houses left,” Toutah continued. “but we will put up new tents and continue our lives.”
    


            Humam al-Hattab said that the joy in Gaza at the news that the killing may finally end is “indescribable,” but compared the looming task Palestinians face in rebuilding their lives to another war.
    


                    “My feeling is joy mixed with great pain,” al-Hattab said, “As a Palestinian I will certainly be happy at the end of the war – but the end of the war is the start of other wars: the war of reconstruction and the attempt to return to their areas, repairing homes and restoring them to what they were before the war, the war of reopening schools and the war of restoring hospitals that the occupation destroyed.”
                





            President Donald Trump pointed to the importance of strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as he praised how countries came together to work on a ceasefire deal in Gaza.
    


            “I think the attack was very important on Iran, because let's say that didn't happen, they'd probably, by now, have a nuclear weapon, numerous nuclear weapons, and therefore, even if we signed a deal, there'd be a big dark cloud over it, and it wouldn't be the same thing,” Trump said, during his Cabinet meeting on Thursday.
    


            Israel first struck Iran's nuclear facilities on June 13. That same month, the US attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, leaving them “severely damaged.”



                    “So Iran is different, but Iran wants to work on peace,” Trump continued. “Now they've informed us, and they've acknowledged that they are totally in favor of this deal. They think it's a great thing, so we appreciate that, and we'll work with Iran,” Trump said.
                





            He added that he'd like to see Iran rebuild its country, but that it can't have nuclear power.
    


            The son of Amiram Cooper, an 85-year-old Israeli hostage who the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said was killed in captivity, said he is “extremely encouraged” by the potential release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza under the terms of a ceasefire deal.
    


            Cooper was abducted with his wife Nurit from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Nurit was released in October 2023. In June 2024, the IDF informed the families of Cooper and three other hostages that they had died.
    


            His son Rotem Cooper said today that he is appreciative of the “tremendous effort” to release the hostages who remain in Gaza, including his father's body.
    


            He told CNN's Becky Anderson that he has “mixed feelings.”
    


                    “I felt that the Israeli government failed to bring about his release when it was still relevant for him,” Rotem Cooper said. “But we try to put that aside today because really it was even hard to imagine this day, just a week or two ago.”
                





            “We're going to get all our loved ones, and we got our soldiers back, and we're looking forward for a better future,” he said in a video released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
    


            US President Donald Trump has indicated that the hostages still held in Gaza are likely to be released Monday or Tuesday.
    


            A detailed plan of how the deal should unfold has not been released, but as things stand, here is what we know about the timing:
    


Israeli cabinet approval: A ceasefire will begin immediately if the Israeli government approves the first phase of the plan to end the war in Gaza. That decision is expected later today.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN that the security cabinet has begun meeting to vote on the ceasefire agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is then expected to chair a full government meeting to approve it.
    


What happens next: When the ceasefire begins, Israeli troops will pull back to the agreed lines. The clock will also start ticking on a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli high court.
    


            This window is mandated by Israeli law — although it was shortened during the last ceasefire in January.
    


Hostage release: Once this objection window closes, a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release the hostages will begin. According to an official Israeli source, the assumption is that hostages will be released before the 72 hours pass.
    


            Under the plan, all the living hostages — believed to number at least 20 — are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period.
    


            This means that if the Israeli government indeed approves the plan on Thursday, the hostages should be back in Israel by Sunday evening or on Monday.
    


            US President Donald Trump said the remaining hostages held by Hamas will be released from Gaza on Monday or Tuesday next week, and that he is still aiming to travel to the region to mark the occasion.
    


            “I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace. Peace in the Middle East,” he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday.
    


                    “We secured the release of all of the remaining hostages, and they should be released on Monday or Tuesday,” he added. “Getting them is a complicated process. I'd rather not tell you what they have to do to get them. There are places you don't want to be. But we are getting the hostages back on Tuesday — Monday or Tuesday — and that'll be a day of joy.”
                





            Trump said he would “try and make a trip over” to mark the moment, including a stop in Egypt for an “official signing” to mark the agreement.
    


            US President Donald Trump announced Israel and Hamas have resolved the first phase of a 20-point peace plan, in a propulsive step toward a permanent end to two years of hostilities.
    


            Murmurs of cautious celebration permeated through Gaza and Israel overnight. Dark gray smoke cascaded over parts of the enclave and Israeli tanks opened fire earlier today, according to Palestinian officials, despite Trump's demands for an end to the bombing.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            As Palestinians begin to imagine life after war, the reality of the destruction left in its wake is difficult to shake. We heard from displaced residents in Gaza who told us what they anticipate for the coming days and weeks:
    


Abu Mohammad Abu Yassin from Jabalia camp:



                    “We are happy about the truce, but I will not return to the north. I returned before and saw what happened. The ruler and the executioner are the same side. They bomb us and they rule us.”
                





                    “My son was nine years old sitting in the street when a shard struck his eye and he lost his eye.”
                





                    “We will feel the effects of the war after the ceasefire. We will sit in a tent and lament our homes that were destroyed. We will remember our friends and relatives who were martyred, our brothers and neighbors who died.”
                





Ali Aref Abu Ouda from Beit Hanoun:



                    “I could fly with joy. I will go to my home and put up a tent.”
                





                    “If we return, what will we find? No house, nothing. We do not know what we will do after the war.”
                





                    “There are no houses, no schools, no universities, nothing remains.”

            President Donald Trump's negotiating delegation of special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have arrived in Israel after participating in negotiations Wednesday in Egypt, two sources familiar with the matter said.
    


            Earlier Thursday they met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
    


            Trump has discussed visiting Israel and Egypt as soon as this weekend as the ceasefire-for-hostages deal comes into effect.
    


            Iran said it supports any effort to end the “genocidal war” in Gaza following the announcement of a US-brokered ceasefire, while calling on the international community to ensure that Israel fulfils its obligations in the agreement.
    


                    “The Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently supported every measure and initiative aimed at halting the genocidal war, ensuring the withdrawal of occupying forces, enabling the entry of humanitarian assistance, securing the release of Palestinian prisoners, and realizing the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people,” Iran's foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X today.
                





            The ministry added that it “underscores the responsibility of the international community” to ensure Israel does not breach its obligations.
    


            The longstanding enmity between Iran and Israel deepened following Hamas' attacks of October 7, 2023, and Israel's subsequent war on Gaza.
    


            Earlier this year, the two countries fought in a 12-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire announced by US President Donald Trump.
    


            Hamas and Israeli delegates were positioned in two different rooms during the ceasefire talks in Sharm El-Sheikh yesterday, a senior Hamas official said.
    


            The official told CNN the militant group did not directly meet with the Israeli delegation during the negotiations.
    


            United States special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo today after an agreement was reached for the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire.
    


            El-Sisi called for a ceasefire to begin immediately in Gaza, according to a statement by the spokesperson for the Egyptian presidency.
    


            Egypt told the American officials that it will continue working with the US and mediators to “implement what has been agreed upon sincerely and responsibly, including a ceasefire, the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages and prisoners.”
    


            The agreement reached with Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza “marks the beginning of a complete end to the brutal war against the Gaza Strip,” according to Hamas' spokesperson in the enclave.
    


            “There are certainly guarantees for Hamas that the war will not return after the exchange process is completed, and we also heard the American president speak directly, publicly, and clearly on this matter,” Hazem Qassem told CNN today.
    


                    Qassem said Hamas appreciated the efforts of the US administration and President Donald Trump, “and Hamas will implement all that is included in the agreement to ensure a full and lasting ceasefire.”
                





            “We as Hamas expressed our thanks to President Trump for helping reach this agreement. President Trump was keen to end the war on the Gaza Strip, and we call on him once again to continue pressuring the occupation to fully implement all terms of the agreement,” Qassem said.
    


            There had been adjustments to a map on the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops “to enable the resistance to carry out a full exchange operation for all prisoners, whether the bodies of the dead or those who are alive,” he added.
    


            It's unclear whether Israel has accepted those adjustments.
    


            Qassem also claimed that Israel was disputing the list of 250 Palestinian prisoners scheduled to be released as part of the first phase of the deal.
    


            “The occupation is attempting to manipulate the list of (Palestinian) prisoners that the resistance handed over for release,” Qassem said.
    


            “Pressure is needed to ensure full implementation of the agreement so that a comprehensive exchange process can be achieved,” he added.
    


            An Israeli security cabinet meeting has begun to vote on the first phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, an Israeli official told CNN.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to chair a full government meeting to approve the plan later, CNN has reported.
    


            An AP photographer zoomed in on the note Secretary of State Marco Rubio handed President Donald Trump mid-meeting, which revealed  a message asking the president to rush the announcement of Gaza deal.
    


            At the top of the note it says, “very close,” and then has written that officials need Trump to approve a Truth Social Post.

“My greatest wish now is for real safety to return — for no more people to die here,” one Palestinian said.

Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal to bring about a temporary pause to Israel's genocidal slaughter in Gaza and the release of Israeli and Palestinian captives, officials have announced.

The deal was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social Wednesday evening, after he first unveiled a heavily criticized 20-point plan to “end the Gaza Conflict” last week. Both the Israeli government and Hamas have confirmed that they agreed to the deal.

Palestinians rejoiced upon the announcement of the news. Videos posted online showed Palestinians celebrating in the streets and children dancing in reaction, celebrating a rare moment of relief amid two years of genocide.

Truthout contacted several of its regular contributors from Gaza to gather their reactions to the announcement.

“Here in the middle of the Gaza Strip, where I live among many displaced families, the atmosphere today feels different. Since morning, children have been running through the streets, smiling and celebrating. We heard fireworks bursting across the neighborhood in joy,” Ghada Eyad told Truthout.

“Prices are starting to drop, and everyone hopes the deal will succeed. Our only fear is that Israel will not honor the agreement, as happened before. My greatest wish now is for real safety to return — for no more people to die here. We deserve security, hope, health, education, and the simple right to live with dignity,” Eyad said.

Exact details of the deal are unclear. However, it is slated to include the release of all 20 living Israeli captives, in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Hamas and associated factions would release Israeli captives within 72 hours of the agreement beginning.

Israeli forces are supposed to conduct a partial withdrawal from the territory after the captive swap is complete. After that, Israel would still control 53 percent of the Strip, according to Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian. 

Under the deal, Israel will also open several crossings for the entry of 400 trucks of humanitarian aid on the first day, and 600 trucks daily after. This operation would be overseen by international aid organizations, not the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a Hamas official has said.

According to Israeli sources, per Al Jazeera, the ceasefire is slated to go into effect within 24 hours after the Israeli cabinet ratifies the agreement. That vote is supposed to take place Thursday evening. Though Trump's plan calls for an end to the hostilities, there are not yet reports of what happens past the first phase.

As they celebrated, Palestinians also noted that Israel did not let up on its bombing even as the deal was announced. Video footage captured by Al Jazeera showed Israeli tanks firing at Palestinians trying to return to Gaza City, where Israel has been conducting a ground invasion. 

Many were skeptical that Israel would adhere to the deal, given Israel's history of breaking ceasefire agreements — including its unilateral ending of the ceasefire deal earlier this year, after its first phase was complete. Indeed, despite Trump's plan giving huge leeway to Israel, certain Israeli demands like disarming Hamas were omitted.

“Ceasefire might not retain Gaza to what it was once; [a] flourishing city, nor could it retain the loved ones we lost, not erase our bloodcurdling memories, nor mitigate our unspoken grief, but it will at least stop the carnage, it will pause the horrors and terrors, it will give us a chance to breathe amid endless tragedies, it will give us a chance to grieve properly,” writer and medical student Hend Salama Abo Helow told Truthout.

“I wish it will lead to a permanent peace for Gaza,” she said.

“After two years of genocide, relentless bombardment, and a life stripped down to survival, this moment feels unreal — like breathing for the first time after being underwater for too long,” Taqwa Ahmed Al-Wawi, writer and student at the Islamic University of Gaza, told Truthout. “We are overwhelmed — joy and sorrow intertwined. Happiness that the bombing has stopped, even for a moment, and sadness for everyone who is not here to witness it.” 

“Still, beneath the relief, there's fear — fear that this fragile calm could break again, that the sky could once more turn against us. But for now, we breathe,” Al-Wawi went on. “We have endured what no one should ever endure. And yet, Gaza sat'eesh — Gaza will live. She always does.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Serbia provided financial humanitarian aid worth 472 million rubles ($5.8 million) to Russia's war-affected Kursk Oblast, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 9.

While Moscow framed the assistance as "centuries-old brotherhood" and praised "the close ties between our countries and peoples," the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.

Ukraine launched the unprecedented offensive into the Russian border in August 2024, taking Russia by surprise and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) in the first few months.

The operation was designed to divert Russian troops from the front in eastern Ukraine and to disrupt Russia's alleged plans to invade Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region bordering Kursk Oblast. 

Bolstered by 12,000 North Korean troops, Russia counterattacked this spring, regaining most of the lost territory and advancing into border areas of Sumy Oblast. 

According to Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russia has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and injured during the Kursk operation as of July 2025.

Russia also continues to use Kursk Oblast to launch regular drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The Serbian funds were transferred to the Kursk Oblast Development Fund on Oct. 8, the foreign ministry said.

Belgrade has yet to comment on the statement. 

The news comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding Serbia's role in the war. 

In May, Russian intelligence accused Serbia of supplying weapons to Ukraine — a claim the Balkan country has denied.

A 2024 Financial Times investigation found that Serbian ammunition had reached Ukraine via third-party intermediaries, albeit on both sides of the war.

While Belgrade has maintained humanitarian assistance to Kyiv and pledged support for post-war reconstruction, it has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, despite being a formal EU candidate since 2012.

Serbia's largest Russian-owned oil company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), announced on Oct. 9 that it had not received an extension of its U.S. sanctions waiver, Reuters reported.

While Moscow framed the assistance as "centuries-old brotherhood" and praised "the close ties between our countries and peoples," the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.





Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said three drones were shot down in the Matveyev-Kurgan district by air defense systems. 

The resolution passed with 469 votes in favor, 97 against, and 38 abstentions, according to an official statement on the parliament's website.

The Kyiv Independent team has introduced a long-requested feature — members can now pay for monthly or annual memberships using PayPal.

The call comes as Kyiv worries that a Babis-led government could undermine Czechia's pro-Ukraine stance, as he has questioned continued military aid and Ukraine's path toward EU membership.



Putin claimed that the missiles exploded a few meters away from the plane, which was then hit by fragments. He linked the incident to the sighting of a Ukrainian drone in the area.

"There is a significant risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will actually go to a world war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The Kyiv Independent is proud to announce the U.S. premiere of its first full-length documentary, “Can You Hear Me? The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics,” hosted in collaboration with the Embassies of Sweden and Ukraine.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) denied on Oct. 9 media reporting suggesting it was investigating a possible involvement of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko in a criminal case.

According to four NATO officials, the goal is to raise the cost of Moscow's gray-zone operations and strengthen deterrence following a series of incursions by Russian drones and aircraft, the Financial Times reported.

            A French court on Thursday rejected the appeal of a former construction worker found guilty last year of the aggravated rape of Gisele Pelicot, and increased his prison sentence by a year to 10 years, France Info reported.
    


            A lawyer for Husamettin Dogan did not respond to a request for comment on her client's failed appeal.
    


            Pelicot returned to court this week to face the only man, out of 51, who appealed his guilty verdict.
    


            Her husband, Dominique Pelicot, drugged her over nearly a decade, recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious.
    


            Gisele Pelicot, 72, emerged as a prominent feminist figure in France and abroad after waiving her right to anonymity and testifying against her alleged abusers in court — a move that turned the trial into a broader reckoning over the prevalence of sexual violence.

Interestingly, it was US President Theodore Roosevelt who helped popularize these tales. He famously called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world,” which cemented their fearsome reputation. However, piranhas are not as violent as Roosevelt's account, Hollywood movies, and adventure novels portray them.
  Far from being ruthless killers, piranhas typically feed on worms, insects, small fish, and plants, helping maintain healthy river ecosystems. However, during the dry season, when water levels are low and food is scarce, they

“Piranhas” may make great material for horror and adventure stories, but in reality, they rarely attack humans. While people fear piranhas, it is often humans who pose a greater threat to them through overfishing, pollution, and habitat disruption.
  In many parts of the Amazon, piranhas have long been a common food source and are often grilled or cooked in soup. Their razor-sharp, triangular teeth are also used by locals to make tools for cutting and carving. These teeth are tightly packed, interlock like a saw blade, and are strong enough to remain useful even after the fish

A majority of voters, 58 percent, said presidents should only send military forces to cities that face external threats.

Two sets of recent polling data demonstrate that Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's actions in office so far — particularly his mobilization of the National Guard in U.S. cities.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Wednesday found that Americans largely disapprove of troops being deployed to U.S. cities when there isn't an external threat. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans, 58 percent, said the president should only deploy troops to areas of the country facing an external threat, while fewer than 3 in 10 Americans, 25 percent, disagreed with that sentiment.

A plurality of respondents, 48 percent, said they were opposed to a president sending troops to a state if the governor of that state disapproves of such an action. Only 37 percent said a president should be allowed to send troops to a state without the governor's consent.

Shortly before the poll was conducted, Trump told a meeting of hundreds of generals and admirals that they should prepare to face off with an “enemy within,” a phrase he's frequently used to describe people with left-leaning views. 

The poll comes as Trump is attempting to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois. In Portland, a federal judge has placed a temporary hold on Trump's attempts to mobilize troops; a different federal judge is allowing National Guard troops to be deployed to Chicago pending an upcoming hearing on the matter.

Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if judges further block his orders to send National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities across the U.S. He has also threatened governors and municipal leaders who challenge his actions, saying they should be “in jail” for refusing to cooperate with his plans to militarize their cities.

Another poll published this week, conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, shows that most American voters disagree with a number of controversial actions the president has taken since being sworn in nearly nine months ago. 

Trump received a net-negative approval rating on several issues, including the economy (-9 point approval rating), his management of the government (-10 points), trade with foreign nations (-9 points), and immigration (-6 points). On the issue of crime, 48 percent of voters said they approve of his actions while 47 percent said they disapprove — a figure that demonstrates a stark split among voters, and that is within the poll's margin of error.

Trump's overall approval rating is -11 points, with 43 percent approving of his performance as president and 54 percent expressing disapproval. 

A large segment of respondents said Trump has gone “too far” on numerous matters, including immigration enforcement (51 percent), sending the National Guard to U.S. cities (53 percent), coercing corporations into supporting his far right agenda (50 percent), and pressuring colleges (49 percent). On the matter of Trump threatening to revoke the licenses of TV stations if they don't fire on-air personalities he dislikes, an overwhelming 77 percent of respondents were opposed, while only 12 percent were in support.

Alarmingly, a majority of voters seem to recognize that Trump is governing in an authoritarian manner. When asked whether he has cleaned up “chaos” and “disorder” or created it, only 42 percent said he's cleaned things up, while 53 percent said he's been creating chaos and disorder, the poll found. 

It's no wonder, then, that nearly 6 in 10 voters (58 percent) feel the country is heading in the “wrong direction,” according to the poll, while only 36 percent believe we're on the “right track.”

Professor Mark Bray, author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” says he has received death threats.

The Rutgers teachers' unions are standing in solidarity with History Professor Mark Bray, who has been targeted by Turning Point USA's student chapter at Rutgers.

The group has falsely claimed that Bray, the author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook is “a prominent leader of the antifa movement on campus,” and launched a campaign to have him fired. “Antifa,” which is short for antifascist, is a frequent target of President Donald Trump and others on the extreme right. As Holly Baxter wrote in The Independent:

Antifa isn't real — at least, not in the way one convenes a roundtable. It has no central command structure, no coherent leadership, no membership rolls, no headquarters. It is a loose ideological umbrella — a term that is sometimes used by disparate activists and local groups, but much more frequently by the far right than by the supposed lefties who are part of it.

Bray says he has received death threats, and that he and his partner, Yesenia Barragan, also a Rutgers professor, are temporarily relocating to Europe because they fear for their family's safety.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

On Wednesday, Rutgers AAUP-AFT and the Rutgers Adjunct Faculty Union issued a joint statement calling on the administration, students, and staff to publicly support Bray. A petition, unaffiliated with the unions, is also circulating asking the Rutgers administration to disband the Turning Point student chapter. So far, the petition has close to 2,000 signatures. (Disclosure: The author signed the petition and has taught at Rutgers.)

“Silence in the face of these assaults will only embolden the far right,” the unions said. “With that in mind, the Rutgers faculty unions reject Turning Point USA's smear campaigns and proudly stand with our colleagues Dr. Mark Bray and Dr. Yesenia Barragan.”

They continued: “Turning Point's attack is part of an escalating effort by the far right to suppress the speech, teaching, and scholarship of faculty who do not conform to their movement's politics.”

Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last month, founded Turning Point USA, an extremist right-wing group in 2012. A close ally of President Trump, Kirk frequently made racist, sexist, and anti-trans statements, and mocked the Palestinian victims of Israel's genocide in Gaza.

In 2016, Kirk's organization created a “Professor Watchlist,” of, the group says, “professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.”

Twenty-two Rutgers professors are currently on the Turning Point Watchlist, which is available online.

People can submit tips to the site via a website form that requests the professor's name, university, and an explanation of how they are “biased.”

It asks tipsters to “select all that apply to the professor,” above a list that includes, Anti-Law Enforcement, Anti-Second Amendment, Antisemitic, Climate Alarmist, Foreign Influence, Socialism, Identity Politics, and Riots and Violence. “Antisemitic” is also included on the list, which is likely code for pro-Palestine. Those who support Israel's genocide use baseless accusations of antisemitism to attack pro-Palestine, anti-genocide activists.

Professors on the list say they've been harassed and received death threats.

“For weeks my inbox and voicemail were deluged. Mostly white men spat venom through the phone: ‘bitch,' ‘c*nt,' ‘n****r,'” Howard University Professor Stacey Patton posted on Facebook after Kirk's death.

She was placed on the Watchlist in 2024.

“They threatened all manner of violence,” she continued.

Kirk's Watchlist has “terrorized” professors “who challenged white supremacy, gun culture, or Christian nationalism,” she wrote.

“Kirk sent the loud message to us: speak the truth and we will unleash the mob!”

Can the US and South Korea's tenuous alliance survive Trump's tariffs and ICE's raid on a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia?

Zip ties. Helicopters. Crowded cells. Guns trained on bewildered workers. Foul water. Forced vaccinations. An unconscious detainee left on the floor by negligent guards. A pregnant woman in handcuffs. A detainee being called “Rocket Man” (Donald Trump's nickname for Kim Jong Un) by sneering federal agents. A menstruating woman forced to attend to her period with only toilet paper.

These are the details of 316 South Korean nationals' experiences in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that have flooded the country's media in the weeks after the September 4 raid on a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. A wave of fury is now pouring forth from across South Korean society — and the political consequences are only just beginning.

There is far more at stake than a single factory in Georgia, which by itself represented 8,500 jobs and $4.3 billion in investment, and is just one of 23 plants being built across the U.S. by Korean conglomerates. Since the raid, the U.S. and South Korea have announced that Korean workers will be able to use B-1 visas and ESTA visa waivers to continue working in the U.S. A new bill in Congress, the Partner with Korea Act, also seeks to extend 15,000 professional E-4 visas to South Koreans for the first time.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

But U.S. flexibility on immigration is not all that matters. Seoul and Washington have yet to finalize their trade deal instigated by Trump's threat to impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on South Korean goods. At the current stage of negotiations, South Korea has agreed to accept a 15 percent tariff on its exports and provide tremendous investments and other financial agreements: $350 billion in state-backed short-term investment, $150 billion in private sector contracts with U.S. corporations, and a guarantee to purchase $100 billion in U.S. liquid natural gas. Despite so much on the table, a written agreement has yet to be produced, and negotiations are proving tense as the Trump administration presses for Seoul to provide the lion's share of its $350 billion commitment in cash. While some of the shock over the ICE raid has died down, Washington's conduct over the course of months of negotiations has also raised deeper questions in South Korea about the real nature of the alliance — and whether this is a relationship that can last.

The anger unleashed by ICE's abuse of Korean workers has been building for some time. Trump's tariff threats, announced in March, hit South Korea at a difficult time, when the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was unresolved, and the country was reeling from years of flagging economic performance.

The issue was not only a matter of timing. The Biden administration's CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act also used similar (though less onerous) tariff threats to force South Korean conglomerates to transfer production and make large investments in the U.S. — which is how the Hyundai-LG plant made its way to Georgia in the first place. Having already complied with the previous administration, South Korea nevertheless now finds itself facing an even graver economic threat that could lead to recession: not just a 25 percent tariff on all exports (since reduced to 15 percent), but sector-based tariffs impacting most of South Korea's key industries as well.

Trump's tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

While much of the anger on either side of the Pacific has focused on the current administration in Washington, Trump's tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

The 1997 International Monetary Fund crisis is the most notorious of these, and led to the “irregularization” of nearly half the workforce as employers moved to subcontracting and other forms of indirect employment to dodge existing labor law and deny rights to their workers. The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers. With Joe Biden, and now Trump, the U.S. has moved to maintain its privileges under the agreement while subjecting South Korea to unequal burdens and penalties.

As with prior rounds of U.S. economic warfare, South Korea's workers and other affected sectors of society responded to the tariffs with force. Farmers reacted with rancor to demands to open up the rice and beef markets to U.S. imports; civic groups staged protests at the U.S. embassy; peace groups highlighted the military demands attached to the tariff threats; and unions educated their workforces and, in some cases, moved to partial strike action — as with the case of General Motors Korea.

Like most governments, South Korea opted to appease the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15 percent, with no corresponding tariff on U.S. goods in the Korean market. So far, Seoul has offered to inject a cumulative $600 billion into the U.S. economy. This is a dizzying figure for any country, no less for South Korea with an annual GDP of roughly $1.7 trillion in 2023, and an annual budget of roughly $500 billion in 2024.

According to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the $350 billion in short-term state-backed investments offered by South Korea is more than the total direct investments it made worldwide over the five-year period from 2020-2024. Beyond extracting such an enormous tribute, Washington has cast a covetous eye toward South Korea's most valuable and strategic industries, seeking to either smother them through tariffs or transfer their most lucrative parts of the production chain to the U.S.: in shipbuilding, automobiles, steel, and more.

While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung attempted to spin the deal as a victory, the domestic labor movement and many progressives swiftly rejected this. The minority Progressive Party, which holds seats in the National Assembly, denounced Trump's tariff maneuvers as “an act of plunder.” The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a massive umbrella union representing over a million workers, described the “unilateral” negotiations as “humiliating,” and criticized the government's declaration of victory as an attempt to confuse the public, since the 15 percent tariff is still ultimately an increase that will burden Korean industry and workers.

At the outset of Trump's tariff threats, labor, farmers, and progressive civil society organizations spearheaded vocal opposition. South Korea's conglomerates (or chaebol) opted to hedge against further potential losses by adopting conciliatory rhetoric and offering handsome investment packages before the details of a deal were worked out at the state level. This was reflected in Lee's first summit with Trump in August, which was noted for its convivial atmosphere and his lavish praise of Trump. Pressure to transfer production to the U.S. was no doubt uncomfortable for South Korea's capitalists, but for a moment, an illusion endured that profits might be sustained in the long term. Then came the ICE raid in Georgia — not only raising questions about the safety of the workforce, but also raising questions about investments.

The ICE raid in Georgia … precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea.

This precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea. Right-wing papers and business media outlets released a barrage of editorials in the wake of the raid. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's conservative paper of record, said the raid “raises fundamental questions about what the United States truly means by ‘alliance.'” Even the People Power Party, whose former leader, ex-President Yoon, now sits in jail, spoke out against the incident.

Some even went as far as to speculate whether the ICE raid might have had something to do with the unsettled tariff negotiations. The Korea Economic Daily, one of South Korea's most important business papers, left little room for subtlety in its editorial: “If the US attempts to leverage this incident in trade negotiations, such as the $350 billion US investment fund and the further liberalization of agricultural and livestock products, it would be a betrayal of the trust of the alliance.” While this statement falls short of an outright accusation in print, one wonders what might have been said in more private settings among the elite.

Despite the pivot in South Korean public opinion, Washington has since only doubled down. Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea's governments have been at odds over how South Korea's investments will be decided. Trump has long claimed that he will personally determine the allocation of South Korea's investments, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick previously tweeted that “90 percent” of the profits will go to “the American people” — a point that continues to rankle South Koreans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick is also applying additional pressure to get Seoul to further raise its investments. Trump has no doubt taken confidence in his success in getting Japan to agree to similar terms, under which its $550 billion tariff tribute will be distributed according to the decisions of a U.S. committee — with Japanese input relegated to only a consultative position. If this all sounds bizarre and corrupt, that's because it is. While Trump has touted his tariff deals as the prelude to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, a better way to see them may be as just another handout for Wall Street — this time subsidized by taxpayers worldwide.

Now, the Trump administration is demanding that the majority of Seoul's $350 billion investment be made “up front” in cash. Though an arrangement based on some credit is more likely, if handed over in full, the $350 billion would represent 83 percent of South Korea's foreign reserves, threatening to trigger a currency crisis for the Korean won. Lee's government has rejected this demand and countered with an offer for an unlimited currency swap to protect the value of his country's currency, but the Trump administration has so far refused.

As negotiations drag on, Lee faces growing pressure to adopt a more assertive stance — including from within his own Democratic Party. For a moment, Lee put up more combative rhetoric, telling the Korean press he would not accept “any irrational or unfair negotiations,” and noted that, “We did not go to the US to gain anything, but to defend ourselves against the US' unilateral tariff increases.” In a separate statement, Lee's office indicated it would be willing to accept a 25 percent tariff to the U.S. market if the alternative were overly detrimental to South Korea. And in a much-circulated Facebook post, Lee called for a “self-reliant” South Korean military while castigating the “submissive mindset of some who think that self-defense is impossible without foreign troops” — a statement widely interpreted as made in reference to U.S. Forces Korea, which stations over 28,000 permanent U.S. troops in South Korea in more than 60 military bases.

Lee's rhetoric is certainly sharpening, but his administration isn't done with the U.S., or Trump, just yet. There are real obstacles preventing a sudden strategic shift from Washington. Lee's economic program pegs South Korea's future competitiveness to massive investments in AI and associated hardware, and recent deals with BlackRock and Open AI would provide the capital for the necessary data infrastructure and chip production.

More immediately, South Korea needs to diversify its trade partners to soften the blows of the U.S. tariff cudgel. Exports rallied to a new monthly record high in September, buoyed by a sharp rise in trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, and more modest gains in trade with China. Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea's military — something Lee has vowed to recover more than 20 years since Washington first agreed to a process for transferring military control.

Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea's military.

A disadvantageous deal for South Korea may yet be in the offing, but a victory on trade may prove pyrrhic for Washington. For its part, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has unambiguously called for Seoul's investment pledges to be withdrawn. Should a potential deal fail to spark public ire immediately, ample opportunities will remain. Trump's demands go far beyond economic matters. The U.S. is also calling for South Korea to raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP (Lee has already taken steps towards this, increasing defense spending by 8.2 percent in next year's budget); raise its annual military “cost-sharing” payments to the U.S. to $10 billion a year; and consent to changes in U.S. Forces Korea's mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.

Out of all these demands, the proposed change in the mission of U.S. Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea. By redefining the mission of the U.S. occupation of Korea, South Korea would essentially lose any ability to avoid a U.S.-China war, since its territory would become part of a battlefield of Washington's making. Lee has consistently maintained that South Korea should stay out of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which Washington has not been shy about as its rationale for pursuing “strategic flexibility” in Korea. As U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson put it, to the U.S. military in the New Cold War, South Korea is akin to a “fixed aircraft carrier” whose geographical position makes it indispensable to dominating the region.

The ICE raid and trade wars alone will not undo the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, but they will likely persist as an open wound marring the relationship for years to come. As Washington presses on with its efforts to economically cannibalize Seoul and impose its military exigencies in preparation for wars few Koreans or Americans want, something will have to give. Whether that will be the alliance and the U.S. empire of bases, or whatever vestiges of democracy that remain in both countries, only time will tell.

Pete Hegseth is investigating hundreds of Pentagon employees for comments they made about the death of Charlie Kirk.

Almost 300 military members, civil workers, and contractors are suspected of mocking the fatal shooting of the conservative influencer on Sept 10, The Washington Post reported.

The Pentagon, which employs some 950,000 civilians and more than one million active-duty personnel, said staff who make fun of Kirk's death would be sacked.

So far, the hundreds of investigations have only resulted in several disciplinary actions.

Mr Hegseth has presided over a department in turmoil since taking the reins as US defence secretary 10 months ago, clearing out members of the top brass while senior aides depart en masse.

Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, told The Washington Post: “Those in our ranks who rejoice at an act of domestic terrorism are unfit to serve the military people.”

Mr Parnell previously said mocking Kirk's death was a “violation of the oath” and “dangerously incompatible with military service”.

Following the 31-year-old's assassination in September, Donald Trump announced a crackdown on “radical” Left-wing terrorists, who he accused of fanning the flames of political violence.

Critics, including prominent conservatives, warned the policy could be exploited to clamp down on free speech under the guise of “hate speech”.

On Thursday, critics of Mr Hegseth accused the defence secretary of creating a culture of fear inside the Pentagon following the dismissal of Jon Harrison, the navy chief of staff, who was appointed to the post by Mr Trump in January.

In a statement following his departure, the department thanked Mr Harrison for his work, but remained tight-lipped on the reasons for his sacking.

There is an emerging “culture of fear; there's a culture of intimidation and retaliation,” a senior defence official told Politico.

“It's better just to keep your head down and not necessarily try to do anything to the advantage of the organisation, because it's very much run from the top down.”

“We all serve at the pleasure of the president,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The White House said Mr Trump had full confidence in Mr Hegseth.

The Pentagon has been approached for comment by The Telegraph.

            After months of delays and disappointments, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his plan for peace in Gaza.
    


            Although Trump's short post on Truth Social represented a major diplomatic breakthrough, it leaves much to be decided.
    


            A ceasefire could come into effect as soon as Friday, and Israeli hostages could be released early next week, but it is not clear whether Israel and Hamas will agree to other conditions proposed by Trump relating to thornier questions of what Gaza will look like after the war.
    


            Here's what we know about the deal so far.
    


            The US president broke news of an agreement on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying it would lead to the swift release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed line.
    


            “This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen,” Trump wrote. “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a meeting of his security cabinet on Thursday to vote on the agreement. That decision is expected later in the day. Netanyahu is then set to chair a full government meeting to approve the deal. Once approved, a ceasefire in Gaza will begin, two Israeli officials told CNN.
    


            With a ceasefire in place, Israeli forces will begin their partial withdrawal from Gaza, expected to take less than 24 hours. There will also be a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli High Court. Once this objection window closes, Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the officials added.
    


            An Israeli source said the assumption is that hostages will be released before these 72 hours pass. Trump said Thursday that they should be released on Monday or Tuesday.
    


            Under the plan, all the living hostages are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period.
    


            Twenty hostages are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. A further 28 hostages are deceased. CNN previously reported Hamas may not be able to find them all.
    


            Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said that 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences will also be released, along with 1,700 others held in Israeli jails.
    


            But an Israeli source familiar with the matter said negotiating teams are still working on the list of prisoners to be released and that the issue “has not yet been resolved.” The source said that any prisoner convicted of murder would not be released to the occupied West Bank and that their transfer to a third country had not yet been determined.
    


Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian political leader who has been imprisoned by Israel since 2002, will not be released, the Israeli government spokesperson said.
    


            Even if the ceasefire takes effect and Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners are released, the warring parties have not agreed to major sticking points tackled in Trump's more comprehensive 20-point plan released last month.
    


• Disarmament: Trump's plan called for Hamas to “commit to peaceful co-existence” with Israel and lay down its arms. Hamas members who comply will be given amnesty under the plan. Disarmament has long been a red line for the militant group.
    


•  Post-war governance: The plan also called for a temporary transitional government to be established in Gaza, comprising a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts” and supervised by “a new international transitional body” called the Board of Peace.
    


            Trump appeared to reference this board during an interview with Fox News, saying that his administration was “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict in the region.
    


            But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza.
    


•  ﻿Israeli withdrawal: Trump's plan also called for the creation of an “International Stabilization Force (ISF)” to be deployed to Gaza and train “vetted Palestinian police forces” in Gaza. With this force in place, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would then be expected to withdraw from Gaza. Israel has not yet agreed to these provisions.
    


• Security guarantees: Hamas has long sought concrete assurances that Israel will not resume the war once it ends, pointing to how Israel shattered the last ceasefire agreement in March. If Hamas agrees to disarm, it is likely to demand even more robust security guarantees, but it is not clear whether Israel will agree to them.
    


            If the ceasefire holds and Israel withdraws to the agreed-upon line in Gaza, the hostages could be released Monday. That timeline is uncertain, however, and the release could happen sooner.
    


            Whereas small groups of hostages have been released each week under previous ceasefires, Trump has insisted that all hostages be released at once.
    


            Netanyahu's cabinet meeting will only discuss the first phase of the ceasefire deal and not Trump's full framework, according to an Israeli source.
    


            Implementing the full framework of Trump's plan would likely spark a revolt among the hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition. Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, two far-right ministers, say Trump's plan represents a defeat for Israel and could threaten government stability if the peace plan progresses.
    


            Meanwhile, Trump told Axios reporter and CNN analyst Barak Ravid that he plans to travel to Israel in the coming days. “They want me to give a speech at the Knesset,” he said.

If Russian President Vladimir Putin launches a new mobilization in Russia, it could pose a grave threat to Europe and spark a world war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 8.

The president's warning comes as Russia steps up provocations against NATO countries, including a surge of mysterious drone sightings across Europe that have raised fears of hybrid warfare.

"Wherever there is quick success, that is where (Putin) will go if there is mobilization," Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. "There is a significant risk that Putin will actually go to a world war."

According to the Ukrainian president, the danger stems from Putin's political need to demonstrate "success" after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

"Mobilization means a definite loss of popularity for the Russian leader. That is the only reason he has not done it," he said. "If there is mobilization, it will be a challenge to Europe. He will start a major war."

Russia's mobilization in 2022 — the first since World War II — followed military setbacks on the front lines and triggered mass protests and emigration, with more than 261,000 Russians fleeing.

While the Kremlin later declared mobilization "completed," no presidential decree officially ended it.

Instead of launching another draft campaign, Moscow has depended on financial incentives and recruitment campaigns, offering lucrative contracts to volunteers willing to serve in the army. 

"Believe me, they definitely didn't want to pay big money for contracts. Such big money as they have been paying all these years. Imagine the price of protecting his personal rating," Zelensky said.

The Ukrainian president has repeatedly warned that unchecked Russian aggression in Ukraine could eventually spill beyond Ukraine's borders and into NATO territory.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest chose not to engage.

Three Russian MiG-31 fighters also entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes on Sept. 19, prompting the Baltic country to invoke consultations under NATO's Article 4.

European leaders have echoed Zelensky's concerns. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned in July that Russia could be ready for a military confrontation with Europe within the next two years.

Tensions between Russia and NATO have escalated since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with growing fears among Western officials that the Kremlin may be preparing for a broader confrontation.

After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

While Moscow framed the assistance as "centuries-old brotherhood" and praised "the close ties between our countries and peoples," the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.





Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said three drones were shot down in the Matveyev-Kurgan district by air defense systems. 

The resolution passed with 469 votes in favor, 97 against, and 38 abstentions, according to an official statement on the parliament's website.

The Kyiv Independent team has introduced a long-requested feature — members can now pay for monthly or annual memberships using PayPal.

The call comes as Kyiv worries that a Babis-led government could undermine Czechia's pro-Ukraine stance, as he has questioned continued military aid and Ukraine's path toward EU membership.



Putin claimed that the missiles exploded a few meters away from the plane, which was then hit by fragments. He linked the incident to the sighting of a Ukrainian drone in the area.

"There is a significant risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will actually go to a world war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The Kyiv Independent is proud to announce the U.S. premiere of its first full-length documentary, “Can You Hear Me? The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics,” hosted in collaboration with the Embassies of Sweden and Ukraine.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) denied on Oct. 9 media reporting suggesting it was investigating a possible involvement of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko in a criminal case.

According to four NATO officials, the goal is to raise the cost of Moscow's gray-zone operations and strengthen deterrence following a series of incursions by Russian drones and aircraft, the Financial Times reported.

Ukrainian delegates will discuss air defenses, energy, sanctions against Moscow, peace talks, and frozen Russian assets.

Zelensky also highlighted that Ukraine's drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have created a gasoline deficit approaching 20%, contributing to shortages in parts of Russia and Russian-held areas.

Giuli Alasania is a professor of history, an advocate for democratic values in Georgia, and the mother of former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.

My son has been a political prisoner of Vladimir Putin's system for more than four years now. He is not being held in Russia, however, but in the very country he once led: the Republic of Georgia. He has been silenced and cut off from his people by a regime aligned with Moscow. 

This is not justice. It is persecution. And as his mother, I bear witness to these actions by both of my countries, as well as to his courage and his suffering.

For nearly a decade, Mikheil stood at the centre of Georgia's transformation. As president, he led one of the most ambitious anti-corruption campaigns in the post-Soviet world. He sought to rebuild the state on foundations of accountability, and like Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, he has championed sovereignty and democracy. 

My home, Georgia, will not become the next Ukraine.

Opinion: Canada should support Russian dissidents in their time of need

But Mikheil's sham trial and his detention is not about justice – it's about silencing Georgia's most visible opposition leader. Like Alexei Navalny, Mikheil has been marked for elimination. Yet his survival itself is resistance. My son's condition, his imprisonment, and his treatment are not just about one man: They are a measure of what kind of country Georgia will choose to become, and whether its allies still believe in its democratic promise.

This persecution is part of a wider authoritarian collapse. Under the leadership of oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream party has hollowed out institutions, silenced civil society, and rigged elections. But for 310 days, Georgians have filled the streets of the capital city of Tbilisi in protest – and last week, during sham local elections, their calls for freedom were met with batons, water cannons, and mass arrests. Citizens participating in peaceful demonstrations were beaten, journalists were silenced, and opposition leaders were dragged away.

As a mother, I cannot watch this brutality crush my son and an entire country's hopes. This is not democracy in decline; it is democracy under assault. 

In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. Today, revisionists dishonour the dead, fracture memory, and hand propaganda to the Kremlin. A country once hailed internationally as a democratic success story has fallen into the grips of the world's autocrats; sanctions against Moscow are being ignored; strategic projects are being handed to Beijing, and in the South Caucasus, this alignment has threatened both European and transatlantic security. 

Georgians cannot stand alone. The world must act.

Analysis: Truth will likely be the last casualty of war in Ukraine

The European Parliament has adopted resolutions that condemn Georgia's fraudulent elections and demand accountability. Now, the United States must do the same. Passing the Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence (MEGOBARI) Act, a package of sanctions and democracy-deepening measures introduced by bipartisan members of Congress and passed the House of Representatives in May, would send an unmistakable message that America stands with Georgians who believe in democracy. International sanctions must extend not only to Moscow, but to those in Tbilisi who carry out the Kremlin's agenda. And most urgently, political prisoners, including my son, must be freed. The international community must prove that it is truly a megobari – a friend – to Georgia.

This is not only about one man. It is about whether Georgia remains aligned with the free world, or slips fully into Moscow's grip – which will have consequences for the rest of the world.

I do not write as a politician or strategist. I write as a mother who has seen her son give everything but his life for his country. His courage deserves recognition, not erasure. His freedom would not only be a matter of personal justice; it is a test of whether the West still believes in the democratic promise of Georgia.

Georgians are watching. Russia is watching. History is watching. The time for hesitation has passed. The world must choose: stand with Georgia now and free Mikheil – or watch another democracy fall.

Carbon-removal startup Deep Sky Corp. plans to build a $500-million direct-air-capture plant in southwestern Manitoba, one of the world's largest facilities designed to counteract the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Montreal-based Deep Sky said Thursday that it is developing a project that will absorb 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, dwarfing its newly operational demonstration plant in central Alberta.

It is announcing the venture as Canada becomes a focus for decarbonization with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration canceling billions of dollars in incentives for green technology.

Deep Sky will start with a $200-million phase that will remove 30,000 tonnes of CO2 per year for injection underground in the region. Construction will start in 2026, the company said. It will add the rest of the facilities in stages.

The company is in talks with municipal and Indigenous leaders, as well as other stakeholders, to determine where it will locate the plant. It is focusing on the Pipestone and Two Borders areas southwest of Brandon, Man. 

“We've looked at a number of sites in that area and what is really going to drive our decision is the geology underneath all of those sites that we're considering, as well as securing the power,” Alex Petre, the company's chief executive officer, said in an interview.

Canada could lead in CO2 removal if Ottawa supports market, coalition says

Deep Sky expects to finalize the site this autumn so it can drill a CO2 storage well by the end of this year, it said. 

Ms. Petre said Manitoba offers several advantages, including geology suited to gas injection, carbon-free hydro power, a trained work force and a favourable regulatory regime. The provincial government passed legislation in 2024 allowing for CO2 storage.

Deep Sky, started two years ago by Fred Lalonde, founder of the online travel agency Hopper Inc., plans to line up its own financing for the project, and it has been marketing credits for the offtake. There is interest among prospective buyers for offsets, Ms. Petre said.

“There is a lot of space in the market for any project developer or company that actually takes execution seriously and is able to deliver credits quickly. So, with Alpha, we've demonstrated that we are very serious about execution,” she said.

This summer, Deep Sky started up its Alpha facility in Innisfail, Alta., where it is testing technology deployed by several vendors to examine energy use, overall efficiency, durability and scalability as they remove climate-warming gas from the air. When fully operational, the plant will remove 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

Ms. Petre declined to divulge which vendor will supply the gear for the Manitoba project, only that Deep Sky is “working with some exciting front-runners” on next-generation carbon-removal technology.

The company said it has garnered the support of the Dakota Grand Council by working with the Dakota Nations of Manitoba, and it has signed a declaration to explore investment and partnership opportunities.

Ms. Petre said the council is enthusiastic about the investment in the region and prospect of future power generation to support later phases. “They are definitely looking forward to discuss all possible avenues, but equity investments from their side have been on the table as well,” she said.

Council chairman Raymond Brown, Chief of the Canupawakpa Dakota Nation, said in a statement that Deep Sky's project aligns with the Dakota economic development strategy and its vision of a sustainable future.

As Deep Sky unveils its investment, the U.S. government has announced it is cancelling billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs and is considering more cuts. Projects on the list include two major direct air capture hubs that received billion-dollar awards from former president Joe Biden's administration.

Ms. Petre said the development is bad news for the U.S. industry, but it puts the spotlight on Canadian carbon-removal opportunities.

“I would say we had already been working with a number of U.S.-based companies that saw the writing on the wall and now we definitely have an influx,” she said. “I have gotten a lot of fairly panicked calls from a lot of my peer group in the U.S.”

One of those companies, CarbonCapture Inc., had been developing a project in Arizona, but moved its equipment to Deep Sky's Alpha project.

“They basically had everything ready to go in Arizona and within four weeks they shipped everything across the border, and because we already had all of the infrastructure, they are basically able to plug and play.”

President attacks Chicago mayor and Illinois governor as extra troops at army training site south-west of city

Hundreds of national guard troops remained in the Chicago area as city and Illinois officials awaited a judge's decision to stop Donald Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation's third-largest city.

It was still unclear where specifically the Trump administration would send the troops who reported to an army training site south-west of Chicago, which was laden with extra fencing and tarps put up to block the public's view of the facility late on Wednesday evening.

As they arrived this week, trucks marked Emergency Disaster Services pulled in and out, dropping off portable toilets and other supplies. Trailers were set up in rows.

“The federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, told reporters. “I can't believe I have to say ‘troop movements' in an American city, but that is what we're talking about here.”

Roughly 500 soldiers – 200 from the Texas national guard and 300 from the Illinois national guard – were mobilized to the city for an “initial period of 60 days”, according to statement issued from US Northern Command, part of the defense department, which called the operation a “federal protection mission”.

The guard members are in the city to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) buildings and other federal facilities and law enforcement personnel, according to Northern Command.

A small number of troops have started protecting federal property in the Chicago area, officials told the Associated Press.

Local television broadcast footage of uniformed troops arriving early on Thursday morning at an Ice processing facility in the suburban community of Broadview, which has become a focal point of protests. They carried shields and what appeared to be luggage.

In a statement the Village of Broadview said three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas national guard had arrived at the federal building.

“During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave and all of the guards were sleeping. We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night's sleep, too,” the statement said.

While the deployment came as part of a crackdown threatened by Trump, in response to unsubstantiated claims that big cities run by Democrats are overwhelmed with crime, the stated mission says military will be “performing ground activities to protect federal functions, personnel, and property”.

It marks Trump's fourth deployment of national guard troops on to the streets of a major US city in as many months, following deployments in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Memphis. In all cases except Memphis, it happened against the wishes of state and city leaders.

Trump repeatedly has described Chicago in hostile terms, calling it a “hellhole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides.

A judge will also have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: a court hearing was being held on Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the guard deployment illegal.

The state of Illinois urged April Perry, a federal judge, to order the National Guard to stand down in the Chicago area, calling the deployment a constitutional crisis. The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.”
 Wells' arguments opened an extraordinary hearing where heavy public turnout at the downtown Chicago courthouse caused officials to open an overflow room with a video feed of the hearing.
 Eric Hamilton, a Department of Justice lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”. He noted an incident last weekend in which a Border Patrol vehicle was boxed in and an agent shot a woman in response.

But in a court filing, the city and state lawyers say protests at the Ice building in Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement”.
 “The president is using the Broadview protests as a pretext,” they wrote. “The impending federal troop deployment in Illinois is the latest episode in a broader campaign by the president's administration to target jurisdictions the president dislikes.”

Elsewhere, an appeals court has scheduled a hearing the same day over the government's desire to send the guard to Portland, Oregon. A judge blocked that effort over the weekend.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“This is about authoritarianism. It's about stoking fear,” Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, said. “It's about breaking the constitution that would give him that much more control over our American cities.”

Trump, meanwhile, sent barbs from Washington, saying on social media that Pritzker and Johnson, both Democrats, “should be in jail” for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Asked about Trump's wish to jail him, Pritzker in downtown Chicago extended his arms and told MSNBC: “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.”

Meanwhile, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said the department was “doubling down” by buying buildings in Chicago – and also Portland – for Ice personnel to operate from.

“We're purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of. We're going to not back off,” she said. “In fact, we're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

At the same time in Memphis, Tennessee, a small group of troops were helping on Wednesday with the Memphis Safe Task Force, said a state military department spokesperson who did not specify the exact role or number of the guard members. The taskforce is a collection of about a dozen federal law enforcement agencies ordered by Donald Trump to fight crime.

Tennessee's Republican governor, Bill Lee, who has welcomed the guard, has said previously that he would not expect more than 150 guard members to be sent to the city.

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Left-wing Antifa violence, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a handwritten message.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly.”

A photographer captured the text with a long lens (see below). “Very close,” read the scrawl, with the two words underlined.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” it added.

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform. A few hours later, it dropped.

“I am very proud that Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” it said.

“BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS,” the post concluded.

The statement capped a frenetic period of diplomatic activity in which Mr Trump has applied the full heft of the White House towards reaching a deal.

If it holds – and it is a big if – the president would have a good case to achieve his long-held dream of being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Insiders said the latest round of negotiations kicked off in earnest exactly a month ago, on Sept 9, when Israel carried out its failed air strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, the capital of Qatar.

Missiles crashed into the terror group's headquarters, killing the son of chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, just as its political bureau was weighing up the latest US proposal.

Mr Trump was furious. The strike had embarrassed the United States, sparked fury among the Arab and Gulf allies crucial to any deal, and achieved none of its military goals.

The president's impatience with Mr Netanyahu hardened. He delivered via backchannels and, later, in person a message: if you do not go along with us on this path to peace, the US will withdraw from its position as Israel's chief ally.

At the same time, Mr Trump tightened his alliance with Qatar, ensuring its leaders would do everything in their power to bring Hamas to heel.

Soon afterwards, Al Jazeera, the state-owned broadcaster, began to promote calls for the Islamist terror group to lay down arms, while watering down anti-Israel coverage.

Another breakthrough came in a meeting between Mr Trump and leaders from Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

The US president said he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. But diplomats from those countries were surprised when the president's 20-point plan dropped the following week.

They felt it reflected Israeli interests much more strongly than the recommendations they had made to Mr Trump and his officials.

A diplomatic source familiar with discussions told The Telegraph: “The output didn't quite add up to the inputs shall we say.”

But Mr Trump and Qatar were now at the head of a process with growing momentum. The source said Arab and Muslim leaders were still discussing how best to raise their worries about the peace plan when Hamas announced they would accept it.

Mr Trump then invited Mr Netanyahu to the White House on Sept 29 and presented a draft of the peace plan pulled together with input from Sir Tony Blair.

Some of it was hard to swallow for the Israeli prime minister. Point 12 stated that Gazans would not be forcibly displaced from the Strip. Point 19 outlined how the deal would help create a “credible pathway” to a Palestinian state.

The Israeli team managed to make last-minute tweaks, but Mr Trump's team rejected an amendment that would allow it to restart the war if it deemed Hamas had broken clauses of the agreement.

To cap off Mr Netanyahu's sudden reversal of fortunes, he was brought into another of the president's “Made For TV” moments in the Oval Office.

Handed a phone by the president, he was forced to call up the Qatari prime minister and personally apologise, more like a naughty schoolboy than the political colossus who has devastated Gaza and humiliated Iran and its proxies.

Next, the plan was presented to Hamas. The group, Mr Trump warned, had three or four days to respond – and, if it refused, Israel would be let off the leash to “destroy” it.

On the night of Oct 3, Hamas issued a full-throated agreement to release the 48 hostages it holds (20 alive, 28 dead).

But it skirted the demand to disarm, and remove itself from post-war governance in Gaza. Analysts characterised it as a carefully calibrated “Yes, but”. Mr Netanyahu saw it as a flat-out rejection – and phoned Mr Trump to persuade him of that view.

A key dividing line between the two men appears to be their approach to the Israeli hostages. Mr Netanyahu spends little time with the hostage families, many of whom accuse him of continuing the war for personal political gain.

By contrast, Mr Trump knows some hostages by name and keeps tabs on their recovery, while Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, regularly texts with the families praying for the release of their loved ones.

Hamas took a gamble: the clear “win” for Mr Trump would be enough for him to overlook its murky views on other parts of the 20-point plan.

It paid off. When Mr Netanyahu phoned the president in an attempt to torpedo the deal, he replied: “Why are you always so f---ing negative?” Axios reported.

The president told the news website he had given Mr Netanyahu no choice but to move towards peace.

“I said, ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it,” Mr Trump said. “He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you've got to be fine.”

Instead of nitpicking the Hamas reply, the president ordered Israel to “stop bombing” in Gaza City, where its troops had begun a full-scale offensive.

Mr Netanyahu accepted, this time. He could not outmuscle the commander-in-chief, as he had with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israel Defense Forces halted offensive operations and began to prepare to receive the hostages.

On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister gave a brief, televised address to the nation. He said Israel had achieved its war goals and cast the move towards diplomacy as his decision, rather than one taken at the behest of the White House.

Hostage families protested in Tel Aviv and other cities, warning against any attempt to sabotage the deal by Mr Netanyahu or his far-Right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who abhor the prospect of an agreement with Hamas.

By Monday, delegations from Israel and Hamas had arrived in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh.

Following reports of progress, Mr Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, joined the talks on Wednesday morning.

However, there were several sticking points to iron out before the “72-hour” window in which Hamas would release the hostages opened.

Israel objected to some of the individuals the terror group wanted to be among the 250 life prisoners freed, including Marwan Barghouti, who was jailed for his role in the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.

In a rare interview, Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader who dodged the missile strike in Qatar, said his group was seeking “real guarantees” that the war would not resume after the release of the hostages, as it had after two earlier ceasefires. The terror group also demanded the body of its former leader, Yahya Sinwar.

By Wednesday night, it appeared that enough progress had been made behind closed doors.

In the White House, Mr Trump was handed the note. True to his style, the president went on to take a further 11 questions, spanning the government shutdown, sanctioning Antifa and on his Nobel Peace Prize hopes, before departing the state dining room to address the matter of ending the war in Gaza.

One of the new cadre of softball reporters who are now routinely admitted to such events pointed out that several nations had nominated Mr Trump for the prize. “By many… by many, many countries,” he agreed. “That's right.”

Mr Trump had, by his own count, ended seven wars and was on the brink of an eighth, he continued. The claims are greatly exaggerated, critics contest.

“I don't think anybody in history has settled that many, but perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me,” he said.

Minutes later, he was gone, heading back to the Oval Office, flanked by JD Vance and Mr Rubio.

Then a Truth Social post dropped, buzzing on journalists' phones all across Washington and beyond. Thumbs scrambled to see if it meant peace in the Middle East.

“Democrats,” intoned the sombre narrator of a political video, “the party of open borders, transgender for everybody, lawlessness in our streets, are shutting down the government in an effort to appease the radical Left”.

A false alarm, as it turned out. But the world was listening, and it did not take long for the big announcement to drop.

Some 50 minutes passed before the president finally declared: “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan.”

All hostages would be released and the IDF would withdraw to “an agreed-upon line”, his post said.

That leaves most of the rest of the 20-point peace plan, including a stabilisation force, aid and a future Palestinian state, to be negotiated. But that is a problem for another day.

It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives.

The US president was presiding over a meeting about Left-wing Antifa violence, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a handwritten message.

“I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly.”

A photographer captured the text with a long lens (see below). “Very close,” read the scrawl, with the two words underlined.

“We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” it added.

Some have likened the image of Mr Rubio and Mr Trump to that of George W Bush and his chief of staff Andy Card on the morning of September 11 2001, when Mr Card whispered into the president's ear as he read a story called The Pet Goat to children at Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. 

Mr Card told Mr Bush that a second plane had hit the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and “America is under attack”.

This is how history is made in this White House. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform. A few hours later, it dropped.

“I am very proud that Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” it said.

“BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS,” the post concluded.

The statement capped a frenetic period of diplomatic activity in which Mr Trump has applied the full heft of the White House towards reaching a deal.

If it holds – and it is a big if – the president would have a good case to achieve his long-held dream of being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Insiders said the latest round of negotiations kicked off in earnest exactly a month ago, on Sept 9, when Israel carried out its failed air strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, the capital of Qatar.

Missiles crashed into the terror group's headquarters, killing the son of chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, just as its political bureau was weighing up the latest US proposal.

Mr Trump was furious. The strike had embarrassed the United States, sparked fury among the Arab and Gulf allies crucial to any deal, and achieved none of its military goals.

The president's impatience with Mr Netanyahu hardened. He delivered via backchannels and, later, in person a message: if you do not go along with us on this path to peace, the US will withdraw from its position as Israel's chief ally.

At the same time, Mr Trump tightened his alliance with Qatar, ensuring its leaders would do everything in their power to bring Hamas to heel.

Soon afterwards, Al Jazeera, the state-owned broadcaster, began to promote calls for the Islamist terror group to lay down arms, while watering down anti-Israel coverage.

Another breakthrough came in a meeting between Mr Trump and leaders from Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

The US president said he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. But diplomats from those countries were surprised when the president's 20-point plan dropped the following week.

They felt it reflected Israeli interests much more strongly than the recommendations they had made to Mr Trump and his officials.

A diplomatic source familiar with discussions told The Telegraph: “The output didn't quite add up to the inputs shall we say.”

But Mr Trump and Qatar were now at the head of a process with growing momentum. The source said Arab and Muslim leaders were still discussing how best to raise their worries about the peace plan when Hamas announced they would accept it.

Mr Trump then invited Mr Netanyahu to the White House on Sept 29 and presented a draft of the peace plan pulled together with input from Sir Tony Blair.

Some of it was hard to swallow for the Israeli prime minister. Point 12 stated that Gazans would not be forcibly displaced from the Strip. Point 19 outlined how the deal would help create a “credible pathway” to a Palestinian state.

The Israeli team managed to make last-minute tweaks, but Mr Trump's team rejected an amendment that would allow it to restart the war if it deemed Hamas had broken clauses of the agreement.

To cap off Mr Netanyahu's sudden reversal of fortunes, he was brought into another of the president's “Made For TV” moments in the Oval Office.

Handed a phone by the president, he was forced to call up the Qatari prime minister and personally apologise, more like a naughty schoolboy than the political colossus who has devastated Gaza and humiliated Iran and its proxies.

Next, the plan was presented to Hamas. The group, Mr Trump warned, had three or four days to respond – and, if it refused, Israel would be let off the leash to “destroy” it.

On the night of Oct 3, Hamas issued a full-throated agreement to release the 48 hostages it holds (20 alive, 28 dead).

But it skirted the demand to disarm, and remove itself from post-war governance in Gaza. Analysts characterised it as a carefully calibrated “Yes, but”. Mr Netanyahu saw it as a flat-out rejection – and phoned Mr Trump to persuade him of that view.

A key dividing line between the two men appears to be their approach to the Israeli hostages. Mr Netanyahu spends little time with the hostage families, many of whom accuse him of continuing the war for personal political gain.

By contrast, Mr Trump knows some hostages by name and keeps tabs on their recovery, while Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, regularly texts with the families praying for the release of their loved ones.

Hamas took a gamble: the clear “win” for Mr Trump would be enough for him to overlook its murky views on other parts of the 20-point plan.

It paid off. When Mr Netanyahu phoned the president in an attempt to torpedo the deal, he replied: “Why are you always so f---ing negative?” Axios reported.

The president told the news website he had given Mr Netanyahu no choice but to move towards peace.

“I said, ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it,” Mr Trump said. “He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you've got to be fine.”

Instead of nitpicking the Hamas reply, the president ordered Israel to “stop bombing” in Gaza City, where its troops had begun a full-scale offensive.

Mr Netanyahu accepted, this time. He could not outmuscle the commander-in-chief, as he had with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israel Defense Forces halted offensive operations and began to prepare to receive the hostages.

On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister gave a brief, televised address to the nation. He said Israel had achieved its war goals and cast the move towards diplomacy as his decision, rather than one taken at the behest of the White House.

Hostage families protested in Tel Aviv and other cities, warning against any attempt to sabotage the deal by Mr Netanyahu or his far-Right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who abhor the prospect of an agreement with Hamas.

By Monday, delegations from Israel and Hamas had arrived in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh.

Following reports of progress, Mr Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, joined the talks on Wednesday morning.

However, there were several sticking points to iron out before the “72-hour” window in which Hamas would release the hostages opened.

Israel objected to some of the individuals the terror group wanted to be among the 250 life prisoners freed, including Marwan Barghouti, who was jailed for his role in the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.

In a rare interview, Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader who dodged the missile strike in Qatar, said his group was seeking “real guarantees” that the war would not resume after the release of the hostages, as it had after two earlier ceasefires. The terror group also demanded the body of its former leader, Yahya Sinwar.

By Wednesday night, it appeared that enough progress had been made behind closed doors.

In the White House, Mr Trump was handed the note. True to his style, the president went on to take a further 11 questions, spanning the government shutdown, sanctioning Antifa and on his Nobel Peace Prize hopes, before departing the state dining room to address the matter of ending the war in Gaza.

One of the new cadre of softball reporters who are now routinely admitted to such events pointed out that several nations had nominated Mr Trump for the prize. “By many… by many, many countries,” he agreed. “That's right.”

Mr Trump had, by his own count, ended seven wars and was on the brink of an eighth, he continued. The claims are greatly exaggerated, critics contest.

“I don't think anybody in history has settled that many, but perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me,” he said.

Minutes later, he was gone, heading back to the Oval Office, flanked by JD Vance and Mr Rubio.

Then a Truth Social post dropped, buzzing on journalists' phones all across Washington and beyond. Thumbs scrambled to see if it meant peace in the Middle East.

“Democrats,” intoned the sombre narrator of a political video, “the party of open borders, transgender for everybody, lawlessness in our streets, are shutting down the government in an effort to appease the radical Left”.

A false alarm, as it turned out. But the world was listening, and it did not take long for the big announcement to drop.

Some 50 minutes passed before the president finally declared: “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan.”

All hostages would be released and the IDF would withdraw to “an agreed-upon line”, his post said.

That leaves most of the rest of the 20-point peace plan, including a stabilisation force, aid and a future Palestinian state, to be negotiated. But that is a problem for another day.

Israel's government ratified a ceasefire with the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday, clearing the way for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours and the freeing of Israeli hostages held there within 72 hours after that. 

The Israeli cabinet approved the deal early Friday morning, roughly 24 hours after mediators announced the agreement, which calls for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the start of a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza under U.S. President Donald Trump's initiative to end the two-year war in the enclave.

“The government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages – the living and the deceased,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's English-language X account said.

The war has deepened Israel's international isolation and upended the Middle East, having evolved into a regional conflict that has drawn in Iran, Yemen and Lebanon. It also tested the U.S.-Israeli relationship, with Trump seeming to lose patience with Netanyahu and pressuring him to reach a deal.

Israelis and Palestinians alike rejoiced after the deal was announced, the biggest step yet toward an end to two years of war in which more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, and the return of the last hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly attacks that started the assault.

Hamas' exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said he had received guarantees from the United States and other mediators that the war was over.

An Israeli government spokesperson said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of government approval of the deal. After that 24-hour period, the hostages held in Gaza would be freed within 72 hours.

Twenty Israeli hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza, while 26 are presumed dead, and the fate of two is unknown. Hamas has indicated that recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing those who are alive.

Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities to dust.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

The accord, if fully implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt the war.

Much could still go wrong. Even after the deal was signed, a Palestinian source said the list of hundreds of Palestinians to be released was not finalized. The group is seeking freedom for some of the most prominent Palestinian convicts held in Israeli jails, as well as hundreds of people detained during Israel's assault.

Further steps in Trump's 20-point plan have yet to be discussed. Those include how the shattered Gaza Strip is to be ruled when the fighting ends and the ultimate fate of Hamas, which has so far rejected Israel's demands it disarm.

Netanyahu also faces skepticism from within his governing coalition, as many have long opposed any deal with Hamas. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would vote to bring down the government if Hamas is not dismantled.

But the announcement of an end to fighting and return of hostages was greeted with jubilation.

“Thank God for the ceasefire, the end of bloodshed and killing,” said Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “All of the Gaza Strip is happy, all the Arab people, all of the world is happy with the ceasefire and the end of bloodshed.”

Einav Zaugauker, whose son Matan is one of the last hostages, rejoiced in Tel Aviv's so-called Hostages Square, where families of those seized in the Hamas attack that triggered the war two years ago have long assembled.

“I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't explain what I'm feeling ... it's crazy,” she said.

In Gaza, Israeli attacks continued before the official start of the ceasefire, but there were far fewer fatalities than the scores killed on a daily basis in recent weeks. Local health authorities reported seven dead in two separate Israeli strikes on Thursday.

Trump said he would head to the region on Sunday to possibly attend a signing ceremony in Egypt, and Israeli Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana invited him to address the legislative body, which would be the first such speech by a U.S. president since 2008. The deal received support from Arab and Western countries and was widely portrayed as a major diplomatic achievement for Trump.

Successful completion of the deal would mark a significant accomplishment for the Republican president, who has struggled to quickly deliver on his promises to bring peace to the Gaza conflict and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Trump praised the 'momentous' Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the 'complicated' hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. 

The Associated Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney congratulated Trump and others whose efforts had helped to bring the deal about. “I want to salute, of course, President Trump, whose decisive leadership has made this possible. Mr. Kushner, Mr. Witkoff, the Qataris, the Egyptians, Turkey, who have been essential to getting to this moment,” Carney told reporters on his way into a cabinet meeeting Thursday morning, referring to Jared Kushner, who is Mr. Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East. 

“The next 48 hours are crucial. We urge the parties, particularly Hamas, to follow through, release all the hostages – including the deceased hostages.”

Western and Arab countries met in Paris to discuss an international peacekeeping force and reconstruction assistance for Gaza once the fighting stops. The United States will deploy 200 troops as part of a joint task force for Gaza stability, with no Americans on the ground in the Palestinian enclave, two senior U.S. officials said on Thursday. 

The officials, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said the 200 would be a core part of a task force that would include representatives from Egypt's military, Qatar, Turkey and probably from the United Arab Emirates. 

More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza, launched after Hamas-led militants stormed through Israeli towns and a music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages. 

Joyful families of hostages and their supporters gathered at a square in central Tel Aviv to celebrate the deal reached by Hamas and Israel.

Ukraine is ready to nominate U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he helps secure a ceasefire with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 8.

Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and end the full-scale Russian invasion, ongoing for more than three and a half years.

This effort has largely stalled as Russia continues to reject a ceasefire and demands territorial concessions from Ukraine.

The U.S. president, who has boasted about ending "seven wars" since returning to office, has actively campaigned for receiving the prestigious award. 

Some officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have already put forward Trump's name for nomination.

The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Oct. 10. As nominations for this year closed in January, any nominations Trump has received since then will not count toward this week's prize.

Despite initially saying he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, Trump later acknowledged that resolving it "turned out to be a little harder" than he thought.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov recently said that the "strong momentum" for ending the war has waned since Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15.

While Trump pledged to arrange direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, no agreement was reached.

Zelensky rejected Putin's invitation to meet in Moscow, calling it impossible while Russia bombs Ukraine, but repeatedly said he is ready to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground.

The Alaska summit, initially expected to include sessions on bilateral cooperation, ended abruptly after those segments were canceled. Two months later, no tangible progress has been made toward peace.

 

Trump has also sought to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, announcing on Oct. 8 that the two parties agreed to the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

While Moscow framed the assistance as "centuries-old brotherhood" and praised "the close ties between our countries and peoples," the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia.





Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said three drones were shot down in the Matveyev-Kurgan district by air defense systems. 

The resolution passed with 469 votes in favor, 97 against, and 38 abstentions, according to an official statement on the parliament's website.

The Kyiv Independent team has introduced a long-requested feature — members can now pay for monthly or annual memberships using PayPal.

The call comes as Kyiv worries that a Babis-led government could undermine Czechia's pro-Ukraine stance, as he has questioned continued military aid and Ukraine's path toward EU membership.



Putin claimed that the missiles exploded a few meters away from the plane, which was then hit by fragments. He linked the incident to the sighting of a Ukrainian drone in the area.

"There is a significant risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will actually go to a world war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The Kyiv Independent is proud to announce the U.S. premiere of its first full-length documentary, “Can You Hear Me? The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics,” hosted in collaboration with the Embassies of Sweden and Ukraine.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) denied on Oct. 9 media reporting suggesting it was investigating a possible involvement of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko in a criminal case.

According to four NATO officials, the goal is to raise the cost of Moscow's gray-zone operations and strengthen deterrence following a series of incursions by Russian drones and aircraft, the Financial Times reported.

Ukrainian delegates will discuss air defenses, energy, sanctions against Moscow, peace talks, and frozen Russian assets.

Zelensky also highlighted that Ukraine's drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have created a gasoline deficit approaching 20%, contributing to shortages in parts of Russia and Russian-held areas.

 How Investments in Resilience Can Deter Beijing

 Lin Fei-fan

In July 2025, Taiwan conducted one of its most extensive military exercises in decades. This time, however, the training did not occur in isolated training grounds but in the heart of Taiwan's cities. Tanks moved through urban streets, more than 20,000 reservists were mobilized, soldiers transported weapons via underground metro systems, and simulated strikes targeted critical infrastructure, including the river crossings that link Taipei's urban core. As part of the exercise, planners tested civilian agencies under extreme contingency scenarios while air-raid alerts emptied the streets. Underground parking lots and metro stations served as bomb shelters, and schools and civic centers became relief shelters and emergency medical hubs. The exercise also mobilized nongovernmental organizations and fire and police agencies to support material distribution logistics and community protection efforts. The government even released updated civil defense instructions, providing the public with air-raid sheltering and safety guidelines.

The exercise, in other words, extended far beyond the armed forces and reflected Taiwan's deepening belief that effective deterrence against China relies not only on military modernization but also on societal resilience—the ability of Taiwan's people to withstand the most extreme scenarios or to resist an invasion. Although it was the first time the Taiwanese people witnessed such a large-scale exercise in their own neighborhoods, the public did not panic but instead expressed strong support for these realistic training and preparedness efforts.

Since 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his ambitions to annex Taiwan, by force if necessary, and to seek Indo-Pacific dominance. The Chinese Communist Party has framed these objectives as essential to the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” and has targeted Taiwan with escalating military pressure and hybrid operations across multiple domains. From near-daily incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone to large-scale kinetic drills, cyberattacks, and disinformation operations, Beijing has pursued a campaign designed not simply to intimidate but to erode Taiwan's confidence and capacity to resist.

In response, Taiwan is undertaking a systemic effort to build its “whole-of-society defense resilience,” a comprehensive strategy that combines military preparedness with democratic cohesion, infrastructure hardening, and societal strength. The goal is to raise the costs of aggression to such a degree that no adversary can hope to achieve victory. Taiwan is making great strides in this approach, as seen in the July exercise. But deterrence is strongest when it is collective. Now is the time for democracies to help preserve peace by investing in Taiwan's resilience.

Long before any conventional methods of war are deployed, authoritarian powers are increasingly trying to exploit their democratic adversaries' societal vulnerabilities. By breaking public morale, degrading infrastructure, and paralyzing decision-making, an aggressor can cripple a state's ability to function before war is even declared. Prior to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for instance, Moscow targeted the country with a steady campaign of hybrid aggression: cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, disinformation aimed at sowing internal discord, economic coercion leveraging Ukraine's reliance on Russia's energy supplies, and political interference exploiting pro-Kremlin forces. These actions were not tactical diversions but rehearsals for a full-scale invasion, designed to soften the target and test its ability to endure systemic shocks. When hostilities began in earnest, Moscow followed a similar script: attacking infrastructure, communications systems, and power plants to create widespread disruption and psychological fatigue.

But Ukraine—leaning on pillars of resilience such as media literacy, a mobilized civil society, redundant infrastructure, and territorial defense—denied the Kremlin a rapid victory. What Moscow expected to be a lightning campaign became a grinding conflict that drained its military strength, triggered unprecedented sanctions, and heightened domestic political risks. Ukraine's resistance has shown that modern deterrence hinges on a society's capacity to absorb shocks and continue resisting under fire.

Ukraine, of course, is not the only country with a formidable civil defense. In response to decades of threats, Finland and Israel have cultivated some of the world's most resilient traditions of whole-of-society defense, or total defense. Their systems go far beyond military readiness. Civilian defense training programs, medical networks, and civic protection rapid-response units are underpinned by a deeper societal conviction that surrender is never an option. Public communication strategies and psychological support structures seek to ensure that civilian morale can withstand prolonged crises, and continuity-of-government planning helps prevent societal breakdown even under extreme pressure.

But it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine that served as the wake-up call for Taiwan. The war made clear that peace cannot be secured through appeasement. It also showed how quickly coercion can escalate into full-scale assault and how the survival of a small democracy up against a powerful authoritarian adversary depends on preparations made long before the first shot is fired. Kyiv's resistance against overwhelming odds was a clear lesson for Taipei, which is why, three years ago, then President Tsai Ing-wen's administration quietly initiated preparations across government agencies to integrate civil defense planning into daily life, fortify critical infrastructure, and foster a society prepared mentally and materially for any contingency.

The Tsai administration started its national resilience campaign by auditing living necessities and essential supplies, including combat medication. It pledged $18.5 billion over ten years to harden and decentralize the power grid, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. It also started investing in low-orbit satellites to maintain communications if undersea Internet cables are severed. To improve reserve mobilization and civil-military coordination, it created the All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency. Amid the intensifying war in Ukraine, the Tsai administration extended conscription from four months to one year and enhanced training programs. These efforts laid the foundation for a much more structured whole-of-society resilience campaign when President Lai Ching-te took office in 2024.



President Lai has made resilience building one of his administration's top priorities. For instance, he has established a national-level committee on whole-of-society defense resilience, which meets quarterly with representatives from the business community, religious groups, academia, and nongovernmental organizations to review the progress of government plans and coordinate across sectors. With the participation of experts and representatives from various sectors, the committee has undertaken new initiatives throughout the last year, including a tabletop exercise to improve coordination among different levels of government, a small-scale live exercise testing civilian agencies' crisis response mechanisms, and the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience International Forum to exchange experiences with like-minded partners, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. The Lai administration also oversaw the July exercise, which emphasized not only military training but also the involvement of civilian agencies—signaling a shift in Taiwan's defense approach. These efforts have underscored that defending Taiwan is a shared responsibility, one that does not rest solely with the military but must also be upheld by all civilian agencies. To that end, Lai has also tasked the National Security Council with closely monitoring each government agency's progress across five major lines of efforts: civil manpower training and utilization, emergency supplies, energy security, medical capacity, and cyber and communication redundancy.

This strategy of whole-of-society defense is far from complete, but these efforts over the past three years demonstrate how decisively Taiwan has progressed from pure military defense to broader societal survivability. The objective is not only to resist armed aggression but also to maintain democratic governance, economic stability, and institutional continuity under pressure, thereby blunting Beijing's use of “gray-zone” and hybrid tactics that fall short of war.

The proposed defense budget, which is set to exceed 3.3 percent of GDP in 2026 and aims to reach 5.0 percent by 2030, further underscores Taiwan's commitment to deterrence. Taipei is not merely investing in conventional systems; it is also directing substantial resources toward asymmetric capabilities, including coastal missile systems, mobile air defense platforms, and a growing array of unmanned technologies such as drones and counterdrone systems. In parallel, the Lai administration has also proposed an $18.1 billion special budget package, with $4.9 billion for national resilience supporting the coast guard's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; disaster relief equipment; and the hardening of shelter facilities. This fund, when combined with regular resilience spending and the core military budget, will elevate Taiwan's total security-related spending to meet NATO's defense benchmarks by the end of 2026.



Still, resilience cannot be built through procurement alone: it also requires unwavering public support and societal consensus. Some opposition voices have called the government's efforts to strengthen resilience and defense a provocation to Beijing. But the reality is that authoritarian aggressors are preparing for military expansion and seeking to change the world order, whereas Taiwan's practices are preserving the status quo and, with it, freedom and democracy. There is no time to waste, so the Lai administration has chosen to accelerate the pace of societal preparedness through more rigorous discussion with the public, including bipartisan and public-private partnerships, particularly in technology and logistics, to ensure preparedness at both the state and societal levels. Many of Taiwan's international partners, including the United States, are also engaging across Taipei's political lines to illustrate the importance and urgency of such preparations.

Ultimately, unity—whether domestic or international, public or private—sends a powerful signal to potential aggressors that Taiwan remains politically strong under pressure. Deterrence is as much about perception as it is about capability. This is why the Lai administration has explicitly stated in its newly published civil defense handbook: “In the event of a military invasion, any claims that the nation is defeated or the government has surrendered are false.”

As Taipei's leaders have repeatedly warned partners and allies, Beijing's ambitions extend well beyond Taiwan. China and its allies seek to reshape the global order. Across the Indo-Pacific, the People's Liberation Army has intensified large-scale military exercises, harassed Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, and even staged unannounced live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea near Australia that disrupted civilian air routes and naval travel. China has also supplied critical components and dual-use technologies to Russia and Iran, enabling Moscow's war in Ukraine and bolstering Tehran's capacity to initiate attacks. Taken together, this pattern of regional aggression and global military support underscores Beijing's determination to erode the existing balance of power and challenge the security architecture that has underpinned peace and stability for decades.

Taiwan's ability to resist, therefore, has repercussions far beyond its shores. Should Taipei fall to Beijing, the resulting power shift could fundamentally alter the global order. Strategically, China would gain a forward operating base in the western Pacific, threatening several vital sea-lanes and undermining the United States' ability to meet security commitments to its Indo-Pacific partners and allies. The collapse of part of the first island chain—which stretches from Japan to the Philippines, separating China from the Pacific Ocean—could erode regional deterrence, raising alarm bells for key U.S. allies such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. China's annexation of Taiwan would also send a dangerous signal that small democracies cannot survive in the shadow of strong autocracies. It would fracture the credibility of democratic solidarity and further legitimize the use of force as a tool of statecraft.

The global economic consequences, meanwhile, would be immediate and severe. As part of a highly specialized global supply chain, Taiwan manufactures cutting-edge components that power today's economy, including the majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Taiwan is also a critical hub for global trade: in 2024, its ports handled a record $690 million revenue tons in cargo, and analysts estimate that roughly half of the world's container ships pass through the Taiwan Strait each year. Any disruption to either this maritime lifeline or Taiwan's high-tech manufacturing would reverberate across global markets, crippling industries from consumer electronics to automotive manufacturing and even defense systems. The potential consequences are staggering: Bloomberg has estimated that a war over the Taiwan Strait could inflict as much as $10 trillion in annual losses on the world economy, erasing more than ten percent of global GDP.

The future of Taiwan is not merely a regional concern; it is a test of whether the international order can withstand the pressure of authoritarian expansionism. Taiwan, especially the current Lai administration, understands this reality and has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to building credible deterrence through both defense capacity and societal resilience. Yet as authoritarian powers coordinate more closely—combining cyber-operations, economic coercion, and military pressure across the region—the preservation of Indo-Pacific peace cannot rest on Taiwan alone.

Although the Taiwanese people deeply appreciate statements of solidarity, further action is needed. More of the world's democratic leaders should take immediate, tangible steps to enhance security cooperation with Taiwan, including improving the ability of security forces to work together across domains. By recognizing that the resilience of one democracy strengthens the security of all, Taiwan and the United States have bolstered their security cooperation in 2025 through military procurement and arms deliveries, significantly accelerating Taiwan's preparedness. This should serve as a call to action for other democracies, as well. Taiwan is doing its part with urgency and resolve and is committed to achieving peace through strength by going beyond military readiness to strengthen whole-of-society resilience. As Taiwan accelerates its preparations, there should be no doubt about its determination to defend its future and its freedom.

Attorneys general from 20 states have stepped into the dispute between Oregon officials and the Trump administration over the use of National Guard troops to defend Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who have come under assault from protesters in Portland.

Led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, Brenna Bird of Iowa, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, and South Carolina's Alan Wilson, the attorneys general filed an emergency appeal amicus brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 8, charging that Portland police failed to protect ICE agents from “violent rioters,” and that “President [Donald] Trump's deployment of a small number of National Guard members to defend against this lawlessness is responsible, constitutional and authorized by statute.”

Osama El Khatib, 26, was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail after prosecutors allege he assaulted police officers to help fellow agitators escape arrest.

Pro-Palestinian agitators accused of being behind a riot Tuesday are now being charged with "promotion of anarchy" after the melee left several officers injured.

The Boston Herald reported that the Suffolk District Attorney's Office on Thursday upgraded charges for all 13 suspects, who are now accused of violating a state law that makes "promotion of anarchy" illegal and is a felony charge, according to court documents.

On Tuesday night, between 200 and 300 people participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston that quickly descended into a riot. Thirteen people were arrested after police allege they became violent toward law enforcement officers.

A spokesperson for the district attorney's office told the Herald the upgraded charges come after a Boston Police Department review of posters promoting the so-called protest, which feature a quote from a Hamas spokesperson and a burning police cruiser.

"Peace be upon your souls that will one day soar in the skies of your liberated Al Quid's and Al Aqsa, purified from the defilement of your killers," the poster read, according to police.

Because of that, police determined there was probable cause that the group "intended to conduct their rally and march in such a way that it induced fear, caused destruction and disruption, caused injury and promoted anarchy."

Four police officers were injured during the riot.

"Further investigation revealed violent imagery and rhetoric used in promotional media for the Oct. 7 incident," the DA's spokesperson said. "This organizing material promoted violence against police and presented an immediate threat to public safety which, combined with the actions of the individuals arrested, provided clear justification for the enhanced charges."

Boston police said the group "surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts," adding that "several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face.

"As violence escalated," police said, more officers were sent to the area while the agitators "continued to resist dispersal."

Officers reported that the rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment.

"During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear," the agency said.

Police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and obstruction of emergency response efforts, along with a slew of other charges including assault.

Osama El Khatib, 26, Roder Atwood, 21, Atalanta Carrig-Braun, 20, Haley MacIntyre, 24, Madeline Weikel, 27, Jacob Pettigrew, 22, Amun Prophet, 25, Laith Hintzman, 19, Benjamin Choucroun, 20, Owen Woodcock, 26, Prahlad Iyengar, 25, Styx Hatch, 19, and Gabrielle Smith, 28, were arrested on Tuesday night.

Bail was set on Wednesday and Thursday for those arrested, ranging from $500 to $10,000.

Notably, bail for Atwood, El Khatib and Hatch was set at $10,000. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office alleges that Khatib punched police officers to help fellow suspects escape without being arrested. While the district attorney's office requested $5,000 cash bail, the judge set bail at $10,000.

The Boston Herald reported that Atwood allegedly broke a police officer's nose during an assault, according to prosecutors.

Suffolk County DA Kevin Hayden sent a message to future protesters in a statement on Wednesday: Remain peaceful or face prosecution.

"These defendants were not in court today because they were protesting," Hayden said. "They were in court because they committed crimes. If you assault police and commit other offenses, you're going to be arrested and prosecuted, period.

"Peaceful protests happen all the time in this city," he said. "We support everyone's right to protest. But these individuals chose against protesting peacefully, and they are now facing the consequences of those choices."

According to Boston.com, the initial protest was organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, which coincided with the two-year mark of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas.

The protest was intended to "flood downtown for Palestine."

According to the report, people yelled "F--- you, Nazis" and "BPD is KKK" as they refused to leave the area.

New York Attorney General Letitia James decries mortgage fraud indictment pushed by the Trump administration as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday on mortgage fraud charges in a case that President Donald Trump urged his Justice Department to bring after he vowed retribution on his biggest political enemies.

James, a Democrat who infuriated Trump after his first term with a lawsuit alleging that he built his business empire on lies about his wealth, was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.

The top federal prosecutor for eastern Virginia, a former Trump aide, personally presented the case to the grand jury weeks after she was thrust into the role amid the administration's pressure to deliver charges.

The indictment, two weeks after a separate criminal case charging former FBI Director James Comey with lying to Congress, is the latest indication of the Trump administration's norm-busting determination to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to pursue the president's political foes and public figures who once investigated him.

In a lengthy statement, James decried the indictment as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

“These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties,” she added.

Both the Comey and James cases followed a strikingly unconventional path toward indictment. The Trump administration last month pushed out Erik Siebert, the veteran prosecutor who had overseen both investigations for months and had resisted pressure to file charges, and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who has worked as lawyer for Trump but has never previously served as a federal prosecutor.

Halligan presented the James case to the grand jury herself, as she did in the case against Comey, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

James called the decision to fire Siebert and replace him with a prosecutor who is “blindly loyal” to the president as “antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country,” and she said she stood by her investigation of Trump and his company as having been “based on the facts and evidence — not politics.”

Abbe Lowell, James' lawyer and a prominent attorney representing multiple Trump targets, said James “flatly and forcefully denies these charges.” James is scheduled to make an initial appearance in the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Oct. 24. 

“We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,” Lowell said in a statement. “When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone — when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted -- it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law.”

James, 66, has been New York's attorney general since 2019 after becoming the first Black woman to be elected to statewide office. She cruised to reelection in 2022 after abandoning a short-lived run for governor.

The indictment pertains to James' purchase of a modest house in Norfolk, where she has family. During the sale, she signed a standard document called a “second home rider” in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her “personal use and enjoyment for at least one year,” unless the lender agreed otherwise.

Rather than using the home as a second residence, the indictment alleges, James rented it out to a family of three. According to the indictment, the misrepresentation allowed James to obtain favorable loan terms not available for investment properties.

In a post on X shortly after the indictment was handed up, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “One tier of justice for all Americans.”

“No one is above the law,” Halligan, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. “The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.” 

Trump has been advocating charging James for months, posting on social media without citing any evidence that she's “guilty as hell” and telling reporters at the White House, “It looks to me like she's really guilty of something, but I really don't know.”

The Justice Department has also been investigating mortgage-related allegations against Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, using the probe to demand her ouster, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., whose lawyer called the allegations against him “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.”

But James is a particularly personal target. As attorney general, she sued the Republican president and his administration dozens of times. Last year, she won a staggering judgment against Trump and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements.

An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. 

The indictment comes a day after Comey made his first court appearance in his case, accusing him of lying to Congress in 2020. Comey's lawyer told the judge that the defense plans to push to have the case dismissed ahead of trial, arguing that it is a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the president.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and that the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

One of the officials said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza.

The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza.




A second official said the troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center.

Two other senior U.S. officials who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations offered more details about forces from other countries and what U.S. troops would be doing.

Members of the armed forces of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are expected to be embedded with the team of 200 U.S. troops, according to one of the officials. The American service members will integrate the multinational force and coordinate with Israeli defense forces, the official said.

The exact location of where U.S. troops will be positioned is something they will be working to determine Friday, the other official said.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, highlighted Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command, during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday, saying he had worked alongside special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“Cooper — I hear he's been fantastic,” Trump said.

Cooper joined the U.S. side of the talks in Egypt this week, according to one of the U.S. officials, and he helped reassure the Arab countries at the negotiating table that the U.S. would put a strong guarantee behind its commitments — a reassurance the Arab countries then passed along to Hamas.

In a show of readiness, Cooper told them he could have a command post up and running in the next two and a half weeks.

A breakthrough deal to pause the war in Gaza was reached Wednesday after the United States and mediators in the region pressured both Israel and Hamas to end the fighting that has devastated the Gaza Strip, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, sparked other conflicts and isolated Israel.

That push sealed an agreement on a first phase that would free the remaining living Israeli hostages within days in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

A former Minnesota high school girls softball player opened up about losing to a transgender pitcher in a state tournament and how the declining safety of the state has caused her and her family fear.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison responded to dozens of school board members who are urging the state to keep biological males out of girls sports by saying the issue "doesn't harm anyone."

A letter penned by more than 40 school board members expressing support for policy revisions to enforce Title IX and protect girls sports prompted the response from Ellison this week. 

"Letting the very small number of transgender students in Minnesota play on their school sports teams doesn't harm anyone, but segregating them does," part of Ellison's statement read.

Ellison said this despite the fact that multiple girls high school athletes in his state have spoken out about how the experience of facing trans athletes has impacted them, and some have even filed a lawsuit over the issue. 

Three anonymous Minnesota high school girls filed a lawsuit against the state's education agencies in the spring after having to compete against a transgender softball pitcher. 

One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans pitcher.

"This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. It's simply unfair, and I hate that nothing is happening to change that. Boys should not be able to take girls' spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. I hope that more girls affected by this issue will stand up against this." the player said. 

Another anonymous player directly called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females.

"It's really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn't taking rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong," one anonymous player previously told Fox News Digital. 

Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears.

"How do you acknowledge that you lost to a biological male? How do you process those events that happened? And that was something that entire night, I still couldn't do it. … We lost to a biological male in a female state tournament," Kotzmacher said. 

Minnesota's education agencies face a deadline Friday from the U.S. Department of Education to change their trans athlete policies. President Donald Trump signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order in February, but Minnesota was one of the first states to openly defy the order.

Ellison then filed a lawsuit against Trump and the Department of Justice over the executive order and appears staunchly opposed to complying with the DOE's Friday deadline.

"Exclusion is a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which has protected the rights of trans kids to participate in all extracurricular activities for decades," Ellison's statement continued. 

"I too am concerned about the Trump Administration's threats to cut education funding for kids across Minnesota, but this matter is before the court right now. The federal government's threats violate the U.S. Constitution, Minnesota law, and Title IX itself. I'm fighting to prevent these harmful cuts, stop the Administration's bullying of transgender kids who just want to live their lives in peace, and protect the rights and freedoms of all our students in Minnesota."

When Ann Walter looked outside her rural West Texas home, she didn't know what to make of the bulky object slowly drifting across the sky.

She was even more surprised to see what actually landed in her neighbor's wheat field: a boxy piece of scientific equipment about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, attached to a massive parachute, adorned with NASA stickers. She called the local sheriff's office and learned that NASA, indeed, was looking for a piece of equipment that had gone lost. 

“It's crazy, because when you're standing on the ground and see something in the air, you don't realize how big it is,” she said. “It was probably a 30-foot parachute. It was huge.”

Walter said she soon got a call from NASA's Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, which launches large unmanned, high altitude research balloons more than 20 miles into the atmosphere to conduct scientific experiments.

Officials at NASA, which is impacted by the ongoing government shutdown, did not return messages Thursday. A message left with the balloon facility also was not immediately returned.

A launch schedule on the balloon facility's website shows a series of launches from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of where the equipment landed.

Hale County Sheriff David Cochran confirmed that NASA officials called his office last week in search of the equipment.

Walter said she ultimately spoke with someone at the balloon facility who told her it had been launched a day earlier from Fort Sumner, and uses telescopes to gather information about stars, galaxies and black holes.




“The researchers came out with a truck and trailer they used to pick it up,” she said.

But not before Walter and her family, who live in Edmonson, Texas, were able to capture some photos and videos.

“It's kind of surreal that it happened to us and that I was part of it,” she said. “It was a very cool experience.”

The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war.

President Donald Trump praised the “momentous” Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the “complicated” hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. Speaking during his Cabinet meeting, the president said he may travel to Egypt for the signing ceremony.

Video released by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum showed hostage relatives, with Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick speaking on the phone with Pres. Donald Trump. This after Trump announced Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan.

U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready to be moved in to Gaza when they are given a green light.

Some residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem woke up Thursday with hope and joy after Israel and Hamas had agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting and release the hostages.

Trump said Wednesday in announcing the outlines of the biggest breakthrough in months in the two-year-old war that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners.

US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war. Families of hostages and their supporters rejoiced as news spread that a deal had been struck to free Israeli captives held in Gaza.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of gridlock, the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza came together in a matter of days after a deft maneuver — or perhaps a misunderstanding — by President Donald Trump that boxed in the two adversaries.

Either way, efforts to wind down the devastating war unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel have seen a breakthrough, and the last 48 hostages — about 20 of them believed to be alive — are set to be returned under the agreement announced Wednesday.



Hamas saw hostages more as a liability than asset over time, providing an opening for the deal, according to two senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.

One of the officials added that negotiators, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had detected that “Hamas had enough.”

Major questions remain, including over governance and reconstruction of a territory that largely has been destroyed as well as whether Hamas will disarm — a key Israeli demand that the militants have not yet publicly accepted.

But it appears for now as though the fighting will pause, because at a critical moment last week, Trump took Hamas' very conditional response to his proposal as a yes.

In early September, long-running ceasefire talks mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar were at a standstill. 




Trump's Mideast envoy had walked away weeks earlier, blaming Hamas. The militant group then accepted a proposal that mediators said was almost identical to one approved by Israel, but there was no public response from Israel or the U.S.

Hamas stuck to its position that it would only release the remaining hostages in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those terms, saying the war would only end with Hamas' surrender and the return of all the captives, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control over Gaza.

On Sept. 9, explosions rocked Doha and smoke rose over the steel and glass skyline of Qatar's capital.

Israel had carried out an airstrike on Hamas leaders and negotiators as they had gathered to consider the latest ceasefire proposal in Qatar, a close U.S. ally and mediator. The strike killed five lower-ranking Hamas members and a Qatari security forces member.

It infuriated Gulf Arab leaders and angered the White House. Trump quickly went into damage control, seeking to reassure Qatar.

The strike alarmed U.S. allies across the region, including countries like Turkey and Egypt that have hosted Hamas political leaders. The war that Trump had pledged to end was at risk of spiraling across the Middle East once again.

The strike united Gulf Cooperation Council countries in a way not seen since the bloc's 1981 inception as a counterweight to post-revolutionary Iran.

It caused the seven GCC members, which include Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to rethink what had been relatively moderate stances on Israel and led some to believe Israel was now a bigger threat to regional security and stability than Iran, according to Arab diplomats familiar with conversations at the bloc's last summit in Doha. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Such a shift could have had profound implications for the Trump administration's anti-Iran push, which relies heavily on being able to respond from two major U.S. military bases in Bahrain and Qatar. And it might have doomed the signature diplomatic achievement of Trump's first term: the Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel.

Two weeks after the Doha strike, Trump met with the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim nations on the sidelines of an annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations that highlighted Israel's growing isolation. The president said it was his “most important meeting.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that efforts “took a turn” at that meeting, with the U.S. building a coalition behind Trump's plan.

Trump unveiled his 20-point peace plan less than a week later — during Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House this year. Trump also made a show of trying to soothe angry Qatari officials.

Trump dialed up Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and spoke to him before handing the phone to Netanyahu. The prime minister read from a written apology, expressing his regret for Israel violating Qatari sovereignty with the strike.

The White House later published photos of a grim-faced Trump with the phone awkwardly perched in his lap.

In a press conference in Washington after the Sept. 29 meeting, Netanyahu said he had accepted Trump's plan.

Rubio said Trump's negotiators then stepped up their efforts through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt to get Hamas on board, while Trump held phone calls and meetings with world leaders.

The U.S. plan calls for Hamas to release all the remaining hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, to give up power in Gaza and to disarm.

The plan essentially demanded Hamas' surrender. Trump said the militant group had days to think it over and issued a stark warning.

“If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote on social media last week. “THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”

Hours later, and ahead of schedule, Hamas submitted its response.

Hamas reiterated its willingness to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and to give up power to other Palestinians. But it said other elements of Trump's plan required more negotiation and offered nothing about disarming, a key Israeli demand.

The response was clearly a “yes, but.”

The U.S. and Israel could have taken it as a “no” and blamed Hamas for the failure to reach a ceasefire on Israel's terms, as they had in the past. Israel could have vowed to press ahead with its invasion of Gaza City or even expand it.

But when the Hamas response landed late Friday, Israel was largely shut down for the Sabbath, and Trump was first to respond.

“Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

U.S. officials declined to comment on Trump's thinking. If he misread Hamas' response, no one was in any mood to correct him — neither Hamas, which had sidestepped his ultimatum, nor Netanyahu, who would not want to be seen as spoiling the president's deal.

In a brief statement later that night, Netanyahu said Israel was preparing for the implementation of the “first stage” of Trump's plan — the release of hostages — and was still committed to ending the war according to its own principles.

It made no mention of the fact that Hamas had not accepted some key demands.

There was room to negotiate, and a desperation on the part of the international community, key Arab players — and likely Trump himself — to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and destabilized the region.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Thursday that he and many other Israeli officials were skeptical about Hamas' heavily qualified acceptance. But he said Trump's decision to frame it as a sign of momentum proved to be a “brilliant” move.

Trump “not only seized an opportunity but created an opportunity by saying, ‘Well, it's positive, and let's move from there.' And eventually it worked,” Saar told Fox News.

In an interview with Fox News host and ally Sean Hannity after announcing the agreement, the president said he hoped it would help repair Israel's international standing.

“I spoke to Bibi Netanyahu just a little while ago,” Trump told Hannity, using the Israeli prime minister's nickname. “I said, ‘Israel cannot fight the world, Bibi.' They can't fight the world. And he understands that very well.”

A California company has recalled nearly 245000 pounds (111130.04 kilograms) of pre-cooked pasta linked to a deadly listeria outbreak and potential contamination of dozens of products sold at grocery stores nationwide. 

Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California, recalled thousands of cases of linguine, fettucine, penne and other pastas sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads on Sept. 25, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration notice posted Thursday. 

The move came after tests showed that pasta made by Nate's Fine Foods contained the same strain of listeria found in chicken fettucine Alfredo and meatball linguine products linked to an outbreak that has killed four people and sickened 20 since August 2024. The most recent illness reported occurred on Sept. 11. 

FreshRealm, the San Clemente, California, company that produced those meals, used genetic sequencing to confirm the link to the outbreak. 

Several grocery stores have recalled products made with pasta from Nate's Fine Foods. The FDA and the U.S. Agriculture Department have warned consumers not to eat the foods and to discard them or return them to stores for refund. 

Here are the recalls to date: 

1. Sprouts Smoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad sold from the deli service counter or Grab & Go section with best-by dates from Oct. 10 to Oct. 29.

2. Giant Eagle smoked mozzarella pasta salad — expiration dates Sept. 30 through Oct. 7. 

3. Kroger stores recalled deli bowtie and penne pasta salads — sold Aug. 29 through Oct. 2.

4. Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls 9.6-oz — best if used by dates of March 12 and 13 and March 17 and 21 2027.

5. Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettucine Alfredo 16-oz plastic tray packages with “best if used by” dates Sept. 20, Sept. 24, Sept. 27, Sept. 28, Oct. 1, Oct. 3, Oct. 5, Oct. 8 and Oct. 10.

6. Albertsons stores recalled store-made deli pasta salads — sell thru dates from Sept. 8 to Oct. 4.

7. Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce 12-oz. — best-by dates of Sept. 22, Sept. 24, and 25 and Sept. 29 to Oct. 1.

8. Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine 12.3-oz – best-by date of June 26, 2025, or prior; and 32.8-oz — best-by date of June 27, 2025, or prior.

9. Home Chef Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo 12.5-oz — best-by date of June 19 or prior.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham discusses Illinois suing the Trump administration over its deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on 'The Story.'

Lawyers for President Donald Trump and the state of Oregon clashed Thursday before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals over Trump's push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, a high-stakes showdown marked by sharp accusations that the president's actions were unlawful and unnecessary.

A three-judge panel, composed of two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee, seemed deeply skeptical of the case made by Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin, including her assertion that Trump's descriptions of the violence in Portland were hyperbolic and "untethered from reality."

Judges sharply questioned Chaffin about the specifics of the protests in Portland. Many of them focused on specifics, including dates of protests and number of arrests, in asking why — in the state's view — these conditions failed to meet the standard needed to justify Trump's deployment of the National Guard.

"I'm not sure even President Lincoln would have been able to authorize the use of force right now" if his actions were to be scrutinized under the "much more stringent reviewability standard" implied by Oregon here, Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee, interjected loudly, one of several times he cut off Chaffin as she attempted to answer the court's questions.

Chaffin argued that the protests in Portland are a far cry from a definition of a "rebellion," one of two conditions Trump needs to satisfy to meet the legal pretext for National Guard deployment. 

The 9th Circuit Court agreed to take up the Trump administration's request to hear the case just days after a federal judge in Oregon issued a temporary restraining order halting the president from immediately sending Oregon National Guard troops to the city of Portland, describing the action as one that risks "blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation."

Rebellions "are unusual and extreme emergencies," Chaffin said, noting that the bulk of agents' complaints on record are focused instead on them being short-staffed. Administrative difficulties "are not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other U.S. city," Chaffin added.

Still, the court's two Trump appointees took a much more critical view of the state's case during oral arguments, which lasted roughly 90 minutes.

Justice Department attorney Eric D. McArthur, meanwhile, spent the bulk of time reiterating the two tenets of the Trump administration's core arguments in deploying National Guard troops. The first is that there is a threat of "rebellion" underway, and the second is that the federal government cannot carry out the law without the help of the National Guard.

McArthur argued that Portland meets the criteria of an "active threat," regardless of the weeks that passed between Trump's June memo authorizing the federalization of National Guard troops and his September attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

Asked by the Clinton-appointed Judge Susan Graber whether Trump could hypothetically rely on any violent event that "post-dates" the administration's National Guard mobilization to justify its deployment, McArthur said yes.

"I think we can rely on later evidence to show there was a colorable factual basis for the president's determination," he told judges for the 9th Circuit.

"It demonstrates the very kind of risk that can materialize at any time with this sort of violent crowd."

The court did not specify when it planned to issue a ruling. In the meantime, dozens of National Guard troops — roughly 200, as lawyers testified Thursday — remain just outside the city's limits, pending possible deployment.

The case is just one of several challenging Trump's authority to federalize the National Guard over the objections of state and local leaders.

Taylor Swift was not exactly subtle in one of her latest songs.

The pop superstar released her 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," last Friday, and the ninth track, "Wood," turned the heads of just about every listener.

The song included lyrics that just about everybody could assume were about fiancé Travis Kelce's anatomy that "opened [her] thighs."

Swift also sings that the "redwood tree … ain't hard to see" and said her beau had "new heights of manhood," a play on the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's podcast title with his brother, Jason.

Jason's wife, Kylie, just like about everyone else, gave a listen to her future sister-in-law's album, and she said she is a fan. She even put "Wood" in her top three favorite songs on the album.

But she was understandably a little bit uncomfortable.

"Here's the detail? Do I need that much detail, specifically about my brother-in-law? Probably not," she said on the latest edition of her podcast. "But also, good job, Trav. That's it. Yes. 1,000% yes, that's women supporting women. Proud of ya."

Travis discussed the album on the newest "New Heights" episode, and Jason pitched the idea of hosting a live listening party for their father.

"Dude, I'm terrified," Travis said.

The album has been a massive hit even before it was released. It had over 6 million pre-saves, the most ever on Spotify. Its lead single, "The Fate of Ophelia," also broke the record for most streams in one day.

A federal appeals court judge on Thursday cast doubt on Oregon's challenge to President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Portland, saying there was no evidence the deployment was unlawful despite state concerns about presidential overreach.

Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said he was not “trying to diminish” worries that federalizing the Oregon National Guard could set a dangerous precedent. But he added that the record before the court did not show evidence of abuse.

“It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now,” said Nelson, a Trump appointee. “All we have is a document that says, ‘We have a federal facility under attack or that violence has forced it to close down, and we want to protect it.' That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.”

The panel, comprised of two Trump appointees and one appointee of former President Bill Clinton, heard oral arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a lower-court order blocking the Guard's deployment to protect a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that had been shuttered amid months of protests and sporadic violence.

Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur told the panel that the president has broad constitutional authority to safeguard federal property when local authorities fail to maintain order. He acknowledged the government did not dispute the factual findings in the district court's injunction but argued those facts did not justify restraining the president's national defense powers.

Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin countered that the Portland demonstrations did not amount to a “rebellion” or “insurrection” that would justify military intervention, insisting the federalization order exceeded the scope of presidential authority.

Judge Susan P. Graber, a Clinton appointee, pressed McArthur early in the hearing to define what constitutes a “rebellion.” McArthur said it referred to an “organized resistance by force and arms” against the government, while Chaffin said such events must be “unusual and extreme emergencies” that threaten “the existence of the Union.”

Chaffin's arguments drew sharp questioning from both Trump-appointed judges on the panel. 

Nelson called her description of the protests as “largely sedate and generally peaceful” “clearly erroneous,” noting that demonstrations had repeatedly disrupted federal operations. Judge Bridget Bade, an appointee of Trump, added that the ICE facility had been closed for more than three weeks during the height of the unrest — a fact she said was “relevant” to the president's duty to ensure federal law enforcement.

Chaffin replied that those conditions no longer existed and urged the court not to treat events from three months earlier as justification for a standing military order. “There is an expectation in the law that the circumstances are going to be evaluated as they happen,” she said.

The three-judge panel did not indicate when it would rule, though they indicated they would attempt a decision as soon as possible.

Even if the Trump administration prevails, a separate district court order remains in place blocking any National Guard deployment in Portland until at least Oct. 19. That order pertains to a secondary lawsuit joined by the state of California after Trump reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland.

TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PUSH GAINS STEAM THANKS TO STRONG LEGAL FOOTING

A simultaneous hearing related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago happened in the Illinois federal court on Thursday. The state has asked for a temporary block on the use of troops to protect federal agents and facilities in the state, and the judge previously declined to immediately enjoin the use of troops when a lawsuit was filed earlier this week.

U.S. District Judge April Perry, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not indicate when she would make a decision but said she would be back at the bench at 4:30 p.m. local time.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott slammed Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for opposing the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Chicago.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott mocked Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, calling him a "joke" for opposing his deployment of Texas National Guard troops to provide security over immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Abbott said, "Gov. Pritzker is a joke" and is in "violation of his oath of office" by attempting to interfere with federal law enforcement efforts to improve safety in Chicago and other Illinois communities.

Texas National Guard troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday, tasked with protecting federal personnel and property amid anti-immigration protests, the Pentagon confirmed. A Pentagon official said 200 guardsmen were mobilized for an initial 60-day period.

Pritzker, a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and fierce critic of President Donald Trump, has condemned the National Guard deployment, calling it "Trump's invasion" and calling on Abbott to withdraw his support. He has also threatened to pull out from the National Governors' Association if the bipartisan group does not condemn the deployment.

The state of Illinois, joined by the city of Chicago, also filed a lawsuit in federal court in an attempt to stop the deployment.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, Abbott said that Pritzker's actions are in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

"You may recall it wasn't too long ago that he put his left hand on a bible and raised his right hand and swore to God that he would support the Constitution of the United States as opposed to supporting it and allowing federal officials to enforce federal law. He's violating the Constitution, violating the oath that he took by interfering with the ability of federal officials to conduct the executive branch of the federal government," said Abbott.

He said that it is "only natural" Trump would call on his "elite National Guard to provide assistance anywhere in the entire country," because of Texas soldiers' extensive experience providing security at the southern border.

"Texas has the most proven, the largest, the best-trained National Guard in the United States of America," he said. "Americans will remember we had thousands of our National Guard securing the American border, the largest border state in the entire country, more than 1,200 miles. And it was Texas, as opposed to the federal government under the Biden administration, that had to step up and secure the border.

"Now, because we have a president who is finally enforcing the laws of the United States … it's only natural, by extension, that if there's a need for that elite National Guard to provide assistance anywhere in the entire country, that it would be the National Guard called upon," he added.

Though Pritzker has denounced the deployment as an "invasion," Abbott clarified that his soldiers' presence in the state is strictly to provide backup for federal officials who have recently faced intense opposition from agitators in Illinois.

"They provide a very important backup role to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Right now, they are playing a very important backup roll to ensure the safety of federal officials while federal officials enforce federal law in places like Illinois, Oregon and elsewhere," he explained. "There's unrest in areas where ICE is trying to operate and where ICE is trying to enforce the law. And what ICE or other federal officials need, they need safety and security as they go about the process of carrying out their function.

"It is very important that the public understand that these federal officials, they have a requirement to enforce federal law. Anybody who interferes with that is interfering with the ability for federal officials to do their job.

"What the National Guard is trained and skilled at doing is dealing with civil unrest like that," said Abbott. "Whenever the country is in times of need, Texans will step up and help out any way we possibly can."

Fox News Digital reached out to Pritzker's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

PHOENIX (AP) — The sheriff's office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert's report.

The report released Wednesday criticized the use of compliance money by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office to fund personnel costs and tasks, either in part or in full, that aren't connected to the overhaul.

It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8 million for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court's orders; $1.5 million in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3 million to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location.

For over a decade, Maricopa County taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then-Sheriff Arpaio's traffic patrols targeting immigrants.

The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency's traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.

The county says $323 million has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff's department's progress and the agency's compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352 million by July 2026.




The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff's office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case's monitor.

The report concluded 72% of the $226 million in spending by the sheriff's office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or “improperly prorated” to a compliance fund.

Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.”

Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff's office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.

Sheriff Jerry Sheridan's office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.

Raul Piña, a longtime member of a community advisory board created to help improve trust in the sheriff's office, said the report opens up a broader conversation about the integrity of the sheriff's office.

“You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said.

Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn't still be under the court's supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn't still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30 million to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.

The report criticized Maricopa County and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.

Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county's governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board's legal counsel is reviewing the report. “The board has confidence in MCSO's budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said.

Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff's office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency's also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn't yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association, said Thursday that he opposes sending National Guard troops across state borders without the permission of the state receiving them.

The position from a sitting Republican official posed a rare rebuke of President Donald Trump's push to send National Guard troops to cities in states where Democrats are in charge, including Chicago where Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker are fighting in court to try to halt the deployment of Texas Guard members.

The administration is also trying to send California troops into Portland, Oregon.

Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, said he supports Trump's effort to help impose law and order in some cities and to aid federal agents removing immigrants who have committed crimes, but that National Guard troops from one state should not be deployed to another over the objection of the receiving state's governor.

“When it's governors working together, it's a very different story, but this whole situation where one state's governor is sending their national Guard troops over the objections of another state's governor, that sets a very dangerous precedent,” Cave said.

Speaking to The New York Times on Thursday, Stitt said “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

Stitt drew one key distinction: While he opposes sending groups across state lines where they're not welcomed by the governors, he said that Trump should have federalized National Guard from Illinois instead to protect federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. That's the approach Trump took over the summer went he sent National Guard to Los Angeles during protests there.




The National Governors Association, a bipartisan group, has experienced turmoil, with Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatening to leave the organization because of its silence over the troop deployments. The organization has still not taken a stance.

Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said on Thursday he was “incredibly disappointed” that the NGA hadn't taken a more forceful stand in opposition to the Trump administration's deployments.

“In the past, it has always stood up for the powers and the rights of governors,” Beshear said during a news conference in Frankfort, Kentucky. “And right now, it's doing nothing as a president is trying to send National Guard into states over the objection of the governors and doing so unlawfully.”

He also gave a blistering critique of the Trump administration's decision to deploy troops into cities over local opposition.

“We don't militarize our communities,” Beshear said. “It's one of the tenets of our very founding. What Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are doing is wrong. It is un-American.”

Stitt's position puts him at odds with the state's Republican Attorney General and officials in most other Republican-controlled states.

Oklahoma's Gentner Drummond was among 20 Republican attorneys general who filed a brief Wednesday supporting Trump's administration in its legal battle to allow him to deploy Oregon and California National Guard troops in Portland.

In the filing, they say the president needs to be able to federalize National Guard and send troops to Oregon so that federal immigration resources are not diverted there. “Otherwise, states will continue to bear the costs of nonenforcement of federal immigration laws,” they said.

Most Republican-controlled state including Oklahoma, have also requested permission to file similar papers in the Illinois court case.

The Democratic attorneys general or governors of 24 states also filed jointly Wednesday to side with California and Oregon.

There's a similar partisan split over the use of troops in Washington, D.C.

Journalist and author Alex Berenson explains the dangers of cannabis as celebrity athletes call on President Donald Trump to reform marijuana laws. 

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday signed an executive order banning THC-containing beverages, gummies and other "intoxicating hemp."

Retailers in the Buckeye State will be required to remove all gummies, beverages, cookies and other products containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) — the main psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant — from shelves by Oct. 14.

"Intoxicating hemp products are known to have significant impacts on young, developing brains, yet these products are legally marketed to kids, sold to kids and ingested by kids in Ohio," DeWine stated in a press release.

Exposure during adolescence, while the brain is still developing, has been linked to poorer learning, memory and attention problems, as well as changes in brain development, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

Intoxicating hemp is made by manipulating compounds found in hemp plants to create toxic compounds like delta-8-THC and delta-9-THC.

Exposures to these compounds among those aged 19 and younger increased to 994 from 419 between 2021 and 2024, according to Ohio Poison Control (OPC).

Among children 5 and under, the number of exposures nearly tripled between 2021 and 2024, going from 202 to 555.

About 90% of children 12 and under who were exposed to THC ended up in the emergency room, with two-thirds requiring hospitalization, per the OPC.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital that the problem stems from lack of regulation of cannabis products.

"This ban is temporary but appropriate given the dangers."

"The 2018 Farm Bill opens up a Pandora's box, where hemp products are used to justify unregulated use of THC gummies, drinks and intoxicating hemp products," he added.

The 2018 Farm Bill, or the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, legalized industrial hemp at the federal level.

"This ban is temporary but appropriate given the dangers," Siegel said.

DeWine noted that when Ohioans voted to legalize marijuana, they only voted for licensing dispensaries to sell products to those 21 or older.

"Intoxicating hemp completely bypasses these laws, and we must do more to keep these products away from kids," the governor said.

Any THC-containing products must be returned to the manufacturer or handed over to law enforcement, the order states.

Retailers who break the order could face a $500 fine per day if the products are still offered for sale, and the Ohio Department of Agriculture will have the authority to confiscate any of the products.

A federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia has handed down an indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James, bringing one charge of bank fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The investigation into James follows allegations that she misrepresented a Virginia residence as her “principal residence” in 2023 in order to secure favorable mortgage terms while serving as New York's top law enforcement official.

The investigation was prompted, in part, by a referral from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who alleged James “falsified records” to obtain preferential financing.

The indictment of James, a Democrat who has clashed with President Donald Trump in high-profile legal battles, follows months of speculation about whether prosecutors would be willing to bring a charge in response to Pulte's allegations.

James responded to the indictment Thursday evening, saying, “This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

“I am not fearful — I am fearless.”

The single count of bank fraud stems from the same allegations first raised in April, when federal housing regulators accused James of making false statements on mortgage loan applications for a Norfolk, Virginia, property. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Jamar K. Walker, an appointee of former President Joe Biden.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a special attorney to probe the mortgage allegations after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte referred the matter to the Justice Department. At the time, prosecutors expressed skepticism that they had sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.

Trump later appointed Lindsey Halligan, one of his personal attorneys, as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, placing her in charge of the office that is now also handling the recent indictment against former FBI Director James Comey and now the New York attorney general.

“The scheme involved falsely representing the [Virginia] Property as a secondary residence to obtain favorable mortgage terms, while using it as an investment property with no intended or actual personal occupancy or use by her,” the five-page indictment, signed by Halligan, reads. It goes on to say James knew the property was used as an investment property with no intent to use or occupancy by her.

Notably, James sued the Trump Organization in civil court in 2023, alleging that Trump manipulated the value of his assets on paper in order to obtain favorable loans and insurance premiums. In August, a New York appeals court found the nearly $500 million penalty imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron in the civil fraud case was “excessive” and threw it out, though Engoron's underlying verdict that Trump was liable for fraud was allowed to stand. James is appealing that decision. 

In response to targeted acts against him, like the civil fraud case, Trump has repeatedly called for the prosecution of political adversaries, including James Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). “We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote on Truth Social less than a week before Comey's indictment.

The bar for indictment before a grand jury is considerably lower than the threshold required to secure a conviction at trial.

Democrats swiftly denounced the indictment as an act of political retaliation. Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said Thursday that the country was witnessing “nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,” while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) decried it as “baseless” and “part of Donald Trump's corrupt weaponization of the criminal justice system against anyone who has sought to hold him accountable.”

“Donald Trump continues to disgrace the presidency and the Department of Justice,” he added. “Those sycophants who aid and abet the President's vengeful schemes will not be able to hide from the serious legal consequences of their behavior. They will be held accountable.”

FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC NEW YORK OFFICES CLOSE OVER AG JAMES'S ‘CORRUPT' ACTIONS

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) celebrated the news, calling the indictments “long overdue.”

“For years, Letitia James has illegally weaponized her office to conduct a political witchhunt against Democrats' political opponents most notably President Donald J. Trump,” she added, saying James “now faces allegations of committing the very type of financial misrepresentation she baselessly pursued against President Trump.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise joins ‘America Reports' to discuss Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's reaction to the ongoing government shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., appears to be holding firm on his strategy for pressuring Senate Democrats to agree to end the government shutdown, he indicated in both public and private comments Thursday. 

But even as he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., continue with their plans, some House GOP lawmakers are growing nervous about the potential fallout.

House Republicans held a private call Thursday where Johnson briefed them on the current state of play. And while GOP lawmakers were largely unified behind their leader, Fox News Digital was told, several did express concerns about optics coming from the House and Senate as the shutdown is poised to enter a tenth day.

Johnson had previously canceled House votes this week to keep national attention on Democrats' resistance to the GOP's plan to fund the government. 

SENATE GOP RESISTS 'NUCLEAR OPTION' AS DEM SHUTDOWN STANDOFF DEEPENS

The speaker told House Republicans he would give them 48 hours' notice before the next House votes were called but did not say when that would be, Fox News Digital was told — after publicly stating multiple times that their return would depend on Senate Democrats.

He said on CNN's "State of the Union" on Wednesday: "As soon as [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.] decides to stop playing games, we'll bring everybody back here and get right back to regular session."

But at least three House Republicans are advocating for the chamber to return next week whether the shutdown is resolved or not, including two on the Thursday call.

Reps. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., and Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., both spoke up in favor of returning next week, sources told Fox News Digital.

SENATE DEMOCRATS DEFY WHITE HOUSE WARNINGS, AGAIN BLOCK GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT

Obernolte told Johnson the House had more work to do beyond spending bills, adding, "None of that is getting done," Fox News Digital was told.

"I think we're going to get to a point where it's damaging to continue to keep the House out of session. I think we've gotten to that point," Obernolte said, Fox News Digital was told.

Fedorchak said she believed House Republicans would be in a better strategic position if they were in D.C., sources said.

But Johnson reiterated his 48-hour pledge and said a recess next week was not a "final call" but pointed out that most House Republicans thought it was the right decision, sources said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., made his concerns public on Wednesday, writing on X, "What the House has done is pass a 7-week Continuing Resolution. The entire reason a CR is necessary is that Congress has not done its job in passing a timely budget. The Speaker shouldn't even think about canceling session for a third straight week."

On the Thursday call, Johnson also indicated he would not hold a standalone vote on keeping the military paid during the shutdown, sources said.

The speaker argued it was a push led by Democrats who were seeking political cover despite rejecting the GOP's funding plan — which would keep the military paid and the entire government open through at least Nov. 21.

As it stands, service members on active duty are deemed "essential" and must keep working, but they could miss their next paychecks on Oct. 15 if the shutdown is ongoing.

"The entire government has to be reopened simultaneously," Johnson said, sources told Fox News Digital.

But that's also been met with some concern by House lawmakers.

Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., who is leading a bill to ensure troops are paid during a shutdown, wrote on X Wednesday, "The President has made it clear: we must pay our troops. I'm urging the Speaker and our House leadership to immediately pass my bill to ensure our service members, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck while supporting their families, receive the pay they've earned."

Meanwhile, two other House Republicans — Reps. John Rutherford, R-Fla., and Tom Barrett, R-Mich. — spoke up during lawmakers' call on Thursday with concerns about the Senate GOP not moving to bypass Democrats altogether to reopen the government.

Under current Senate rules, most legislation needs to meet a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster and allow for debate.

But there have been several exceptions made in modern times, triggered by the Senate majority leader, in which rules have been changed to lower the threshold to 51 votes for certain issues. Senate Republicans most recently used it earlier this year to overcome Democrats' blockade on President Donald Trump's nominees.

However, Federal funding legislation still needs 60 votes, something Rutherford and Barrett said the Senate should consider changing.

Rutherford specifically warned he was concerned it could open Republicans up to "bad messaging" if the Senate did not use the so-called "nuclear option" to ensure the military was paid on time when it was used so recently for presidential nominees.

Johnson, as leader of the House of Representatives, does not have a say over what the Senate does. But he addressed a similar query during a Q&A with Americans on C-SPAN Thursday morning.

"The filibuster is a tradition there that people on both sides cherish, and the reason is if you blow that up, and you go nuclear on something like a CR, their argument is you would open a Pandora's box," Johnson said.

"What if the socialists take over the Senate, and Democrat socialists are in charge, and they want to grow government to take over the means of production, and they don't have any safeguard there, and they could do it with a bare-minimum majority next time?"

The government shutdown is poised to roll into a tenth day on Friday after Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's funding plan a seventh time.

Republicans are pushing a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 funding levels, called a continuing resolution (CR), to give lawmakers more time to reach a deal on FY2026 spending levels.

But Democrats, infuriated at being sidelined in the discussions, are demanding serious concessions on healthcare provisions in exchange for their support for a spending deal.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.

The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can't get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage. 

But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.

That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.

The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.




“The kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That's why we're taking action now to continue strengthening California's insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,” Newsom said in a statement.

Republican state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil said the measure was a good step to help stabilize the FAIR Plan.

“This bill doesn't solve everything. But it does help to ensure that the FAIR Plan customers can rely on coverage in their time of greatest need,” she said in September during a floor debate.

Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board. 

Supporters, including the state's top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.

California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.

Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.

U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready to be moved in to Gaza when they are given a green light.

President Donald Trump praised the “momentous” Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday, saying the “complicated” hostage release may happen Monday or Tuesday. Speaking during his Cabinet meeting, the president said he may travel to Egypt for the signing ceremony.

Some residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem woke up Thursday with hope and joy after Israel and Hamas had agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting and release the hostages.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet late Thursday to approve a pause in the devastating two-year war with Hamas, ahead of a government meeting to approve the release of Palestinian prisoners. Both the ceasefire deal and the release of prisoners are expected to pass with wide margins, even if far right ministers vote against it. (AP video by Moshe Edri)

The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war.

CAIRO (AP) — Israel and Hamas have agreed to a pause in their devastating two-year war and the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners — a breakthrough greeted Thursday with joy and relief but also caution.

Uncertainty remains about aspects of the broader ceasefire plan advanced by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump — such as whether and how Hamas will disarm and who will govern Gaza. But the sides appear closer than they have been in months to ending a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, reduced much of Gaza to rubble, brought famine to parts of the territory and left dozens of hostages, living and dead, in Gaza.

The war, which began with Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has also triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies. 




Some 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led assault, and 251 were taken hostage. In Israel's ensuing offensive, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and nearly 170,000 wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half of the deaths were women and children.

Even with the agreement expected to be finalized later in the day, Israeli strikes continued, with explosions seen Thursday in northern Gaza. At least 11 dead Palestinians and another 49 who were wounded arrived at hospitals over the past 24 hours, Gaza's Health Ministry said.

An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines said Israel was continuing to hit targets that posed a threat to its troops as they reposition.

A senior Hamas official and lead negotiator made a speech Thursday laying out what he says are the core elements of the ceasefire deal: Israel releasing more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, opening the border crossing with Egypt, allowing aid to flow and withdrawing from Gaza.

Khalil al-Hayya said Israel will release 250 prisoners serving long sentences and about 1,700 people detained in Gaza since the war began. All women and children held in Israeli jails will also be freed, he added. He did not offer details on the extent of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Al-Hayya said the Trump administration and mediators had given assurances that the war is over, and that Hamas and other Palestinian factions will now focus on achieving self-determination and establishing a Palestinian state.

“We declare today that we have reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people,” Al-Hayya said in a televised speech Thursday evening.

In the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, reactions to the announcement of a ceasefire were relatively muted and often colored by grief.

“I am happy and unhappy. We have lost a lot of people and lost loved ones, friends and family. We lost our homes,” said Mohammad Al-Farra. “Despite our happiness, we cannot help but think of what is to come. ... The areas we are going back to, or intending to return to, are uninhabitable.”

In Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages popped champagne and cried tears of joy after Trump announced a deal late Wednesday.

In Jerusalem on Thursday, Sharon Canot celebrated with some others.

“We are so excited this morning. We cried all morning,” she said. “It's been two years that we are in horror.”

Under the terms, Hamas intends to release all living hostages in a matter of days, while the Israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of Gaza, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of an agreement that has not fully been made public. Some 20 of the 48 hostages still in captivity are believed to be alive.

In a short video posted by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump was seen speaking by phone to a group of elated hostage families.

 “They are all coming back on Monday,” said Trump, who is expected in the region in the coming days.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to convene his smaller Security Cabinet and then the full Cabinet to approve the deal.

Hamas called on Trump and the mediators to ensure that Israel fully implements the troop withdrawal, the entry of aid into Gaza and the exchange of prisoners. Hamas officials said nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners are to be released, including 250 serving long sentences, while the rest are people who were detained during the war in Gaza.

The days ahead could be politically tricky for Netanyahu, who has been shadowed by an ongoing corruption trial as he navigated the Gaza war.

His grip on power has been largely contingent on the support of hard-line, far-right coalition partners who have urged him to continue operations against Hamas until the group is eliminated.

But Trump on Thursday suggested Netanyahu's political standing has been bolstered by the ceasefire and hostage deal.

“He's much more popular today than he was five days ago,” Trump said. “I can tell you right now, people shouldn't run against him. Five days ago, might not have been a bad idea.”

The deal being submitted to Israel's government and then expected to be signed in Egypt will include a list of prisoners to be released and maps for the first phase of an Israeli withdrawal to new positions in Gaza, according to two Egyptian officials briefed on the talks, a Hamas official and another official.

Israel will publish the list of the prisoners, and victims of their attacks will have 24 hours to lodge objections.

The withdrawal could start as soon as Thursday evening, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be publicly named speaking about the negotiations. The hostage and prisoner releases are expected to begin Monday, the officials from Egypt and Hamas said, though the other official said they could occur as early as Sunday night.

Five border crossings would reopen, including the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing 400 trucks in the initial days and increasing to 600 trucks after that, the Egyptian and Hamas officials said.

The Trump plan calls for Israel to maintain an open-ended military presence inside Gaza, along its border with Israel. An international force, comprised largely of troops from Arab and Muslim countries, would be responsible for security inside Gaza. The U.S. would lead a massive internationally funded reconstruction effort.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that Turkey will “hopefully take part in the task force that will monitor the implementation of the agreement on the ground.” Turkey, which has close ties to Hamas, helped broker the deal, along with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.

The plan also envisions an eventual role for the Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to undergo a sweeping reform program that could take years. 

The Trump plan is even more vague about a future Palestinian state, which Netanyahu firmly rejects.

After the deal was agreed to, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi met Thursday with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Cairo.

In a statement after the meeting, Sissi said he is eager to celebrate the signing of the agreement and reiterated his invitation to Trump to visit Egypt to witness it “in a ceremony befitting the occasion.” Witkoff and Kushner later landed in Israel, according to an official who was not authorized to speak to the media.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Oct. 9, 2025, that "Trump derangement syndrome" has reached pathological levels, while pointing to pregnant moms protesting the administration by taking Tylenol.

"Trump derangement syndrome" has spiraled to pathological levels, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the White House's monthly Cabinet meeting Thursday, pointing to a recent trend of pregnant moms protesting President Donald Trump by taking Tylenol — despite warnings the medicine could be tied to autism. 

"The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left political landscapes, and it is now a pathology," Kennedy said. "That a mother could overwhelm millions of years of maternal instinct to put her baby at risk." 

Kennedy explained to his colleagues and the media that he watched a video of a pregnant Columbia medical professor ingesting Tylenol on TikTok to protest Trump ahead of the meeting, and was startled that any mom would willingly ingest the over-the-counter pain medication following reports it's allegedly tied to skyrocketing autism trends. 

"Any mother who is taking this up during pregnancy just to get back into Donald Trump is doing something that is, it is pathological," he said. "And we're seeing that across the board."

Trump announced in September while flanked by U.S. health leaders that Tylenol taken during pregnancy "can be associated with a very increased risk of autism." 

Kennedy said during the same event that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are "turning over every stone to identify the ideology of the autism epidemic and how patients and parents can prevent and reverse this alarming trend."

"We have broken down the traditional silos that have long separated these agencies, and we have fast-tracked research and guidance," said Kennedy. "Historically, NIH has focused on almost solely on politically safe and entirely fruitless research about the genetic drivers of autism. And that would be like studying the genetic drivers of lung cancer without looking at cigarettes, and that's what NIH has been doing for 20 years."

Tylenol manufacturer Kenvue said it strongly disagreed with the administration's assessment in comment to Fox Digital in September. 

"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism," a company spokesperson said at the time. "We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."

Fox News Digital reached out to Kenvue Thursday afternoon for additional comment on Kennedy's and Trump's most recent Tylenol remarks but did not immediately receive a reply.

Following the September announcement, liberal pregnant moms began filming themselves taking Tylenol and posting the videos to X and TikTok as a way to protest Trump. Critics have balked at the claims that the common over-the-counter pain medicine is tied to autism. 

"It is so suggestive that anybody who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible," Kennedy continued Thursday.

Kennedy told Trump that, back in 1970, researchers in Wisconsin determined that roughly one in 20,000 eight-year-olds in the state had autism before skyrocketing in the following decades. Kennedy called the increasing autism rates a "national security issue." 

"Now, it's 1 in 12 for boys, 1 in 18, 19 for girls. So obviously there's something, there's something that's artificially, I think, (inducing) something," Trump added.

Kennedy continued that there are a handful of studies pointing to Tylenol's alleged links to autism, including among male babies who are circumcised.

"There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism," he said. "It's highly likely it's because they're given Tylenol." 

Trump added that "there's a tremendous amount of proof" surrounding the claims linking Tylenol to autism, and remarked that he has discussed the increasing autism rate with Kennedy going back 20 years. 

"I've studied this a long time ago," Trump said, noting he himself is not a doctor. "You know, I met Bobby in my office 20 years ago. We were talking about the same thing 20 years ago. And, I was a real estate developer, it bothered me that it seemed to be getting worse. But it's so bad now when you hear these numbers, it's not even really sustainable."

Shabbos Kestenbaum tells 'America Reports' Harvard has 'normalized' antisemitism.

EXCLUSIVE: Mired in controversy over the past week after it was revealed that the school hosted a panel weighing the merits of political violence, Harvard University has several times ignored opportunities to condemn it. 

The Ivy League school has been under the microscope after it was reported that its Carr-Ryan Center for Human Rights hosted a panel in early 2018 where a guest lecturer from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made his case for potential armed political violence. Three Harvard faculty members participated in the panel. 

Since then, Fox News Digital has asked Harvard multiple times whether it condemns political violence. Those requests have all gone unreturned.

UNC PROFESSOR REVEALED ANARCHIST GROUP REQUESTED SECURITY FROM FAR-LEFT GUN CLUB DURING 2017 RIOT

UNC Professor Dwayne Dixon led the panel called "You Don't Stand Around and Let People Get Hurt: Antifascism After Charlottesville" in February 2018. 

Dixon was then a member of Redneck Revolt, an offshoot of the far-left John Brown Gun Club, which, amid last week's controversy, announced it had shut down in 2019. 

He described the "far-right" as "filled with murderous rage," though he never clearly defined the term "far-right." 

During his speech, Dixon framed armed political action in the United States in 2018 in the context of the era of American slavery, when violent means were used to achieve political goals. 

Describing famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Dixon said, "He saw no hope that slavery would ever be abolished by moral or political means."

UNC PROFESSOR REINSTATED AFTER ‘THREAT ASSESSMENT' OF ‘POLITICAL VIOLENCE' CONCERNS, TIES TO FAR-LEFT GUN CLUB

"Douglass is not a victim of some faint-hearted anxiety about the use of force to free slaves and to dispatch those who would threaten their freedom or their lives," he said. "He plainly says the system must be met with its own weapons."

Three Harvard faculty members — education professor Timothy McCarthy, professor of American history and African American studies Vincent Brown and American history professor Lisa McGirr — listened intently to Dixon. 

McCarthy invoked President Donald Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in the context of "fascism," saying that LGBTQ people have "a sense, perhaps quite real, that we are indeed at war and that this is a different kind of phase of war that is more specific, more linked to domestic insurgency of White supremacy, the rise of that, a fascist state under the Trump-Pence regime."

Harvard Professor Timothy McGirr speaks at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in 2018.  (University of Arkansas)

He also referred to the political climate as an "emergent fascist moment with all the signs of that from history that if we're paying attention," and concluded that "this may indeed be a moment that calls for a more robust integration of tactics and strategies that include both violence and nonviolence."

McGirr fawned over Dixon's presentation.

STUDENT UPROAR ERUPTS AT ELITE COLLEGE AFTER PROFESSOR PUT ON LEAVE OVER TIES TO FAR-LEFT GUN CLUB

"This was a beautiful, brilliant, wonderful, very convincing talk. So, you know, I actually came in here relatively skeptical about your use of, you know, coming armed to Charlottesville and what happened in North Carolina," she said. "And, at the end, I'm kind of convinced, actually, you know, that there is a place for this."

Brown, meanwhile, openly suggested that political violence was an obvious solution in a statement that drew laughs from the audience. 

"Many of you are aware of the ongoing vigorous debate over whether it's OK to punch a Nazi. I personally happen to believe that the ethical question was settled by WWII and ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,'" he said in his introduction. 

"All four of [the panel members] are committed to study, interpretation and reasoned debate, but are well aware that deliberation might have distinct limits in the face of opponents who would prefer to see us eliminated," he continued.

When UNC officials were made aware of Dixon's involvement with Redneck Revolt and the panel, the school immediately condemned political violence. 

"The University continues to reaffirm its commitment to rigorous debate, respectful engagement and open dialogue in support of free speech," university spokesman Dean Stoyer told Fox News Digital. "There is no place for or tolerance of inciting or extending sympathy toward violence of any kind within the UNC community."

Harvard refused to follow suit. 

HARVARD FACULTY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR POTENTIAL LEFT-WING POLITICAL VIOLENCE DURING 2018 PANEL

Earlier this week, Fox News Digital reported that a University of Chicago faculty member was arrested for felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor obstruction/resisting charges stemming from an anti-ICE rally Oct. 3.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi, a known entity in the far-left activism world, was taken into custody that day. 

In the wake of the violent charges against her, the University of Chicago also condemned violence.

"Safety is a paramount concern at the University of Chicago. Violence runs contrary to the university's core values of free and open inquiry, dialogue and debate," a school spokesman said. "The university promptly looks into any safety concerns, and takes action if necessary to uphold the safety of the university community." 

Harvard has an institutional neutrality policy, borne out of an "Institutional Voice Working Group" and a subsequent report. It was implemented last year and forbids the school from making specific comments on anything. 

The report says that the "university and its leaders should not, however, issue official statements about public matters that do not directly affect the university's core function."

The report mentions violence in passing. 

"The University places special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which are essential to its nature as an academic community. Among these are freedom of speech and academic freedom, freedom from personal force and violence, and freedom of movement. Interference with any of these freedoms must be regarded as a serious violation of the personal rights upon which the community is based."

Harvard did not return a request for comment Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, both Democrats, should be jailed as they oppose his deployment of National Guard troops for his immigration and crime crackdown in the nation's third-largest city.

Aerial footage showed a large group of demonstrators marching through downtown Chicago Wednesday night, in the wake of President Donald Trump's deployment of federal troops to an Army training center outside the city.

Illinois urged a judge Thursday to order the National Guard to stand down in the Chicago area, calling the deployment a constitutional crisis and suggesting the Trump administration gave no heed to the pending legal challenge when it sent troops overnight to an immigration enforcement building.

The government “plowed ahead anyway,” attorney Christopher Wells of the state attorney general's office said. “Now, troops are here.”

Wells' arguments opened an extraordinary hearing in federal court in Chicago. The city and the state, run by Democratic elected leaders, say President Donald Trump has vastly exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the Guard off the streets.

Heavy public turnout at the downtown courthouse caused officials to open an overflow room with a video feed of the hearing. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson got a seat in a corner of the courtroom.

U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness.” He pointed to an incident last weekend in which a Border Patrol vehicle was boxed in and an agent shot a woman in response.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They're not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

He said some people were wearing gas masks, a suggestion they were poised for a fight, but U.S. District Judge April Perry countered it might be justified to avoid tear gas at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago.




“I, too, would wear a gas mask,” the judge said, “not because I'm trying to be violent but because I'm trying to protect myself.”

Hamilton also tried to narrow the issues. He said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field — not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

Guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and have been activated for 60 days. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a legal challenge to President Trump's Chicago-area National Guard deployment.

Some Guard troops could be seen behind portable fences at the Broadview ICE building. It has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents, but the scene was peaceful, with few people present. 

Wells, the lawyer for Illinois, described the impact of Trump's immigration crackdown in Chicago, noting that U.S. citizens have been temporarily detained. He acknowledged the “president does have the power, and he's using that power.”

“But that power is not unlimited,” Wells added, referring to the Guard deployment. “And this court can check that power.”

Perry told the parties to return to court late Thursday afternoon.

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court heard arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor Paul Young said troops would begin patrolling Friday. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the role.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped the Guard would be used to direct traffic and have a presence in retail corridors, but not used for checkpoints or similar.

Davis said she doesn't want Memphis to “feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities.”

The Trump administration's aggressive use of the Guard was challenged this summer in California, which won and lost a series of court decisions while opposing the policy of putting troops in Los Angeles, where they protected federal buildings and immigration agents.

A judge in September said the deployment was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained on the ground. The judge did not order them to leave. The government later took steps to send them to Oregon.

It's worth celebrating. But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿

At last, Israel and Hamas have reached a deal — of a sort. On Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump announced that the warring parties in Gaza agreed to implement the “first phase” of the peace plan he presented in September. While this doesn't quite mean the war is completely finished just yet, it appears to be an earnest attempt by Israel and Hamas to begin ending two years of bloody conflict, destruction, and despair.

Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. It has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, starved and displaced most of Gaza's 2 million residents, and reduced most of the territory's buildings and infrastructure to rubble.

The fate of the hostages has also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, and Portugal to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's UN General Assembly.

Now we'll find out if the peace can hold, and if so, what the “day after” actually looks like. Wednesday's deal means, the parties say, that all Israeli hostages who are still being held in Gaza will be returned, beginning with those still living, estimated to be around 20 people, as soon as Monday; the remains of the dead Israeli hostages (approximately 30) will reportedly be returned in phases afterward. In exchange Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, approximately 1,700 of whom were captured during the current conflict. Israel also says its army will retreat to an agreed upon line in Gaza as the first part of its withdrawal from the territory.

But most importantly, much is still unknown about the terms of the agreement that Israel and Hamas have reached. We don't know whether Hamas has agreed to completely disarm. We also don't know the extent to which Israeli troops are withdrawing from Gaza, or the timing of that withdrawal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is meeting Thursday to vote on accepting the deal, and the ceasefire has not yet begun; Israeli strikes on the Strip were reported even as celebrations unfolded across both Gaza and Israel.

This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. Indeed, he reportedly had to be strong-armed pretty aggressively by Trump into agreeing to it.

And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. If the deal actually being implemented resembles at all what was first announced by Trump at the beginning of the month, Israel will keep a troop presence in Gaza and the capability to periodically launch future strikes against militants there. Hamas will not control Gaza nor — for the foreseeable future — will the Palestinian Authority. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The seemingly impossible dilemmas faced by the Netanyahu government turned out not to be dilemmas at all.

Lessons will be taken from this, by both Israel and the rest of the world. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future.

It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. The days of “mowing the grass” — degrading Hamas's capabilities without getting embroiled in a long and costly struggle to wipe the group out entirely — were clearly over.

If Israel were to try to put an end to Hamas entirely, international observers had suggestions. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024 that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. But, he suggested, Israel should learn from the relative success of the counterinsurgency tactics the US employed in Iraq after 2007.

The true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out.

“Killing and capturing terrorists and insurgents is insufficient,” Petraeus wrote in Foreign Affairs back then. “[T]he key to solidifying security gains and stemming the recruitment of new adversaries is holding territory, protecting civilians, and providing governance and services to them.”

This is plainly not what Israel did. Commanders weakened safeguards meant to protect noncombatants. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Food aid was, at times, blocked entirely.

Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by the Biden administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans.

It seems likely that the war is going to deal a significant blow to the idea of “counterinsurgency” doctrine: that the best way to deal with an insurgency is to win over the local population — to “clear, hold, and build” your way to victory. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq.

Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments.

In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. But of course, there are caveats. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. As Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal writes, increasingly, “solidarity with the Palestinian cause—and hostility to Zionism—have become the political markers of a new generation.” The full extent of the consequences for Israel may not be evident for years. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel.

And yet, other countries are likely to take the lesson that crushing the enemy is worth the international opprobrium that comes with significant civilian casualties. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. When it comes to crushing a counterinsurgency, you don't have to “clear, hold, build.” You can just crush.

This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering.

The coming days will tell whether this is just a hostage exchange and prelude to a new phase of the conflict, or a lasting peace. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year.

But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. When questioned about the way they conduct those wars, governments are likely to point to Israel's example.

            As the ninth day of the government shutdown wears on, the focus is on how many air traffic controllers show up to work tonight.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages for controllers dealing with airspace in 11 different places Thursday evening, according to a publicly available planning document.
    


            The control tower at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport will have fewer than normal controllers from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET along with Bradley International Airport in Connecticut from 4:25 p.m to 8:45 p.m. ET and Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport in Virginia, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
    


            Two different parts of the airspace controlled by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center will be short-staffed from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and two parts of the Albuquerque center will be short staffed between 7:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. ET. The Washington center, located in Virginia will not have a normal number of staff from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and the Indianapolis center will be short staffed 12:30 a.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET. These areas usually deal with planes flying at higher altitudes.
    


            Newark Approach control, which handles flights approaching or departing the airport, will be short staffed from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET. Delays of nearly 90 minutes are expected. And Orlando International Airport Approach will be understaffed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
    


            Earlier Thursday, a facility in Fort Worth, Texas was also short-staffed for about an hour.
    


            The cause of the staffing problems was not immediately apparent, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said early Thursday on Fox Business a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work.
    


            Every staffing problem reported does not always cause delays since controllers can take other actions, like routing flights to airspace with a normal complement of controllers.
    


            Wednesday six FAA facilities had staffing shortages, including the control towers at Denver International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where about a quarter of the flights were delayed.
    


            “It's a small fraction of people who don't come to work that can create this massive disruption, and that's what you're seeing rippling through our skies today,” Duffy said.
    


            He said normally about 5% of delays are caused by short staffing, but now it's more than half of the delays.
    


            “I think what's happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,” Duffy said, blaming Democrats in Washington for the shutdown.
    


            Monday night, the Hollywood Burbank Airport control tower closed when too many controllers there called out sick. Tuesday, flights in Nashville were delayed and part of the air traffic control operations had to be shifted to another facility across the state when workers took unscheduled time off.
    


            If controllers keep not showing up, Duffy will fire them, he said.
    


            “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don't show up to work… they're the problem children,” he said. “We need more controllers, but we need the best and the brightest, the dedicated controllers, and if we have some on our staff that aren't dedicated like we need, we're going to let them go.”
    


            Controllers are considered essential employees and have to work during the government shutdown, despite not being paid.
    


            It is against the law for controllers to strike or take actions like sickouts, and the air traffic controllers' union has urged members to keep working during the shutdown.
    


            “There are processes and procedures in place to deal with the inappropriate use of sick leave,” the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said responding to Duffy's threats.
    


            Tuesday is the next payday, and controllers will only get a partial check for hours worked before the shutdown.
    


            The government shutdown has not had a “significant impact” on Delta Air Lines' operations, CEO Ed Bastian told Brad Smith in an interview on “CNN Headline Express.”
    


            There were barely any flight cancellations the first week of October, with Delta completing nearly 100% of its flight schedule, Bastian said. Delays were also infrequent, with the airline running on time for 90% of flights.
    


            “As everyone's well aware, the air traffic control system is already understaffed, so I think it's difficult to speculate at this point in time, ‘is it more understaffed than normal?'” Bastian said. “We'll keep our customers posted as always, but I do not anticipate any meaningful issues here.”
    


            Southwest Airlines, which has a large operation in Nashville, Burbank and several of the other cities hard hit by recent staffing problems, said it is monitoring the situation.
    


            Southwest must remain “vigilant in ensuring operational reliability” as air traffic controller staffing is “dynamic and could change rapidly at any ATC facility,” airline leaders wrote Wednesday in a company-wide memo obtained by CNN.
    


            “To date, while we've experienced a few manageable delays and cancellations related to the shortages,” it said. “We'll continue to adjust our schedule, as needed and under the direction of the FAA, to help maintain the safety of our customers and employees.”
    


            United Airlines and American Airlines declined to comment, directing CNN to the industry group Airlines for America.
    


            “When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation's aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group said. “Aviation is the safest mode of transportation, but to maintain that the system may need to slow down.”

President Donald Trump's Cabinet broke out into applause, Oct. 9, 2025, as Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.

President Donald Trump's Cabinet and others at the White House broke out into applause Thursday afternoon when Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. 

"Today we have your Columbus Day proclamation for Monday, which we're signing a bit early," White House staff secretary Will Scharf told Trump Thursday ahead of the monthly Cabinet meeting. 

"Columbus, obviously, discovered the new world in 1492. He was a great Italian explorer. He sailed his three ships, the Nina, the Pinto and Santa Maria, across the Atlantic Ocean, and landed in what's today the Caribbean. And this is a particularly important holiday for Italian Americans who celebrate the legacy of Christopher Columbus, and the innovation and explorer zeal that he represented," he continued. 

AMERICAN HISTORY WON'T BE DISPLAYED 'IN A WOKE MANNER' AT SMITHSONIAN, TRUMP SAYS

Applause was heard breaking out in the room as Trump added: "In other words, we're calling it Columbus Day."

Trump continued in his remarks Thursday saying, "We're back, Italians," as applause continued.

"That was the press that broke out in applause," Trump quipped of the warm reception to the proclamation. "I've never seen that happen. The press actually broke out in applause. Good. Columbus Day. We're back. Columbus Day. We're back, Italians. We love the Italians."

Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1971, following decades of the Italian American community already celebrating the explorer and previous presidents recognizing the holiday with their own proclamations.

Activists in recent years, however, have worked to disassociate the day from Columbus — claiming it celebrates colonialism and genocide of indigenous people — in favor of celebrating Native Americans. Activists also have worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020. 

Former Vice President Kamala Harris was among political leaders who favored celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day, and called on Americans in 2021 to "not shy away" from its "shameful past" of European explorers.

"Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for Tribal nations — perpetrating violence, stealing land and spreading disease," she said just one day after Columbus Day 2021. "We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on Native communities today."

Trump also signed another proclamation Thursday honoring Viking explorer Leif Erikson on Oct. 9. Erikson is credited with discovering the coast of Newfoundland in Canada more than 1,000 years ago and is considered the first European to step foot on North America.

Live Updates


• Hearings latest: A hearing in a California court over deploying National Guard troops to Oregon has adjourned. Meanwhile, in Chicago, a judge is hearing arguments as the city and state contend that President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the city.
    


• The courtroom showdowns: The hearings could determine the fate of Trump's National Guard deployments in two major American cities, potentially setting a precedent for future federal intervention in local law enforcement and civil liberties.
    


            • National Guard in Chicago: Texas guardsmen have started their mission in the greater Chicago area, according to US Northern Command, as Illinois lawyers argue Trump is exceeding his authority in federalizing them. About 500 National Guard members – 300 from Illinois and 200 from Texas – are tasked with protecting ICE and other personnel.
    


            • Portland: National Guard troops remain blocked by several court orders from deploying in Oregon. State officials and the Trump administration argued in a California court today over whether troops from other states should be allowed to deploy in Oregon.
    


• Anti-ICE protests continue: Rallies outside ICE facilities in Broadview, a Chicago suburb, and in Portland go on despite large perimeters and heavy security. The Trump administration is tying planned deployments in Chicago and Portland to the increasingly tense protests after weeks of pushing an effort to fight crime in what the president has described as violence-ridden Democratic-led cities.
    


            An appeals court hearing on whether the Trump administration should be blocked from federalizing the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland has concluded.
    


            The hearing, originally scheduled for 40 minutes, lasted more than an hour as the three judges pressed both sides with questions about the law and the impact of the protests on federal agents.
    


            “The case will be taken under advisement, and we'll respond as quickly as we're able,” said Judge Ryan D. Nelson.
    


            President Donald Trump should first consider more law enforcement options to deal with protests in Portland, Oregon, before sending a military presence, the state said in arguments before an appellate court Thursday.
    


            Federal law enforcement has plenty of officers who could respond to any perceived threat before the need for the National Guard, said Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin.
    


            ”We have a ton of law enforcement agencies under the President's control,” Chaffin said, adding that responding to threats “is their job. That's what they do.”
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee – pushed back, adding that it is counterintuitive to suggest the City of Portland can tell the president how to respond to threats.
    


                    ”The problem that I have with this argument, that I'm just trying to struggle with is, the President gets to direct his resources as he deems fit,” Nelson said. ”It just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say, ‘No, you need to do it differently.'”
                





            An appeals court judge who strongly challenged concerns from the state of Oregon about the legality of National Guard deployment to a Portland ICE facility also acknowledged worries about a dangerous precedent being set.
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said he was not “trying to diminish” concerns to arguments that the National Guard's deployment is a “slippery slope” when pushing back on several arguments from Oregon's attorney.
    


            “I'm not trying to diminish that,” Nelson said of the concern of unlawful use of troops. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now.”
    


            “All we have is a document that says, ‘We have a federal facility under attack or that violence has forced to close down, and we want to protect it,'” Nelson added. “That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused local and state law enforcement officials she met with in Portland of being “dishonest” and “disingenuous” in remarks during Thursday's Cabinet meeting at the White House.
    


            “I was in Portland, went out back with the governor, the mayor, met with the chief of police and the superintendent of the highway patrol,” Noem said.
    


                    “They are all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people. Because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response.” 
                





            Noem visited Portland Tuesday, meeting with local officials and touring an ICE facility just days after a Trump-appointed judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon.
    


            The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers.
    


            National Guard troops remain blocked by court orders from deploying in Oregon as state officials and the Trump administration argue in a California court today over whether troops from any state should be allowed.
    


            The attorney representing the state of Oregon and city of Portland in their legal battle against the Trump administration said protests in Portland do not rise to a level that gives the president the legal right to send the military.
    


            In attempting to focus on the legal definition of rebellion used to justify the National Guard's deployment, Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin said rebellions “are unusual and extreme emergencies.”
    


            “If we're comparing it to an invasion from a foreign power, that's something that goes to the heart of the safety of our country,” Chaffin said.
    


            A situation should be considered a rebellion when circumstances arise “which may be vital to the existence of the Union,” she added.
    


            Chaffin argued that any difficulties federal agents have experienced carrying out the laws are due to a lack of personnel more than violence.
    


            “We have declarations (from federal officers) that say ‘we're short staffed,'” Chaffin said.
    


            “(The argument that) we're having administrative difficulties because we don't have enough people – that is not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other city in the United States,” Chaffin said.
    


            Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said there doesn't need to be an “actual rebellion” for President Donald Trump to federalize the National Guard, and their deployment is lawful.
    


            The plaintiff's argument that the move targets sanctuary city laws is “wrong,” Hamilton said.
    


            “The argument also makes no sense when considering the federalization of Guardsmen in California,” he said, adding the force has since been responsibly “drawn down.”
    


            As the state of Oregon began its argument in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals over whether President Donald Trump can federalize the Oregon National Guard to deploy to Portland, an attorney almost immediately got into a dispute over the severity of protests at an ICE processing facility that has been the site of protests for months.
    


            Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee to the appellate court – shot back when Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin cited the lower court's finding that protests at the Portland ICE facility were small and peaceful, calling it “clearly erroneous.”
    


            Chaffin said the judge who put deployments on hold found “that the Portland ICE facility protests were small, less than 30 people, largely sedate and generally peaceful.”
    


            “Okay, hold on that,” Nelson said. “I mean that that's clearly erroneous, because there's clearly been protests that were above 30. Unless you're trying to limit it to certain time periods, we have evidence in the record that there were protests as much as 200.”
    


            “It was generally small,” Chaffin said.
    


            The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers.
    


            DOJ attorney Eric McArthur said the Trump administration believes the National Guard can be mobilized in response to violence and threats against federal agents.
    


            “The legal question,” McArthur said, is whether the law “authorizes the president to call up the National Guard when violence and threats of violence directed at federal officials and facilities has significantly impeded federal law enforcement and required an unsustainable diversion of the regular forces in order to contain it.”
    


            McArthur said the administration does not disagree with the lower court judge's factual findings about the case, but says the dispute is over “whether that risk suffices to invoke the statute” allowing President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard.
    


            Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur argued that deploying troops in Portland is legally justified, saying 115 federal officers have been sent to protect the city's ICE facility.
    


            “The key evidence in this case,” McArthur said, is “the violence, the threats of violence that have occurred at this facility, and the unsustainable and unsafe, diverse diversion of the government's limited protective resources that has been necessary to contain the violence there.”
    


            Those officers, part of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service — which specializes in protecting federal buildings — have been stretched too thin in guarding the facility, McArthur said, and “are not equipped to deal with this kind of ongoing, sustained unrest.”
    


            “While the officers are expected to be able to respond to emergencies, they are not expected to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, which has become the norm,” he added.
    


            An attorney for Chicago and the state of Illinois said some of the conduct by protesters against officials is, “of course deplorable,” and the defendants are asking for a degree of deference.
    


            The case is not about what the president says in the media and on social media, and the court should “take the president at his word when it has been unfiltered by his attorneys.”
    


            What the president has done to Illinois is “lawless,” the attorney said. “We ask the court to rest the balance in Illinois.”
    


            An appeals court panel quickly got into legal details of when a president can take control of the National Guard during Thursday's hearing over efforts to deploy troops to Portland, Oregon, asking a Trump administration attorney what he thinks the word “rebellion” means in the law.
    


            “I think one defined the term to mean a deliberate, organized resistance by force and arms to the laws and operations of the government,” Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur said.
    


            Leaders in Oregon and Portland have said the unrest outside an ICE building in Portland does not constitute a riot that could give President Donald Trump power to federalize the Oregon National Guard.
    


            “The statute doesn't actually require any rioting, contemporaneous or otherwise, in order for the president to be able to invoke this statute,” said McArthur.
    


            An attorney for the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago rejected White House arguments for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago as “audacious.”
    


            “Rebellion. Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” he said. He went on to say, “There is no rebellion in Illinois,” an attorney for the state said.
    


            “That is such an audacious claim,” the attorney said.
    


            A three-judge appeals panel is now hearing arguments from the Trump administration, which says a lower court order that blocks the president's federalization of the Oregon National Guard should be overturned.
    


            A military presence is necessary at an ICE facility in Portland in order to “contain the violence,” according to Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur.
    


            “For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,” McArthur said.
    


            A federal judge in Chicago is hearing from both sides as the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois argue President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the Windy City.
    


            Unlike Portland, the judge in the Chicago case declined to issue a temporary restraining order immediately, noting she didn't have time to go through hundreds of pages of legal filings.
    


            While the Federal Protective Service has authority in most federal buildings, the US Marshals Service – not the National Guard – has primary responsibility for security at the Chicago courthouse where today's hearing will be held, the city's federal court chief judge said in a statement today.
    


            “At no point did I, nor did the Building Security Committee authorize or request the National Guard's assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall said in a statement to CNN.
    


            The judge has added additional security measures, “to allow court operations to proceed, but those measures do not include the National Guard at the Dirksen Courthouse,” she said, adding the courthouse remains open and accessible for all matters.
    


Remember: Members of the Texas National Guard have already deployed in the greater Chicago area, an official said Wednesday night, as lawyers prepare for critical court hearings on federalized troops.
    


            With its history of protest and progressive politics, Portland, Oregon, has been a target of President Donald Trump since his first term.
    


            Unlike other Democratic-run cities where the president has tried to send federal troops, the Pacific Northwest city isn't even among the nation's 30 largest metro areas.
    


            Despite Trump's claims that federal troops are needed because the city is “war-ravaged,” Portland did not rank among the 30 U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates last year, according to the Real Time Crime Index — and its violent crime numbers have been dropping.
    


            Trump said he would be watching Portland closely since 2018, when demonstrators set up outside an ICE facility in the city.
    


            Protests erupted in the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020, with thousands rallying for more than 100 days. Without approval from local leaders, Trump sent more than 700 officers from federal agencies. Oregon's attorney general at the time sued the federal government in response.
    


            As protests have continued in the city this year over the administration's immigration actions, Trump escalated his response by calling in National Guard troops. The protests are ongoing, as a legal battle unfolds over Trump's federalization of the National Guard in Oregon.
    


            National Guardsmen were seen Thursday morning patrolling the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.
    


            CNN is at the scene and captured video of two guardsmen making laps around the facility.
    


            Overnight, Texas National Guard troops were seen entering the building. Some wheeled luggage while others carried riot shields as they arrived at the facility.
    


            A defense official said Thursday that a small contingent of California National Guardsmen are joining the Texas National Guard and Illinois National Guard in Illinois to assist with ongoing pre-mission training.
    


            Separately, in a declaration filed in federal court Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Niave Knell wrote that 14 members of the California Guard had arrived in Illinois on October 7 to assist with the training.
    


            CNN reported Wednesday that 200 Texas National Guard and 300 Illinois National Guard were assembling in the Chicago area on Tuesday, the same day the California troops arrived.
    


            The defense official said the group of California Guardsmen were sharing best practices and lessons learned from their mobilization in Los Angeles over the summer. The California Guardsmen are working in coordination with US Army North, the defense official said.
    


            Troops from the Texas National Guard were seen entering the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, near Chicago, overnight, as a federal judge is preparing to hear arguments on whether a military callup is legal.
    


            Video taken by a freelance journalist showed men in fatigues with a Texas National Guard patch and carrying riot shields and luggage entering the facility, which has been a flashpoint for clashes between protesters and federal law enforcement. Two Guardsmen appeared to be adding fuel to a generator.
    


            The Texas Guardsmen are now deployed on their official mission of protecting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel in the Chicago area, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday night.
    


            Texas troops were seen earlier this week staging at an Army training facility in Elwood, about 40 miles from the ICE building. A photo tweeted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this week showed guardsmen carrying riot shields as they prepared to board a transport plane.
    


            Judge April Perry declined earlier this week to issue an order that would block the National Guard deployment in Chicago, saying she first wanted to hear arguments from both sides at a hearing Thursday.
    


            As major courtroom decisions loom today to determine whether National Guard deployments will go forward, the key question is: Who gets to make that decision? CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said.
    


                    “We've seen reasonable people disagree about whether the situations … on the ground in Portland, in Chicago, constitute an emergency or not,” Honig said. “The key question becomes when will the court actually come in and overrule the president?”
                





For context: Texas Guardsmen have started their mission in the Chicago area, according to US Northern Command. Meanwhile, National Guard troops are still blocked through court orders in Oregon.
    


            The judge who's going to be hearing the case in Illinois today has told both parties the court wants details about when, where and how the troops will be deployed, Honig said.
    


            As for talk of President Donald Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, Honig said he thinks “that's more just lurking in the background as a next step,” adding, “the president might take a more dramatic invocation of law that actually would involve the entire military, not just the National Guard.”

            All the hostages still held in Gaza are set to be released as soon as Monday under the first phase of a ceasefire plan agreed by Hamas and Israel, US President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday.
    


            More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014, when he was killed and his body taken to the strip.
    


            The Israeli government has said 26 of the 48 hostages are deceased, although the status of two others – Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi – remains uncertain. The government previously expressed “grave concern” over their fates.
    


            The hostages who are believed to be alive are all men and all but one are in their 20s and 30s. Women, children and men over the age of 50 were released under previous ceasefire agreements.
    


            One woman, Inbar Hayman, is among the 26 in Gaza who have been declared dead.
    


            Of those still believed to be living or whose status is unknown, 11 were taken from the Nova music festival. Eight were kidnapped from several kibbutzim, or small communities, in southern Israel, including two foreigners who worked on Israeli farms. Three are Israeli soldiers – two were kidnapped from military bases and one from a tank.
    


            Here is what we know about them.
    


            Twin brothers Ziv and Gali Berman were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Kfar-Aza during the October 7 terror attack. They were 26 at the time. Speaking to CNN in February, their mother Liran Berman said other hostages who had been released had told the family the brothers were alive and separated from each other.
    


            Several of the hostages were kidnapped alongside friends and family members, some of whom have since returned home.
    


            Brothers Ariel and David Cunio were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, alongside Ariel's partner Yehoud, David's wife Sharon, and their three-year-old twin daughters, Yuli and Emma. Sharon, Yuli and Emma were released under a ceasefire agreement in November 2023, while Yehoud was freed earlier this year.
    


Eitan Horn was visiting his brother Iair when they were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz. Iair was released earlier this year. A propaganda video showing him saying goodbye to Eitan was released by Hamas in March. The Horn family said that seeing him in the video “broke their hearts.”
    


            “Since Iair returned to us, he hasn't stopped thinking about and working for Eitan and all the other hostages he met in captivity who are still there,” the family said in a statement.
    


Matan Zangauker and his partner Illana Gritzewsky were kidnapped from the same kibbutz as the Horn brothers. Gritzewsky, a Mexican national, was released on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal, while Zangauker was left behind.
    


Omri Miran, then 46, was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family's home in kibbutz Nahal Oz. In April 2024, Hamas put out a video showing Miran, alongside American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who has since been released.
    


Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David are childhood best friends who were kidnapped together from the Nova Music Festival. In February 2025, Hamas filmed Gilboa-Dalal and David watching other hostages being released, posting the video to Telegram.
    


            Gilboa-Dalal's brother Gal told CNN this amounted to psychological torment. “To make them see what freedom might look like for them and then close the door and drag them back to hell – it's awful,” he said.
    


Avinatan Or was also kidnapped from the Nova festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in an IDF operation in central Gaza in June 2024. She revealed that they had been separated during the abduction.
    


Alon Ohel, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, Elkana Bohbot, Segev Kalfon, Maxim Herkin, Eitan Abraham Mor, Bar Kupershtein and Rom Braslavski were also kidnapped from the Nova festival.
    


            Ohel, Ohana, Bohbot, Braslavski and Mor were all seen helping wounded victims at the site before their abduction.
    


            The IDF soldiers Nimrod Cohen, Matan Angrest and Tamir Nimrodi are among the youngest still held in Gaza.
    


            Cohen appeared in a Hamas propaganda video posted online on March 1 this year. His family was able to identify him thanks to a tattoo on his arm, his mother Vicky Cohen told CNN. “We recognized Nimrod because of that tattoo. Otherwise, I wouldn't recognize him because you couldn't hear his voice or see his face,” she told CNN.
    


Bipin Joshi, a Nepali student, was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. His family said earlier this week that a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity was recently recovered by the Israeli military in Gaza.
    


            The video is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi's kidnapping. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family said the video had given them “unwavering faith” that Joshi is alive.
    


            Israeli officials had previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi.
    


            Besides Joshi, four other foreign nationals are still held in Gaza, three of them from Thailand and one from Tanzania.
    


            Three of the four – Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania – have been declared dead by the Israeli government. An unnamed Thai citizen is believed to be alive.
    


            The bodies of the 26 hostages who have been declared dead by the government are also set to be returned as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday.
    


            However, three Israeli sources told CNN that Hamas may not know the location of, or may be unable to retrieve, the remains of some of them. According to one source, that is thought to be the case for between seven and nine of the deceased hostages, while another source put the figure at between 10 and 15.
    


Inbar Hayman was kidnapped from the Nova festival. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced in December 2023 that she had been killed by Hamas while in captivity. She remains the only female hostage still in Gaza.
    


            At least 13 of the deceased hostages whose remains are still in Gaza were killed during the terror attacks on October 7, 2023 and their bodies then taken to the enclave.
    


            They include several Israeli soldiers, including two who were dual US and Israeli citizens – Omer Maxim Neutra from Long Island, New York, and Itay Chen.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine will nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he provides long-range Tomahawk missiles and helps secure a ceasefire with Russia.

“During our most recent meeting, I didn't hear a ‘no.' What I did hear was that work will continue at the technical level and that this possibility will be considered,” Zelensky said of his meeting with Trump at the United Nations General Assembly late last month.

“The plan for ending the war won't be easy, but it is certainly the way forward. And if Trump gives the world — above all, the Ukrainian people — the chance for such a ceasefire, then yes, he should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,” he added. “We will nominate him on behalf of Ukraine.”

Trump has boasted about his role in ending seven wars around the world. That's now tentatively up to eight after his administration helped broker the first stage of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday. The agreement allows for the return of the remaining Israeli hostages and requires Israel to withdraw from most of Gaza.

Before announcing the peace deal, Trump downplayed expectations about receiving the prestigious award on Friday for his peacemaking efforts.

“I have no idea,” he said when asked if he believed he would win. “We settled seven wars. We're close to settling an eighth, and I think we'll end up settling the Russia situation, which is horrible.”

“So I don't think anybody in history has settled that many,” he added. “But perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me.”

The wars that Trump helped end were fought between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.

This year's Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and awarded at a ceremony in Norway on Dec. 10. Nominations for the annual prize closed in January, meaning it's unlikely Trump will get the award this year. However, he may win one in the coming years.

Zelensky, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, believes Trump deserves it if he can help the Russia-Ukraine war come to a peaceful close.

TRUMP ‘ISN'T HOLDING HIS BREATH' OVER THIS YEAR'S NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

Earlier this week, Trump said he had “sort of” decided on whether to send the requested Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, but first wants to know how the weapons will be used.

A spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry warned a shipment of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would lead to a “new serious stage of escalation” in the war.

Political strategists are raising questions about California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter's campaign to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after an unflattering interview resurfaced this week. 

In the CBS appearance, a palpably irritated Porter, viewed as the front-runner among six Democrats vying for the primary win, was scrutinized for threatening to end what she called an “unhappy” interview when pressed on whether she believes she needs the support of Republican voters to win the race. Porter's odds of winning the primary tanked by 20 percentage points, according to some betting markets, and analysts widely agreed it was a “bad night” for the candidate, as critics accused her of partisan, entitled, and generally unlikable behavior. 

Strategists across the board told the Washington Examiner that “one bad interview” isn't likely a “game-changer” for the race. 

But Elizabeth Ashford, a Los Angeles-based strategist who was chief of staff to former Vice President Kamala Harris during her during her time as California attorney general, suggested that while she doesn't see the interview as “a deal breaker moment at all,” campaigns will jump at the opportunity to leverage such incidents “anytime you have, you know, a human moment.” She added that it could send Porter's campaign spinning.

All five of Porter's Democratic rivals, as well as Republican challenger Steve Hilton, used the incident as an opportunity to dig into Porter's lead, issuing statements attacking her for “being afraid to answer simple questions,” “hiding from the press,” and “excluding any votes.” 

Lingering doubts about Porter's candidacy could aid liberal momentum to push Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) into the race, spelling danger for her in the crowded primary battle to win voters. Padilla's entrance into the race as a left-wing Democrat would likely pose the greatest threat to Porter's base, as she is viewed as one of the more liberal candidates campaigning.

“If the Democratic leadership doesn't think that Katie Porter is ready for prime time, [then there is] the push to get Padilla to enter the race,” Republican strategist Matt Clink told the Washington Examiner. “He could immediately become a front row.” 

“Katie Porter is clearly running far left of center,” he said. “So I think Padilla could come in, and he's got a carpet niche that would be left of center.” 

Padilla enjoys comparable name recognition to Porter, which strategists have said is the primary reason she's considered the front-runner. He also made headlines in June when he was detained during a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, garnering him support from liberals frustrated by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Challenges from Padilla and other rumored Democratic contenders, such as businessman Rick Caruso, might not be a problem if it weren't for California's open primary system.

In that structure, candidates for governor, regardless of their political party, are listed on the same ballot — with the top two candidates proceeding to the general election. The vote is already split between seven candidates, bringing the total to nine if Padilla and Caruso hop in. That means there's an ever-shrinking slice of voters for the crowded field of contenders to vie for.

Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff suggested that if controversy over Porter's likeability and media style persists, he believes “it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary,” giving rivals such as former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra a boost. 

“I do see [the CBS interview] perhaps not being a big deal,” he said. “At the same time, now, if there's  several other more current examples of this, where she continues to have moments like that, I do think it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary, especially because it is a competitive primary.”

Hours after Shroff made the comments, more footage of Porter losing it during a media interview resurfaced, adding fuel to the fire. The gubernatorial candidate is seen yelling, “Get out of my f***ing shot!” at a staff member who wandered into the background of an interview video she was recording, in resurfaced clips obtained by Politico. 

For Democrats disillusioned by Porter, “there are other options here, and there's still time,” Shroff said of alternatives, arguing that the race remains wide open as the primary election remains eight months away. 

Clink suggested that the open primary system spells warning signs for Porter's belief that she can pull off a win without the help of any Republican voters. 

“She's assuming that she makes it through the open primary to get into a general election, and then she can ignore Republican voters, but that's a big assumption on her part,” he said, adding she has only “focused Republican attention that OK, we know who they will never vote for Katie Porter now.”

“Let's say you only have two Republican candidates and you have seven or eight Democratic candidates. Let's say that the two Republican candidates split the Republican vote, and let's say that the seven Democratic candidates split the Democratic vote. It's not inconceivable that the top two finishers in the primary could be Republicans. If you just do simple math … I don't think that it's likely, but mathematically, it works,” Clink said.

While nearly 40% of Californians voted for President Donald Trump on the Republican side in the 2024 election, Porter has expressed full confidence that she can emerge as the victor in the governor's race next year because she believes most Democrats will coalesce behind her candidacy in the primary and leave the general election to her and a Republican candidate. With the state leaning majority-Democrat, Porter believes she can pull off a win. 

When asked what she would do if the race ended up between her and another Democrat, in which case the winning candidates would need to secure support of some moderates and Republicans, Porter replied, “I don't intend that to be the case. … I'm going to build the support. I have the support already in terms of name recognition.”

Porter's CBS interview also raised concerns about the likability factor in the gubernatorial race, similar to the scrutiny Harris triggered during the media interviews she granted during her 2024 presidential campaign. 

Shroff warned the CBS kerfuffle was “not really a one-off,” pointing to other public incidents in which Porter has struggled to manage her public image, including when she lost the Senate primary last year to Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and accused him of rigging the election.

“I remember she kind of left on such a sour note in her race against Adam Schiff,” he said. “And definitely interesting to … make the point that if she's willing to do that on camera with a journalist from CBS … what is she like behind the scenes? And I think we kind of have a glimpse of that from several other episodes and moments.” 

Of comparisons between Porter and Harris in the wake of the CBS debacle, Clink suggested it would be unwise for the gubernatorial candidate to follow the former vice president's lead of avoiding the press when it comes to building rapport with voters.

“Porter's next few interviews are going to be heavily scrutinized, and I think that she would be wise to do the opposite of what Kamala Harris did. She should get out and do as many interviews as possible so that she buries the bad CBS interview with decent interviews with other reporters,” Clink said. 

As Porter tries to recoup her image, her challengers are pouncing on the CBS debacle as an opportunity to argue to voters that she's not a strong candidate. 

Former California state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa attacked his rival for trying to exit the tough interview. 

“We need a governor who will work to solve hard problems and who is not afraid to answer simple questions. You can't just throw up your hands and refuse to answer as Katie Porter did,” he told the Washington Examiner. “California faces a lot of big problems, and voters deserve a leader who will answer the questions and speak the truth about how to solve them.”

In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Hilton made a dig at Porter for saying she didn't “need” Trump voters to become California governor.

“Every day, I'm on the road meeting Californians from every background and political stripe. As governor, I'll serve every citizen of this state — whether they voted for the President or not, whether they vote for me or not. It's not about what the politicians ‘need,' California needs a governor focused on improving people's lives, not another career politician looking out for political insiders and allies. And I'm certainly not afraid to talk to the media about it,” the Republican candidate said. 

CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE KATIE PORTER SECURES EMILY'S LIST ENDORSEMENT

Clink believes that at the end of the day, Porter's front-runner status at the head of a stack of nearly 10 candidates is “all well and good” over a year before the election, but all it does is put a big target on your back.” 

“For Katie Porter, I think it just highlights the fact that she has very thin skin,” he said. “She's a very good politician, but she's not a very good retail politician.”

Trump administration officials say their hands were tied over the Food and Drug Administration's decision to greenlight a generic version of the abortion drug mifepristone.

“It's not an endorsement of this drug by any means. They are just simply following the law,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of the FDA on Friday.

HAWLEY SAYS HE WAS ‘MISLED' BY TRUMP FDA PICK OVER ABORTION PILLS

I don't buy this “simply following the law” excuse. Neither do key anti-abortion legislators, including Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who rightly denounced the approval as a “betrayal” of the anti-abortion community that got President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance elected.

And neither does Kelsey Pritchard, the political director of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

“‘Powerless' is not a word that someone uses to describe this administration when they face trouble,” Pritchard told me by phone. “They're known for bucking the status quo. They're known for doing what they need to do to reverse problems.”

Oddly, the FDA issued the approval before it completed its own safety review of the drug, which began in mid-September. An Ethics and Public Policy Center study, showing 11% of users faced “serious adverse events,” prompted Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct FDA Commissioner Marty Makary to review “the latest data.” However, the FDA prematurely issued the approval without the results.

The administration had tools to delay or pause the process despite Leavitt's contrary claims. While Title 21 of the United States Code states that the HHS secretary “shall issue an order approving the application,” that's only if the data provided by the manufacturer meets the standards of safety and effectiveness. Leavitt overstated the law's rigidity as the administration could have cited the ongoing review, not to mention the safety concerns raised by the EPPC, as a cause to delay.

After all, the FDA's primary function is to protect public health by ensuring the safety of medical products. If the agency was concerned enough to start a review, why wasn't it concerned enough to delay approval? The decision defies logic.

The stakes couldn't be higher. It's difficult to imagine a starker “life-or-death” situation than mail-order abortion pills. These drugs take hundreds of thousands of innocent unborn lives each year, as the Guttmacher Institute found that in 2024, 63% of all abortions came from “medication,” totaling roughly 654,000 abortions, which grievously injure and even kill mothers in the process.

It's hard to say how many mothers are damaged by these pills annually. That's because the abortion drug dealers advise women, especially in red states, to lie about the reason for their ER visits, which are known to involve hemorrhages, sepsis, and even death.

The approval also undermines Trump's and Vance's preference for states' rights on abortion. Thanks to mifepristone and its peddlers, abortion is a national issue whether the administration likes it or not. Abortion pill manufacturers ship pills from blue states to red states regardless of the differences in state laws.

By approving a cheap generic abortion pill, HHS and the FDA are essentially aiding Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Kathy Hochul (D-NY) in their quest to subvert anti-abortion laws nationwide. Clinicians in California, New York, and other abortion-rights states are protected by shield laws, allowing them to mail pills interstate without fear of prosecution. Telehealth abortion provider Aid Access reports that 84% of its 118,000 prescriptions went to states with abortion bans. This state of affairs renders state abortion bans meaningless. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization may as well have never happened.

Trump and Vance are surely aware of all this. But sadly, they have little incentive to intervene. Abortion is broadly popular, and opposing it is politically hazardous. And whether they act or not, they'll continue to enjoy the unconditional support of sycophantic organizations in the anti-abortion movement and Christian media, who rarely, if ever, apply pressure, no matter how energetically their administration promotes the culture of death. Trump and Vance know that these organizations and their talking heads will continue to provide cover, convincing their followers that this is “the most pro-life administration in history,” in exchange for access to power.

Tragically, most anti-abortion groups, SBA and Live Action excluded, have devolved into pro-Trump pamphleteering outfits, posting his administration's “wins” and ignoring his mounting pile of anti-life actions.

Do they hold back criticism for fear of not being invited to speak at various “America First” galas? Have Trump and Vance bought their silence with cushy appointments? Do they fear that Vance might no longer occasionally return their texts?

It's impossible to know, but I have no qualms about asking these questions. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, and the Trump administration needs to be pressured to correct course. The time for niceties has passed.

It passed long ago, in fact. 

During the 2024 campaign, Trump dodged direct calls to restrict mifepristone, emphasizing states' rights, which universal access to mifepristone effectively nullifies. He proceeded to remove the call from the Republican Party platform for a constitutional amendment to grant personhood protections to the unborn, and he even waffled on voting for the six-week abortion ban in his home state of Florida.

Vance, meanwhile, has been crystal clear about his commitment to protect abortion rights. On Meet the Press in July 2024, he told host Kristen Welker, “The Supreme Court made a decision that the American people should have access to that medication. President Donald Trump supports that opinion. I support that opinion.”

Welker then asked him to clarify, asking, “Do you support mifepristone being accessible?”

“Yes, Kristen, I do,” he responded.

After his reelection victory, Trump told Time magazine that it was “very unlikely” he would restrict access to mifepristone.

True to his word, Trump soon ordered the Justice Department to preserve access to the abortion pill by defending federal regulations allowing abortion pills to be available online and by mail. The DOJ argued in a filing with a Texas federal court that the three GOP-controlled states suing the agency lacked standing, protecting Biden-era rules easing mifepristone access.

When will the broader anti-abortion community finally blink itself awake from its delusions about Trump and Vance? When will it finally take them at their word about preserving access to mail-order abortion?

TRUMP FDA APPROVES NEW GENERIC ABORTION PILL, ANGERING CONSERVATIVES

The Trump administration is far from the “most pro-life administration in history.” In fact, it's the most anti-life Republican administration since that of Gerald Ford, if not the most anti-life administration in history.

Meanwhile, the culture of death thrives in America, on the coasts, and everywhere in between.

            The Internal Revenue Service began furloughing nearly half its staff Wednesday because of the ongoing government shutdown, sparking chaos and confusion among employees as the news rippled through agency offices around the country.
    


            The agency said in an updated shutdown contingency plan that it was furloughing more than 34,400 of its 74,300 employees on Wednesday. Initially, the IRS said that its entire workforce would remain on the job thanks to funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But it noted in its original contingency plan that staffing would be in place only for the first five business days — and there is no sign that the shutdown that began October 1 is nearing its end.
    


            A prolonged shutdown could cause bigger problems as the October 15 tax filing extension deadline approaches, said Maria Ramos, the National Treasury Employees Union chapter president in Austin, Texas, where she works in paper tax return processing.
    


            “Tax returns will be arriving,” she said, “but there will be no one there to process them.”
    


            In Kansas City, NTEU union chapter president Shannon Ellis described “lots of confusion” Wednesday morning as employees were notified of their status.
    


            An emergency notification system, typically used for weather alerts or building emergencies, sent out a recorded message telling staff that “as of October 8th, you are considered furloughed” unless you receive notification from your manager, Ellis told CNN.
    


            But soon after, Ellis said, managers began calling employees and telling them to “ignore that message” and “keep working as usual.”
    


            Well into the late afternoon, some people still didn't know their status, she said.

            At the IRS and other agencies, some employees must continue working without pay during the shutdown, while other workers are furloughed without pay and stay home. But a third category, “exempt,” has added to the confusion. Employees classified as exempt will continue to work and receive pay, though union leaders say no one has explained where those funds are coming from.
    


            In its updated contingency plan, the IRS said that virtually all of the 39,870 workers who will remain on the job will be compensated by “a resource other than annual appropriations.” In its original shutdown plan, the agency said it could pay its entire workforce with Inflation Reduction Act funds.
    


            The IRA originally gave the agency roughly $80 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funds, to use over 10 years to improve customer service, expand enforcement, update technology and hire more staff. GOP lawmakers have sought to rescind the money ever since — slashing nearly $42 billion from the appropriation.
    


            Ellis said some employees who had been considered essential in previous shutdowns were furloughed this time around, including employees responsible for opening and scanning mailed tax returns and payments, critical paper-processing work. “To my knowledge, all of those people were furloughed,” Ellis said, adding that this was not the case in past shutdowns.
    


            “We were already short-staffed after months of resignations and layoffs,” she added. “Now this.”
    


            The IRS has a heavy workload: It is currently in the midst of putting into place dozens of tax law changes contained in the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including some that take effect this year.
    


            Adding to the confusion, the agency's updated plan said both that the plan could be changed again in five days and also that the staffing levels would be in place until April.
    


            The majority of the employees being retained work in taxpayer services, including customer service representatives, tax examiners and staffers who process tax returns with payments, according to the contingency plan. Also, some revenue agents and tax examiners in the small business division, as well as some local taxpayer advocates, will remain on the job, among other staffers.
    


            Among the significant activities that will cease are taxpayer services, such as responding to taxpayer questions outside of the filing season, and non-automated collections.
    


            In Memphis, where roughly 4,500 IRS employees make up the agency's third-largest union chapter, Gibson Jones, the local NTEU union chapter president and IRS employee, told CNN that the “vast majority” of workers were furloughed Wednesday, leaving only “very limited skeleton crews” across IRS business units.
    


            Like Ellis, Jones said the union has received no clarity on how the agency is deciding who is essential versus nonessential and noted that in prior shutdowns, many of the jobs furloughed Wednesday were treated differently.
    


            “Customer service staff weren't furloughed on the IRS Memphis campus in previous shutdowns,” he said. “This time, the vast majority of them have been sent home.”
    


            According to Jones, about 150 revenue agents and tax collection officers have also been furloughed.
    


            “We're in a government shutdown over money,” Jones said, “and the people who could be out there collecting more money for the federal government have been furloughed. They've essentially halted these revenue and tax collection functions.”
    


            Jones said he expects taxpayers to start feeling the impact immediately: longer hold times on phone lines, more dropped calls, and delays in refunds or processing as the October 15 extension filing deadline approaches.
    


            CNN reached out to both the IRS and Treasury Department, the agency that oversees the IRS, for comment.

            Normally, Treasury's human resources officials coordinate with the union to explain which employees are considered essential. “That's not happening this time,” Jones said.
    


            “Managers are just telling employees one-on-one. The unions have been completely cut out of this.” He added that it's unclear what criteria are being used. “There's no rhyme or reason to who's being told they're furloughed and who's not.”
    


            In Atlanta, NTEU union chapter president, Denise Wells-Gomez said employees received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off.”
    


            Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used, and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave).
    


            One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren't present the day they decide to do an audit.
    


            However, during a staff meeting, the director of the Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave, if approved by their manager. Despite that, employees continued receiving instructions that “no exceptions” would be allowed.
    


            In Austin, Ramos was among those furloughed Wednesday. She said she drove an hour and a half in a carpool to the IRS office, waited around for four hours, and then was told to go home.
    


            “At a time when we're not going to be getting paid, people could've used that gas money,” Ramos told CNN. “That was time wasted and money spent that didn't need to be spent just to sit around for four hours and find out you were furloughed. In past shutdowns, we knew that information in advance.”

A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Oregon National Guard can remain under the Trump administration‘s control.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued the ruling, rebuking the efforts of Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR), who sought to prohibit her state's National Guard troops from being placed under the authority of President Donald Trump. However, the court's decision was not a total loss for Kotek, as it also ruled that troops were not yet allowed to be deployed to Portland, Oregon. The president desired to have troops assist with protecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from violent protesters and in crime prevention efforts.

The three-judge panel stayed the two orders issued by U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut over the weekend, which prohibited Trump from deploying National Guard troops from any state into Oregon. Wednesday's orders are temporary until the court hears arguments for justifications to deploy the National Guard to Portland, which are scheduled for Thursday at 9 a.m. local time, according to reports.

“An administrative stay of the October 4 temporary restraining order will maintain the federalization of Oregon National Guard members, because that order prohibits implementation of the Memorandum,” read court documents. “Additionally, the second temporary restraining order has not been challenged or appealed, and it prohibits the deployment of National Guard members in Oregon.” 

“Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed,” noted the court order.

Protesters have allegedly harassed and demonstrated against law enforcement officers for months at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. The Trump administration has claimed that many of the demonstrators have engaged in violence against ICE officers, necessitating the aforementioned federal deployment of National Guard troops. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, Oregon's governor, and many Democrats in and out of Oregon have rejected such claims, saying the protesters only amount to a small gathering and are mostly peaceful.

Immergut agreed with those suggesting the violence in Portland is minimal, ruling in two hearings over the weekend that the Trump administration did not have a basis to use National Guard troops in Portland. She also categorized the deployment as illegal.

“You have to have a colorable claim that Oregon conditions” require National Guard troop deployment, said Immergut. “You don't. We went over it.”   

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield praised the Ninth Circuit's order prohibiting National Guard troops in Portland.

CHICAGO HAS NO SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY

“Today's order from the Ninth Circuit doesn't change anything on the ground,” Rayfield said in a released statement. “While it keeps the Oregon National Guard under federal status, most importantly, [it] prevents the President from deploying the guard in Portland. That means no unnecessary federal escalation – and that's a win for Oregonians who want calm, not conflict in our communities.”

Thursday morning's hearing should provide legal clarity on Trump's authority to use the National Guard in Portland.

Several high-profile antifa leaders have fled the country or are actively making plans to abscond overseas.

News of their escape comes after President Donald Trump designated antifa as a domestic terrorist threat and directed federal authorities to dismantle terrorism networks operating within the United States.

Mark Bray, a financier of transnational antifa operations and antifa's foremost thought leader in America, announced he is fleeing to Europe, settling in Spain specifically, under the pretext of safety concerns following negative media attention.

THE MEDIA'S GO-TO ANTIFA ‘EXPERT' IS A FINANCIAL BACKER OF ANTIFA

Before his departure, Bray issued an apparent call-to-action, urging widespread militancy. “Only mass antifascism, legal or not, can save us,” Bray declared on Bluesky, a popular platform on the political Left.

Bray, an assistant professor at Rutgers University, will continue teaching classes on “Terrorism” and the “History of Antifascism” remotely, despite a Change.org petition from students calling for his firing.

Derisively dubbed “Dr. Antifa” by critics on campus, Bray openly supports far-left violence in his academic work. Bray's book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, is a how-to guide intended to serve as operational “reference” material for stamping out so-called fascism.

Half of his handbook's proceeds are funneled to the funding arm of Antifa International, which financially supports hundreds of affiliates around the world, including accredited antifa chapters in America, such as Atlanta Antifascists and the Central Oregon Anti-Fascist Action.

By way of its bail fund, Antifa International pays for an array of expenses, not just legal defense fees, from riot-related tactical gear to “emergency relocations.”

“As a precaution,” Antifa International has since shut down its donation infrastructure “to protect our donors and recipients.” The announcement mentioned relocating operations due to Trump's edict, suggesting that the global group's fundraising apparatus is based in the United States. Antifa International accepts donations through standing campaigns on Patreon, FundRazr, and the Action Network, all American fundraising sites.

Trump's clampdown on antifa includes prosecuting, as co-conspirators, individuals suspected of providing material support to terror-listed criminal enterprises.

U.S. intelligence officials are also investigating antifa's international ties and working toward a foreign terrorist classification for antifa abroad. Under U.S. anti-terrorism law, sponsors of foreign terrorists face up to 20 years behind bars, and the federal government can freeze assets, cutting off the funding flow, as part of counter-terrorism sanctions.

ANTIFA MAINTAINS TIES TO INTERNATIONAL NETWORK, AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EYES FOREIGN TERRORIST DESIGNATION

Bray is not the only expat among antifa's ranks seeking shelter in foreign countries.

Independent reporter Christian Peterson recently found the leaders of Rose City Antifa, the most notorious American antifa cell, holed up in Europe.

Caroline Victorin (née Gauld), one of the founding members of the Portland-based antifa faction, was discovered this week hiding with her husband, Johan Victorin, a Swedish-born activist and another Rose City Antifa architect, in the coastal town of Varberg, Sweden.

Together as co-founders of Rose City Antifa, the oldest-known antifa chapter in America, the Victorins reportedly had helped import the European model of antifascist extremism into the U.S.

Peterson, a Swedish investigative journalist covering far-left radicalism, confronted Johan Victorin, who has dual citizenship, outside their residence and asked whether the couple fears federal prosecution in the United States.

“You are a citizen of the United States. Are you afraid of being convicted of conspiracy yourself?” asked Peterson, according to an English translation of the interaction posted on Monday. Victorin refused to comment.

Rose City Antifa, a sophisticated organization with strict recruitment practices, has gone underground in fear of conspiracy charges, according to antifa expert Andy Ngo.

Over the years, Rose City Antifa has been linked to a string of attacks against political opponents and government property. At least one Rose City Antifa member is facing federal charges of felony assault on law enforcement for allegedly punching an officer in the face outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland. The crime carries up to eight years in federal prison.

ANTIFA INC: HOW AN IDEOLOGY BECAME AN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORK

Most recently, U.S. Homeland Security said Rose City Antifa is responsible for publishing the private information of ICE personnel, including posting their personal addresses online and on “wanted”-style public flyers, which allegedly solicited additional “tips” about individual ICE agents.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised to pursue anyone involved in illegal doxxing efforts against ICE officers. “We will prosecute those who dox ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law. These criminals are taking the side of vicious cartels and human traffickers,” Noem said in a statement. “We won't allow it in America.”

The nationwide Torch Anti-Fascist Network, which Rose City Antifa belongs to, claimed that DHS was spreading “a false conspiracy theory about our member crew.”

Today's statement about "Fighting Back Against Antifa Violence" from the DHS contains a false conspiracy theory about our member crew Rose City Antifa.RCA has not doxed any ICE agents, a fact confirmed by going to the URL DHS conveniently censored from their photo.RCA did not put up this flyer.

“RCA did not put up this flyer,” the Torch Network insisted. Authorities consider the Torch Network the “most radical” of antifa collectives, overseeing the accreditation and recognition of regional antifa chapters stationed all over America.

In a separate post, Rose City Antifa stated, “We are aware that our tipline email address was recently included on flyers identifying ICE agents. We applaud any efforts to unmask ICE's secret police, who we consider to be agents of state fascism.”

However, “we can't take credit for these flyers,” Rose City Antifa added.

The cell said its focus as a group is generally on fighting “local fascist activity.” While the cell “support[s] doxxing and any other actions that undermine ICE's blatant human rights abuses,” Rose City Antifa noted, “It is not within our capacity or purview to handle tips of this nature.”

Bray and Rose City Antifa were contacted for comment.

The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a "civil-military coordination center" in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and how the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed this week to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

One of the officials said the new team would help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza.

The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza.

A second official said troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center.

New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on criminal charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution after a prosecutor hand-picked by President Donald Trump presented evidence to that panel.

James is a long-time antagonist of Trump, who recently publicly called for criminal charges to be filed against her and former FBI Director James Comey.

The attorney general previously sued Trump in a civil case in New York that led to him and his company being held liable for business fraud.

The indictment issued Thursday accuses James of making false statements in connection with a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae that she obtained to buy a three-bedroom home in Norfolk, Virginia, in August 2020.

James, whose primary residence at the time was in Brooklyn, New York, is accused of lying on a rider to that mortgage, which required her to use the Norfolk home as a secondary residence and not rent the property, according to the indictment.

"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust," said Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, in a statement after she obtained the indictment of James in Alexandria federal court.

"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served," Halligan said.

James, in a statement, said, "This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."

She called the charges "baseless," saying that Trump's "own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.

"The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties," James said.

"His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me – and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president – is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country. This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice."

James was ordered to make her first appearance in the criminal case on Oct. 24 in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia. The case has been assigned to Judge Jamar Walker, who was appointed to the bench in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden.

If convicted, James faces a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison, and up to a $1 million fine on each count. Any actual sentence would likely be much less severe given federal sentencing guidelines.

The indictment alleges that total amount of purported "ill-gotten gains" by James were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan, which was originated in mid-2020.

Halligan on Sept. 25 obtained a criminal indictment against Comey, on charges related to his allegedly lying to Congress in 2020.

Halligan also had personally presented the evidence in Comey's case, reportedly after other prosecutors balked at the idea. It is highly unusual for a U.S. Attorney to present a case to a grand jury.

Comey pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Alexandria on Wednesday and was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5.

Halligan's predecessor as acting U.S. Attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned on Sept. 19, shortly after Trump said he wanted him gone.

Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that "investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey," The New York Times reported on the day he resigned.

Trump promptly tapped Halligan to replace Siebert.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James.

"New Yorkers know @NewYorkStateAG James for her integrity, her independence, and her relentless fight for justice," Hochul wrote in a post on X.

"What we're seeing today is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable," the governor wrote.

James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James.

"Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC," that report on Monday said.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte in April made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had in multiple instances falsified bank documents and property records in connection with the Norfolk home and a New York property.

In a letter in April to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called Pulte's allegations "baseless."

Pulte has made similar accusations about purported mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

Trump cited those claims in August when he tried to fire Cook, who, like James, is the first Black woman to hold her position. A federal district court judge blocked Trump from removing Cook while her lawsuit challenging her termination was pending.

The Supreme Court on Oct. 1 said Cook could remain in her post pending the outcome of oral arguments over the dispute, which are set for January.

In early September, James asked New York state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case.

"I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization," James said in her statement on Thursday.

"We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence – not politics," she said. "Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud."

"I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space," James said. "And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job."

The U.S. Treasury finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina and bought pesos in the open market on Thursday, making good on President Donald Trump's pledge to prop up the wobbling country and sending the peso and Argentine dollar bonds sharply higher.

"The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in announcing the actions on X.

Argentina's 2035 bond rose 4.5 cents to trade at 60.5 cents on the dollar, while the peso closed at 1,418 per dollar, up 0.8% on the day after falling 3% earlier.

Local stocks rose 5.3% Thursday. Last month, they touched a 2025 low, days before Bessent's initial support pledge. Argentine stocks traded in U.S. exchanges rallied 13%.

Bessent issued his statement at the end of four days of meetings with Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo that also involved officials from the International Monetary Fund. In April, the IMF granted Argentina a new $20 billion loan program.

A spokesperson for the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. actions.

"Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity," Bessent said in his post. "The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly. And act we will. To that end, we directly purchased Argentine pesos."

A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to provide any further details, including on the amount of pesos purchased and how the $20 billion currency swap line would be structured.

Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate complained that Trump was moving to provide financing to bail out a foreign government and global investors, even as the U.S. government has been shut down.

Previously, Bessent had pledged the use of the Treasury's $221 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund and its holdings of IMF reserve assets known as Special Drawing Rights to support Argentina.

The backstop is partly aimed at giving Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei, a boost in Argentina's October 26 mid-term legislative elections. His party wants to strengthen its minority position to solidify his agenda to cut government spending and boost private-sector investment.

Argentine lawmakers are working to limit what the president can do via decrees, raising the stakes for Milei's party in the midterms.

Although the effect on financial markets was immediate, there was no guarantee the U.S. backstop will improve Milei's party's election prospects as public dissent over his austerity measures has grown.

UBS's Shamaila Khan, head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific, said the announcement was likely to bolster prospects for Milei's party. Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy, said the midterms remain the major event, as are a policy and FX adjustment after the vote.

Bessent called the success of Milei's reforms of "systemic importance," to the U.S. by helping to anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere.

Milei, who is due to meet Trump next week during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, thanked Bessent and Trump in a message on X.

"Together, as the closest of allies, we will make a hemisphere of economic freedom and prosperity. We will work hard every day to provide opportunity for our people," Milei wrote.

Investors greeted the intervention with a sigh of relief.

Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at BankInvest, said markets had been hungry for details of Bessent's support pledge and had been challenging peso valuations.

"If they hadn't come through with a promise they made...we would be talking about a complete collapse of Argentina," he said.

Several U.S. Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to bail out Argentina and global investors. The measure is largely symbolic, as Democrats remain the minority in both chambers of Congress.

"It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own," said Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to the partial government shutdown due to lack of funding.

"Trump promised 'America First,' but he's putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill," said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

Tesla is facing a federal investigation into possible safety defects with FSD, its partially automated driving system that is also known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised).

Media, vehicle owner and other incident reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that in 44 separate incidents, Tesla drivers using FSD said the system caused them to run a red light, steer into oncoming traffic or commit other traffic safety violations leading to collisions, including some that injured people.

In a notice posted to the agency's website on Thursday, NHTSA said the investigation concerns "all Tesla vehicles that have been equipped with FSD (Supervised) or FSD (Beta)," which is an estimated 2,882,566 of the company's electric cars.

Tesla cars, even with FSD engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.

The NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation opened a Preliminary Evaluation to "assess whether there was prior warning or adequate time for the driver to respond to the unexpected behavior" by Tesla's FSD, or "to safely supervise the automated driving task," among other things.

The ODI's review will also assess "warnings to the driver about the system's impending behavior; the time given to drivers to respond; the capability of FSD to detect, display to the driver, and respond appropriately to traffic signals; and the capability of FSD to detect and respond to lane markings and wrong-way signage."

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the new federal probe. The company released an updated version of FSD this week, version 14.1, to customers.

For years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised investors that Tesla would someday be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.

That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.

Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or valets on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed.

In February this year, Musk and President Donald Trump slashed NHTSA staff as part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce, impacting the agency's ability to investigate vehicle safety and regulate autonomous vehicles, The Washington Post first reported.

President Donald Trump has met with Jared Isaacman to discuss another nomination to lead NASA, a source familiar with the talks confirmed to CNBC's Morgan Brennan.

Isaacman, who has close ties with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, was at the White House in September for Trump's dinner for tech power players. Musk did not attend.

Trump and Isaacman have had multiple in-person meetings in recent weeks to talk about the Shift4 founder's vision for the space program, according to Bloomberg,  citing a person familiar with the meetings.

After a fiery back-and-forth between Musk and Trump over government spending, the president pulled Isaacman's nomination for the post, saying he was a "blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before."

"I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 6.

Trump named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA in July.

Isaacman, who declined to comment, was initially nominated in December to lead the space agency.

Isaacman is a seasoned space traveller, having led two private spaceflights with SpaceX in 2021 and 2024. Shift4 has invested $27.5 million in SpaceX, according to a 2021 filing.

Isaacman stepped down as CEO from Shift4, the payments company he founded in 1999 at the age of 16, after his nomination was pulled, and now serves as executive chairman.

"Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again," Isaacman wrote about the NASA nomination process in a letter to investors announcing the Shift4 change.

Now, it looks like he gets to do it all over again.

Tensions between Musk and Trump have cooled in the months since, but big challenges face the U.S. space program..

Trump has proposed cutting more than $6 billion from NASA's budget.

As a result of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative, which Musk led in the first half of 2025, around 4,000 NASA employees took deferred resignation program offers, cutting the space agency's staff of 18,000 by about one-fifth.

During the October government shutdown, NASA has made exceptions that allow employees to keep working on missions involving Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.

In the ever-evolving long-term competition between the United States and China, it can be easy to lose sight of the quieter but more enduring risks that lie beneath the headlines.

Case in point: China's new sweeping export controls on rare earth magnets and related technologies, tightening its grip on critical inputs for everything from EVs to fighter jets. Under the new rules, any magnet containing even trace amounts of Chinese-sourced rare earths — or made using Chinese methods — now requires Beijing's explicit approval for export. This marks a significant development in China's export controls and should be understood as the debut of a Chinese version of the "Foreign Direct Product Rule," a signature tool Washington has used for decades to exert power and control and most relevant to China, to choke off semiconductor supplies to Huawei and other Chinese firms.

But the latest rare earths move is about much more than that. As attention turns to the anticipated Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea later this month— or to flashpoint issues like Taiwan, the TikTok deal, tariffs, or semiconductor competition — the deeper structural tensions shaping the U.S.-China long-term relationship, and the rest of the international system, risk falling into the background.

Amid these high-profile developments and the churn of short-term tactical deals, a more subtle but profoundly consequential trend is underway that deserves sustained attention from boardrooms, CEOs, investors, and policymakers: the expanding use of what is commonly referred to as "lawfare." Deliberate, strategic deployment of laws, compliance regimes, and regulatory norms are being increasingly used by China to assert power, shape global behavior, and entrench long-term advantages for itself and its companies around the world.

It is not merely the laws themselves that pose a challenge. Many would also be right to point out that the United States and Europe have done these things for decades. The risk lies in the lack of serious understanding about what China is doing, and little in the way of curiosity or forward-looking scenario planning in U.S. boardrooms and C-suites. Too often, executives are unprepared for situations in which compliance with U.S. laws — once routine — now conflicts with obligations under China's expanding legal and regulatory regime. These are no longer edge-case occurrences.

And if China's regulatory framework is relatively new compared to the U.S. or Europe, it is increasingly effective in advancing its geopolitical goals. Any nation with China's level of state capacity, agency, and ambition would use its legal system to extend influence, even extraterritorially. The timing of the latest rare earth restrictions are no coincidence. With a Trump-Xi meeting expected in Seoul this month, China is showing it is fully capable of adapting its legal toolkit to ensure that it is fit for purpose and willing to use law and regulation to maximum effect, both to secure short-term negotiating leverage and longer-term national interests.

The same strategic logic is evident in China's use of a broader legal arsenal.

Beijing has used its Anti-Monopoly Law to launch retaliatory probes — like an antitrust investigation into Nvidia following U.S. chip export controls. It has wielded the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law to sanction defense firms such as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin over arms sales to Taiwan, even banning their executives from China.

China's Unreliable Entities List (UEL), once seen as a theoretical threat, is now a working tool. In 2025, U.S. firms, including Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp. and Illumina, were listed for alleged discriminatory practices, followed by a wave of U.S.-based drone companies, including Skydio and Brinc.

The message is clear: compliance with U.S. law alone can now trigger punishment from Beijing. And that scope widened further this week. On Thursday, China added 14 more Western entities to the UEL, many tied to the defense, intelligence, and semiconductor ecosystem. Among them is TechInsights, a Canada-based leader in semiconductor intelligence, reverse engineering, and market analysis. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce barred Chinese entities and individuals from engaging in any trade, cooperation, or data sharing with the listed firms.

This latest addition to the UEL list signals a new frontier in China's lawfare strategy, targeting not only physical goods and technologies, but the information infrastructure and analytical capabilities that underpin supply chain transparency, compliance assessments, and competitive forecasting. It's a sharp reminder that data is now a contested domain, and Beijing is willing to sever flows of insight as aggressively as it once did flows of minerals or equipment.

Other statutes, such as the Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law, have been used to restrict data flows and discipline firms operating across jurisdictions. Didi Chuxing's delisting and LinkedIn's China exit illustrate how regulatory pressure can be exerted swiftly and unilaterally to great effect.

But it is China's Export Control Law, applied in recent years to gallium, germanium, and now rare earth magnets, that has become its central economic lever. By imposing strict licensing requirements on outbound shipments of these chokepoint materials, China is deliberately slowing the global flow of inputs essential to advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and defense supply chains. This law is no longer a back-office technicality of benign license application processes and approvals — it is an open and active instrument of statecraft.

This legal web is complex and sometimes vague and overlapping, giving Beijing the flexibility to apply pressure when and where it chooses. China now wields over 20 such laws and regulatory statutes — spanning cybersecurity, foreign investment screening, maritime safety, the corporate social credit system, and even anti-food waste and religious activity — creating a dense framework designed to compel, retaliate, and reward in service of national objectives.

There is also an even quieter, long-term battle that China is winning: global standards setting.

Through its China Standards 2035 initiative, and strategic placements in key international bodies like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), China aims to define the technical norms that will govern the future of 5G telecommunications, artificial intelligence (AI), smart cities, and other emerging and advanced technologies. Standards determine what scales, who profits, and which governance models get encoded into global systems.

Chinese firms like Huawei and Hikvision are aggressive participants. U.S. firms are often left to fight it out alone. American regulators, by and large, are absent. If this continues, U.S. firms and consumers will increasingly operate under rules shaped in Beijing, not Washington.

These may not be the sexy issues. And they likely won't be on the agenda of the Trump-Xi meeting on the margins of APEC. But they are critical issues just the same. This is not necessarily about choosing geopolitical sides. It is about building a plan to navigate an adversarial and fragmented global legal environment. The real challenge lies in how global firms respond. Does a company know its full exposure? Does it have red lines — scenarios in which it is clear which legal regime to obey, and are U.S. corporations prepared to make that decision and explain it to shareholders and regulators?

These are not platitudes. They are the foundation of a strategic framework businesses need to build, refine, and rehearse now before the next time they have to choose between obeying U.S. law and remaining viable in China's market. These are not easy questions to answer, nor are the tradeoffs comfortable to make. But ignoring them — or pining for the good old days — is not an option. As Chairman Mao might have said, they are not "paper tigers." They are real, active tools used to pressure, compel, and shield Chinese firms from foreign competition — while also placing Beijing's national interest at the center of the global regulatory ecosystem.

Serve Robotics is trying to get as many businesses as possible to use its cooler-shaped delivery robots — even if it means teaming up with an apparent rival.

The autonomous delivery company's latest partner is DoorDash, which is also developing its own delivery robots. On Thursday, the companies said Serve's robots would start making deliveries for DoorDash in Los Angeles, a city where Serve already works with Uber Eats.

Ultimately, the goal is to roll out the partnership across the US, the companies said.

Serve, which was spun out of Uber-owned Postmates in 2021, operates delivery robots in five cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami.

Working with DoorDash, which unveiled its own delivery robot last month, might seem counterintuitive. But Ali Kashani, Serve's CEO, said that DoorDash's Dot is more complementary than threatening to his company. Right now, he said, there are far more deliveries than robots that can make them, and different robots will be best for different circumstances.

"We are all going to try different approaches and see which one of them makes the most sense," Kashani told Business Insider in an interview..

The goal is to make delivery robots more like ride-hailing drivers, who switch between working for Uber and Lyft depending on where they can pick up work.

"We want to be a shared platform," Kashani said. "We want to be an infrastructure that everybody can use."

Shares of Serve were trading 26% higher on Thursday after the announcement.

Besides DoorDash and Uber Eats, the company also works directly with some restaurants and retailers, including 7-Eleven and Shake Shack.

Autonomous vehicles — be they cars or delivery bots — are becoming more common on the sidewalks and streets of US cities.

Robotaxis are appearing in more metro areas: Waymo, which has offered rides in self-driving cars for years in some cities like San Francisco, started making its vehicles available to Uber users in Atlanta and Austin earlier this year. Tesla also started its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin around the same time.

Smaller self-driving delivery vehicles are also gaining ground, though executives say that using robots for delivery presents a different set of challenges, such as handing off orders from the restaurant to the robot.

Last month, DoorDash unveiled Dot, a stroller-sized delivery robot it developed in-house. The robot can travel up to 20 miles an hour and traverse sidewalks and bike lanes on roads.

While getting around through ride-hailing has become a habit for many consumers, Kashani said that having things delivered is more ubiquitous — and is, potentially, a bigger market for self-driving technology.

"Everybody is very distracted by self-driving cars to move people," he said. "But for every person, there are so many items that we consume or we touch every day. I actually think it's as big, if not bigger, than the movement of people."

President Donald Trump on Thursday said his administration plans to use the ongoing government shutdown to permanently cut government programs popular with Democrats, his latest threat amid the funding stalemate.

"We're only cutting Democrat programs," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

It was not immediately clear which programs Trump had in mind, but he specified that they were "very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly."

"They wanted to do this," Trump said, doubling down on blaming Democrats for the shutdown.

They will "get a little taste of their own medicine," he added.

The president's threat to target Democratic priorities came one week after he initially floated the idea of inflicting pain on his political opponents during the shutdown, which is now in its ninth day.

He said in a Truth Social post last Thursday that the congressional funding lapse gave him an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash what he described as "Democrat Agencies."

He also wrote he would be meeting with Russell Vought, the White House Office of Management and Budget director, to determine what to cut.

On the first day of the shutdown, Vought announced that the administration was freezing about $18 billion in funding for New York City infrastructure projects, and canceling roughly $8 billion more in climate-related funding for Democratic-leaning states.

Two days later, Vought said that $2.1 billion in Chicago transit project funding has also been put on hold.

The administration is considering canceling an additional $12 billion earmarked for clean energy projects, Semafor reported Tuesday.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Republican and Democratic congressional leaders could not pass appropriations bills to keep the government funded past the end of the fiscal year.

Republicans want to pass a stopgap measure to resume funding largely at current levels through Nov. 21. Democrats say any funding bill should include additional health-care protections, including extending premium Affordable Care Act tax credits before they expire at the end of the year.

The dueling proposals have repeatedly failed to pass in the Senate.

YouTube is offering creators who were banned from the platform a second chance.

On Thursday, the Google-owned platform announced it is rolling out a feature for previously terminated creators to apply to create a new channel. Previous rules led to a lifetime ban.

"We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance," wrote the YouTube Team in a blog post. "We're looking forward to providing an opportunity for creators to start fresh and bring their voice back to the platform."

Tech companies have faced months of scrutiny from House Republicans and President Donald Trump, who have accused the platforms of political bias and overreach in content moderation.

Last week, YouTube agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit involving the suspension of Trump's account following the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021.

YouTube said this new option is separate from its already existing appeals process. If an appeal is unsuccessful, creators now have the option to apply for a new channel.

Approved creators under the new process will start from scratch, with no prior videos, subscribers or monetization privileges carried over.

Over the next several weeks, eligible creators logging into YouTube Studio will see an option to request a new channel. Creators are only eligible to apply one year after their original channel was terminated.

YouTube said it will review requests based on the severity and frequency of past violations.

The company also said it will consider off-platform behavior that could harm the community, such as activity endangering child safety.

The program excludes creators terminated for copyright infringement, violations of its Creator Responsibility policy or those who deleted their accounts.

YouTube's 'second chance' process fits with a broader trend at Google and other major platforms to ease strict content moderation rules imposed in the wake of the pandemic and the 2020 election.

In September, Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan sent a letter to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, that announced the platform had made changes to its community guidelines for content containing Covid-19 or election-related misinformation.

The letter also claimed that senior Biden administration officials pressed the company to remove certain Covid-related videos, saying the pressure was "unacceptable and wrong."

YouTube ended its stand-alone Covid misinformation rules in December 2024, according to Donovan's letter.

In this article

Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt has issued a stark reminder about the dangers of AI and how susceptible it is to being hacked.

Schmidt, who served as Google's chief executive from 2001 to 2011, warned about "the bad stuff that AI can do," when asked whether AI is more destructive than nuclear weapons during a fireside chat at the Sifted Summit

"Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely," Schmidt said Wednesday. The proliferation risks of AI include the technology falling into the hands of bad actors and being repurposed and misused.

"There's evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone," Schmidt said.

"All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature."

AI systems are vulnerable to attack, with some methods including prompt injections and jailbreaking. In a prompt injection attack, hackers hide malicious instructions in user inputs or external data, like web pages or documents, to trick the AI into doing things it's not meant to do — such as sharing private data or running harmful commands

Jailbreaking, on the other hand, involves manipulating the AI's responses so it ignores its safety rules and produces restricted or dangerous content.

In 2023, a few months after OpenAI's ChatGPT was released, users employed a "jailbreak" trick to circumvent the safety instructions embedded in the chatbot.

This included creating a ChatGPT alter-ego called DAN, an acronym for "Do Anything Now," which involved threatening the chatbot with death if it didn't comply. The alter-ego could provide answers on how to commit illegal activities or list the positive qualities of Adolf Hitler.

Schmidt said that there isn't a good "non-proliferation regime" yet to help curb the dangers of AI.

Despite the grim warning, Schmidt was optimistic about AI more broadly and said the technology doesn't get the hype it deserves.

"I wrote two books with Henry Kissinger about this before he died, and we came to the view that the arrival of an alien intelligence that is not quite us and more or less under our control is a very big deal for humanity, because humans are used to being at the top of the chain. I think so far, that thesis is proving out that the level of ability of these systems is going to far exceed what humans can do over time," Schmidt said.

"Now the GPT series, which culminated in a ChatGPT moment for all of us, where they had 100 million users in two months, which is extraordinary, gives you a sense of the power of this technology. So I think it's underhyped, not overhyped, and I look forward to being proven correct in five or 10 years," he added.

His comments come amid growing talk of an AI bubble, as investors pour money into AI-focused firms and valuations look stretched, with comparisons being made to the dot-com bubble collapse of the early 2000s.

Schmidt said he doesn't think history will repeat itself, however.

"I don't think that's going to happen here, but I'm not a professional investor," he said.

"What I do know is that the people who are investing hard-earned dollars believe the economic return over a long period of time is enormous. Why else would they take the risk?"

Ukraine's escalating attacks on Russia's energy sector are biting into its economy and war chest, forcing Moscow to tap into emergency gas reserves, Kyiv said this week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday night that "long-range sanctions against Russia," a reference to its deep-strike campaign targeting Russian energy facilities, is "achieving truly significant results." Moscow's vast oil industry is a critical sector, with oil and natural gas exports fueling its war efforts in Ukraine.

Ukraine has been targeting infrastructure across Russia, including refineries, with long-range weapons to turn up the pressure on Moscow.

"The fuel shortage in Russia is already approaching 20% — this specifically concerns their gasoline," Zelenskyy said, citing Ukrainian data. "They've now begun tapping into diesel reserves, which they've been saving for a rainy day."

Ukrainian drones have struck targets far beyond the front lines, sometimes hundreds of miles into Russian territory. A strike on Friday, for instance, hit a facility more than 800 miles away, underscoring Kyiv's long reach.

A source in the Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, said that nearly 40% of the capacity of Russian refineries is "already idle" because of the long-range strike campaign.

"The SBU continues to cause serious damage to the Russian economy, working on the facilities of the oil and gas industry of the Russian Federation," the source said after the strike last week, per a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.

"The decrease in petrodollar revenues to the budget directly affects the aggressor's ability to continue the war against Ukraine," they added.

Ukraine has primarily used homemade missiles and drones to strike deep inside Russia, investing heavily in the production of weapons as a workaround to the restrictions and shortages it faced in using Western-provided cruise and tactical ballistic missiles to hit across the border.

Zelenskyy on Wednesday praised Ukraine's weapons makers and said they were working to ensure that Russia bears the cost of the war. Their equipment has become more accurate, he added.

The attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure have leaned predominantly on drones; however, Ukraine has also used domestically produced cruise missiles and hybrid missile-drones to strike Russian targets.

Though Ukraine has received tens of billions of dollars in security assistance from Western countries, Zelenskyy has also pushed Ukraine's defense industry to contribute a greater share of domestically produced weaponry into the hands of soldiers.

On Monday, he said that more than 40% of the weaponry Ukraine uses at the front is Ukrainian-made, adding that it must be at least 50% by the end of the year.

Russia's energy infrastructure has long been a target. The oil and gas sector is a significant source of income for Russia, which, in turn, helps fund the invasion. This one industrial sector is estimated to be worth approximately 20% of Russia's GDP on average.

Kyle Glen, an investigator with the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience who tracks Ukrainian strikes on Russia's energy sector, told Business Insider that there have been 24 attacks on oil refineries since the start of August.

The ability to strike these facilities has been crucial for Ukraine, even when it faces challenges such as battlefield setbacks or shortages of weapons and ammunition from its partners. Kyiv views these efforts as an opportunity to weaken Russia and project power.

The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Ukraine as its forces continue to defend against the invading Russians, with relatively static front lines and mounting losses.

The escalating campaign comes amid Ukraine's expanding ability to strike high-profile Russian targets — like warships, aircraft, bases, factories, and ammunition production sites — far beyond its borders, with its own weaponry, hampering Russia's war machine and preventing the conflict from being fought solely on Ukrainian soil.

Russia is also hitting Ukraine with deep strikes. Nightly attacks, consisting of large numbers of drones and missiles, hammer civilian areas and critical infrastructure, including the country's energy sector. Bombardments sometimes involve hundreds of munitions as Moscow ramps up its own weapons production.

Russian attacks have resulted in outages and blackouts, and have left Ukraine more reliant on imported energy, but they have not decimated a major national income source like the attacks in Russia have.

Two funding bills that could end the federal government shutdown failed to pass in Senate votes for the seventh time on Thursday.

The votes on dueling Republican and Democratic stop-gap funding proposals came on the ninth day of the shutdown, and as fallout from the crisis spread.

The IRS on Wednesday said that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce because of the lack of funding by Congress.

Lawmakers showed no indication that they are open to yielding on their respective party's demands.

The Senate voted against the GOP-backed bill, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, in a 54-45 vote.

Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, as well as Angus King of Maine, one of two independents in the Democratic caucus, all again voted with Republicans, as they have done on prior votes.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted again with Democrats to oppose the GOP measure. 

Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the Senate, need about eight votes from the Democratic caucus in order to pass their short-term funding bill in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required for passage.

In the last round of voting on Wednesday, the GOP bill was rejected 54-45, while the Democrats' version fell short in a 47-52 tally.

On Thursday, the Senate rejected the Democratic bill in a 47-50 party-line vote.

The Senate on Thursday is set to vote for a seventh time to try to end the government shutdown, as the stalemate on Capitol Hill continues with no sign of a breakthrough.

Now in its ninth day, more of the shutdown's widespread impacts on the government are starting to emerge. The IRS, for instance, said Wednesday that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce as a result of the congressional funding lapse.

Still, lawmakers on both sides remain dug in, showing no indication that they are open to yielding on their demands.

The Senate is expected to vote at around 11:30 a.m. ET on dueling Republican and Democratic proposals to end the government shutdown.

Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the Senate, need about eight votes from the Democratic caucus in order to pass their short-term funding bill in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required for passage.

In the last round of voting on Wednesday, the GOP bill was rejected 54-45, while the Democrats' version fell short in a 47-52 tally.

Intel on Thursday announced its new PC chips slated to debut in laptops next year as the chipmaker battles to turn around its struggling business.

The company said the new Panther Lake processor is made with its 18A technology and is the most advanced node made on U.S. soil.

The new generation of chips will be made at Intel's Fab 52 facility in Arizona, which the company said is now fully operational and set to ramp production.

"The United States has always been home to Intel's most advanced R&D, product design and manufacturing – and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market," CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a release announcing the news.

Intel is also building its Xeon 6+ servers equipped with 18A processors at the site. Those will debut in the first half of 2026. 

The latest reveal comes during a critical stretch for the beleaguered chipmaker that has lagged in recent years and struggled to keep up with cutting-edge chip demands spurred by the artificial intelligence revolution.

In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in the company in an effort to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.

Since taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.

This summer, President Donald Trump called Tan "highly CONFLICTED" and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.

Intel shares have bounced 87% this year.

Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged Thursday after China tightened restrictions on exports, fueling market speculation that the Trump administration will move more aggressively to invest in building out a domestic supply chain.

Ramaco Resources soared more than 11%, Energy Fuels surged over 12%, USA Rare Earth jumped more than 16%, NioCorp Developments rallied 14%, and MP Materials advanced over 6%. Albemarle popped 7%, Trilogy Metals rose over 4%, and Lithium Americas was up about 2%.

Beijing is now requiring foreign entities to obtain a license to export products that contain rare earths worth 0.1% or more of the goods' value, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. Companies will also need export licenses if they use China's extraction, refining or magnet recycling technology.

"The White House and relevant agencies are closely assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without any notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world's technology supply chains," an administration official told CNBC.

China imposed the restrictions ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea, later this month.

Rare earths have been a major point of contention in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Beijing dominates the global rare-earth supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on imports from China.

The White House and the U.S. critical mineral industry have accused China of manipulating the market to drive foreign competition out of business. Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs for U.S. weapons platforms, robotics, electric vehicles and electronics among other applications.

The Defense Department struck an unprecedent deal with the largest U.S. rare earth miner MP Materials in July that included an equity stake, the first big salvo in the Trump administration's push to back the U.S. industry against China. The White House has subsequently taken stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals, fuelling investor speculation that more deals will follow.

"This action reinforces the need for forward-leaning U.S. industrial policy," a MP spokesperson said of China's export restrictions. "Building resilient supply chains is a matter of economic and national security."

USA Rare Earth and Energy Fuels have not struck deals with the White House, but their CEOs told CNBC that they are in close contact with the Trump administration.

"It's going to take a lot of players to build out this marketplace," USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC on Oct. 2.

China's export restrictions "help to ensure a strong position for Xi to sit down with Trump" on the sidelines of the summit in South Korea, Evercore ISI analyst Neo Wang told clients in a Thursday note.

"Although both Beijing and Washington learnt the lesson the hard way in their last exchange of export controls back in [April] and May, China's stronger pain endurance rooted in its political system adds to the credibility of its threats in a game of chicken," Wang wrote.

Chip Wars:

Intel Corp., the embattled chipmaker now backed by the US government, introduced new products and manufacturing technology that are central to its turnaround bid.

The company announced Thursday that its Panther Lake processor designs are in full production and will go on sale in laptops early next year. The new chips are made with 18A technology, which Intel says offers advantages that none of its competitors can match yet.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Thursday that it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million Tesla vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving system over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes.

The auto safety agency said FSD - an assistance system that requires drivers to pay attention and intervene if needed - has "induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws."

The agency said it has reports of Tesla vehicles using FSD driving through red traffic lights and driving against the proper direction of travel during a lane change.

In total, NHTSA is reviewing 58 reports of issues involving traffic safety violations when using FSD, including 14 crashes and 23 injuries.

The new investigation comes amid growing scrutiny of Tesla's advanced driver assistance system from Congress and weeks after a new NHTSA administrator was confirmed.

Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, issued a software update to FSD this week.

NHTSA said it has six reports in which a Tesla vehicle, operating with FSD engaged, "approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles in the intersection."

NHTSA said four crashes resulted in one or more injuries.

The investigation - a preliminary evaluation - is the first step before the agency could seek a recall of the vehicles if it believes they pose an unreasonable risk to safety.

A driver in Houston in 2024 told NHTSA that FSD "is not recognizing traffic signals. This results in the vehicle proceeding through red lights, and stopping at green lights."

The complaint added: "Tesla doesn't want to fix it, or even acknowledge the problem, even though they've done a test drive with me and seen the issue with their own eyes."

NHTSA also said it will review FSD behavior when approaching railroad crossings. Last month, Democrat Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal cited a growing number of reported near-collisions in urging the agency to investigate.

Tesla's FSD, which is more advanced than its Autopilot system, has been under investigation by NHTSA for a year.

In October 2024, the agency began an inquiry into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD after four reported collisions in conditions of reduced roadway visibility, such as sun glare, fog or airborne dust, including a 2023 fatal crash.

Tesla says FSD "will drive you almost anywhere with your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention" but does not make the car self-driving.

Tesla's other automated vehicle features have also drawn agency scrutiny.

In January, NHTSA opened an investigation into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that lets users move their cars remotely.

NHTSA is also reviewing Tesla's deployment of self-driving robotaxis in Austin, Texas, launched in June.

When Anshul Gandhi graduated from dental school in India, the idea of working for a company like Apple — let alone as a machine learning engineer — felt far beyond his reach.

But 11 years later, after moving to the US for graduate school and navigating multiple job transitions, that's exactly where he ended up.

During his final years of dental school, Gandhi realized the profession wasn't for him. He and other students had begun treating patients, including performing root canals, dentures, and other procedures. The experience gave him a clearer sense of what day-to-day work in the field would look like.

"Deep down, I knew it wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life," said Gandhi, who's in his 30s and lives in Austin.

So he began exploring other paths. Gandhi said he'd taken computer science courses in high school, which gave him some familiarity with the coding languages C++ and Java. During his final year of dental school, he enrolled in a few programming courses, which he said helped him develop his coding skills. The more he learned, the more confident he felt about pursuing a programming role in the tech industry.

"By the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to start my career in this field," he said.

In the years that followed, Gandhi would set his sights on an even bigger goal: landing an AI role at one of the largest US tech companies. However, his lack of formal education and work experience in the field, combined with a competitive tech job market, posed a real challenge. If he wanted a shot at Big Tech, he knew he'd have to keep building his skillset.

Gandhi is among the professionals who've pursued AI roles in recent years, as major tech companies like Meta and Google collectively invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure.

While several tech giants have laid off workers in recent years, many are aggressively chasing AI talent and offering eye-popping pay packages. A LinkedIn analysis of job growth rates between early 2022 and mid-2024 found that "artificial intelligence engineer" was the fastest-growing role on the platform.

While AI roles are competitive, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Gandhi shared how he landed interviews at Microsoft and Walmart — and ultimately secured a machine learning role at Apple.

After graduating from dental school in 2013, Gandhi said he secured a data analysis role in India that provided him with more hands-on programming experience. He also connected with computer science engineers who helped him find online boot camps and side projects focused on AI and machine learning.

While AI is arguably the biggest trend in tech today, Gandhi said that a decade ago, "big data" was the industry's buzzword. His early exposure to AI helped him build expertise that felt relatively niche at the time.

"At that time, nobody was talking about AI," he said.

After a few years, Gandhi decided he wanted more practical knowledge and hands-on experience in AI and machine learning, so he started applying to graduate school programs. In 2016, he moved to the US to pursue a master's degree in biomedical informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He hoped the degree would give him a strong foundation in AI and data science, while also allowing him to build on his healthcare background.

"It gave me the technical depth I was looking for, while still feeling connected to my previous experience," he said.

After graduating in 2018, he began working as a data scientist until 2021, when he landed a machine learning engineering role at Dell. While Gandhi was generally happy with his new position, he hadn't given up on his goal of working at one of the largest US tech companies.

"I wanted to work on designing large-scale machine learning systems that serve tens of millions of users globally," he said. "And that kind of scale, you only get from working for a company like Meta, Amazon, Google, Netflix, or Apple."

Around August 2024, Gandhi began looking for a new role, he said. But he soon realized the job market was tougher than he'd previously experienced. He said demand for generative AI-specific skills — rather than traditional machine learning expertise — had surged, and the bar for technical proficiency was higher than ever.

"This round of hiring was totally different," he said.

One of the first steps he took to boost his chances was becoming more active on LinkedIn. At the time, he had about 200 connections, a number a recruiter told him raised concerns about the authenticity of his profile. She expected someone with his experience to have at least hit the "500+" threshold LinkedIn uses to display connection counts.

To boost his LinkedIn presence, Gandhi began connecting with more people. He now has over 500 connections and more than 3,000 followers. Over the past year, he has also begun posting his thoughts on the tech industry, aiming to establish himself as an expert in AI and machine learning.

Gandhi said he learned two other things during the early stages of his job search. One was that he needed to be more selective about what roles he applied for, prioritizing positions that were the best fit.

The other was that he might need a referral to land the type of job he desired, and that he needed to be strategic about how he pursued one. While Gandhi continued to reach out to strangers on LinkedIn for referrals, he said he also began investing time in building a minimal online relationship first.

"When you connect, you don't just say, 'Hey, can you refer me?' because nobody has the time," he said. "I realized that you have to keep engaging with their content, sharing your thoughts, and let them know that you not only exist, but are also a thought leader in your field."

Gandhi said his experience working in the AI field helped him land interviews at multiple companies without referrals, including PayPal. However, he said that a referral from a friend helped him get an interview at Microsoft, and a LinkedIn connection led to a referral at Walmart.

In the fall of 2024, Gandhi accepted a machine learning role at a large healthcare organization that checked many of his boxes. However, he continued to interview for roles he'd previously applied for, and later that year, he landed an offer for a machine learning engineering job at Apple. He started in January and said he's very happy with his role.

Gandhi said he didn't have a referral for the Apple job — it came through a cold application — but he still considers pursuing referrals to be a wise strategy for job seekers. When preparing for machine learning interviews, Gandhi recommends practicing LeetCode problems, mock interviews, and system-design drills — as well as familiarizing oneself with agent-based AI, retrieval-augmented generation, prompt tuning, and inference engines.

Gandhi said among the top takeaways from his job search journey is that career pivots — even unconventional ones — are possible.

"I didn't have a linear path," he said. "I don't think a lot of people have a very pre-planned career path. So you can start over, even if it feels impossible."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Leigh Coney, a 34-year-old AI consultant based in France. It's been edited for length and clarity.

AI models can tend to be "yes-men."

They are sycophantic by design, meaning they agree with us, support our ideas, and want to help. Part of the reason I think so many AI projects fail is because the human factor is overlooked. The same biases that apply to us also apply to AI, so it's important to factor in psychological principles when building experiments, agents, and automation.

I decided to pivot from teaching psychology at a university to becoming an AI consultant after Microsoft announced Copilot for its products nearly three years ago. At that moment, I decided AI would be in every business.

Now, I build custom AI automations and agents for businesses across many industries to increase efficiency and growth, using my psychological background to interact better with AI. Although ChatGPT was updated to make it less sycophantic, we have to make an extra effort to be critical of and question our ideas if we want to improve our thinking or work content.

A standard ChatGPT prompt might not challenge a flawed plan.

I ask AI to point out assumptions I might be making when I'm talking about an idea. My goal is to uncover things I'm not thinking about by asking questions like "where am I not being clear in my thinking?" or "What am I overlooking?"

AI is particularly useful for expanding our thinking by uncovering perspectives we could be missing.

Let's say you're pitching an idea to a CFO. Tell your chatbot to "Act as a skeptical CFO and ask five hard-hitting questions. Don't be shy. Be harsh."

Not only will it prepare you for the pitch, but it will also give you better output. The questions may even be more valuable than the answers because they force you to think about things you didn't think about before.

A surgery with a 90% survival rate feels different than a surgery with a 10% mortality rate. That's the framing effect. Little wording tweaks in our prompts not only change how we feel, but can also change how AI responds.

The way you should frame a question to AI depends on what you're trying to do.

Let's say a team is facing a setback at work, and a manager is using a chatbot to write an email to their employees. If the manager prompts the chatbot to "explain the project delay and the problems they encountered", that's a negative framing, and the response will be more critical.

A more positive framing would be to say something like, "draft a project update for the team. Frame our recent challenge as a critical learning moment that has revealed two insights for making the final product even better. Focus on our resilience and the path forward."

If I'm using a chatbot to work on something important, I test out many different versions of my prompt in different chats. I tweak some words, sometimes just one, and it actually makes a really big difference in the response I get.

The speed at which AI was advancing made me a bit concerned about jobs and employment, but since the personally underwhelming GPT5 release, I think we've got a lot more time than I previously assumed. To me, this is good news for our job market.

Learning about cognitive biases is worth it. It improves how we think and communicate with each other and with AI, and will ultimately lead to better output.

Every tech giant is "ganging up" on OpenAI, said a Thrive Capital partner.

On an episode of the "Uncapped" podcast released on Wednesday, Vince Hankes said Big Tech companies don't want new players entering their league.

"My mental model for you on how the competitive landscape looks like is: OpenAI is in a corner and every Big Tech company has a bazooka pointed at them to try to take them down," Hankes said. "Because none of those Big Tech companies want a new Big Tech company."

Thrive Capital, founded by Josh Kushner in 2011, is a major investor in the ChatGPT maker. The venture capital firm has also invested in companies including SpaceX, Databricks, and Stripe.

"We should want it to be a competitive fair fight for a new company to break into Mag Seven," Hankes added, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia. "Because that's what our whole ecosystem lives and breathes off of."

This support for OpenAI doesn't mean the VC firm only plans to invest in the AI giant, Hankes said.

"There isn't a risk-adjusted better return than OpenAI, and therefore if we're given a decision, we should do it," he said about investing more in the company.

"At the same time, you can't not take a risk because of that," he added.

Hankes did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In the past month, a string of deals and announcements has positioned $500 billion OpenAI closer to some of its more established tech competitors.

At its DevDay event on Monday, the company announced it's bringing apps inside ChatGPT, which CEO Sam Altman said now has 800 million weekly users.

OpenAI also unveiled an app software development kit that allows developers to build their own apps for ChatGPT. This makes the AI tool more like an app store, a move that could threaten industry leaders like Apple and Google. Google investors have already been concerned about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools eating into Google's search engine share.

On Monday, OpenAI announced a multi-year deal with AMD in which it will deploy chips requiring up to six gigawatts of power.

The agreement came just weeks after Nvidia announced that OpenAI would gain access to 10 gigawatts of high-powered GPUs, alongside a $100 billion investment from the chipmaker.

OpenAI is set to produce its first AI chip in partnership with Broadcom next year.

New York City is taking on some of the biggest names in tech.

In a 327-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in the Manhattan federal court, the city alleged that Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance created a "public nuisance" and a "youth mental health crisis" by intentionally exploiting the psychology of young users to keep them hooked.

The city alleged in the complaint that the platforms' algorithms are designed to maximize engagement at the expense of children's mental health, contributing to sleep loss, chronic absenteeism, and risky behavior such as "subway surfing," meaning riding on top of moving trains. All these behaviors, the complaint said, are heavily costing schools, educators, and the public health system.

"Social media use by teens has recently been implicated in alarming increases in dangerous and even deadly off-campus activity in New York City," the lawsuit alleges. "One such dangerous type of conduct known to be spreading through viral social media posts is 'subway surfing.'"

The lawsuit cited data from the NYC Police Department that at least 16 teens have died in such incidents since 2023, including two girls aged 12 and 13, who died this month.

"Defendants should be held to account for the harms their conduct has inflicted on New York City youth and on the NYC Plaintiffs' educational and public health ecosystems," the plaintiffs wrote in the complaint. "As it stands now, NYC Plaintiffs are left to abate the nuisance and foot the bill."

The NYC Mayor's office, Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The NYC Law Department said in a statement to Business Insider that social media has resulted in "substantial interference" with school district operations and public hospitals that provide mental health services to youth.

The City School District of the City of New York and New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation are also plaintiffs in the case. The NYC's health commissioner said social media was a public health hazard in January 2024.

Among the defendants, Meta is the owner of Facebook and Instagram, Snap runs Snapchat, and Alphabet owns Google and YouTube. The Trump administration is facilitating a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok, but the Chinese company still owns the platform as of now.

"These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true," José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson, told Business Insider. "YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports, to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends."

Owners of social media giants have previously been in the crosshairs of lawmakers and brought into Senate hearings over allegations of harming and exploiting children. In 2024, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, faced a room full of families who said their children had suffered harm from social media.

NYC withdrew from a similar litigation announced by Mayor Eric Adams in February 2024, which was pending in California state courts, so that it could join the new federal litigation.

One of the best deals I've spotted is $70 off the Ninja Dualbrew Pro, which we recommend for its versatility. It features drip and pod brewing capabilities, along with a 10-cup carafe. Nespresso also has several machines on sale, including 22% off the Vertuo Pop+ and 38% off the Vertuo Plus by Breville.

Last year, I was running on empty. Decades spent as an editor in the relentless pace of London, Hong Kong, and Dubai had left me depleted. What some might call a midlife crisis, I saw as a necessary intervention — one that led me straight to Thailand.

I began my reset in bustling Bangkok, but it was the calmer southern shores of Phuket where I truly found my peace. My mission was to stop, reset, and rebuild on my own terms.

Naturally, the most pressing question loomed over me: What was the price tag on this kind of freedom? My research, a deep dive into online forums and even AI assistants, consistently delivered the same magic number, $1,500 a month to live comfortably in Thailand.

My first concern was where to live. I discovered I could rent a studio for as low as $200 a month or splurge on a modern condo for about $1,000.

I chose a serviced apartment in a mid-range hotel in Kathu, a leafy suburban jungle area in Phuket that's far from the tourist crowds of Patong. 

As a long-term resident, I pay around 13,000 Thai baht, or $400, a month. This includes all utilities, cleaning, high-speed WiFi, and access to amenities like an infinity pool and gym. The rent fluctuates slightly between high and low seasons, but the average is roughly that amount.

The best part? I don't have a long-term contract, just a flexible two-week notice period when I decide to move on.

No day in Thailand is complete without a trip to a 7-Eleven or Tops Daily. I've come to believe that everything you need to stay happy, healthy, and alive can be found in a Thai convenience store. It's where I can fill my basket to the brim without worrying about the final cost.

Between fresh fruit, yogurt, probiotics, vitamins, soft drinks, water, and snacks, I spend about $10 a day. This is also where I top up my mobile plan. My pay-as-you-go package, free of any expensive, locked-in contracts, costs $10 a month for unlimited calls and high-speed data.

Transport is one area where I've kept things simple. Instead of renting a motorbike for about $6 a day like many people do in Phuket, I rely on Grab, a local ride-hailing app. A quick ride to the beach on a GrabBike costs a dollar or two, and I book a car for longer trips.

Since I work remotely and can walk to most places, I only travel every other day, keeping my transport costs low while getting my steps in.

One of the biggest joys of living in Thailand has been discovering that I can eat exceptionally well without spending a fortune. For someone who can barely boil an egg, it's been a life-changing convenience.

A plate of pad Thai from a street-side vendor costs around $2. I've since leveled up by ordering through a food delivery app, which often comes with free delivery and promotional discounts. 

I get restaurant-quality meals like papaya salad and spicy basil pork delivered to my door for $3. I don't think I've ever eaten so healthily or deliciously — budget aside. 

All in, I spend roughly $250 a month on food, which covers everything from morning market fruit to my daily delivered dinners. 

Staying fit and well-groomed in Phuket has also been easy and inexpensive. My local neighborhood gym is a multi-level space stocked with modern equipment and a schedule of classes.

I now have a regular schedule of Tabata and HIIT classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and weight training every other afternoon. While the standard monthly membership is about $50, I renewed during my birthday month in August and scored a six-month package for $115.

After a workout, I often reward myself with a $10 one-hour recovery massage. I also visit my favorite rock-and-roll styled barber twice a month, where a stylist gives me a cut for $9.

Even what I once considered luxury treatments are within reach. Korean Botox starts at around $125 for 50 units, proving that living on a budget doesn't mean sacrificing your personal care — or vanity.

Living in Phuket is genuinely affordable, especially if you embrace local living and avoid tourist traps. When I add up my core expenses like rent, daily convenience store runs, food, and transport, it totals about $1,000 a month. This leaves enough wiggle room for all kinds of extras, including weekend trips to nearby islands. 

The budget not only covers a comfortable life in Thailand but also funds an exhilarating lifestyle in what I've deemed one of the world's most dynamic and welcoming countries.

Dan Springer, the former CEO of electronic signature company DocuSign, told Business Insider that there are two things people can do to lower their risks of being laid off — one big-picture and one smaller.

Springer was DocuSign's CEO from 2017 to 2022. He left DocuSign's board in April and joined Ironclad, a Franklin Templeton-backed contract management software company, as CEO in the same month.

"The macro piece is, you need to invest in your capabilities, and as new technologies come along, you have to embrace them," Springer said.

Springer referenced the rise of Apple's iPhone, which launched in 2007 and displaced incumbent players like Blackberry.

"When the iPhone came out and mobility became part of business, there were some people who said, 'I'm just staying with my Blackberry. I'm using it for emails, and I don't care about apps.' Five years later, they're a dinosaur," he added.

Springer said the micro factor relates to how invested people are in their companies' work. He said that people who want to be the "most employable" need to be "really committed to the company and constantly just apply yourself to make your company successful."

"Companies aren't perfect, but for the most part, companies figure out who the best employees are. They want employees that are culture builders, the ones that are working hard to serve our customers, doing all the right things," Springer said.

"If you really apply yourself and don't become cynical about that, then I think you become really valuable to the company, and you're always going to be needed," he added.

DocuSign's stock soared in the pandemic, but cratered about 80% from its summer 2021 peak to Springer's departure a year later.

Springer's tenure as DocuSign CEO coincided with the rapid expansion of the company's workforce. The company went from 2,255 employees in January 2018 to 7,461 employees in January 2022.

After Springer stepped down as CEO in June 2022, DocuSign underwent three rounds of layoffs.

The first round took place in September 2022, when DocuSign said it was laying off nearly 700 employees, or 9% of its workforce.

Months later, in February 2023, DocuSign said it was laying off about 700 employees, or 10% of its workforce.

Its last round of layoffs took place in February 2024, when DocuSign laid off 440 workers, or 6% of its employees. The company said in an SEC filing that it had 6,838 employees as of January 31, 2025.

Mass layoffs have gripped the tech industry in recent years. In July, Microsoft said it was laying off around 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its total workforce. The company previously announced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers in May.

In 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg embarked on what he called a "year of efficiency." Zuckerberg said in March 2023 that he was axing 10,000 employees, just months after the social media giant had laid off 11,000 employees in November 2022.

That's on top of the threat posed by AI, which some business leaders say could result in fewer jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a May interview with Axios that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level office jobs in the next five years.

In September, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that AI was probably having an effect on the job market, though it is "hard to say how big it is."

"It may be that companies or other institutions that have been hiring younger people right out of college are able to use AI more than they had in the past," Powell said.

"That may be part of the story. It's also part of the story, though, that job creation more broadly has slowed down," he added.

As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, recent legislative proposals such as Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could significantly impact the landscape of crypto payroll regulations across the world. This article examines how tax breaks for modest Bitcoin transactions may not only boost adoption in the U.S. but also prompt similar changes in Europe and Asia. Let's dive into the potential global ripple effects of this legislation and what it could mean for businesses in the shifting digital assets landscape.

The rise of cryptocurrency has ushered in a new era in finance, providing decentralized alternatives to conventional currencies. Bitcoin, in particular, has paved the way for a rapidly growing digital asset market that has piqued the interest of both individual and institutional investors. As businesses increasingly adopt cryptocurrency payments, understanding the regulatory environment is key to successful integration.

Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has grown from an obscure digital currency into a widely recognized financial asset. Its decentralized structure and promise of high returns have made it a popular choice. However, the intricacies surrounding its use, especially regarding taxation, have impeded broader acceptance. Senator Lummis's proposed tax exemption is an attempt to alleviate these issues by clarifying tax implications for small Bitcoin transactions.

Central to cryptocurrency is blockchain technology—a decentralized ledger documenting all transactions across a network of computers. This technology fosters transparency and security, making it an ideal foundation for digital currencies. For businesses exploring crypto payroll solutions, a solid grasp of blockchain's function will help navigate the complexities inherent in cryptocurrency transactions.

Senator Lummis's proposal to exempt small Bitcoin transactions from capital gains tax—specifically for transactions under $300—could have profound ramifications for crypto payroll regulations worldwide. Easing the tax burden on everyday transactions may lead to heightened Bitcoin adoption among U.S. businesses.

This U.S. tax exemption could prompt similar reforms in Europe and Asia. As American companies start using Bitcoin for payroll and other payments, European regulators may feel compelled to consider comparable measures to maintain competitiveness. This could create a more favorable environment for crypto payroll, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that often grapple with regulatory hurdles.

The proposed exemption could simplify compliance for SMEs utilizing crypto payroll. Tax-free transactions up to $300 would enable businesses to pay employees or settle invoices without triggering complex capital gains calculations. This clarity may promote wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments, particularly in tech-savvy industries and among remote teams.

While the proposed tax exemption offers many advantages, it also presents regulatory hurdles.

Aggregation and Abuse Prevention: To prevent taxpayers from breaking transactions into smaller amounts to evade taxes, regulators will need to introduce rules for aggregating related transactions. This could complicate enforcement and compliance.

Cross-Border Compliance: Businesses involved in cross-border transactions might find it challenging to navigate disparate tax treatments. If some jurisdictions adopt exemptions while others do not, compliance could become a major issue.

Tracking and Reporting Difficulties: The pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions complicates accurate tracking and reporting. Businesses will need robust systems to ensure adherence to tax regulations.

Defining Scope and Limits: Clearly establishing thresholds for "small transactions" and differentiating personal from investment activities will require careful legislative design to prevent loopholes.

Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could transform crypto payroll regulations not just in the U.S. but globally. By simplifying tax compliance for small transactions, this legislation could drive increased cryptocurrency payment adoption among businesses. However, the effectiveness of such reforms will hinge on how regulators address the resulting challenges and whether other countries follow suit. As the digital asset landscape evolves, businesses must remain vigilant and ready to navigate the complexities of crypto payroll and compliance.

The crypto industry is recoiling from a document reportedly outlining a U.S. Senate Democratic pitch on handling decentralized finance (DeFi) as a component of the wider effort toward regulating crypto in the U.S.



The proposal — a detailed outline describing an approach to DeFi, first reported by Politico — suggests that a firm or individuals that handle customer needs on the front end of a DeFi operation should have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and be regulated as a broker.



The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include "everyone in crypto," according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant.



"Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable," he argued. "This is not a 'first offer' in a negotiation; it's a list of demands that appear designed to kill the bill."



Summer Mersinger, who runs the Blockchain Association and was recently a commissioner at the CFTC, said the proposal "would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development and other applications in the United States."



"The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas," Mersinger said in a statement. "We urge our policymakers to stay at the table."



Before the Senate's crypto market structure work fell into the shadow of the ongoing negotiation to reopen the federal government, Senate Republicans and Democrats were circling each other over legislative language and seemed to be in range of making progress on a final, combined bill. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto.



This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as "anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end." However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as "sufficiently decentralized" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter.



The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. This liability question has been among the core concerns of the DeFi space.



Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin, have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over.



However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. While the crypto work has a long list of Democratic allies, they've made it clear that there are a number of changes they're seeking in the previous Republican legislative drafts before they can jump on board.

The UK government has announced plans to appoint a “digital markets champion” as part of its drive to modernize the way financial transactions are conducted by adopting blockchain-based shared ledgers.

News of the new role was announced by Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby, in a speech on Wednesday at the Digital Assets Week conference in London.

It's not yet clear who might be in line for the job, but the individual will need to be an industry figure with enough knowledge and connections to get competing agencies – the Bank of England, the UK Treasury, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – to agree to a common framework.

The government is also setting up a new group, the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce (DEMAT), to co-ordinate the UK's move away from paper-based share certificates. 

Tech suppliers are also being invited to bid to take part in the government's Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT), a platform to issue sovereign debt, Rigby is reported to have said.

The range of initiatives underlines the complexity of migrating the financial system from the manual, paper-based systems that have been in use for centuries to ones that are fully digital.

In July, the government set out the arguments for change in its Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy policy paper, saying today's financial processes are slow, costly, and rely on manual systems, which together stifle financial innovation.

Adopting blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) would, the paper argued, allow financial assets to exist as tokens on shared ledgers, overhauling markets by lowering costs, dramatically speeding up transactions, and increasing transparency.

“The ‘tokenisation' of assets could deliver a step change in market efficiency, for instance by enabling real-time data sharing which could improve transparency and lower operational costs,” the paper said.

“More broadly, it could enable a fundamental reimagining of the way financial markets operate, creating infrastructures that support both existing and new forms of asset issuance, transfer, and ownership.”

Despite this, the UK is at risk of falling behind its international peers in ways that will soon hinder London's preeminence as a financial hub. The EU already has the EU DLT Pilot Regime and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the US has the Genius Act for stablecoins, and Singapore has Project Guardian.

Additionally, Swift, the global financial messaging network, recently announced that it would introduce blockchain-based ledger as part of its platform, an initiative it has been testing for several years.

The organization is developing a prototype shared digital ledger to accelerate cross-border payments in conjunction with 30 global financial institutions and blockchain company Consensys.

This will eventually extend the Swift platform to validate transactions and enforce rules governing smart contracts, the organization said.

“You may think, ‘Wow, aren't those opposites? Swift and blockchain. Traditional finance and decentralized finance. Can they really go together?' In the regulated system of the future, we believe they can. Banks are ready for it. And they're asking us to play a bigger role,” said Swift CEO Javier Perez-Tasso at the Sibos 2025 conference.

In the UK, progress towards a regulatory environment remains a work in progress, with a lot of detail still unclear. For now, the Treasury and the FCA are still at the stage of producing policy papers.

According to Julia Demidova of FinTech company FIS Global, the first job of the new digital markets champion will be to work with the Bank of England, the FCA, and the Treasury. 

“The champion will try to achieve some kind of consensus between the three parties. We need a champion in this space to reduce some of the frictions that exist,” Demidova told Computerworld. “We haven't been moving fast enough in comparison to other markets such as the EU, which has a consensus on what MiCA is.”

The UK needs to develop a clear set of priorities as soon as possible, especially over how it plans to support asset classes such as stablecoins, she said. Right now, there is a lack of clarity over whether these can be used for payments.

“The champion will have to establish what's missing today from the existing regulatory frameworks.” said Demidova.

The UK government has recognized this need. In Demidova's view, this suggests the digital champion will have the political backing to unblock the regulatory process.

Lurking in the background to all this is the security of technologies that are still unproven under real-world conditions. “These are new, emerging technologies, and this brings some potential cyber security issues that we may not know about. This is a new surface for attacks that might emerge in this ecosystem,” cautioned Demidova.

It's a debate that will interest IT management, an analyst noted. “The challenge for CIOs is integration. Legacy ERPs weren't built for immutable, token-based workflows,” commented Dan Silverman, co-CEO at data intelligence company, Balcony.

“Tokenization isn't just financial, it's foundational for secure, verifiable data exchange across public and private systems,” he added. The risk is that the effect of uncertainty on businesses is ignored in favor of institutional interests, not least because countries are adopting these technologies at different rates.

 Olga Kharif notes that not everyone is ignoring one of the fundamental risks that comes with buying Bitcoin during the current record-breaking rally in the crypto market bellwether.

Gold and Bitcoin have become the darlings of what's been dubbed the  debasement trade as of late, rising to record highs as skittish investors pull away from major currencies.

Oops, something went wrong

Retail Bitcoin traders made themselves heard today, causing $700 million in crypto liquidations. The price of BTC fell by around $4,000 as on-chain activity spiked, even though institutions kept buying. 

Whether or not BTC keeps dropping or recovers soon, we need to pay attention to these dynamics. Corporate liquidity is very influential in the market, but it's not the final arbiter of price.

When Bitcoin hit two successive all-time highs earlier this week, it caused a little consternation in the community. This took place despite a lack of retail activity, with institutional investors powering the growth.

Crucially, these corporations continued making huge purchases while BTC's value was inflated.

In other words, there have been fears that these inflows could profoundly alter market cycles. Arthur Hayes even proclaimed that the four-year cycle was dead and that global institutional liquidity would determine token prices now.

Today, however, these concerns seem less serious. Bitcoin fell around $4,000 in the last 24 hours, spawning a frenzy of crypto liquidations. Over $114 million in total short positions were eradicated in one hour:

A few key factors suggest that retail Bitcoin traders caused all these liquidations. For one thing, ETF issuers continued buying BTC at elevated rates, and the products are seeing huge inflows. Meanwhile, BTC's on-chain trading activity has spiked between 4% and 5%, showing that activity is stirring awake.

Analysts have already identified some of the most likely causes for Bitcoin's retreat to $120,000, which triggered these liquidations. They seem like pretty standard price actions; long-term traders are taking profits, holder accumulation rates sparked low confidence, etc.

Furthermore, there are even signs that BTC could rebound in the near future.

This, too, presents a useful opportunity to gather valuable market data. These new structural forces are very powerful, but they aren't all-powerful.

Retail activity still spurred a major Bitcoin price dump, causing a cascade of liquidations. What new narratives can help explain this behavior and enable accurate predictions?

Whether Bitcoin keeps going up or down, these questions should be at the forefront of traders' minds. These institutions are apparently going to keep stockpiling Bitcoin either way.

Oops, something went wrong

The first step of Monad's long-awaited token airdrop is finally arriving next week, the project announced Thursday.

The Monad airdrop claim portal will open for users on Tuesday. The project has not yet revealed details about eligibility requirements for receiving allocations of the Monad token, MON, nor has it unveiled information about the token's supply or planned release schedule.

The much-hyped Ethereum and Solana competitor is also widely expected to launch its mainnet in tandem with the Monad token.

A representative for Monad told Decrypt that only the airdrop claim portal will debut on Tuesday—not the airdrop itself, nor the network's mainnet. Further details about the MON token and airdrop, including a tokenomics breakdown, as well as regarding the Monad mainnet launch, will be shared “in the near future,” they added.

The MON token airdrop is heavily anticipated to come before other buzzy airdrops forecasted on the horizon, including those for crypto mainstays OpenSea and MetaMask, according to Myriad Markets users. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

For years, Monad has attracted loads of attention and capital in the crypto ecosystem—thanks to high-profile backers and lofty promises to build an EVM-compatible layer-one blockchain that's far more efficient than Ethereum.

In 2024, the project raised a whopping $225 million in a funding round led by crypto venture giant Paradigm. Monad was founded in 2022 by Jump Crypto alum Keone Hon.

How to Prepare for Monad: The High-Speed EVM Layer-1 Blockchain

Monad's value proposition is based on two key premises. One, that the vast majority of decentralized finance activity takes place on networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the system backing the Ethereum ecosystem; and two, that users desire a speedier and more scalable alternative to Ethereum that doesn't sacrifice security and interoperability.

Though the network's slow rollout has become something of a meme in crypto circles, Monad did launch its testnet in February. The testnet has featured a robust ecosystem stretching beyond standard DeFi applications into gaming, NFTs, meme coins, and prediction markets. 

Since February, users and developers have been able to build out projects by utilizing valueless “testnet MON” tokens. While the project has not yet announced whether activity on the Monad testnet will contribute to a user's MON allocation, such engagement is typically taken into account when coordinating a token airdrop, as a means of rewarding early adopters.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Digital Currency Group subsidiary Yuma, focused on scaling the decentralized AI network Bittensor, is launching an asset management division, according to an announcement on Thursday.

Yuma Asset Management will be anchored by a $10 million investment from DCG, the crypto investment giant.

According to the announcement, the asset manager will kick off with two flagship strategies that invest in Bittensor subnet tokens: the Yuma Subnet Composite Fund, designed for market-cap weighted exposure across all active subnets, and the Yuma Large Cap Subnet Fund, focused on larger subnets.

The Bittensor network is a decentralized, blockchain-based network that enables collaborative machine learning and AI model development across specialized subnets. The network rewards validators and miners in its native TAO token for contributing computational resources.

Yuma, founded in November 2024, said earlier this week it is "actively validating" over 120 subnets and mining on others. It has also "provided capital to 15 subnet operators" and has onboarded firms like BitGo, Copper, and Crypto.com as validator partners.

On Tuesday, TradeBlock's co-founders Greg and Jeff Schvey, brothers, joined Yuma as chief operating officer and chief technology officer, respectively.

Uganda has launched one of Africa's most ambitious blockchain initiatives to date, a $5.5 billion real-world asset tokenization project paired with the country's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot. 

The new initiative, led by the Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Uganda's Diacente Group, will bring $5.5 billion worth of physical infrastructure assets on-chain. The tokenized portfolio will span sectors such as food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade. 

The rollout includes a pilot of Uganda's digital shilling, a CBDC backed by Ugandan treasury bonds and deployed on GSN's permissioned blockchain.

The move comes as neighboring Kenya advances its Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, marking a significant moment for digital finance regulation and infrastructure development across East Africa.

According to GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley, the initiative represents a major step toward linking blockchain technology with tangible development outcomes. 

“We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,” he said.

The CBDC is designed to operate in a regulated environment and comply with international standards, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. 

BREAKING: MPs have passed a Bill granting investigators the power to shut down social media accounts spreading what they term is Harmful Content before it circulates.

It will be accessible through smartphones and USSD technology, allowing over 40 million Ugandans to transact using a secure, mobile-first digital currency for the first time.

The partnership supports Uganda's Vision 2040 and aligns with the African Union's Agenda 2063, as well as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) framework. 

The Karamoja Green Industrial and Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), managed by Diacente, is at the core of this rollout and has been designated a national flagship under Uganda's Karamoja Regional Development Plan (2025–2035). 

The project is expected to create over one million jobs and could generate up to $10 billion in annual exports, reinforcing Uganda's position as a regional digital and industrial hub.

Diacente Group Chairman Edgar Agaba added that the partnership “goes beyond infrastructure,” emphasizing that integrating tokenization and CBDCs into Uganda's economic roadmap will help attract new capital, empower local industries, and drive sustainable growth.

Meanwhile, Kenya is making progress on its own crypto regulation efforts. The country's National Assembly has advanced the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill (N.A. Bill No. 15 of 2025) to the third reading stage. 

The legislation, which grants oversight powers to the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), seeks to regulate digital assets and combat risks such as money laundering and terrorism financing.

Kuria Kimani, Chair of the Finance and National Planning Committee, emphasized the bill's role in protecting Kenya's monetary system while fostering innovation. 

The Treasury will have the authority to issue additional regulations covering stablecoins, tokenization, exchanges, ICOs, and cybersecurity requirements.

If approved, the bill will move to President William Ruto for signature. 

Local industry group VACC noted that the legislation places Kenya among Africa's top five nations advancing comprehensive crypto regulations, opening doors for innovation and investment in the region's growing digital economy.

Sub-Saharan Africa has emerged as one of the fastest-growing regions for digital asset adoption, according to a September report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. 

The region, which includes countries such as Uganda and Kenya, received $205 billion in on-chain value between July 2024 and June 2025, ranking third globally for growth.

Nigeria remains the continent's leader in digital currency innovation, having launched Africa's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2021. Ghana and South Africa have completed pilots, while Egypt plans a rollout by 2030. 

Kenya and Rwanda are still conducting public consultations. Statista projects that Africa's crypto user base could surpass 75 million by 2026, generating an estimated $5.1 billion in revenue.

Stablecoins now account for 43% of Sub-Saharan Africa's total crypto transaction volume, driven by Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia.

Ripple recently expanded its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, across the continent through partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card. The token is being tested in remittance, treasury, and climate-insurance applications.

In June, Visa also partnered with Yellow Card to expand stablecoin payments across Africa, starting with pilot programs this year.

Regulatory momentum continues to build. Kenya's proposed Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill is viewed as a potential model for regional frameworks, while Mauritius, Botswana, and several Central African nations have already passed formal crypto laws. 

Despite rapid growth, over 80% of intra-African payments still rely on foreign banks, showing the demand for local digital payment infrastructure.

DappRadar noted BTC took the spotlight, but app building and activity continued. NFT are also taking on new roles, linked to tokenization and DeFi. 

DappRadar noted apps were highly active in Q3, despite BTC taking the spotlight. In the latest quarterly report, DappRadar noted new trends emerging, especially tokenization, a return of NFT, and DeFi making new records of value locked. 

In Q3, decentralized apps drew in 18.7M active wallets per day, down 22.4% from the previous quarter. Gaming apps made up 25% of all activity, up from 20.1% for the previous quarter. However, DappRadar warned only a few decentralized games are purely about play, and most have some form of DeFi mechanics. 

NFT followed with 18.5% share of apps, while DeFi had a 17.9% share. More specific use cases, such as SocialFi and AI, lost momentum, resulting in only a small increase in overall activity. 

While some app categories were surprisingly healthy, the slowdown in the AI agent space was one of the major reasons for the activity downturn. Virtuals Protocol changed its relevance from Q2, when it attracted 10K active wallets daily and rapid AI agent minting. In Q3, the platform carried 1,000 to 1,500 wallets daily, making up $100K in daily value transfers. 

The new wave of SocialFi apps like The Arena, Layer3 and OnchainGm  lost 50% of their activity, down to 1.57M in daily active wallets. 

Overall, apps are redistributing their activity, with utility apps still at the peak, as in the case of the Kai-Ching payment platform. 

App teams are retesting the NFT model, increasing the number of transfers and trades. In Q3, apps sold 18.1M NFT, up from 12.5M in the second quarter. In Q3, NFT activity generated $1.6B in trading volumes through apps. 

Some of the NFT activity is niche, and has not brought back mass adoption. Additionally, the items bought and sold go at much lower prices, as a fun activity rather than a life-changing investment. 

Still, 2.14M wallets interacted with NFT, each holding on average over 8 items. The number of interacting wallets grew by 28% quarter-on-quarter, while sales grew by 158%. The type of NFT traded also changed, as game-based items were less active. Interest shifted to Sorare items, mostly linked to sports and sports celebrities. 

Some of the activity with NFT is linked to OpenSea incentives for an eventual native token airdrop. Older blue-chip avatar collections also changed hands, with a special focus on the Pudgy Penguins collection. 

OpenSea increased its activity by 88% in Q3, while Blur grew its activity by 178% against the previous quarter. Moonbirds turned into one of the hottest collections after Yuga Labs divested some of its assets and sold them to the Orange Cap Games team. Moonbirds may soon have its native Solana token, BIRB, as the team announced plans in early October. 

The Moonbirds shift to a tokenized collection follows the general trend of integrating NFT into DeFi protocols. NFT are being used for tokenization, creating digital identities and copies for physical collections. The CryptoPunks collection is also used for its underlying value in minting and burning PUNKSTR tokens. Holding PUNKSTR is a proxy for the price of Punks NFT, without the need to hold the assets.

This story was originally published by the Daily Montanan.

The Montana Legislature grappled with a lot of technological innovation during the 2025 session including determining how to regulate the growing digital economy and this month has seen the launch of new laws and committees focused on the digital space. 

One new law, the Financial Freedom and Innovation Act, took effect in October, paving the way for companies that issue network tokens to do business in Montana, and ensuring the State Auditor's office has authority to regulate the burgeoning industry and prosecute bad actors. 

The bill, Senate Bill 265, carried by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, defines a number of buzzwords in the digital asset space — such as network token, blockchain, and decentralized network — in state law. It also provides the framework for uses of network tokens and what boxes businesses must check off to do business in Montana. 

Under the new Innovation Act in Montana, companies that issue digital tokens — used to power decentralized services like computing, data storage and media streaming, among other things — can register with the Commissioner's office as non-securities assets, making Montana among the first states to do so.

Zolnikov said network tokens have the ability to decentralize so many parts of industry, essentially cutting out middle man companies, which he said fits a Montanan ethos. 

“If you have a new technology that's an exception to the rule, but you want to play by the rules, what do you do?” he said. “We finally gave them a regulatory path forward.”

In a press release, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Jim Brown said the new law charts the course for “responsible innovation.”

“This law gives entrepreneurs the certainty they need while ensuring Montanans are protected. SB 265 strengthens both our business climate and our national reputation as a state that embraces innovation while striking the right balance,” Brown said. 

Speaking to the Daily Montanan this week, Brown said that one of his office's main roles is to protect Montana consumers from “fraudsters and bad actors.”

“Not only in the insurance area, but in financial institutions, which includes digital currencies and anything related to the blockchain,” Brown said. “…At this point in the world of digital currency, there isn't a whole lot on the books in Montana about giving either my office or the attorney general's office the authority to either regulate companies or persons who engage in this.”

On the consumer protection front, Brown has been advocating on a national level to strengthen laws in the digital space. He recently joined with securities regulators from across the nation in urging the federal government to move forward with regulating aspects of the digital economy, including giving states prosecutorial authority in the digital space. 

In a letter sent last month, Brown and his counterparts with the North American Securities Administrators Association asked for changes to a proposed federal market structure legislation that he said “is a gift to fraudsters,” by limited actions states can take to investigate and charge crypto scammers. 

The Association is also behind legislation called the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act which would cement state authority to prosecute fraud involving digital assets. 

“We believe we have the authority to go after these bad actors,” Brown said. “I take the authority of this office to prosecute bad actors very seriously to protect consumers. … and we don't want to create a system where smaller bad actors fall through the cracks.”

Brown said with the explosion of digital assets in recent years, his office has seen a parallel increase in fraudulent claims within the digital space. 

Last year, his office received nine complaints of digital asset fraud, totaling more than a million dollars. Through September of this year, his office has already received 20 complaints — to the tune of $3.1 million. 

On Tuesday, Brown's office issued a press release about an individual charged in Missoula County for defrauding investors, including several elderly Montanans, through a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. 

According to the release, an Idaho resident and two uncharged co-conspirators set up a “fund” of more than one million dollars from investors purportedly invested in cryptocurrency. 

The defendant is charged with six felony counts of elder exploitation, securities fraud, operating a pyramid promotional scheme and operating as a securities dealer without a license. 

“By the end of the century, (blockchain technology and digital assets) are going to be so integrated in our economy and our way of life that people won't even recognize how we operated financially in 2025,” Brown told the Daily Montanan. “While that's exciting and I want to be on the forefront as a regulator and help support that, we have to keep our ability to prosecute bad actors. We can't have it be the wild west out here.”

Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force holds first meeting 

On Monday, members of the newly formed Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force met for the first time to discuss the state of cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation in Montana and how to remain competitive in the digital economy. 

The task force, created during the 2025 Legislature, is comprised of legislators, representatives from the State Auditor and Attorney General's offices, and public members with experience in the financial or digital technology sectors. 

Co-chair Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, said he envisions the task force as “a big brainstorming operation.”

“So many people think about crypto when they think about blockchain, but it's so much more than that, so much more than the financial end of it,” Lammers told the task force. “But, it has implications in agriculture, fraud, chain of custody, record keeping — all kinds of things we could apply this baby to.”

One area of discussion on Monday revolved around Wyoming's approach to digital assets, which has included launching their own state-backed cryptocurrency. 

“They've certainly laid the baseline for this,” Brown, a member of the task force, told the Daily Montanan. “We might not be looking at having Montana be the issuer of a stablecoin, but we will look at a model of what's made Wyoming a leader in blockchain technology … we'll look at how Montana can be an innovator like Wyoming is, maybe even going beyond what they've done.”

In upcoming meetings, the task force will focus on educational sessions to understand the scope of the digital economy and identify specific topics to tackle, as well as examine how the other states are currently regulating blockchain and other digital technologies. 

“I think we're going to be able to come up with some real great stuff here to make our lives easier, and to protect the people in Montana,” Lammers said.

The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has paused many SEC operations, including the review and approval of crypto ETFs. Filings and enforcement actions remain on hold, leaving investors waiting. The Senate is expected to vote for the seventh time today to end the shutdown. Current market odds, such as those from Polymarket, say the shutdown may only conclude after October 15.

This delay temporarily slows institutional entry into crypto markets, particularly through ETFs, but it does not diminish long-term momentum. Experts are now looking for altcoins positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity returns.

Altcoin 1: Sei SEIUSDT

Sei is gaining attention from institutional players, including BlackRock and Brevan Howard, who have launched tokenized funds on its network.

Sei's combination of institutional backing and growing on-chain activity makes it a strong buy ahead of ETF approvals.

Altcoin 2: Sui SUIUSDT

Sui continues expanding through gaming and DeFi applications.

Price still lags behind network growth, offering potential upside as market attention shifts back to altcoins.

Altcoin 3: Solana SOLUSDT

Solana is positioned to benefit from upcoming ETF approvals and growing adoption.

Solana's strong infrastructure and ETF catalysts make it a top choice for near-term accumulation.

Altcoin 4: XRP XRPUSDT

XRP remains an institutional favorite despite retail uncertainty.

Market sentiment shows oversold conditions, setting XRP up for gains toward $4 once regulatory clarity returns.

 Afghanistan's internet blackout highlighted the need for more decentralized internet infrastructure solutions to bolster blockchain's resistance to censorship. 

Afghanistan's recent nationwide internet outage underscored a critical weakness in the world's leading decentralized blockchains: their dependence on centralized internet providers that remain vulnerable to government intervention and technical failures.

The country suffered a near-total internet shutdown that lasted about 48 hours before connectivity was restored on Oct. 1, Reuters reported. The disruption was reportedly ordered by the Taliban administration, though officials later blamed “technical issues” involving fiber optic cables.

While blockchains aim to provide people with a public, censorship-resistant network for value transfers, their reliance on centralized internet providers makes these use cases challenging during outages.

“The Afghanistan blackout is not just a regional connectivity crisis: It is a wake-up call,” according to Michail Angelov, co-founder of decentralized WiFi platform Roam Network. “When connectivity is monopolized by a handful of centralized providers, the promise of blockchain can collapse overnight,” he said.

The nationwide internet and mobile data services outage affected about 13 million citizens, according to a September report from ABC News. This marked the first nationwide internet shutdown under the Taliban rule, following regional restrictions imposed earlier in September to curb online activities deemed “immoral.”

The Taliban denied the ban, blaming the internet outage on technical issues, including fiber optic cable problems.

Iran has also been facing internet censorship issues since the start of its conflict with Israel.

The Iranian government shut down internet access for 13 days in June, except for domestic messaging apps, prompting Iranians to seek out hidden internet proxy links for temporary access, The Guardian reported on June 25.

The Afghanistan blackout adds momentum to calls for decentralized connectivity solutions that remove single points of control. 

Decentralized wireless networks are emerging as alternatives to centralized internet providers, as part of a broader technological shift known as a decentralized physical infrastructure network, or DePIN.

Roam aims to build a smartphone-powered decentralized wireless network that crowdsources mobile signal measurements to create a “living map of connectivity.” 

Along with the project's incoming eSIM implementation, this enables devices to automatically select the best available internet options, including public carriers, a private mesh or a peer-powered local network.

“Roam users can see in real time what works where: No guesswork during outages,” which ensures a connection even when “centralized backbones fail,” said Angelov

World Mobile is the largest decentralized network with 2.3 million daily active users, spanning over 20 countries, according to data from worldmobile.io

The project surpassed $9.8 million in total revenue in August, which represents revenue distributed across AirNode operators, stakers and other contributors.

Helium is the second-largest decentralized wireless network, with over 190 countries and 112,000 total hotspots worldwide. It claims to have over 1.3 million daily users on its decentralized network.

Users are incentivized to host a hotspot for internet coverage through Helium (HNT) token rewards.

Advocates say blockchain technology's promise of financial freedom and censorship resistance cannot be fully realized until the underlying internet itself becomes more distributed.

As Angelov put it, “If decentralization stops at the protocol layer, we haven't really solved the problem — we've just shifted where the control lies.”

The UK General Regulatory Chamber's Upper Tribunal (UT) has ruled in favor of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which appealed against a 2023 decision that it could not fine Clearview AI over GDPR violations.

In what some Reg commenters called a "knee-capping of the UK GDPR" at the time, the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decided in October 2023 that the ICO did not have the territorial scope to issue the £7.5 million fine (c $10 million) it planned for the US-based AI company.

The case relates to an ICO fine issued in May 2022 after the regulator accused Clearview of scraping Brits' images uploaded to social media before adding them to a database used to train its AI algorithms.

As we reported at the time, the FTT accepted that it was reasonable to expect UK residents' faces to appear in Clearview's database, given the size of the country and the ample access to the internet most people enjoy.

However, on Tuesday, the UT upheld most of the grounds on which the ICO based its appeal, crucially ruling [PDF] that Clearview's data processing fell within the territorial scope of the UK GDPR.

It also ruled that the FTT incorrectly applied the law when deciding that Clearview's data processing fell out of scope based on the fact that it was doing so as a competent authority for the purposes of assisting law enforcement clients.

In its appeal of the ICO's decision to fine it £7.5 million ($10 million, or $9.43 million at the time) in 2022, Clearview heavily leaned on Article 2(2)(a) of the UK GDPR to clear its data processing activities.

This is the provision that precludes foreign data processing for law enforcement purposes from regulatory penalties.

Clearview said when appealing against the fine that its service is an internet search engine offered only to non-UK/EU law enforcement and national security agencies, whose uses are out of scope of the regulations per Article 2(2)(a).

The Information Commissioner accepted this was valid. Under the principles of international law, one state cannot seek to compel another to meet a legal demand, i.e. a foreign power investigating a Brit for a crime committed on its own soil should not attract interference from the UK, or penalties under the UK GDPR.

The UT's decision this week, however, overturned the FTT's previous decision and this crucial aspect of Clearview's appeal against the ICO's fine.

It ruled that Clearview's processing was related to behavior monitoring of UK residents, per Article 3(2)(b), and was still bound by UK GDPR regulation despite being carried out on behalf of its foreign law enforcement clients.

The UT, citing case law and previous statements from the EU's Advocate General, said that this exclusion only applies to the UK state itself, and not a commercial entity such as Clearview selling services to foreign governments.

Even if the data is, or can be used by a government in the interests of its national security, the data processing still falls within the scope of the GDPR.

The latest ruling, which New York-based Clearview can also appeal against, means that the case will be sent back to the FTT to decide whether the ICO can, in fact, impose the fine.

This case was solely focused on determining the UK GDPR's territorial scope, not the fine, although the ruling suggests the ICO's decision to issue a fine was valid.

The FTT will then decide again whether, in light of the UT's decision, Clearview contravened the UK GDPR.

John Edwards, the UK's Information Commissioner, said: "The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge.

"The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK."

Jack Mulcaire, chief legal officer at Clearview AI, told The Register: "Clearview AI is disappointed by this ruling which misapplied the law to improperly seek to regulate how American companies serve the US government. We do not offer any product or do any business in the United Kingdom. We intend to file an appeal."

On that point, Jon Baines, Senior Data Protection Specialist at Mishcon de Reya LLP, commented: "It's worth noting that it was a very strong, three-judge bench (with President of the Chamber Mrs Justice Heather Williams DBE as lead judge) and the judgment very much has the feel of one the bench has tried to make as 'appeal-proof' as possible." ®

A former
Israeli intelligence official is asking a court to force Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to turn over records of foreign bank accounts,
cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property as part of his defense against a
$150,000 defamation lawsuit filed by the prime minister.

But is it
really possible to access such information, especially in the supposedly
anonymous cryptocurrency market? Experts who spoke with FinanceMagnates.com say
yes.

Dr. Udi
Levi, who spent three decades with the Mossad, the National Security Council,
and military intelligence, filed the legal response this week, calling
Netanyahu's suit a tactic to shut down public questions about possible
financial ties to Qatar. The court filing asks for records of foreign bank
accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property owned by Netanyahu and
his family.

In his
court filing, Levi said he's received reports of witnesses who claim to have
seen cash deliveries to the Netanyahu family, both inside Israel and abroad. He
said those accounts included allegations of foreign bank accounts, digital
wallets, and real estate purchases made with money that was never declared.

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members.

The demands
arrive at a moment when tracking crypto has become far more realistic than most
people assume. Isaac Joshua, CEO of Gems Launchpad, said once funds pass
through centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or OKX, analytics

such as Chainalysis and TRM Labs can connect blockchain activity to verified
identities.

“The
offshore privacy era is ending,” Joshua said. “Israeli holders should
expect greater scrutiny and may consider voluntary disclosure before global
data-sharing becomes fully automatic.”

Israel has committed to adopting the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, known as CARF, which will create a standardized system for collecting and exchanging data on cryptocurrency transactions between countries. Through OECD information-sharing frameworks and CARF, more than 50 countries will automatically exchange crypto account data from regulated exchanges starting in 2027.

There is still a long way to go before that happens. For now, from a procedural or political standpoint, it may be considered impossible. However, current technological solutions suggest otherwise.

The
technical reality of crypto tracking has shifted dramatically in recent years.
Matthew Stern, CEO of CNC Intelligence, explained to FinanceMagnates.com that
the blockchain  
            Blockchain
           
      Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.  The ledger can be public or private (permissioned). In this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data, making it not only open but verifiable.

    Read this Term is an immutable ledger, which means even if it takes authorities
time to catch up, the trail doesn't disappear.

“Wallets can often be tied back to real identities,” Stern said. Analytics
tools have become far more advanced, some even tracking cash-for-crypto
schemes. “With governments and private players teaming up against money
laundering and terror financing, Israeli traders should expect their overseas
accounts to be within reach of tax authorities.”

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members. He also requested information on political campaign funding
received by Netanyahu and his parties in the 2012 and 2018 elections.

Stern's view is echoed by Nathan Bekerman, Head of Product at Station70. Even if the funds were held in self-custodian wallets and not directly linked to any identity, “most blockchains are actually highly transparent, not private,” he said.

“Every
transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which means with the right
analytics tools, tracing funds is often easier than hiding them,” Bekerman
added

The demands
come as Israeli law enforcement continues to investigate what's been called
“Qatargate,” a scandal in which close aides to Netanyahu are accused
of taking money from Qatar to promote Doha's interests in Israeli media. 

Two of
Netanyahu's top advisers were arrested in connection with the probe, and court
documents suggest they're suspected of accepting bribes and coordinating
messages to journalists that portrayed Qatar favorably while downplaying
Egypt's role in ceasefire negotiations.

Netanyahu
denied all of the allegations through his attorney Uriel Nizri, who called
Levi's comments “sick and insane” and accused political opponents of
spreading lies to bring down a sitting prime minister during wartime. The prime
minister claimed Levi used his security background to give false legitimacy to
what he called baseless conspiracy theories.

Levi argued
that Netanyahu, as a public figure, isn't immune from public scrutiny,
particularly when there are credible questions about financial conduct. The
former intelligence official said the radio interview was a good-faith call for
transparency, not libel.

accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property owned by Netanyahu and
his family.

In his
court filing, Levi said he's received reports of witnesses who claim to have
seen cash deliveries to the Netanyahu family, both inside Israel and abroad. He
said those accounts included allegations of foreign bank accounts, digital
wallets, and real estate purchases made with money that was never declared.

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members.

The demands
arrive at a moment when tracking crypto has become far more realistic than most
people assume. Isaac Joshua, CEO of Gems Launchpad, said once funds pass
through centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or OKX, analytics

such as Chainalysis and TRM Labs can connect blockchain activity to verified
identities.

“The
offshore privacy era is ending,” Joshua said. “Israeli holders should
expect greater scrutiny and may consider voluntary disclosure before global
data-sharing becomes fully automatic.”

Israel has committed to adopting the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, known as CARF, which will create a standardized system for collecting and exchanging data on cryptocurrency transactions between countries. Through OECD information-sharing frameworks and CARF, more than 50 countries will automatically exchange crypto account data from regulated exchanges starting in 2027.

There is still a long way to go before that happens. For now, from a procedural or political standpoint, it may be considered impossible. However, current technological solutions suggest otherwise.

The
technical reality of crypto tracking has shifted dramatically in recent years.
Matthew Stern, CEO of CNC Intelligence, explained to FinanceMagnates.com that

    Read this Term is an immutable ledger, which means even if it takes authorities
time to catch up, the trail doesn't disappear.

“Wallets can often be tied back to real identities,” Stern said. Analytics
tools have become far more advanced, some even tracking cash-for-crypto
schemes. “With governments and private players teaming up against money
laundering and terror financing, Israeli traders should expect their overseas
accounts to be within reach of tax authorities.”

Levi wants
the court to compel Netanyahu to produce verified bank statements,
cryptocurrency records, and property purchase documents for himself and his
family members. He also requested information on political campaign funding
received by Netanyahu and his parties in the 2012 and 2018 elections.

Stern's view is echoed by Nathan Bekerman, Head of Product at Station70. Even if the funds were held in self-custodian wallets and not directly linked to any identity, “most blockchains are actually highly transparent, not private,” he said.

“Every
transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which means with the right
analytics tools, tracing funds is often easier than hiding them,” Bekerman
added

The demands
come as Israeli law enforcement continues to investigate what's been called
“Qatargate,” a scandal in which close aides to Netanyahu are accused
of taking money from Qatar to promote Doha's interests in Israeli media. 

Two of
Netanyahu's top advisers were arrested in connection with the probe, and court
documents suggest they're suspected of accepting bribes and coordinating
messages to journalists that portrayed Qatar favorably while downplaying
Egypt's role in ceasefire negotiations.

Netanyahu
denied all of the allegations through his attorney Uriel Nizri, who called
Levi's comments “sick and insane” and accused political opponents of
spreading lies to bring down a sitting prime minister during wartime. The prime
minister claimed Levi used his security background to give false legitimacy to
what he called baseless conspiracy theories.

Levi argued
that Netanyahu, as a public figure, isn't immune from public scrutiny,
particularly when there are credible questions about financial conduct. The
former intelligence official said the radio interview was a good-faith call for
transparency, not libel.

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, and projects that connect real-world value with blockchain utility are catching investors' attention.

Among these innovations, Avalon X (AVLX) stands out as one of the best RWA crypto projects to emerge in 2025.

The idea of real estate tokenization has transformed how people view property investment. By converting tangible assets into blockchain-based tokens, Avalon X simplifies access to one of the world's largest markets.

Its presale crypto phase marks an opportunity for early adopters to explore how blockchain can bring transparency and liquidity to real estate—an asset class long dominated by barriers to entry and limited accessibility.

Join the Avalon X team for a live AMA on Friday, October 10th on X official.

Avalon X is introducing a groundbreaking platform that merges blockchain innovation with real-world assets, reshaping how investors interact with property-backed opportunities. All smart contracts within the ecosystem are independently audited by top-tier security firms such as CertiK, ensuring trust, transparency, and protection from vulnerabilities.

What sets Avalon X apart from many presale coins is its deep connection to tangible assets through Grupo Avalon, a property developer with over $1 billion in ongoing projects.

The AVLX token follows a deflationary model, creating scarcity while offering passive income opportunities through staking. Holders can also enjoy property-related rewards and exclusive access to partner developments.

This thoughtful combination of tokenization and blockchain infrastructure showcases why Avalon X is being recognized among the top RWA crypto contenders, offering a more structured approach to decentralized real estate participation.

Mark your calendars for Friday, October 10th, when a live AMA featuring an Avalon X representative will take place. You can share your questions early through the Google Form for a chance to get featured.

Avalon X is on a mission to make property investment accessible to anyone, anywhere. Its blockchain-powered model introduces fractional ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in projects that were once reserved for high-net-worth individuals.

By partnering with Grupo Avalon, with a development portfolio valued near $1 billion, Avalon X moves beyond promises—it delivers infrastructure that supports real-world integration.

Key highlights include:

To celebrate its launch, Avalon X is offering exciting opportunities for its community. Grupo Avalon is gifting a luxury townhouse in the exclusive Eco Avalon development to one lucky participant. In addition, the $1M giveaway offers ten winners a chance to claim $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens.

To participate, users simply need to:
Add their wallet address to their dashboard, invest at least $100 in AVLX tokens, and refer friends to earn extra entries.

Every referral grants 10 bonus entries toward the $100,000 prize.

This initiative highlights Avalon X's community-first vision, aligning with the growing demand for real estate tokenization among the best crypto presales of 2025.

For those exploring where to buy presale crypto, Avalon X has made the process seamless. The AVLX presale is currently live, priced at $0.005 per token, with over $155,000 raised and 31,179,661 AVLX tokens sold. A 10% bonus is still active for early contributors.

AVLX tokens grant access to rewards from real-world projects, discounts on partner properties, and staking opportunities that promote long-term ecosystem growth.

However, it is essential to note that AVLX tokens are not shares or ownership instruments, but rather a utility component within the platform's blockchain architecture.

This integration of blockchain technology and real estate tokenization reflects a growing trend among top RWA crypto projects, where decentralized systems meet tangible investment assets to build sustainable financial ecosystems.

The rise of real estate tokenization represents one of the most transformative shifts in modern investing. Projects like Avalon X are redefining how blockchain connects with physical assets, making real-world investing simpler, safer, and more transparent.

As one of the best crypto presales 2025, Avalon X bridges two massive industries—crypto and real estate—by enabling everyday investors to participate in institutional-grade projects. Its combination of verified audits, tangible backing, and community engagement reflects the broader movement toward 100x RWA crypto innovations that prioritize trust and accessibility.

With blockchain unlocking new layers of efficiency and inclusion, Avalon X demonstrates how tokenization could reshape the global financial landscape—one property at a time.

iCo Medios, a leading digital out-of-home (DOOH) media company in Colombia, today (9th October, 2025) announced a strategic partnership with VIOOH, the leading premium global digital out-of-home (DOOH) supply-side platform. This alliance, officially signed in March 2025, marks a significant milestone for the Colombian advertising industry — enabling programmatic access to additional high-impact screens in key urban locations for both local and international advertisers.

The partnership integrates iCo Medios' premium DOOH inventory, currently 72 digital screens located in Bogotá, Medellín and Cali, into VIOOH's platform, making these assets available for programmatic buying from anywhere in the world. The screens are strategically placed in high-traffic environments including shopping centres, mass transit systems, and key urban access points.

With more than 32 million monthly impressions and coverage across Colombia's three main cities, iCo Medios is pioneering the shift from traditional to data-driven, measurable, and flexible DOOH. The integration into VIOOH's platform empowers buyers to activate campaigns in Colombia with the same ease and intelligence they use for digital media. Brands will be able to target audiences by geolocation, day-parting, mobility patterns, weekdays or weather conditions, maximising message relevance and campaign efficiency.

"At iCo Medios, we are very proud to announce our partnership with VIOOH, a key step in advancing programmatic OOH in Colombia and the region. By integrating our premium digital inventory — strategically located across high-impact environments — into VIOOH's global SSP, we are enabling advertisers to access our network with greater efficiency, precision, and measurability. This collaboration not only strengthens our commercial offering but also positions iCo Medios at the forefront of digital out-of-home innovation in Colombia," said Ricardo Echeverri, CEO, iCo Medios.

"We're excited to partner with iCo Medios to expand programmatic DOOH for the Colombian market. Latin America represents a significant growth opportunity for VIOOH, and iCo Medios' strategic positioning across Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali provides an ideal entry point for brands looking to reach high-value audiences in Colombia's key urban centres. Their premium inventory in high-traffic environments, combined with advanced targeting capabilities like geolocation and mobility patterns, enables advertisers to deliver contextually relevant messages with precision and measurable impact. This partnership reflects our commitment to making quality DOOH inventory globally accessible through programmatic technology," said Gavin Wilson, global chief commercial officer at VIOOH.

The ICO market is experiencing a surge in activity, particularly in the UK. This resurgence comes as Web3 projects gain traction and investor interest in crypto grows. Recent trends suggest an increasing focus on ICO compliance, market risks, and new opportunities. These developments may shape the future direction of crypto fundraising.

After years of decline, the ICO market is back in the spotlight, notably in the UK. A renewed interest in Web3 funding has led to a spike in ICO activity. In 2025, investors are showing increased appetite for innovative projects leveraging blockchain technology. This marks a significant shift from the subdued environment of past years.

The momentum is largely driven by projects focusing on decentralized technologies, which promise efficient and transparent investment opportunities. As major tech firms and startups embrace Web3, ICOs are once again becoming a favored method for raising capital.

A relevant discussion on Reuters highlights how these trends are unfolding within the market, suggesting a robust future for this fundraising model.

UK ICO regulations are evolving to address the complexities of the market. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been proactive in refining rules to ensure investor protection and market stability. These regulations aim to mitigate risks while embracing innovation in digital assets.

ICO projects must now adhere to tighter compliance requirements, including thorough financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks. This regulatory framework helps foster trust and transparency, encouraging more investors to participate in the ICO market.

The UK's regulatory stance is crucial as it balances encouraging digital innovation and maintaining stringent oversight. For more details on the regulatory landscape, refer to Yahoo Finance.

Web3 is at the forefront of this ICO revival, with significant funding directed toward decentralized applications. This shift is reshaping how fundraising trends are developing, allowing smaller projects equipped with cutting-edge technology to compete on a global scale.

Current trends indicate that investors are particularly interested in projects that integrate AI, blockchain, and financial technology. This alignment with modern tech trends ensures that the ICO sector remains dynamic and forward-looking.

For stakeholders and market observers, understanding these trends is essential. For instance, a piece on Bloomberg provides insights into how these activities are structured.

As the ICO market continues to gain momentum in the UK, driven by Web3 initiatives and evolving regulations, investors must remain informed. The regulatory environment offers both challenges and opportunities, necessitating a careful approach to compliance and transparency.

The current ICO climate presents diverse opportunities for those willing to engage with new technologies and digital strategies. The focus on regulatory compliance alongside innovative funding strategies marks a promising future for ICOs.

Moving forward, staying abreast of regulatory changes and investment trends will be crucial for success in the dynamic ICO landscape.

The ICO market surge is mainly driven by renewed interest in Web3 projects and increased investor interest in digital assets. This is causing a significant rise in ICO activity, particularly in the UK.

The UK is refining its regulations with a focus on investor protection and market transparency. The FCA enforces measures like financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks to ensure a safe investment environment.

Key trends include a focus on decentralized Web3 technologies that integrate AI and blockchain. These trends are making ICOs a preferred method of funding due to their transparency and innovative potential.

Spot solana SOL$218.22 exchange-traded funds (ETFS) are unlikely to draw major investor inflows even if approved this week, according to a Wednesday report from Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM). 

Solana ETFs could see about $1.5 billion in first-year inflows, roughly one-seventh of ether's ETH$4,309.76, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

But the analysts warned that figure could be lower due to waning on-chain activity, heavy memecoin trading, investor fatigue from multiple launches, and competition from diversified crypto index products such as those tied to the S&P Dow Jones Indices Digital Markets 50. Corporate treasuries could also divert demand away from spot ETFs.

JPMorgan also noted weak demand signals in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) solana futures positioning.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide on roughly sixteen spot crypto ETF applications in October, including solana.

Markets widely expect approval, helped by an existing CME futures contract and the July launch of the first Solana ETF from REX Osprey, the bank said.

JPMorgan noted that expectations are already visible in pricing. The premium to net asset value (NAV) on the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) has collapsed from around 750% last year to near zero, echoing bitcoin BTC$120,468.13 and ether trends ahead of ETF launches.

 Ethereum devs have introduced Kohaku to enhance wallet privacy and security with modular tools, zero-knowledge recovery options and decentralized transaction handling. 

Ethereum developers unveiled Kohaku, a roadmap that aims to improve wallet privacy and security through a modular framework designed for developers and advanced users. 

The project, announced in a Thursday blog post by Ethereum Foundation coordinator Nicolas Consigny, outlines plans to build a set of privacy and security primitives for the Ethereum ecosystem.

At its core, Kohaku aims to create a software development kit (SDK) for building secure wallet functions, and a reference wallet that demonstrates how these tools work in practice. The first version will come as a browser extension based on the Ambire wallet, designed for advanced users who want more control and privacy.

Kohaku is being developed in collaboration with well-known Ethereum ecosystem teams, including Ambire, Railgun, DeFi Wonderland, Helios and Oblivious Labs. The project is open source, and developers are encouraged to contribute through its GitHub repositories.

Kohaku's primary goal is to reduce the reliance of wallets on centralized services that can track transactions. The project will include features like private sending and receiving, hiding IP addresses, separate accounts for each DApp and P2P transaction broadcasting that bypasses normal remote procedure call (RPC) servers. 

It also plans to add social recovery options using tools such as ZK Email or Anon Aadhaar, making it easier to restore access without giving up privacy. ZK Email uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable anonymous verification of emails, while Anon Aadhaar allows users to prove their identity in a privacy-preserving way.

In the long run, the team aims to bring wallet security even closer to the device level, which they refer to as “as close as possible to the silicon.” This means creating a native Ethereum browser where users can safely interact with DApps, IPFS content and decentralized networks without data leaks.

On Wednesday, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new initiative called the Privacy Cluster, bringing together 47 leading researchers, engineers and cryptographers to develop privacy features at the protocol level of the Ethereum network. 

The group will work alongside the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team to introduce tools such as private payments, confidential identity systems, and zero-knowledge infrastructure designed to protect user data directly on Ethereum's layer-1 blockchain.

The Privacy Cluster includes multiple Ethereum Foundation and PSE initiatives, with Kohaku being one. Other notable projects are Private Reads & Writes, Private Proving, Private Identities and more.

BISMARCK — The Bank of North Dakota and its core banking services provider, Fiserv, announced a partnership Wednesday, Oct. 8, to develop the state's own stablecoin, which will be called the Roughrider coin.


According to J.P. Morgan,
    
       "A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is designed to be stable, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. On paper, they aim to offer the benefits of cryptocurrency — high-speed, low-cost and decentralized transactions — with the stability of traditional assets."

ADVERTISEMENT

Fiserv COO Takis Georgakopoulos said stablecoins allow for essentially instantaneous transactions as compared to existing options like wire transfers and ACH transfers.



Wire transfers can typically be accomplished in the same day. ACH transfers can take 1-3 business days to complete. 

Making the announcement during an event held at Bismarck State College, Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the Roughrider coin will be developed in the new financial environment created with the passage of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a framework for payment stablecoins by requiring they be backed with high-quality assets, as opposed to more volatile cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

Initially, Morgan said, the Roughrider coin will be used for things like bank-to-bank movement of money using Fiserv's digital assets platform.

Eventually, he added, the Roughrider coin could be used for other types of transactions, though he did not go into details.

When the Bank of North Dakota takes future steps, Morgan said, it will do so "diligently, thoughtfully, step by step. We've operated that way for 100 years."

Georgakopoulos said that by developing its own stablecoin, North Dakota will have greater say in how it may be used compared to going with an established stablecoin.

"The moment you go with any of the existing coins, you have to live with their rules. You are intermingled with all of their other clients," Georgakopoulos said.

"Banks are different," he added. "You want to be able to set your own rules, and there is a whole host of capabilities you can bring to the table that you wouldn't be able to do if you went with an established provider."

He said one area of flexibility relates to the custody of real assets that are moved to stablecoins and how those deposits might be shared between banks "in ways you guys decide make sense."

State officials said the Roughrider coin will be available to banks and credit unions in North Dakota in 2026.

Following the Roughrider coin announcement, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota, issued a statement applauding the development.

“As the only state-owned bank in the country, BND has charted its own path numerous times over the last 106 years to benefit North Dakota residents. This is the next chapter in its financial innovation story," the statement said.

"The Roughrider coin is a cutting-edge approach to improving efficiency and quality control in the banking sector, a direct benefit for our residents,” the statement said.

The Industrial Commission consists of North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Attorney General Drew Wrigley and  Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring.

In announcing the new coin, officials stressed that in addition to requiring that stablecoins be backed with high-quality assets, the GENIUS Act also requires things like mandated disclosures and audits, ensured reserve transparency and rules for permitted users.

XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) are sitting on their final technical supports, with traders warning that one decisive move lower could trigger a cascade of liquidations across the altcoin market.

SOL Technical Analysis (Source: TradingView)

Solana trades around $222, struggling to hold its rising trendline support near $219 after a sharp rejection from $225. 

The level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $222 and short-term EMAs, forming a key support zone.

Broader structure on the 4-hour chart forms a large symmetrical triangle. 

A breakdown below $219 could open a move toward $214 (0.382 retracement) and $205, with further downside risk to $190.

On the upside, bulls need a close above $229 to retest $240, where the 0.786 Fibonacci level meets the triangle's upper boundary. 

A breakout above $240 would shift the technical narrative toward $253 and signal renewed strength.

Marcantonio of GalaxyHQ compared Solana to a "digital Panama Canal," predicting it could dominate tokenized securities trading by 2030.

While the broader outlook remains positive, the near-term setup leaves no room for error.

XRP Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

XRP trades near $2.81, testing its ascending trendline support that has held since mid-July. 

The level aligns with the 50-day EMA at $2.85, creating the final technical layer before a potential breakdown.

A move below $2.80 would invalidate the higher-low structure and expose $2.70 and $2.64 (200-day EMA) as next support zones. 

Deeper loss of momentum could send XRP toward $1.89, which served as the base for its summer rally.

For bulls, recovery depends on reclaiming $2.92 and then $3.10, where descending trendline resistance caps upside attempts. 

Only a daily close above that level would restore short-term bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward $3.50.

Supports like $219 on Solana and $2.80 on XRP are not just chart levels — they are the fault lines of altcoin leverage.

Billions in open interest sit tethered to these ranges, meaning a single breach could unleash cascading liquidations across exchanges.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)  is battling resistance near $4,500 and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is trying to regain $122,000, creating a backdrop where majors may dictate whether altcoin floors survive.

The convergence of major-cap stability and fragile altcoin supports makes this inflection point unusually decisive for market structure.

Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot, marking a significant step in the country's digital finance efforts. This move comes amid growing interest in cryptocurrencies across Sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, Kenya is about to pass a crucial bill that will regulate the crypto industry. Both developments represent important milestones in the region's evolving digital economy, reflecting a broader trend of embracing blockchain technology.

Uganda has introduced a CBDC pilot as part of a broader plan to digitize its financial infrastructure. The digital Ugandan shilling, backed by the country's treasury bonds, is deployed on a permissioned blockchain.

This effort aims to boost economic transparency and financial inclusion. The CBDC is available for use via smartphones, which could potentially increase access to financial services in remote areas.

The pilot complies with both local and international standards, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. GSN, a blockchain financial infrastructure company, partnered with Uganda's Diacente Group to tokenize $5.5 billion in real-world assets. This initiative is focused on various sectors such as agro-processing, mining, and renewable energy.

In neighboring Kenya, the virtual asset service providers (VASP) bill has passed its final parliamentary reading and is awaiting President William Ruto's signature to become law. The bill seeks to create a regulated framework for crypto exchanges, brokers, and wallet operators. The law also includes consumer protection measures and establishes the Central Bank of Kenya as the overseeing authority for payment and custody functions.

The proposed legislation is in line with global standards, including KYC and AML measures. It also includes provisions to prevent deceptive advertising practices and enforce penalties for non-compliance. Once signed into law, this bill will set a clear regulatory path for Kenya's growing crypto industry.

Both Uganda and Kenya are part of the rapidly expanding crypto ecosystem in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to blockchain data platform Chainalysis, the region saw a surge of $205 billion in on-chain value between July 2024 and June 2025. Countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana are also leading the charge in crypto adoption, with Uganda ranking seventh in the region for total transaction volume.

As blockchain technology and digital currencies gain traction, many African nations are exploring the potential of CBDCs. While Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC in 2021, other countries such as Ghana and South Africa have also conducted CBDC trials. In contrast, Kenya and Rwanda are still in the research phase but are expected to launch in the coming years.

The initiatives in Uganda and Kenya underscore a wider shift toward digital finance across Africa. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into the financial system, countries are positioning themselves to attract new investment and stimulate economic growth. Tokenization of assets, along with CBDCs, can enhance transparency and help industries access new funding opportunities.

With a growing user base in the crypto space, Africa's digital asset market is expected to reach significant heights. Statista estimates that over 75 million users in Africa will be engaged in crypto by 2026, with a revenue of $5.1 billion expected. This growth could further reinforce the region's position as a key player in the global blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.

Americans in 2024 lost nearly $250 million to scams that used Bitcoin ATMs

In June 2024, when Fran Bates entered a Fort Worth-area gas station, she thought the voice on the other end of the phone was from her bank, and she thought a machine where she was in the process of feeding more than $23,000 would keep her money safe. 

Neither was true. 

The voice belonged to a scammer, and experts believe the call was likely made from overseas. The machine was a bitcoin ATM kiosk -- one of more than 45,000 across the country. And on that summer day in Texas, the 85-year-old Bates became one of the tens of thousands of Americans who fall victim each year to scams perpetrated using bitcoin ATMs. 

"It's a horrible, horrible experience," Bates recalled in a recent interview with ABC News' Jay O'Brien. 

The scammer convinced Bates that she was in danger of losing her savings, she recalled, and over the course of two days encouraged her to withdraw more than $40,000 in cash and deposit it into a special machine, where she was told it would be safe. 

The scammer even ordered her a car that delivered her to an area gas station, she told ABC News, where she began feeding $100 bills into the cash kiosk -- his voice instructing her every step of the way. 

"That seems so hard to believe," O'Brien told Bates about the scam. 

"I know," Bates replied. "And you think if you had to listen to it, you would wonder, 'What's going on with that woman? Doesn't she realize what they're doing to her?' No, you don't."

"But they've got you," O'Brien said. 

"Oh, they have you right where they want you," Bates said.

The FBI says scams perpetrated using bitcoin ATMs cost Americans nearly $250 million in 2024, more than double the sum from the previous year. And AARP is warning its 38 million members that bitcoin ATMs are increasingly scammers' preferred means to dupe Americans. 

Bitcoin ATMs allow users to insert cash and send it to a digital wallet anywhere in the world. It takes only a few minutes, and once the transaction is executed, experts say, the money can be nearly impossible to recover -- making it an attractive method for prospective fraudsters. 

"Have you seen an increase in how popular using crypto -- and using these ATMs specifically -- has become for a scam like this?" O'Brien asked Amy Nofziger, AARP's director of fraud victim support. 

"Yes, requesting crypto is now the No. 1 preferred method of criminals," Nofziger replied. "It is a huge problem." 

Authorities have taken notice. Last month, the Washington, D.C., attorney general's office sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest bitcoin ATM machine purveyors in the country, accusing it of "pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed fees on the backs of scam victims." 

The lawsuit claims 93% of the transactions on Athena's devices in the District "are the product of outright fraud," and that "the median age of victims was 71 years." 

Athena forcefully denied those allegations in a statement to ABC News, asserting in part that it maintains "strong safeguards against fraud including transparent instructions, prominent warnings and consumer education." 

"Just as a bank isn't held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users' decisions," the statement said. 

AARP has advocated for more stringent regulations to protect Americans from scams on bitcoin ATMs, like capping the amount of money a user can deposit in one day. At least 17 states have passed legislation in recent years regulating the machines, and some municipalities have moved to ban them outright. 

But critics say some bitcoin ATM firms have been reluctant to embrace regulation, as it could conceivably hurt their bottom line. Some companies that operate the machines charge transaction fees that exceed 20%. 

"Do you think these companies know that, in large part, their ATMs are being used for scams?" O'Brien asked Adam Zarazinski, the CEO of Inca Digital, a cryptocurrency forensics firm. 

"They either know or they're turning a blind eye to it, yes," Zarazinski opined. 

Brenna Bird, the attorney general in Iowa, filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year against two major players in the space, Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip, which she accused of being "a silent partner to many scammers' preying on Iowans, taking a cut of each scam with its excessive and deceptive [bitcoin ATM] fees." 

Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip have both denied those claims in court and in statements to ABC News. 

Bitcoin Depot told ABC News that the "vast majority" of their transactions are "legitimate," that they "are one of a few operators in the bitcoin ATM space to proactively require an ID for even the smallest transactions," and that "customers receive up to four scam warnings before completing a purchase." 

A spokesperson for CoinFlip told ABC News that the company "never wants to profit when honest people are duped by bad actors, which is why we refund transaction fees to victims in instances of fraud." 

"We hold ourselves to the highest standards of consumer protection, compliance, and transparency," the statement said. 

While most victims never manage to recoup their money, Fran Bates' story has a rare happy ending.

She owes it to Myndi Jordan, another customer at the gas station, who noticed Bates hunched over the bitcoin ATM machine, shoving thousands of dollars into it -- and called the police. 

Jordan, who had herself been the victim of identity fraud, said she immediately recognized it as a scam. 

The two women sat down with O'Brien for a joint interview earlier this month, reuniting for the first time since that day in June 2024.

"I hate when somebody tries to take advantage of somebody that's not able to protect themselves, or defend themselves," Jordan told O'Brien. "And I feel like they were taking advantage of you. And I was like, 'No, we're not doing this today.'" 

Bates calls Jordan her "guardian angel." 

As Bates continued to pour bills into the ATM, Lieutenant James Stewart of the White Settlement Police Department arrived on the scene. He grabbed Bates' cellphone and confronted the man on the phone as the scammer implored Bates to execute the payment. She was just one click from losing it all.

"Ma'am, just you click on 'I'm done,'" the scammer is heard saying on police bodycam footage. 

"No, don't click 'I'm done,'" Stewart told Bates on the bodycam recording. "Do not click anything." 

Bates backed away from the machine -- and the transaction was never executed.

Days later, after contacting the machine vendor, Stewart personally delivered a cashier's check to Bates in the amount of what she entered into the machine. He even escorted her to the bank to deposit it back into her account.

Bates, in her interview with ABC News, called Stewart her "knight in shining armor." 

"It felt amazing, being able to see it to the end and see the happy ending," Stewart told ABC News.

"She gives amazing hugs," Stewart said of Bates. "You know, that was the best part of it, I think."

The East African country of Uganda has launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot backed by treasury bonds. At the same time, its neighbor, Kenya, is on the verge of signing its first cryptocurrency regulation bill into law, pending presidential approval.

The Bank of Uganda's CBDC, a digitized version of the Ugandan shilling on a permissioned blockchain, has been implemented by a partnership between blockchain infrastructure company Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Ugandan developer Diacente Group. It forms part of a $5.5 billion national tokenization initiative announced on Wednesday.

Under the pilot program, GSN and Diacente will tokenize real-world assets, including treasury bonds, agricultural investments, and renewable energy projects, to modernize Uganda's financial system and attract international investment. According to GSN, funding will come from tokenized loans and investors across Korea and the Middle East.

More than 80% of Uganda's workforce operates in the informal economy, where access to formal banking is limited. The new CBDC system seeks to change that by enabling low-cost, mobile-based transactions via smartphones and USSD codes for over 40 million Ugandans.

GSN representatives said the platform uses full Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols in tandem with both local and international standards.

“We are building infrastructure that goes beyond theory—a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility. This is how we close the gap between digital finance and real-world impact,” remarked Ryan Kirkley, co-founder and CEO of GSN.

The pilot will begin in the Karamoja Green Industrial and Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), a government-supported development centre within Uganda's Vision 2040 plan. The country's government is seeking to industrialize and expand the economy to $500 billion through regional trading.

Uganda's pilot follows similar efforts by Nigeria, which became the first country on the continent to launch a CBDC in 2021 with its eNaira, while Ghana and South Africa have both conducted pilot programs. Egypt plans to roll out a national digital currency by 2030, and Rwanda and Kenya remain in the research phase.

Kirkley asserted that Uganda's CBDC deliberately avoids the pitfalls faced by Nigeria's eNaira, which he said struggled with low user adoption. 

“Previous systems failed because they were not linked to real use. We are starting with industries, with jobs and production, so people have a reason to use it,” the GSN CEO surmised.

The Ugandan government hopes the pilot will lay the groundwork for full-scale tokenization in several economic activities, including agriculture, mining, renewable energy, and global trade.

Crossing the border from Uganda, Kenya is on the brink of passing its first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. On Tuesday, the 2024-tabled Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, 2025, cleared its third reading in Parliament, sending it to President William Ruto for assent.

Kenyan Members of Parliament reached a consensus to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets under the joint oversight of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). It also grants the Treasury Cabinet Secretary powers to issue detailed rules on stablecoins, tokenization, capital adequacy, and anti-money laundering (AML) standards.

If signed into law, the framework will create clear licensing and solvency requirements for both domestic and foreign digital asset operators. Companies expected to be part of the approval list include Luno, Busha, KotaniPay, Fonbnk, Swypt, and Binance. President Ruto is expected to receive the final bill within weeks.

Chebet Kipingor, the country lead for crypto platform Busha Kenya, said the legislation is a turning point for the country's crypto market confidence.

The bill's approval would make Kenya one of the few African nations with formal legal recognition of digital assets and service providers. Sub-Saharan Africa, which includes Uganda and Kenya, is the world's third-fastest growing region for crypto adoption, according to a September report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation announced the formation of the Privacy Cluster, a team of 47 researchers, engineers, and cryptographers coordinated by Blockscout and xDai founder Igor Barinov.

In a Wednesday blog post, the foundation said that it is collaborating with the broader community — complementing existing privacy projects — to establish privacy as a “first-class property” of Ethereum.

As such, the foundation has released a roadmap outlining current progress towards building comprehensive end-to-end privacy into the world's second-largest blockchain. 

“Ethereum was created to be the foundation of digital trust, one that is worthy of civilizational scale. For that trust to remain credible, privacy must be part of its core,” the foundation said in the blog post.

The development also marks an escalation of the foundation's ongoing efforts to protect users from surveillance, data leaks, and metadata exposure in an era when blockchain transactions are increasingly under scrutiny. The Privacy Cluster is expected to address such leaks, targeting Layer 1 improvements like confidential transfers and protections against RPC node metadata leaks.

The Cluster will expand on the Foundation's Privacy & Scaling Explorations team, which has been working on privacy research and development since 2018.

It will allocate resources toward privacy-preserving research and tooling, spanning cryptography (including zero-knowledge proofs), protocol improvements for transaction confidentiality, and applications such as private payments, identities and wallets.

Two major crypto ETF issuers are joining the rush to bring crypto asset staking to the U.S.

Bitwise and 21Shares each unveiled updates to their crypto funds on Tuesday, cutting fees and adding staking features for investors, just days after Grayscale became the first to introduce staking in its U.S. Ethereum ETFs.

Bitwise's latest filing formally renames its product to the aptly titled “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while adding language that allows it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.”

It also introduces a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets.

At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETF filings, which typically range between 0.21% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among approved crypto products.

21Shares, meanwhile, announced enhancements to its 21Shares Ethereum ETF (TETH), adding staking and waiving its 0.21% sponsor fee for 12 months starting October 9.

The move is being touted as a “natural evolution of Ethereum investment products in the U.S. market,” Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, said in a statement.

By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains.

Institutional investors “will likely be more interested in how much of the staking yield will be passed to them,” Maksim Balashevich, founder and CEO of crypto analytics firm Santiment, told Decrypt.

In conversation, when it was noted that some investors hold overlapping positions in digital asset treasuries tied to Solana and Ethereum, Balashevich suggested those holders may view staking ETFs as a simpler way to consolidate yield and manage exposure.“

"Yield is what is different,” in this case, he said. “The battle will likely be on this field.”

Commenting on Bitwise, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X that the firm is “not playing around,” adding that low fees have a “near perfect record of attracting investors,” and is a “good sign for inflow potential.”

Balchunas did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions on whether this could ostensibly mark a race to the bottom similar to the so-called “fee war” that broke out ahead of the SEC's approval of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in January last year.

Bitwise declined Decrypt's request for comment. Decrypt has reached out to 21Shares.

BUCKS CO., Pa. (WPVI) -- Crypto scammers are increasingly using what are called Bitcoin ATMS to carry out their cons.

Bitcoin ATMs don't operate like a traditional ATM. Instead of withdrawing money, you use the machine to insert cash to buy Bitcoin.

The transaction is then sent to a crypto wallet, which is a place where someone can manage, trade, swap or use cryptocurrencies.

What makes the ATMs appealing to criminals is that the transactions are usually untraceable.

Crystal Reale of Bucks County said she was lured to a Bitcoin ATM scam.   It happened this past July when she received a call from a man who identified himself as a Bucks County officer.

"Telling me that I had warrants out for my arrest," Reale said.   "I'm immediately freaking out, and I'm like, 'What do you mean?'"

Reale said she was told it was for missing jury duty.

"And I just was summoned for jury duty back in June and I was released from it," she added.

The call caused confusion and panic, and she closely listened to what she was told to do.

The con artist told her it could get worked out, but she needed to pay a bond, or she'd be going to jail in 72 hours.

"Which was like $5,000. I'm just like, 'What am I going to do?'" she said.

She said the officer instructed her to go to the Bucks County Courthouse.

But first, she said she was told to head to the Sunoco down the road to pay the warrant.   The money would need to be deposited into a Bitcoin ATM.

"He's like, 'I'm going to send you documents to state that this is for real. I'm going to send you a QR code for you to scan on this machine,'" she said

That QR code ended up being the gateway to the criminal's crypto wallet.   She said scams like buying large amounts of gift cards and even wiring money were on her radar.

But she had never heard of a Bitcoin ATM, so she scanned and deposited $5,000 in cash.

"There was no evidence that I had just put this $5,000 in this machine," she said.

The officer then told her that the warrant wasn't settled, and she would need to deposit $2,000 more, which she did.

After the transaction went through, her phone went dead and that is when she knew she had been scammed.

"I'm just crying. I started bawling," she said.

Reale, a single mother, said the money was cash she had been saving over the course of a few years to take her two kids on a cruise.

"Vacation is not gonna be for a long time now," she said.

Director of Fraud for the American Association of Retired Persons or AARP, Amy Nofziger, say Bitcoin ATM scams are a growing threat, especially among the elderly.

"It is a huge problem," said Nfziger.  "We believe these machines need regulations and strong consumer protections to protect victims of fraud."

Nfziger said there are an estimated 45,000 of the crypto ATMS located in grocery stores, gas stations and corner stores across the country.   And more pop up every day.

"These ATMS overwhelmingly serve criminals and scammers," said Adam Zarazinski.

Zarazinski is CEO of Inca Digital, which does risk-focused intelligence for crypto and banking.

"These are transnational criminal groups," he said.  "These are not one-off guys in grandma's basement, you know, randomly calling old people. These are compounds typically."

Reale says she reported her crime to police and the Internet Crime Complaint Center or IC3.

It's unclear if any investigation is underway in her case, but these scams are simply too prevalent for authorities to keep up.

"I'm so mad at myself for letting them get to me," said Reale.

Experts told the Investigative Unit if you're found in a similar predicament, breathe, slow down, and think about what's going on.

They also said the bottom line is no legitimate organization will ask you to deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM.

RFK, Jr., Says Tylenol Use for Circumcision Causes Autism. Here's Why That Claim Is Flawed

Studies suggesting circumcision rates are linked with autism are “riddled with flaws”

Today, in a cabinet meeting, U.S. secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., claimed that there is a link between autism and circumcision. “There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It's highly likely because they are given Tylenol,” he stated, without citing the studies.

Kennedy was probably referring to a 2013 study of eight countries and a 2015 study from Denmark, both of which claimed to show a link between circumcision and autism rates. Helen Tager-Flusberg, an autism researcher and a professor emerita at Boston University, calls the methods used in those studies “appalling.” Tager-Flusberg leads the Coalition of Autism Scientists, a group that advocates for high-quality autism research.

Neither study shows a causal link between circumcision—or the pain relief medications that are often prescribed along with the procedure—and higher rates of autism. In the decade-plus since each was published, autism researchers have heavily criticized these studies. And after reviewing both studies, scientists last year found no evidence supporting the claim that circumcision leads to autism or any other adverse psychological effects.

There is also very little evidence that giving acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) to babies or children increases their risk of being diagnosed with autism. There is also very little evidence, as the secretary of health and human services recently suggested, that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy increases a baby's risk of developing autism.

For the 2013 study, researchers compared rates of circumcision in eight countries, including the U.S., with rates of autism. They found that countries with higher rates of autism tended to have higher rates of circumcision. “They are looking at an association involving a sample size of eight countries,” an extremely small number for establishing such a link, “and they don't take into consideration any other factors about those countries,” Tager-Flusberg says. Factors such as the average age of becoming parents in each country, as well as genetics are known to affect autism rates. Awareness of autism and diagnostic practices also vary between countries. All of these factors could explain the correlation, but they weren't controlled for in the analysis. “I'm ashamed that there are colleagues in my field who would actually go out and conduct a study that is so flimsy and that it was actually published,” Tager-Flusberg says.

Experts say that circumcision rates are not a reliable stand-in for acetaminophen use in babies anyway. The researchers of the 2013 study explained they chose to look at circumcision because acetaminophen is often prescribed following the procedure. The medication is commonly taken for numerous childhood ailments, and it may not always be prescribed for circumcision. This means that relying on circumcision to estimate acetaminophen use in newborns is flawed, Tager-Flusberg says.

Scientists who conducted the 2015 study examined rates of autism among 3,347 predominantly Jewish and Muslim boys who were ritually circumcised in the hospital or in doctor's clinics. That study showed a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with autism among that group than among those who hadn't been circumcised. “That study is riddled with flaws, which others have written about,” said psychologist David S. Mandell in a statement sent to Scientific American on behalf of the Coalition of Autism Scientists. It had a small sample size, limiting the power of its conclusions, and did not account for many Muslim circumcisions that are not done by doctors, which likely skewed the results. The association between circumcision and autism was only significant for those aged 0 to 4 years old, not those aged 5 to 9 years old, which suggests there may be an alternative explanation for the results.

These kinds of observational studies are inherently limited—even if they show a link between two variables, they cannot explain what causes it. Relying on weak evidence like this to make claims about the causes of autism is “terribly alarming,” Tager-Flusberg continues, and is ultimately confusing and distressing to families.

These five profiles—including general poor sleep, interrupted sleep, and sleep assisted with medical aids—strengthen the physical and mental connections between our waking and sleeping hours.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Although sleep is a universal trait among every living species, scientists have only begun to understand the immense intricacies of our brain's nighttime reset. While more sleep has always been associated with healthier outcomes, it wasn't until the 1950s—with the arrival of electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and the discovery of the rapid eye movement (REM) cycle—that sleep experts began to connect the dots between human physiological/mental health and sleep. 

Now, a new study led by a team of Canadian scientists has taken this correlation one step further by identifying what they call five “biopsychosocial profiles” of sleep, which connect characteristics of certain types of sleep with individual health and cognition. The results of the study were published in the journal PLOS Biology. 

“Our study showed that different aspects of sleep are related, but can also be separable domains with specific connections to biopsychosocial factors (lifestyle, mental and physical health and cognitive performances),” Aurore Perrault, a co-lead author of the study from Concordia University, said in a press statement. “This highlights the importance of considering the full picture of an individual's sleep to help clinicians make more accurate assessments and guide treatment.”

To develop these five distinct profiles, Perrault—along with her fellow co-author Valeria Kebets from McGill University—relied on a treasure trove of data from the Human Connectome Project, which is an NIH-funded project to map macroscale connections across the human brain. Luckily, this included detailed data on hundreds of participants, at least 770 of which were used in this study, thanks to detailed notes of their sleep characteristics and brain imaging data. 

The scientists performed an analysis that discovered five general sleep profiles among the project's participants. The first profile discerns generally poor sleep, which in turn produced increased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. New Scientist reports that this group also showed signs of decreased connectivity in brain areas associated with self-reflection, meaning participants ruminated on their inner thoughts and feelings instead of taking in the external world. 

The second profile similarly showed signs of worse mental health, but none of the reported characteristics of bad sleep—this was known as “sleep resilience.” The remaining three groups focused on participants that used sleep aids, didn't achieve the minimum recommended seven hours of sleep per night, or woke up several times during the night, respectively. 

“The dominance of mental health markers in most of the profiles is not surprising as sleep is one of the five key domains of human functioning likely to affect mental health,” Kebets said in a press statement.

The authors hope this study will empower clinicians to use these profiles as a means to target treatment that's unique to each individual. By understanding how certain sleep characteristics impact other factors (such as mental health or social behavior), doctors can analyze symptoms to identify the sleep problems at the root of the issue. 

No two people are 100 percent the same, and now, science is showing us that this age-old maxim applies to our sleep as well.

Of the 202 Nobel laureates who have been awarded prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows').

Among the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.

Immigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That's because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that's the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”

The new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain'. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. Meanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.

Among those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.

Of the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds'). “What we have in the US is unique. It's a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.

But, the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of depature'), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.

Among the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ'). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.

The future of immigration's interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.

Already, international researchers are making moves to leave the United States, with other nations ready to woo them. France, South Korea and Canada have set up programmes to attract US researchers with awards and scholarships, for example. The European Research Council, which funds research in the European Union, is offering as much as €2 million ($2.3 million) to scientists who move their laboratories to the EU, with the goal of helping those moving from the United States.

The record-breaking mission offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the geology of our planet's largest layer.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. Separating the planet's rocky crust and the molten outer core, the mantle makes up 70 percent of the Earth's mass and 84 percent of its volume. But despite its outsized influence on the planet's geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer. 

And that's understandable, especially when you consider that the crust is roughly 9 to 12 miles thick on average. Luckily, that average contains outliers—areas of the world where the crust is actually incredibly thin and faulting exposes the mantle through cracks. One such area is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically near an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif.  

On the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock's structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance. 

It was here, 800 meters south of this field, in May 2023 that members of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)—aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot-long research vessel rented by the U.S. National Science Foundation—extracted a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, which are the primary rocks that make up the Earth's upper mantle. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Although this makes this particular drill core the deepest sample of the mantle yet, going that deep into the rock wasn't the goal of this record-breaking expedition. 

“We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. He said that the drilling was so easy that they progressed three times faster than usual. The team eventually drilled a staggering 1,268 meters, and only stopped due to the mission's limited operations window. 

Andrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core's composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. It also contained rocks known as gabbros, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition. 

While this core represents an incredibly opportunity to learn more about the Earth's mantle, as well as give an in-depth look at the geologic substrate upon which the Lost City rests, the mission didn't quite complete the “grand challenge” of crossing the Mohorovičić discontinuity. Otherwise known as the Moho, the Mohorovičić discontinuity is recognized as the true boundary between the crust and pristine mantle. 

Future missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won't include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024. Just as scientists are finally knocking on the door to the Earth's most ubiquitous geologic layer, the future of these kinds of drilling missions is now uncertain.

Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have uncovered a new way that brown fat, a type of fat that burns energy, can boost the body's metabolism. This process allows cells to consume more fuel and generate heat, improving overall metabolic health. Conducted in mice, the research points to new possibilities for using brown fat to address metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity.

The findings were published Sept. 17 in Nature.

Brown fat is unique because it turns energy (calories) from food into heat. Unlike white fat, which stores energy, or muscle, which uses it immediately, brown fat helps keep the body warm in cold environments. Exposure to cold can increase the amount of brown fat, and scientists have long suggested that activating it could support weight loss by increasing calorie burning.

"The pathway we've identified could provide opportunities to target the energy expenditure side of the weight loss equation, potentially making it easier for the body to burn more energy by helping brown fat produce more heat," said senior author Irfan Lodhi, PhD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research at WashU Medicine. "Boosting this kind of metabolic process could support weight loss or weight control in a way that is perhaps easier to maintain over time than traditional dieting and exercise. It's a process that basically wastes energy -- increasing resting energy expenditure -- but that's a good thing if you're trying to lose weight."

A back-up heater in brown fat

Until now, scientists understood brown fat's heat production mainly through mitochondria, the energy centers of cells. Mitochondria in brown fat can shift from making fuel to generating heat through a molecule called uncoupling protein 1. However, studies have shown that mice lacking this protein can still burn energy and produce heat, suggesting another system at work.The new research identifies peroxisomes, small structures within cells that process fats, as an alternative heat source in brown fat. When exposed to cold, these peroxisomes multiply. This effect was even stronger in mice whose mitochondria lacked uncoupling protein 1, suggesting that peroxisomes can step in when mitochondria lose their ability to produce heat.Lodhi and his team discovered that peroxisomes burn fuel and release heat through a process involving a protein called acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Mice that lacked ACOX2 in their brown fat were less able to tolerate cold, showed lower body temperatures after exposure to cold, and had poorer insulin sensitivity. When fed high-fat diets, they also gained more weight than typical mice.

In contrast, mice genetically engineered to make unusually high amounts of ACOX2 in brown fat showed increased heat production, better cold tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and weight control when fed the same high-fat diet.

Using a fluorescent heat sensor they developed, the researchers found that when ACOX2 metabolized certain fatty acids, brown fat cells got hotter. They also used an infrared thermal imaging camera to show that mice lacking ACOX2 produced less heat in their brown fat.

While human bodies can manufacture these fatty acids, the molecules also are found in dairy products and human breast milk and are made by certain gut microbes. Lodhi said this raises the possibility that a dietary intervention based on these fatty acids -- such as a food, probiotic or "nutraceutical" intervention -- could boost this heat-production pathway and the beneficial effects it appears to have. He and his colleagues also are investigating possible drug compounds that could activate ACOX2 directly.

"While our studies are in mice, there is evidence to suggest this pathway is relevant in people," Lodhi said. "Prior studies have found that individuals with higher levels of these fatty acids tend to have lower body mass indices. But since correlation is not causation, our long-term goal is to test whether dietary or other therapeutic interventions that increase levels of these fatty acids or that increase activity of ACOX2 could be helpful in dialing up this heat production pathway in peroxisomes and helping people lose weight and improve their metabolic health."

This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01DK133344, R01DK115867, R01DK132239, GM103422, T32DK007120, S10 OD032315, DK020579 and DK056341; and by the FP7 funded European Infrafrontier-I3 project.

Lodhi and Liu are named on a provisional patent application filed by Washington University related to targeting ACOX2 activation as a treatment for obesity and related metabolic diseases.

A new study published in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry by Oxford University Press reports that many tree swallow populations across the United States are living in areas with high levels of exposure to “forever” chemicals. Surprisingly, the researchers found that this exposure did not appear to harm the birds' reproductive health.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as “forever chemicals,” are synthetic materials that have become a global environmental concern. These compounds enter ecosystems through industrial discharges, firefighting training sites, and wastewater treatment facilities. Such facilities can release residues from everyday consumer products that use these chemicals, including nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, and water-repellent coatings.

Because of their strong chemical bonds, these substances do not easily degrade in the environment. They have been detected in soil, water, plants, animals, and even humans on every continent. Although previous studies have linked forever chemicals to serious human health issues, such as certain cancers and reproductive disorders, their broader ecological impacts remain uncertain. Most existing research comes from laboratory experiments on captive animals, while much less is known about how wild species are affected. Field studies that could answer these questions are uncommon because they require extensive time and funding.

In this investigation, scientists measured concentrations of these chemicals in the tissues and diet of tree swallows, a migratory bird found throughout North America. They also examined whether exposure influenced breeding success.

The research included fieldwork at multiple military installations and other locations with differing contamination histories. Sampling sites included Willow Grove, Pennsylvania; Lakehurst, New Jersey; Camp Springs, Maryland; Chesapeake Beach, Maryland; Laurel, Maryland; Ashumet Pond, Massachusetts; Lake Elmo, Minnesota; Grey Cloud Island, Minnesota; Gibson City, Illinois; and Scanlon, Minnesota.

The researchers found much higher concentrations of forever chemicals at sites treated with firefighting foams, as well as those closer to urban areas. Researchers noted the high concentration of forever chemical perfluorohexane sulfonate at a site whose sources include residual from the manufacturing plant near Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and associated waste disposal sites, but also from other numerous other household and industrial sources originating in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area.

The investigators found that despite differences in exposure levels to these chemicals, there was no statistically significant association between chemical exposure and reproductive outcomes such as whether birds hatched or grew to the point where they could take flight. The health of the bird chicks appeared unaffected by levels of chemical exposure.

Hailstorm formation has remained a mystery, until now.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Every year, hailstorms cause billions in damage to homes, businesses, and crops, yet how these ice balls of destruction form in the upper troposphere has remained somewhat of a mystery. The predominant theory was that hailstones went through a recycling motion, which explained why they often contained varying layers of a clear and opaque ice. 

Now, research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that this recycling motion is only a small part of the story. In the study, Peking University's Qinghong Zhang, lead author of the study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used stable isotope analysis to effectively recreate the “history” of 27 hailstone specimens produced by nine separate storms in China by analyzing the ‘fingerprints' left in each stone by unique layers of the atmosphere. 

Using this precise method, Zhang and her colleagues could pinpoint at what level in the atmosphere certain layers of the hailstones formed, creating a vertical map of the ice chunk's journey toward the earth.

“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Zhang said in a press statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.”

Of the 27 hailstones studied, only one of them displayed tell-tale signs of the hypothesized recycling method, in which hail travels up and down within a storm cloud. Some 10 stones showed that they formed while steadily descending toward the atmosphere, and another 13 displayed evidence of only one single upward push. Surprisingly, three even showed signs of nearly horizontal movement.

According to the researchers, hail typically forms in a temperature “sweet spot” of between roughly -30 and -10 degrees Celsius. However, Zhang's data showed that embryos of hailstones can actually form outside that gradient, between about -33.4 and -8.7 degrees Celsius. Although this largely refutes the previous theory behind hailstone formation, larger hailstones do require extended time (at least one upward growth) in this zone for supercooled water to form more layers. This explains why stronger storms—with more powerful updrafts—often produce larger hailstones. 

Zhang hopes that understanding the inner workings of hailstorm formation will help improve weather forecasting and our ability to estimate the potential dangers of a passing hailstorm (this research is in collaboration with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research). However, improving forecasting capabilities in the U.S. may prove difficult under the Trump Administration, as it steadily levies cuts on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the National Weather Service. Meteorologists at NWS have already reported degraded forecasting services due to curtailed weather balloon launches used to help gather data for accurate storm prediction. 

Although unlocking the secret of hailstone formation could help protect people in the path of dangerous storms, it helps to be able to identify that a storm is coming in the first place.

Behavioural addictions, characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding activities despite adverse consequences in the long term, are more heterogeneous and less well-understood than substance addictions, and there is a relative lack of translational research. This study investigates “excessive toy motivation” in domestic dogs as a potential parallel to behavioural addictions in humans. Employing a combination of a behavioural test and an owner questionnaire, we examined whether a subset of highly play-motived dogs meet key behavioural addiction criteria, including craving, salience, lack of self-control, and mood modification. Data from 105 highly play-motivated dogs revealed that 33 subjects exhibited behaviours consistent with addictive-like tendencies, including an excessive fixation on toys, reduced responsiveness to alternative stimuli, and persistent efforts to access toys. Owner-reported behaviours not only corroborated these findings but also demonstrated significant associations with behavioural test scores. Our results highlight parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and human behavioural addictions, with dogs as the only non-human species so far that appears to develop addictive-like behaviours spontaneously without artificial induction. This exploratory study provides foundational insights and proposes future research directions that have the potential to significantly deepen our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying behavioural addictions across species.

What is play? Why do many large-brained mammals engage in play throughout their lives? And what makes playing potentially addictive? Despite numerous publications on play and its possible functions, play has remained somewhat of a mystery1, being associated with no immediate adaptive function, although it has been suggested to allow animals to practice species-typical behaviours such as hunting, mating, or fighting with a competitor in a non-serious context1. Notwithstanding, play behaviour is ubiquitous among (at least young) mammals and some birds2,3, and in large-brained species in particular – from humans to dogs – it persists throughout life4,5. Still, no unified definition of play exists to date6, although there is some agreement that, at a proximate level, play makes us feel good7. Even in non-human animals, observers will often agree that playful activities look like fun7, with neurotransmitter systems mediating the rewarding aspects of play (opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine)8,9 appearing to be highly conserved across mammalian taxa10.

Bateson (2014) proposed a set of characteristics that are generally accepted to define play: it is spontaneous, intrinsically rewarding and “fun”; it is separate from serious consequences; it often involves novel or exaggerated actions and role reversal; it is repetitive, but distinct from stereotypies; and it usually occurs only in healthy, stress-free animals, making it a marker of well-being7. However, regarding the latter point, it has been highlighted that play can also represent an attempt to cope with suboptimal conditions (e.g. in nonhuman animals, play may occur as displacement behaviour in stressful situations5 or may serve to reduce social tensions)11. Also, in humans, playing computer games or gambling represents a way of coping with stress. Moreover, in some instances, what started as a fun activity can become compulsive and develop into a behavioural addiction12,13,14.

A behavioural addiction can be defined as “repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person (at least in the short-term), despite longer-term harm to the individual or others” (ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision))15. Unlike in compulsive disorders, where performance of the compulsive behaviour primarily serves to provide some relief from a negative affective state, i.e. via negative reinforcement, addictive behaviours originate because their performance generates positive affect, i.e. via positive reinforcement. However, as the addiction develops, the behaviour becomes compulsive and may even cease to be rewarding (reviewed by Freimuth et al.16. Behavioural addictions share underlying neurobiological processes17 and behavioural symptoms (such as craving, lack of self-control, tolerance, withdrawal and risk of relapse) with substance addictions17,18. Still, they are more heterogeneous and less well-understood19.

While a wide range of behaviours have the potential to become addictive in people (e.g. exercise, sex, shopping, work, etc.)19,20,21,22,23,24,25, to date, only the two disorders related to playing – gambling and internet gaming – are officially recognised as behavioural addictions in the two psychiatric manuals of psychological disorders (DSM-5 and ICD-11). The ICD-1115 included both gambling and internet gaming as behavioural addictions. In the 5th edition of DSM-526, gambling, previously classified as an impulse control disorder, was included under “substance-related and addictive disorders”19,26, while internet gaming was listed separately as “internet gaming disorder”26.

What would make behaviours related to playing so addictive? Play involves neurotransmitter systems (opioids, cannabinoids, and dopamine) that are also engaged in the rewarding aspects of food and drug rewards8,9. Thus, video games can provide players a hedonic experience and a high degree of relaxation27. Pathological gaming is an example of how seemingly normal and enjoyable behaviours can develop to disrupt regular social and environmental functioning28,29,30.

Compared to substance addiction, there are only a few animal models of behavioural addictions. Moreover, these are restricted to controlled laboratory settings, and addictive-like behaviour has to be actively induced31. Rodent models have been used to investigate compulsive eating (e.g. reviewed in31, exercise addiction (wheel running32,33), gambling34, and responses to sexual reward35. Mice selectively bred for excessive wheel-running, sometimes referred to as an addiction-prone phenotype, develop physiological withdrawal symptoms similar to those found in drug addiction after abstinence36. As with excessive exercise in humans, wheel-running in rodents may become disruptive to everyday activities, leading to impaired nest-building and sheltering behaviour37,38. The animals may continue to wheel-run despite disrupted sleep39 or even in the face of injury40, thus fulfilling the behavioural addiction criterion “persistence of the behaviour despite adverse consequences”41. This suggests that behavioural addictions are not unique to the human species.

There is, however, only one species that appears to display addictive-like behaviour spontaneously, without intentional experimental induction: the domestic dog (although inadvertent promotion of addictive-like behaviour by the caretakers cannot be ruled out). A small subset of dogs – colloquially referred to as “ball junkies” – appear to demonstrate an addictive-like desire for object play42.

Like humans, domestic dogs frequently remain playful throughout their lives1, engaging in both social and object-related play, as well as combinations (e.g. tug-of-war9. Solitary object play appears to be related to predatory behaviour9; accordingly the development of social and object play may reflect different selective histories of dog breeds, which were selected for various purposes such as hunting, guarding, herding, and other functions6,7,8.

Toy play is a potent reinforcer, especially in working dog training43,44,45. For instance, detection dogs working in public settings are typically not rewarded with food due to concerns about undesirable food-seeking behaviours in the field. Still, they will work persistently for their toy rewards. It has been argued that artificial selection has exaggerated play behaviour in adult dogs, especially in working breeds or working lines, where high toy motivation is often actively selected as a predictor of performance46. For example, in Labrador retrievers, working lines demonstrate higher playfulness than show lines, indicating a genetic basis for play motivation and potential for artificial selection47.

Playing with toys allows dogs to express instinctive predatory sequences such as chasing, catching, possessing and “dissecting”, considered to be intrinsically rewarding to them based on their species and breed histories48. None of this is pathological, nor is gambling or computer gaming in people. However, such highly rewarding activities have the potential to become obsessive in humans49,50, and the same may be true for dogs.

While addictive-like behaviour towards toys in dogs has not been studied to date, the phenomenon has been described in the lay literature (where affected dogs may be referred to as ‘ball junkies'), and it has been (rarely) alluded to in the scientific literature. Lazarowski et al.48 describe how some dogs show behavioural and physiological signs of high arousal in relation to toys, lack of self-control, and behaviours such as whining, barking, spinning, and other behavioural signs of stress when access to a toy is prevented (e.g. because the dog is restrained), suggested as an expression of their inability to manage the frustration of anticipation46. All these signs could be interpreted as indicative of craving (and frustration when the urge cannot be fulfilled).

In humans, addictive behaviours are often associated with deficits in inhibitory control and heightened cue-reactivity and craving, which are likely key mechanisms in addiction, particularly when exposed to behaviour-specific cues51,52,53.

In animal models of addictions, not only is an increased motivation to work for the rewarding substance notable, but the animals also continue seeking the reward even when it is signalled to be unavailable54. Similarly, excessively toy-motivated dogs may continue to try to gain access to a toy even when the caretaker has put it away (anecdotal evidence55. Dogs that appear obsessed with toys cannot be easily distracted from their fixation on the preferred object – demonstrating the high salience of the toy. Such dogs may even lose interest in other stimuli or social interactions as long as they have access to the toy, or sometimes even when it has been removed from reach55 – i.e., everyday functioning may be affected. Moreover, some dogs may continue playing (e.g., running tirelessly after balls thrown for them) despite adverse consequences, such as over-exertion or even injury in the short term and damage to joints and ligaments in the longer term56.

Thus, we suggest that ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs may show parallels to behavioural addictions in humans. Domestic dogs share many complex behavioural traits with us57,and they are commonly used as model species to explore compulsive behaviours58,59; cognitive ageing60,61,62, ADHD63,64,65, neuroticism66 and autism67,68,69.

Here, we aim to provide the first scientific evaluation of ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs, develop methods to assess this phenomenon, and investigate whether ‘excessive toy motivation' in pet dogs meets the defining criteria of behavioural addictions. Due to the heterogeneity of behavioural addictions, the number and description of diagnostic criteria are inconsistent in the scientific literature, even in humans19. We decided to explore whether the most common behavioural addiction criteria can be adapted to dogs: (1) craving, (2) salience, (3) mood modification through carrying out the behaviour, (4) lack of self-control, (5) tolerance, (6) withdrawal symptoms, (7) external consequences (the addictive behaviour causes conflict with other activities, other individuals, or within the individual), and (8) relapse after abstinence from the activity (cf28,41,70,71. Two additional criteria are used for diagnosing behavioural addictions in humans: having problems at home or work and lying to/deceiving people close to them26,72. Since these criteria cannot be applied to animals, we focused only on the eight abovementioned criteria.

We developed a behavioural test exposing pet dogs to various situations where behavioural addiction criteria in relation to toys can be expressed. Only the first four of the criteria mentioned above can be measured in a single behavioural assessment. The remaining criteria were included in an accompanying questionnaire, in which the dogs' owners were asked about their dogs' everyday behaviour.

While this study is exploratory, given the lack of prior research in this area, we used convergent methodologies in an attempt to assess internal and external validity. We predicted that dogs classified as having a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour based on our continuous Addictive-like Behaviour Test score, would:

Show higher scores for the individual behavioural addiction criteria: Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control in the behaviour test,

Show higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an unavailable toy in the behaviour test,

Receive higher scores on the owner questionnaire designed to measure dogs' addictive-like behaviour in everyday life,

than dogs classified as having a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour.

The study was assessed and approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland (Licence number BE115/17). All procedures were performed in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioral Research and Teaching” of the Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. All dog owners provided written informed consent for their participation.

One hundred twenty-six dog-owner teams were recruited via advertisements on social media. In the first call, any play-motivated dog was welcome to participate. In a second call, we specifically sought dogs showing ‘excessive' motivation for toy play.

Twenty-one of the 126 tested dogs were excluded from the analysis as they were (1) outside the target age range (< 1 year or > 10 years old; N = 9), (2) did not complete the test due to fatigue (N = 1), (3) did not play at all or were too fearful for pulse measurements (N = 7), or (4) due to disturbances during the test (e.g. owners bringing young children along, N = 4). The final sample (N = 105) included 56 males (34 neutered or chemically castrated, 20 intact and 2 cryptorchids) and 49 females (34 neutered and 15 intact), ranging in age from 12 months to 10 years (mean age = 5.09 years, SD = 2.6). The dogs belonged to various breeds (for demographics, see Supplementary Table 1). Eighty-two owners (72 women and 10 men) participated in the study.

Behaviour tests took place in an experimental room (Fig. 1), measuring 5.22 m x 3.36 m. A wooden partition wall divided the room into two parts so that the effective testing space was 3.60 m x 3.36 m. The room was furnished with two chairs and several shelves on the walls. One of the chairs was placed in front of the wooden partition wall (facing the entrance door), and the other was placed at a 90° angle against the wall to the left. In front of both chairs, a taped line marked a one-meter distance from the chairs. During the habituation phase, the opaque box in which a toy or food was enclosed during several subtests (hereafter, unsolvable task box) was placed next to the experimenter's chair.

Four video cameras (IB8377-H; 4 MP, 30 fps, H.264, WDR Pro, IR, PoE, IP66, 2.8–12 mm) were placed in the room, and recordings were made using the recorder system (ND9441P NVR, 16-CH, 4HDD, H.265, HDMI/VGA, 16x PoE).

Experimental room with the experimenter and owner in the starting position.

The test battery consisted of 14 subtests assessing various aspects of toy motivation in dogs. Play behaviour per se cannot be used to infer addictive-like behaviour, which is characterised primarily by reactions when the reward is unavailable; therefore, only subtests relevant to exploring behavioural addiction criteria are described in detail hereafter. The complete description of the play motivation test is available under: https://figshare.com/s/dfd6d12d922f7543b96c.

After the owner and the dog had entered the test room, the dog was unleashed, and a 3-minute habituation phase commenced (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the owner and the experimenter were seated on their allocated chairs, and the experimenter explained the test procedure. The owner signed the consent form. The owners were instructed to interact with the dog only when asked to perform one of the subtests and not to use food during testing unless absolutely necessary (such as exchanging food for a toy if the dog was unwilling to relinquish it).

After the habituation phase, the experimenter retrieved a box containing various commercial dog toys of different sizes and textures, with and without squeakers, etc., from the adjacent storage room. Only toys that might be associated with food enrichment were excluded. The owner was asked to select three toys (one ball, one tug toy and one plush toy) which they thought the dog would like the most. If the owner had brought the dog's favourite toy from home, this toy was used in the subsequent preference test along with two other toys. 

After removing the toy box from the room, the experimenter returned to the test room. The owner recalled the dog and sat down on their chair, holding the dog behind the Line marking the 1 m distance from the chair. Opposite the dog at the front of the room, the experimenter placed the three toys on the floor in a row, 40 cm apart. After the experimenter had returned to her chair, the owner released the dog, who could now explore and play with the toys for 30 s. The two people present did not interact with the dog during this time. The toy the dog spent the most time interacting with was used for subsequent testing. Forty-five dogs selected a ball, nine selected a tug toy, 39 selected a plush toy, and 12 selected a hybrid toy (plush ball: N = 3; tug with a ball: N = 6; plush tug: N = 3). On rare occasions, the dog did not show interest in any of the toys. In this case, the owner was asked to choose the type of toy the dog was usually most interested in at home. The chosen toy was used throughout the experiment, and the remaining two toys were placed on the shelf out of reach and sight of the dog. If the preferred toy was not a tug toy, the tug toy was used in subtests where the owner or experimenter played tug-of-war with the dog.

A description of the subtests and, when applicable, their relevance for addiction criteria coding is given in Table 1.

Videos were coded using Solomon Coder (Solomon Coder beta 19.08.02, Copyright 2006–2019 by Andràs Péter).

For most subtests, the starting point for coding was when the experimenter and the owner were sitting on their chairs, and the dog was behind the Line, which marked a 1 m distance from the owner's chair (Fig. 1).

Qualitative and quantitative coding was performed by coders who were not involved in the experiments.

Three different coding approaches were employed:

Scoring of individual variables that may be indicative of addictive behaviour each minute, which were later summed up as Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (Table 2); coder: KS.

Coding of presence/absence of the four addiction criteria in each minute of each subtest; coder: KS.

Quantitative coding.

Scoring and point sampling of behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” (Table 4); coder: FL.

Coding of absolute durations of behaviours in subtests where the toy was rendered inaccessible (unsolvable task box and toy on a shelf, see Table 4); coders: DZ and AH.

A second coder (AM) performed reliability coding of addictive-like behaviours and behavioural addiction criteria and point sampling for 15 dogs. Reliability between the two coders who coded the durations was also analysed for 15 dogs. Reliability was good or excellent for all included variables (ICC, absolute agreement, single measures, two-way mixed-effects model, computed in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) (see Supplementary Table 3 for full results).

To quantify dogs' propensity for addictive-like behaviour as objectively as possible, we introduced the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (AB-T score). Applicable sub-criteria were rated for each minute of the test, and for analysis, each sub-criterion was assigned a score between 0 and 2 points, as detailed in Table 2. The points from all the subtests, including the cool-down period, were added to yield the AB-T score. The maximum possible value of the AB-T score was 120 points. A cut-off point for addictive-like behaviour was defined by a data range split divided into two halves. Dogs scoring equal to or above the mid-point (44.2 points) are referred to as dogs showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour or high-AB dogs.

Dogs scoring less than 44.2 points are referred to as low-AB dogs (dogs with a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour). The sub-criteria included in the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (as detailed in Table 2) were selected as they were assumed to be relatively independent of the level of obedience and training. Dogs might have been trained to drop a toy on a cue and to exert impulse control and refrain from jumping towards the toy in the experimenter's hand; therefore, these variables were not included in the AB-T score. However, behaviours such as staring at the toy or pacing are believed to be less subject to training and were included.

Separately from the AB-T variables, in each subtest, the addiction criteria Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control were rated each minute as present or absent based on the occurrence of pre-defined behaviours. For instance, Salience was inferred from searching for a toy although there was an »attractive alternative« (food, owner inviting the dog to play). Craving was based on the dog focusing mainly on the toy (> 50%) and medium to high arousal directed at the inaccessible toy (inferred from behaviours such as panting, restlessness, and high muscle tension). We further coded behaviours that are usually characteristic of high arousal in some dogs, e.g., pacing, jumping towards the toy, and vocalising (see Table 3). If at least one of the pre-defined behaviours was expressed, the respective addiction criterion was coded as present. Tolerance, Withdrawal symptoms and Risk of relapse after abstinence could not be tested in the setting of the play motivation test since they develop over time.

For each subtest, a summary score for each of the four addiction criteria was computed by summing up the points for each minute of the subtest.

Selected behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” were coded by point sampling at 3-second intervals and then extrapolated to proportions of time (Table 4). Based on a subsample of dogs coded using both point sampling and absolute durations of behaviour, we determined sufficient agreement between the two measurement methods, justifying the use of point sampling. During subtests where a reward was inaccessible in the unsolvable task box, the absolute duration of interacting with the box (with low or high effort) was coded (Table 4). For detailed definitions of quantitatively coded variables, see Supplementary Table 2.

A questionnaire was developed (available in English and German) (for inter- and intra-rater reliability based on over 1500 dogs recruited via an online survey; see Supplementary Table 6). The questions relating to behavioural addiction criteria relevant to the present manuscript are shown in Table 5. They were rated on a 5-point Likert scale indicating the extent of agreement with the statement (1 – strongly disagree; 2 – partly disagree; 3 – neither agree nor disagree; 4 – partly agree; 5 – strongly agree). The dog owners were asked to complete this questionnaire during the cool-down period of the behavioural test.

SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) was used to compute a Categorical Principal Component Analysis and Mann-Whitney U tests. R version 4.1.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021) was used to create boxplots and to calculate linear models.

We calculated summary scores for the four addiction criteria for each subtest by summing up the points for each minute. Using Mann-Whitney U tests, we tested whether there was a difference in the addiction criteria Craving, Lack of self-control, Mood modification and Salience between dogs classified as high-AB dogs (AB-T score ≥ 44.2 points) and low-AB dogs (AB-T score < 44.2 points). Note that although components of Salience and craving were used to calculate the AB-T score, these are not identical to the 1 − 0 variables of Salience and craving here. While the addiction criteria were coded as 1/0 for each minute, the variables included in the AB-T score were more detailed, and individual elements potentially indicative of addictive-like behaviour were differentiated. Mood modification and Lack of self-control were not used in the designation of the AB-T score. See Sect. 1.6 and Table 3 for more details.

We performed Mann-Whitney U tests to assess whether high-AB and low-AB dogs differed in quantitatively coded variables such as time engaging with the toy during different subtests, attempting to attain an unavailable toy, etc. (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

Linear models were used to assess associations between the addictive-like behaviour score and the 19 questionnaire questions targeting addictive-like behaviour. Model requirements were checked by visually assessing normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals. If applicable, the dependent variable was transformed.

Additionally, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test whether the 19 questionnaire scores differed between high-AB and low-AB dogs. This was the case for fifteen questions; therefore, these were summed up to generate an Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score). Cohen's R was used as a measure of effect size.

Both intra-rater reliability (available for 274 dogs, including dogs from the online survey) and inter-rater reliability (available for 24 dogs) of the AB-Q score were very good (see Supplementary Table 6).

Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no correction for multiple testing was performed (as recommended by73.

The mid-point of the data range of the AB-T score was 44.2 (range 6.6–95). Therefore, dogs scoring 44.2 or higher were classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour (high-AB dogs). This was the case for thirty-three of the 105 highly play-motivated dogs tested, with a mean score of 59.7 points and a median of 58.6. The mean AB-T score for low-AB dogs (< 44.2 points) was 23.1, and the median was 22.8. For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 7.

Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that high-AB dogs scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on craving (U = 217, p < 0.0001), salience (U = 208, p < 0.0001), and lack of self-control (U = 756.5, p = 0.002), but not mood modification (U = 1022, p = 0.157), in the behaviour test (see Supplementary Table 4, Figs. 2a-d). For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 8.

High-AB dogs interacted significantly longer with the box than low-AB dogs in the ‘toy in the box' subtest (U = 675.5, p < 0.0001). They also spent more time looking at the toy on the shelf during the ‘toy on shelf' subtest (U = 414.5, p < 0.0001) and the ‘social play without toys' subtest (U = 942.5, p = 0.021), while focusing less on the owner in the latter (U = 819.5, p = 0.011) compared to low-AB dogs (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 2e and f). However, time spent interacting with the toy while the owner and experimenter were out of the room did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs (U = 994, p = 0.135; Supplementary Table 5). For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 9.

Linear models demonstrated significant associations between the AB-T score and 18 out of 19 individual questions (Table 6). However, according to Mann-Whitney U tests, only fifteen questions differed significantly between dogs classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour in the behaviour test (AB-T score ≥ 44.2) and those that did not. These fifteen questions (Cohen's R > 0.2 – see Table 6) were summed up into the Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score) (see Table 6).

This study represents the beginning of the exploration of addictive-like behaviour in domestic dogs. Convergent behavioural measures support the existence of an addictive-like behavioural phenotype in 33 of the 105 tested highly play-motivated dogs. Note that we specifically sought dogs exhibiting extreme behaviour; thus, this proportion is not a reflection of the general population. Perhaps not surprising, working breeds – many of which are known to have been artificially selected for high toy or predatory motivation74,75,76 – were overrepresented in the sample.

As predicted, dogs classified as high-AB dogs based on the detailed AB-T score (Addictive-like Behaviour Test score) scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on the individual criteria craving, salience, and lack of self-control in the behaviour test. Contrary to the prediction, mood modification (when given access to a toy) did not differ between high and low-AB dogs. In retrospect, however, this lack of difference between the two groups strengthens our argument that we were measuring a phenotype beyond mere enjoyment of play. Still, despite the significant differences between high- and low-AB dogs in the other investigated addiction criteria, Salience, Craving and Loss of Self Control, there was generally high variation between individuals.

In line with the predictions, high-AB dogs showed higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an inaccessible toy than low-AB dogs, often prioritising attempting to access the toy over eating or interacting with the owner. Thus, there was general agreement between the three alternative methods of coding the data (detailed behaviour score, addiction criteria, and quantitative coding), indicating internal consistency.

The external validity of the behaviour test was demonstrated by significant associations of the AB-T score with 18 out of 19 questions from the addictive-like behaviour questionnaire filled in by the dogs' owners, intended to measure addictive-like behaviour in everyday life. Nonetheless, although significant, the effect sizes were relatively low, indicating that no single question would have predictive value for assessing a tendency for addictive-like behaviour in dogs.

In studies using animal models of substance addiction, one way to differentiate an addiction from drug use that occurs due to lack of choice is to present the subject with a choice between the addictive substance and other highly desirable stimuli. If an individual continues to take the drug at the expense of these other options (such as consumption of a food reward), this points to the possibility of addictive-like behaviour77,78. Consistent with this, high-AB dogs showed a loss of interest in other relevant stimuli, focusing on the inaccessible toy and foregoing the opportunity to consume food or to engage with their owner. The latter is also reminiscent of behavioural addictions in humans, leading to a decline in social interactions79.

The intense toy-seeking and loss of interest in other stimuli, despite the availability of food or social interaction – considered as indicators for salience and persistence – might resemble “hyperfocus,” a trait associated with ADHD and autism in humans80,81. However, unlike typical hyperfocus, which often emerges in the absence of competing stimuli, dogs in our study were presented with alternative salient rewards (e.g., the toy was placed on a shelf while the owner actively invited the dog to engage in social play; in another subtest, food was available in a puzzle toy while the preferred toy was inaccessible in a closed container), and they still showed a preference for the inaccessible toy. Like dogs with ADHD, dogs in the current study with high AB-T scores in general exhibited high impulsivity (labelled as “loss of self-control”), and some individuals displayed heightened activity (which could be interpreted as the hyperactivity component of ADHD64,65 in particular during the cool-down period. Thus, further research is needed to explore commonalities and differences between addictive-like behaviour and ADHD-like behaviour in dogs. While dogs with a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour might exhibit many characteristics of dogs with ADHD, the converse is not necessarily true – dogs might show ADHD-like behaviour without displaying any hyperfixation on toys.

Another characteristic of addicted individuals is that they are willing to pursue their addiction even if it has adverse consequences82. In the current study, “adversity” was elicited by the owner and the experimenter leaving the room in order to assess the effect of social isolation on the behavioural addiction criteria. Isolation in an unfamiliar place is well-established as a stressful experience for dogs83,84,85,86. However, this subtest was not a good measure of addictive-like behaviour: Time spent interacting with the toy while the dog was alone did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs. For welfare reasons, we decided against exposing the dogs to more severe stressors; however, it cannot be ruled out that this subtest was not “aversive” enough. The dog was left alone for only 30 seconds, and the subtest took place in the middle of the test when the dogs were already habituated to the test room. It is also possible that individual differences in subjects' separation distress, independent of play motivation, affected the results. Additionally, there was no clear contingency between interacting with the toy and the ‘adverse' outcome (owner leaving). Future studies could potentially enhance the design by providing the dog with an explicit choice, such as by placing the toy in a separate room, away from the owner and the experimenter. This could help determine whether the dog is willing to risk being alone in an unusual or new environment when it normally prefers the safety of being near its owner. Such a design would better reflect the conflict between competing motivations (social security vs. reward seeking) and could offer a more valid test of the criterion of persistence under adversity.

Still, the importance of continued efforts to engage in the behaviour despite adverse consequences was demonstrated in the questionnaire, where one of the highest associations with the AB-T score was found with the question, “My dog will continue to play with a ball/toy despite adverse consequences”. This suggests that some dogs may fulfil the criterion of continuing the addictive-like behaviour despite adverse consequences in real life, even if this could not be demonstrated in the behaviour test.

A critical factor in addiction is the propensity to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards87,88. In humans, cues associated with addictive behaviours, such as specific locations or objects, can induce craving and drug administration88,89. In dogs, a toy such as a ball could represent such as a conditioned cue. It may achieve its value, for example, by the experience of chasing and catching. For many domestic dogs, balls or other toys possess incentive salience, according to the three criteria by Robinson and Berridge49: they (1) “elicit approach” (i.e. they become “wanted” and act as “motivational magnets”); (2) “they can energise ongoing actions by eliciting cue-triggered wanting”; (3) “they can act as reinforcers in their own right, reinforcing the acquisition of a new instrumental response (measurable by conditioned reinforcement)” (cf49, p. 3139].).

The perceived value of the toy was demonstrated in our study by many dogs having difficulty relinquishing the toy. It can be speculated that balls become ‘motivational magnets' by being associated with species-typical predatory behaviour (cf48. The high salience of the toy was especially apparent in subtests where dogs were foregoing available alternatives such as freely available food or social play with the owner, at the expense of trying to regain their inaccessible toy.

In both rodents and humans90,91, individuals with a higher tendency to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards (sign trackers) are more vulnerable to addiction than goal trackers, who focus primarily on the (location of the) reward itself88,92, see the meta-analysis by93. Tendency to sign-track vs. goal-track is associated with the risk of addiction and is also related to variations in the dopaminergic system and stress physiology88.

While it was not explicitly measured in the current study, in dogs, a tendency to sign track might be advantageous in a training context – i.e., maintaining motivation would be easier in dogs that are not only sensitive to rewards but also attribute value to the cues predicting these rewards, even if not always followed by a primary reinforcer. Sensitivity to reward – and propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward-predictive cues – would thus be highly relevant traits in relation to trainability and might be selected for especially in working dog breeds.

Several publications state the importance of ‘obsessive' play motivation for working dog success42,94,95,96,97,98,99. Dogs with extreme toy motivation are believed to show better focus, reduced distractibility and greater trainability97,99. However, if such motivation becomes addictive-like, it needs to be questioned whether the well-being of these dogs may be compromised. If dogs prioritise toy interactions over other essential aspects of their daily lives this may have maladaptive effects, as is the case in humans with behavioural addictions100,101. Certainly, adverse health consequences may arise from repetitive ball chasing, like straining ligaments and joints56. Moreover, welfare would be compromised when dogs experience a high level of frustration when access to their reward is prevented (cf102.

Anecdotally, when play motivation becomes excessive, irritability, high arousal levels, and frustration may negatively affect dogs' trainability and work103. Indeed, as stated by Mathews96, the high ‘drive' of search dogs often makes them unsuitable as family pets, which is also supported by owner reports that pet dogs with extreme motivation for toys are often problematic to control102.

Thus, it needs to be questioned when play becomes maladaptive. Do high-AB dogs still ‘like' to play, or have they progressed to primarily ‘wanting' and the compulsive need to continue104?. Similar to the escalating engagement seen in human behavioural addictions105, some dogs would repeatedly spin, jump, focus or bark towards the unavailable toy on the shelf for the duration of the subtest. Two dogs even managed to destroy the box enclosing their favourite toy. These behaviours might be likened to the repetitive actions observed in individuals with behavioural addictions41. Nonetheless, such behaviours may also occur in other behavioural phenotypes such as canine compulsive disorder or autism spectrum-like behaviours106. Further research is needed to elucidate commonalities and differences between such phenotypes in dogs.

Behavioural addictions in humans often involve emotional dependency on specific activities107. Whether dogs similarly seek comfort, stimulation, or stress relief through persistent engagement with the toy could not be determined in the context of the behaviour test. In the questionnaire, “Is attached to the favourite toy” was the only question not significantly associated with the AB-T score. Thus, further research is required to determine whether dogs develop an emotional dependency on their toys (as described anecdotally).

To better understand the origin and possible functional underpinnings of excessive toy-directed behaviour in dogs, future research should examine whether similar patterns of excessive object play occur in non-domesticated canids. While data are limited, recent studies have shown that both hand-reared and wild wolf pups engage in object play108. For instance, wolf pups have been observed developing a preference for toys and spending increasing amounts of time with them over time108. Hand-reared wolf pups will even retrieve objects to humans109. In the wild, wolves have also been seen interacting with human-made objects110. These findings suggest that object play is not unique to dogs but rather could represent a broader trait shared by canids. Comparative studies are needed to assess how common and functionally relevant such behaviours are in wolves, which would help clarify the biological basis of the addictive-like behaviours observed in some dogs.

Being the first of its kind, this study has its limitations. As no gold standard exists, the study is exploratory, and our categorisation of dogs into high and low addictive-like behaviour groups, determined by a data range split, was somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, the assignment of high- and low-AB categories corresponded well to the first author's personal assessment of addictive-like tendencies in the participant dogs.

In interpreting the questionnaire results, it is important to acknowledge the potential biases associated with using owner-reported questionnaires. Owners may unintentionally project their perceptions or expectations onto their dogs' behaviours, potentially leading to discrepancies between reported and observed behaviours in behavioural test. This is particularly relevant in cases where owners have multiple dogs, as they are likely to compare their pets to one another, influencing their assessment, such as by underestimating or overestimating certain behaviours. For instance, an owner with a highly active dog may rate their less active dog as overly calm. Integrating owner reports and objective testing allows for a more comprehensive and accurate canine behaviour evaluation.

To conclude, there appear to be parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and behavioural addictions in humans. Interestingly, also in humans, the first officially recognised behavioural addictions (gambling and internet gaming) originate in play28,29,30,111. Generally, play is an activity that induces a pleasurable emotional state6. In humans, much evidence suggests that video games can affect people's lives positively. They make players feel better about themselves, help raise their self-esteem and assist people in dealing with everyday stress111. Some people are excessive gamers, but only a minority would be classified as addicts111,112,113. Similarly, many dogs may greatly enjoy toy play without developing harmful compulsions (cf. in humans28,29,30,111).

Despite the observed parallels between high-AB dogs and humans affected by behavioural addictions, we refrain from conclusively characterising high-AB dogs as exhibiting addictive behaviour, given the absence of established benchmarks or standardised criteria. It is important to be cautious when pathologising behaviour, especially given that even in humans, addictive behaviours are still difficult to define and measure114. To further understand possible parallels in the processes underlying behavioural addictions in humans and excessive toy motivation in dogs, subsequent research endeavours should seek to correlate individual differences in addictive-like behaviour in dogs with characteristics associated with addictive behaviours in humans, such as high impulsivity, impaired reversal learning, heightened perseveration, and delayed extinction of previously rewarded responses115,116.

Surprise!

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A mapping expedition in the Tlayócoc cave in Mexico led a professional cave explorer to a hidden chamber containing shocking evidence of an extinct civilization.

Yekaterina Katiya Pavlova ventured to a community in the Sierra de Guerrero to further map the Tlayócoc cave. When Pavlova and local guide Adrián Beltrán Dimas reached the bottom of the cave, having already explored all that was mapped, they opted to head into an unknown passage through a submerged entrance. The effort paid off.

The passage led to a previously unseen room in which two engraved shell bracelets sat atop stalagmites, likely as an offering, according to a translated statement from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). 

The explorers also found another bracelet, a giant snail shell, and pieces of black stone discs similar to pyrite mirrors—all of it dated to more than 500 years ago. 

Archaeologists then descended on the cave, uncovering 14 total objects—three shell bracelets, a bracelet fragment, the giant snail shell, a piece of burnt wood, and pieces of eight stone discs (two of which were complete). Each of the bracelets were made from snail shells—likely a marine species—and were engraved with anthropomorphic symbols and figures.

The bracelets feature S-shaped symbols known as xonecuilli, zigzagging lines,a and circles to create human faces in profile. These designs could be meant to signify deities. 

The archaeologista estimate that the items were left in the cave during the Postclassic period between 950 and 1521 A.D.—a time when the area was known to be populated by the now-extinct Tlacotepehaus ethnic group. 

“This finding is of great relevance, since, with the study of the contextual relationship of the pieces of the cave, we can interpret symbolic notions, cultural aspects, manufacturing, and even trade,” Miguel Perez, INAH archaeologist, said in a statement, “to characterize the pre-Hispanic societies settled in the Sierra de Guerrero.”

The archaeologists determined that the stalagmites were manipulated in pre-Hispanic times to give them a more spherical finish, likely to better fit with ritual needs. 

“Possibly the symbols and representations of characters on the bracelets are related to pre-Hispanic cosmogony regarding creation and fertility,” Cuauhtemoc Reyes Alvarez, INAH archaeologist, said in a statement. He added that the sealed context allows experts to understand how the ancient inhabitants may have conceived of these caves—as portals to the underworld, or as sacred spaces connected to the Earth and the divine.

The black stone discs resemble others from nearby archaeological regions, such as El Infiernillo, along with ones from distant cultures like Huasteca. 

Historical reports say extreme cold forced people groups living in the Sierra de Guerrero (located over 7,850 feet above sea level and filled by dense pine and oak forests) to lower altitudes. Little is known about the Tlacotepheuas, other than 16th century historical mentions of their presence. The snail-shell bracelets could help tell their story.

Scientists have developed a blood test that analyses epigenetic changes in immune cells. They say it could be used to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Credit: TEK Image/Science Photo Library

Researchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome may have a new weapon in their armoury. In a study published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on 8 October1, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.

A debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.

The results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.

Others in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.

A reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research

A reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research

The underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.

The researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.

The authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.

“I think it's really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”

Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge

Many studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.

Although Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere, it still experiences powerful winds that play a major role in shaping the planet's climate and in distributing its ever-present dust. These winds stir up dust into swirling columns called dust devils—rotating plumes of air and fine particles that sweep across the Martian surface. While the winds themselves are invisible, the dust devils they lift can be seen clearly in spacecraft images. Because they trace the flow of moving air, scientists use them as natural markers to study wind behavior that would otherwise remain unseen.A new study led by Dr. Valentin Bickel from the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern reveals that both dust devils and the winds driving them are much faster than scientists previously believed. These stronger winds may be responsible for much of the dust lofted into the Martian atmosphere, which has a major impact on the planet's weather and long-term climate. The research, conducted in collaboration with the University of Bern's Department of Space Research and Planetology, the Open University in the UK, and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), was recently published in Science Advances.

Movement of dust devils studied with the help of deep learning

"Using a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, we were able to identify dust devils in over 50,000 satellite images," explains first author Valentin Bickel. The team used images from the Bern-based Mars camera CaSSIS (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System) and the stereo camera HRSC (High Resolution Stereo Camera). CaSSIS is on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, while the HRSC camera is on board the ESA orbiter Mars Express. "Our study is therefore based exclusively on data from European Mars exploration," Bickel continues.

Next, the team studied stereo images of about 300 of these dust devils to determine their movement and speed. Co-author Nicolas Thomas, who led the development of the CaSSIS camera system at the University of Bern and whose work is funded by SERI's Swiss Space Office through ESA's PRODEX program, explains: "Stereo images are images of the same spot on the surface of Mars, but taken a few seconds apart. These images can therefore be used to measure the movement of dust devils."

Bickel emphasizes: "If you put the stereo images together in a sequence, you can observe how dynamically the dust devils move across the surface." (see the images on the website of the University of Bern)

Winds on Mars stronger than previously assumed

The results show that the dust devils and the winds surrounding them on Mars can reach speeds of up to 44 m/s, i.e. around 160 km/h, across the entire planet, which is much faster than previously assumed (previous measurements on the surface had shown that winds mostly remain below 50 km/h and - in rare cases - can reach a maximum of 100 km/h).

The high wind speed in turn influences the dust cycle on the Red Planet: "These strong, straight-line winds are very likely to bring a considerable amount of dust into the Martian atmosphere - much more than previously assumed," says Bickel. He continues: "Our data show where and when the winds on Mars seem to be strong enough to lift dust from the surface. This is the first time that such findings are available on a global scale for a period of around two decades."

Future Mars missions can benefit from the research results

The results obtained are also particularly important for future Mars missions. "A better understanding of the wind conditions on Mars is crucial for the planning and execution of future landed missions," explains Daniela Tirsch from the Institute of Space Research at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and co-author of the study. "With the help of the new findings on wind dynamics, we can model the Martian atmosphere and the associated surface processes more precisely," Tirsch continues. These models are essential to better assess risks for future missions and adapt technical systems accordingly. The new study thus provides important findings for a number of research areas on Mars, such as research into the formation of dunes and slope streaks, as well as the creation of weather and climate models of Mars.

The researchers plan to further intensify the observations of dust devils and supplement the data obtained with targeted and coordinated observations of dust devils using CaSSIS and HRSC. "In the long term, our research should help to make the planning of Mars missions more efficient," concludes Bickel.

The researchers exploited a weakness in current energy technology to create more electricity.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

It sounds counterintuitive, but there is such a thing as too much sun for solar panels. According to the World Economic Forum, when things really heat up—like during a heat wave—solar panel power output drops by 10 to 25 percent.

This is a longtime problem, and it might be one that's preventing greater adoption of solar panels, which emerged as a viable energy source for Americans in the 1970s. As global energy requirements continue to rise and much of the world moves away from fossil fuels, efficiency has become a vital factor in sustainable energy generation. It could be especially important as heat waves become more common due to climate change.

Now, scientists in the UK might have a fix that takes advantage of excess thermal energy, turning it into chemical energy that can then provide the missing power.

Each traditional photovoltaic cell within a solar panel array has a silicon semiconductor layer specially designed to absorb the sun's photons, or particles of light, and convert it into electricity. The photons transfer their energy to electrons in the semiconducting material, causing them to move. This motion creates an electric current in the cell. 

Such solar panels have a typical operating temperature range between 60 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can absorb too much heat, thanks to their superior sun-absorbing properties. Panels get as hot as 150 degrees Fahrenheit, even when it's only 85 degrees outside. That's when electrons within the circuit of each photovoltaic cell begin bouncing around. As a result of this instability, the voltage drops, lowering the efficiency.

The new research looks beyond photovoltaics and relies instead on silicon-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) flow cells. In particular, they are paired with a storage system whose efficiency actually rises with temperature. This positive result is described in an August issue of The Journal of Chemical Physics.

The system is similar to traditional solar panel technology, but it has a key difference: a chemical reaction takes place at the cell's surface, driving its electricity transfer, study co-author Dowon Bae, PhD, of Loughborough University said in an email. “Depending on the type of chemicals in the electrolyte [which stores and carries electrical charge], we can convert the electricity into other chemicals or store it in the form of chemical energy in the electrolyte,” he said. 

PEC flow cells operate primarily through a two-step process. First, light absorption by the photodevice generates electricity. Then, this drives a chemical reaction located at an interface between the PEC cell itself and the electrolyte. 

“What we've experimentally found in our recent work is that a certain amount of heat can promote the chemical conversion reaction, compensating the loss in voltage,” Bae said in an e-mail. “Simply put, there is a temperature range where heat can be used efficiently without overheating.”

The sweet spot for this increased energy conversion is at around 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Beyond that point, rising temperatures will cause PECs to reduce their effectiveness, too. Although this threshold can change based on the materials used, Bae says that as it gets hotter, more material adheres to the surface of the cells, and at a certain point, it's too much. 

Though PEC flow cells promise to drink up more sunlight than traditional solar panel technology, they do have to overcome their own Achilles' heel: they require what Bae calls a “toll-fee” payment to kickstart the necessary chemical reactions. This “overpotential” lowers the cells' overall efficiency. The cells are also particularly susceptible to corrosion compared to run-of-the-mill solar panels. 

So, at this time, the PEC flow cell isn't quite as robust as it needs to be. While these limitations have kept the technology from widespread adoption, some industries do use it for other applications, particularly in green hydrogen production or carbon capture.

Standard photovoltaics may remain the foundational engine of the green energy revolution, but Bae is still confident that PEC flow cells offer myriad benefits. They can be quite beneficial for situations requiring independence from the main electrical grid, because they're particularly adept at energy storage. They're also simpler, since they don't require wiring, or any other kinds of traditional electrical connections. In fact, some researchers refer to the PEC cell as an “artificial leaf.”

Bae is very skeptical of using PEC technology for hydrogen generation or carbon dioxide-reduction, because of the current efficiency and corrosion issues. However, he notes that redox batteries, which rely on an oxidation-reduction (redox) chemical reaction to produce electricity, could be a better option for PECs. “Unlike other chemical conversion processes, redox batteries require low overpotential and do not require any gas or product filtering processes,” he says.These kinds of creative solutions will become necessary in the near future, he says. The cost of photovoltaic electricity has fallen by 85 percent since 2010, and enabling solar panels to soak up more of the sun's power could further reduce the cost, making solar panel technology more universally appealing. 

Though solar engineers have treated heat as an enemy to be circumvented for decades, this new work showcases that, ironically, even heat waves could power the green energy revolution.

Discovered in modern-day Turkey at the Karahantepe site, it could be the first-ever carved depiction of a human face.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The T-shaped obelisks famous at Karahantepe just took on an entirely abstract—and remarkably human—visage. Excavations at the early Neolithic site uncovered an obelisk with a human face on it, the first ever found with such a carving and what could be one of the earliest examples of symbolic expression from the Neolithic period roughly 12,000 years ago. 

“In the excavations carried out within the scope of our Stone Hills Project, a T-shaped obelisk with a human face was brought to light for the first time,” Nuri Ersov, Turkish minister of culture and tourism, said in a translated statement. “This work, located in Karahantepe, sheds light on human history as the first example of the Neolithic age man in which he embraced himself in a T-shaped column.”

Karahantepe is one of the limestone heights within the Tek Tek Mountains National Park outside the Turkish city of Sanliurfa. The limestone there provided the raw material for the T-shaped pillars at Karahantepe (a Neolithic settlement discovered in 1997) and other contemporary sites.

The new find was discovered as part of the Stone Hills Project, an endeavor designed to explore southeast Anatolia and provide fresh insights into the earliest known periods of human history. The aforementioned obelisk's facial representation appears at the top of the pillar, and is similar in style to the human statues found in Karahantepe, featuring sharp lines, deep eye sockets, and blunt noses. These human statues are dated to about 11,000 years ago. 

The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that the discovery shows the technical mastery of Neolithic craftsmen, but also highlights the self-expression and abstract thinking occurring at the time.

Previously, the site had revealed T-shaped obelisks thought to symbolize people, but finding one with facial features for the first time strengthens the theory that the pieces were used for far more than architecture. Rather, they offer a potential first look at human abstract art. “The obelisks, which were previously thought to represent humans, deepened their meaning with this discovery,” Ersoy said. 

Other discoveries at the site have, over the years, shaped our understanding of Karahantepe's significance. A human sculpture was found at the site in 2023, which featured a man with a facial expression, a full body, and his arms reaching to hold his phallus. The site has also yielded statues of a gazelle, a rabbit, birds, and other animals, and could potentially represent a move toward a less nomadic lifestyle, as indicated by the discoveries of monuments and carvings amidst residential artifacts.

But those finds are all dated to about 11,000 years ago—not as old as this T-shaped obelisk with its striking facial features. Now, with the discovery of one of the earliest examples of symbolic expression from the pre-pottery Neolithic period (dated to around 10,000 B.C.E.), experts surmise that Karahantepe could be one of the first cult centers showing man trying to understand his place in nature.

Scientists Turned 300,000 Litter Box Visits into an AI-Powered Cat Health Monitor

Cat bathroom data from an AI-powered litter box could offer useful pet health insights

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Clara Moskowitz

To cat owners, a litter box is a nuisance. But to scientists, it's a trove of information. A team of researchers at Nestlé Purina PetCare decided to investigate litter boxes as records of behavior: the pre-squat scratch, the whirl, the precise geometry of the bury.

The scientists built a painstaking dictionary of these gestures—a full “ethogram,” or catalog, of species-specific behaviors—and then identified the distinct moves in feline bathroom habits: grooming, digging, sniffing litter. “We landed on 39 different behaviors that cats do in a litter box, with the understanding that depending on their satisfaction with the litter box, the environment and the dynamics around them, those behaviors will shift,” says Ragen McGowan, director of digital and AI product development at Purina and one of the authors of a paper published recently in Applied Animal Behaviour Science on the development of Purina's AI-powered litter box monitor. “We realized this ethogram could be a window into their health.”

Cats commonly suffer from diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, urinary tract infections and many more conditions. The researchers hoped to predict and stave off these ailments by training an artificial intelligence system on everything a cat can do in a litter box. They believed that AI could warn cat owners of feline health concerns long before the cats—ever stoic and aloof—showed signs.

But arriving at the 39 behavior types wasn't easy. The project began in 2018. The team gathered data from 191 cats—140 at a company research center in Missouri and 51 in private homes. The researchers placed scales with a sensor at each corner that could detect tiny changes in weight and movement under litter boxes. They then made video recordings of every bathroom visit so that artificial intelligence could correlate the visual data with the weight and movements that the sensors recorded. But for the AI to do that, the scientists first had to generate the ethogram.

Watching the videos, they labeled every nudge and movement, peering at ear angles, at the bunching or flaring of whiskers. If you've ever watched a cat rotate exactly three and a half times before committing to a square inch of litter, you begin to understand the research process—multiplied hundreds of thousands of times. “We took over 300,000 videos of cats eliminating in different scenarios—single cat, multicat, all different types of litter boxes,” McGowan says.

The team then paired those video labels with the weight and movement data so that the AI could distinguish a quick tinkle from a philosophical contemplation. “We would work closely with our behaviorists to discuss what they're looking at in the videos, and then we had to develop mathematical equations,” says Natalie Langenfeld-McCoy, manager of AI product development at Purina.

The analysis of these recordings would become the foundation for Purina's Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitor, which, released in 2022, is already in more than 10,000 homes. The product is designed to alert pet owners when the measurements match the known patterns for certain cat ailments, and the team regularly updates the software to improve accuracy. The new paper documents the scientific steps behind its creation.

The monitor slides beneath an existing litter box and can recognize each cat in the house, according to the study. “Not only can we use their weight as a way to tell them apart but also their patterns in the litter box, the time of day they go and their normal habits to create what we call a ‘paw print,' or signature, for that cat,” McGowan says.

The team intends for the tool to communicate problems cats are having or offer reassurance to owners when all is well. Feline kidney disease, for example, a progressive illness that often goes unnoticed in early stages, can be treated if caught early. “By the time most pet owners would notice a behavioral change, the loss of renal function will be over 80 percent, and there's no turning back,” McGowan says. According to Purina's website, although “information provided by Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitors is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease,” the monitors can alert owners to “key changes that may indicate a health issue requiring a veterinary diagnosis.”

Jessica Quimby, a small animal internal medicine specialist and professor at the Ohio State University, uses the Petivity monitor in her own research on feline kidney disease and recently published a paper showing clinically relevant results based on the monitor's measurements. (Quimby is a Nestlé Purina PetCare advisory board member.) “One of the very first things you might see with the onset of disease, even before we know the cat has kidney disease, is that they're losing weight and urinating more,” Quimby says. “We can see those trends appearing on the Petivity data.” Cats, she explains, are good at hiding health problems from their caregivers.

The smart litter box does, however, have its limitations. “If [cats] are close in weight and they have a similar pattern of elimination, that's a struggle for the system,” says Langenfeld-McCoy. She recommends that five or fewer cats use one system. But improvements in AI capabilities should help distinguish between similar cats soon. “The deep-learning models can pick out subtle differences in behavior that maybe we don't even know exist, so we're moving towards that for those cats that are close in weight,” she says.

Household antagonists—nudgy robot vacuums, percussive washing machines—can also cause confusion, so the team coached cat owners on placement during its research. But often when problems arise, the fix is less engineering than sociology. Langenfeld-McCoy recalls a home in which the AI indicated the cat had done its usual behavior but left nothing behind. “The family dog would come after the cat and have a snack, which was confusing the AI,” she says. With a baby gate installed, the AI recovered its composure. Sometimes the outlier in the data is a Labrador.

Although the Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitor has been on the market for three years, the team waited until it had ample data to publish its scientific findings. “Smart” is one of those labels that arouses suspicion—smart toasters send overanxious notifications; smart fridges upsell milk. So when we hear “smart litter box,” we picture an appliance with delusions of grandeur. The new study is a way for the team at Purina to pull back the curtain for users and skeptics alike and let cat owners determine whether “smart” gets to take off its quotation marks.

In drug discovery processes, changing the core structures of lead compounds to a variety of other ring systems is often needed, which typically requires laborious de novo syntheses of individual analogues. Here we report a conceptually different approach that allows rapid access to diverse core structures from a common intermediate using 1,2-oxaborines as a versatile molecular platform. A soft enolization/6π-electrocyclization strategy has been developed to efficiently synthesize 1,2-oxaborines from readily available enones or enals. Taking advantage of their multifaceted reactivities, 1,2-oxaborines can undergo further C−H functionalization and be transformed into a diverse range of arenes, heteroarenes and non-aromatic heterocycles. Finally, late-stage preparations of a suite of analogues that contain Lipitor substituents but with different aromatic cores are demonstrated using the 1,2-oxaborine-based core diversification strategy.

Researchers at Skoltech have developed a mathematical model that explores how memory functions. When they analyzed this model, they discovered intriguing results that could help improve robotic systems, artificial intelligence, and our understanding of how the human mind stores information. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, suggest there might be an ideal number of senses—and if that's true, our five senses might not be enough!

"Our conclusion is of course highly speculative in application to human senses, although you never know: It could be that humans of the future would evolve a sense of radiation or magnetic field. But in any case, our findings may be of practical importance for robotics and the theory of artificial intelligence," said study co-author Professor Nikolay Brilliantov of Skoltech AI. "It appears that when each concept retained in memory is characterized in terms of seven features—as opposed to, say, five or eight—the number of distinct objects held in memory is maximized."

Following a research tradition that began in the early 20th century, the team focused on modeling the basic units of memory known as “engrams.” An engram can be thought of as a sparse collection of neurons in different brain regions that fire together. Each engram represents a concept, described through a set of features. For humans, these features correspond to sensory experiences—for example, the concept of a banana includes its appearance, smell, taste, and other sensory qualities. In this framework, the banana becomes a five-dimensional object within a mental space containing all the other memories stored in the brain.

Engrams evolve over time, becoming sharper or more diffuse depending on how often they are triggered by sensory input from the outside world. This process represents how we learn and forget as we interact with our environment.

"We have mathematically demonstrated that the engrams in the conceptual space tend to evolve toward a steady state, which means that after some transient period, a 'mature' distribution of engrams emerges, which then persists in time," Brilliantov commented. "As we consider the ultimate capacity of a conceptual space of a given number of dimensions, we somewhat surprisingly find that the number of distinct engrams stored in memory in the steady state is the greatest for a concept space of seven dimensions. Hence the seven senses claim."

In other words, let the objects that exist out there in the world be described by a finite number of features corresponding to the dimensions of some conceptual space. Suppose that we want to maximize the capacity of the conceptual space expressed as the number of distinct concepts associated with these objects. The greater the capacity of the conceptual space, the deeper the overall understanding of the world. It turns out that the maximum is attained when the dimension of the conceptual space is seven. From this the researchers conclude that seven is the optimal number of senses.

According to the researchers, this number does not depend on the details of the model -- the properties of the conceptual space and the stimuli providing the sense impressions. The number seven appears to be a robust and persistent feature of memory engrams as such. One caveat is that multiple engrams of differing sizes existing around a common center are deemed to represent similar concepts and are therefore treated as one when calculating memory capacity.

The memory of humans and other living beings is an enigmatic phenomenon tied to the property of consciousness, among other things. Advancing the theoretical models of memory will be instrumental to gaining new insights into the human mind and recreating humanlike memory in AI agents.

Scientists from the University of Bath, working together with researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, have created a molecule that stops a key protein linked to Parkinson's disease and certain dementias from clumping together. The research team has shown that this molecule works in an animal model of Parkinson's and believes it could one day form the basis of a treatment that slows the disease's progression.

Alpha-synuclein is a protein found mainly inside brain cells (neurons), where it helps control the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the chemical that allows neurons to communicate with each other.

In Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein begins to stick together, forming toxic clusters that kill nerve cells. This cell loss leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulty with movement. Although existing therapies can ease these symptoms, none currently stop or reverse the underlying damage.

In its normal or "native state," alpha-synuclein is a flexible strand, but when it becomes active it folds into a helix. This shape is crucial for its role in carrying and delivering dopamine within the brain.

The researchers designed a short peptide that locks alpha-synuclein into its healthy helical shape, preventing it from transforming into the harmful clusters that cause cell death.

Lab experiments revealed that the peptide remains stable, can enter brain-like cells, and reduces the buildup of toxic protein deposits while improving movement in a worm model of Parkinson's disease.

Published in the journal JACS Au, the study highlights how rational peptide design can turn large, unstable proteins into smaller, more drug-like molecules.

The findings mark a significant step towards developing new peptide-based treatments for currently untreatable neurodegenerative conditions. Professor Jody Mason, from the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Bath, said: "Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems.

"This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited."

Dr. Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, which funded the research, said:

"Dementia isn't an inevitable part of ageing; it's caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases.

"Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein.

"By stabilizing alpha-synuclein in its healthy form, this could open the door to a new class of treatments that could slow progression in diseases like Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies. We look forward to seeing this research taken to the next stage, potentially exploring how it would work in people.

"We're delighted to see such promising advances from Alzheimer's Research UK funded work opening up new avenues for treatments of the future, and the potential to change the lives of those affected by neurodegenerative diseases."

Further research is needed, but the team hopes that continued progress will enable these and similar molecules to advance towards clinical testing in the coming years.

I was really looking forward to seeing how that got translated into something other than English.But in the fine print, they say this instead:> We take the letters from your message and transliterate by syllable, as nearly as we can, into [Old Persian] cuneiform.

I studied Greek and Hebrew in college, Latin in high school. In each the very first night's homework was to memorize the characters and their pronunciation.Multiple ANE cultures used cuneiform (Ugaritic, Akkadian, Sumerian, Hittite, and so on). The time to master each depends on your native language, the target language, and exposure to similar languages. The writing system is not the hard part.

All of the examples you mentioned are derivatives of the Phoenician alphabet, which have around 20 to 30 characters each. Even with case sensitiveness and diacritics, I think they still add up to under a hundred characters.Cuneiform character sets are in the order of magnitude of the several hundreds or even thousands, depending on the language[1], so I imagine that the experience is closer to learning to read Chinese or Japanese and less like Hebrew and Greek.That being said, I've never tried to learn neither cuneiform or hanzi, so I'm just guessing based on the number of characters.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#Sign_inventories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_BatteryThe Baghdad Battery is the name given to an artifact consisting of a ceramic pot, a tube of copper, and a rod of iron fixed together with bitumen. It was discovered in present-day Khujut Rabu, Iraq in 1936,[1][2] close to the ancient city of Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian (150 BC – 223 AD) and Sasanian (224–650 AD) empires, and it is believed to date from either of these periods.[3]Its origin and purpose remain unclear. Wilhelm König, at the time director of the laboratory of the National Museum of Iraq, suggested that the object functioned as a galvanic cell, possibly used for electroplating, or some kind of electrotherapy. There is no electroplated object known from this period, and the claims are universally rejected by archaeologists. An alternative explanation is that it functioned as a container for magic spells for protection, defense or curses.[2]Ten similar clay vessels had been found earlier. Four were found in 1930 in Seleucia dating to the Sassanid period. Three were sealed with bitumen and contained a bronze cylinder, again sealed, with a pressed-in papyrus wrapper containing decomposed fiber rolls. They had been held in place with up to four bronze and iron rods sunk into the ground, and their cult meaning and use are inferred. Six other clay vessels were found nearby in Ctesiphon. Some had bronze wrappers with badly decomposed cellulose fibers. Others had iron nails or lead plates.[2]

There was no "Analytical Engine" in ancient Rome. I don't even know what this could be referring to.As your link mentions, the "Baghdad Battery" was debunked long ago, it's just a jar for storing scrolls.The modern symbology of circuit diagrams was invented in the 20th century.None of those cuneiform structures even work as circuit diagrams.It's coincidence. The Dendera lightbulb isn't a lightbulb either.

Writing systems using cuneiform include Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Hurrian, Ugaritic, Old Persian...The article states that "Prop­er­ly writ­ten out, these syl­la­bles join up into a flow­ing cal­lig­ra­phy that your aver­age, edu­cat­ed Baby­lon­ian would be able to read at a glance", so presumably they're thinking of Akkadian. Why not say so?(Does it make a difference? Consider that our first attempt to read the name of Gilgamesh came out as "Izdubar".)

    How to Write in Cuneiform, the Oldest Known Writing System in the World

The added word being: KNOWNYou can argue that, "well, obviously!" but correctness and exactness are what makes science, history, journalism, etc good, and allowing incorrectness like this is a step backwards.I read a history book when I was a teenager (can't remember which one, unfortunately), and the author wrote a preface that said something along the lines of "Everything in this book is based on the published information I could discover during my research period of April to September 1999. I have chosen to write in absolutes--stating many things as certain and clear--but in reality there is still much we do not know about this time period. No history author should say their writing is fact and any good historian will make it clear that their work is composed of assumptions layered on assumptions. Please read these works with this in mind."If you don't have a preface like that, you should add "known" to your title/sentence! I will argue with someone all day over this! I will die on this hill!

Of course, if you're a fallibilist you believe that it's always possible that you're making a mistake. It seems unnecessary to always add “unless I am mistaken,” because that hedge always applies.

Writing has only been invented independently a few times in history, so it seems reasonable that cuneiform could be the first.

reply

Why do we not see more writing in the archeological record? Maybe agrarian societies both motivate writing and are required to provide the free time to invent it? Or perhaps it was written on media that's subject to decay? If some society developed writing on tree bark 100,000 years ago, none of that is going to survive and we'd never know.

How to Write in Cuneiform, the Oldest Known (by the author) Writing System on Earth, the third planet from the Sun in the Milky Way galaxy, as of 2025 as long as you're a human without a major disability that would prevent you from using these techniques or are at least a being with similar hands and arms also able to obtain the necessary materials and can read and comprehend modern English if you aren't too busy doing other things and expect to live long enough to complete the taskYou often get nitpickers going after some small technically correct detail which may be true but no reasonable person in the intended audience would ever actually need to be told.  No one reading the original title would assume that the author had omniscient knowledge of the whole human history of writing beyond present archaeological fact and this doesn't need to be pointed out.

You might want a superfast M.2 SSD for gaming or booting Windows on your PC, but what if you just want the most economical storage solution possible? Seagate's BarraCuda range is synonymous with massive storage at low cost, and right now you can score its 24TB version for just $249 at Newegg, the cheapest this drive has ever been, and $10 less than the last time we highlighted it. 

With 7200 RPM speeds, this is a capacity-over-performance play, but a huge HDD like this is a great solution for those who just want to get as much storage as possible without paying a premium.

While we have previously reviewed the Seagate Barracuda 8TB HDD, the 24TB version, which is faster and doesn't use SMR tech, isn't a fair comparison. While not our favorite HDD by any stretch, you'll struggle to find this much storage for $249 anywhere else. To give you an idea, this is six times the capacity of a similarly priced 4TB M.2 SSD, and should be considered an economy-of-scale purchase accordingly.

The 24TB edition of the Seagate BarraCuda HDD is available at Newegg for $249. This is an excellent option for anyone looking to expand their storage capacity without incurring significant costs. It operates at 7200 RPMs and can achieve transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s.

As noted, a 7200 RPM HDD isn't a drive for those who want speed and performance, but the transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s — and SATA 6GB/s connectivity — are respectable enough given the capacity.

The Seagate BarraCuda line is generally reliable, and crucially, this drive (unlike the aforementioned 8TB model) uses Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology as opposed to Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR), avoiding some of the pitfalls of the latter. You'll also get a two-year limited warranty.

Reflection AI, a startup founded just last year by two former Google DeepMind researchers, has raised $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation, a whopping 15x leap from its $545 million valuation just seven months ago. The company, which originally focused on autonomous coding agents, is now positioning itself as both an open source alternative to closed frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, and a Western equivalent to Chinese AI firms like DeepSeek.

The startup was launched in March 2024 by Misha Laskin, who led reward modeling for DeepMind's Gemini project, and Ioannis Antonoglou, who co-created AlphaGo, the AI system that famously beat the world champion in the board game Go in 2016. Their background developing these very advanced AI systems is central to their pitch, which is that the right AI talent can build frontier models outside established tech giants.

Along with its new round, Reflection AI announced that it has recruited a team of top talent from DeepMind and OpenAI, and built an advanced AI training stack that it promises will be open for all. Perhaps most importantly, Reflection AI says it has “identified a scalable commercial model that aligns with our open intelligence strategy.”

Reflection AI's team currently numbers about 60 people — mostly AI researchers and engineers across infrastructure, data training, and algorithm development, per Laskin, the company's CEO. Reflection AI has secured a compute cluster and hopes to release a frontier language model next year that's trained on “tens of trillions of tokens,” he told TechCrunch.

“We built something once thought possible only inside the world's top labs: a large-scale LLM and reinforcement learning platform capable of training massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models at frontier scale,” Reflection AI wrote in a post on X. “We saw the effectiveness of our approach first-hand when we applied it to the critical domain of autonomous coding. With this milestone unlocked, we're now bringing these methods to general agentic reasoning.”

MoE refers to a specific architecture that powers frontier LLMs —  systems that, previously, only large, closed AI labs were capable of training at scale. DeepSeek had a breakthrough moment when it figured out how to train these models at scale in an open way, followed by Qwen, Kimi, and other models in China.

“DeepSeek and Qwen and all these models are our wake-up call because if we don't do anything about it, then effectively, the global standard of intelligence will be built by someone else,” Laskin said. “It won't be built by America.”

Laskin added that this puts the U.S. and its allies at a disadvantage because enterprises and sovereign states often won't use Chinese models due to potential legal repercussions.

“So you can either choose to live at a competitive disadvantage or rise to the occasion,” Laskin said. 

American technologists have largely celebrated Reflection AI's new mission. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, posted on X: “It's great to see more American open source AI models. A meaningful segment of the global market will prefer the cost, customizability, and control that open source offers. We want the U.S. to win this category too.”

Clem Delangue, co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face, an open and collaborative platform for AI builders, told TechCrunch of the round, “This is indeed great news for American open-source AI.” Added Delangue, “Now the challenge will be to show high velocity of sharing of open AI models and datasets (similar to what we're seeing from the labs dominating in open-source AI).”

Reflection AI's definition of being “open” seems to center on access rather than development, similar to strategies from Meta with Llama or Mistral. Laskin said Reflection AI would release model weights — the core parameters that determine how an AI system works — for public use while largely keeping datasets and full training pipelines proprietary.

“In reality, the most impactful thing is the model weights, because the model weights anyone can use and start tinkering with them,” Laskin said. “The infrastructure stack, only a select handful of companies can actually use that.”

That balance also underpins Reflection AI's business model. Researchers will be able to use the models freely, Laskin said, but revenue will come from large enterprises building products on top of Reflection AI's models and from governments developing “sovereign AI” systems, meaning AI models developed and controlled by individual nations.

“Once you get into that territory where you're a large enterprise, by default you want an open model,” Laskin said. “You want something you will have ownership over. You can run it on your infrastructure. You can control its costs. You can customize it for various workloads. Because you're paying some ungodly amount of money for AI, you want to be able to optimize it as much as much as possible, and really that's the market that we're serving.”

Reflection AI hasn't yet released its first model, which will be largely text-based, with multimodal capabilities in the future, according to Laskin. It will use the funds from this latest round to get the compute resources needed to train the new models, the first of which the company is aiming to release early next year.

Investors in Reflection AI's latest round include Nvidia, Disruptive, DST, 1789, B Capital, Lightspeed, GIC, Eric Yuan, Eric Schmidt, Citi, Sequoia, CRV, and others.

This week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law new legislation that will give Californians the ability to easily opt out of digital data collection with a simple portal that should apply to all websites in their browser. The move promises to make the state's digital privacy protections that much easier to take advantage of, and could set a new precedent for future privacy regulations.

In a press release shared this week, Newsom's office announced the passage of two new laws, SB 361 and AB 566, that will strengthen the state's landmark California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA, created in 2018, notably gave state residents the ability to request that companies share with them—but also delete—information that had been collected about them as part of their business practices.

The passage of the CCPA was a big deal, but, as is often the case with landmark legislation, its execution has left something to be desired. While the CCPA did, indeed, force companies—for the first time—to give web users a certain amount of control over their data, the mechanisms by which that control can be exerted have always been quite imperfect.

In other words, loopholes in the law have created a situation in which every single time a web user visits a website, they are forced to go through the annoying process of selecting their privacy preferences. In some cases, companies have capitalized on this process by making it confusing or difficult to navigate, thus tilting the scales in their favor.

Now, however, due to the passage of AB 566, Californians should—theoretically—be able to opt out of all data collection via a simple portal made available through their web browser. The legislation “helps consumers exercise their opt-out rights” under the CCPA by “requiring browsers to include a setting to send websites an opt-out preference signal to enable Californians to opt out of third-party sales of their data at one time instead of on each individual website,” Newsom's press release states.

This is a great step towards giving web users more control over their data, although—given that the bill was just passed into law—it's not yet clear how the regulation will manifest for consumers. Hopefully, it will be as easy as checking a box in your browser.

The legislation puts California miles ahead of the rest of the country when it comes to digital privacy enforcement. In recent years, the state has also taken strides towards improving its ability to police and punish companies for infringing upon this law. Currently, enforcement is operated through the state Attorney General's office. This year, a number of companies—including a tractor company and a health information publisher—were fined upwards of a million dollars for alleged CCPA violations. However, in 2020, the state also approved the creation of a new agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency (or CPPA—which has been dubbed the nation's first “privacy police”), which is tasked with administering and implementing the CCPA.

Also signed into law this week was SB 361, which is designed to strengthen California's already existing data broker registry. The law will give consumers “more information about the personal information collected by data brokers and who may have access to consumers' data,” Newsom's office said.

Here's a new element of the East Coast vs. West Coast beef: The City of New York is reaching across the country to sue tech giants headquartered in California over allegations that their platforms have created a youth mental health crisis. The city, along with its school districts and health department, alleges that “gross negligence” on the part of Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance has gotten kids hooked on social media, which has created a “public nuisance” that is placing a strain on the city's resources.

In a 327-page complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the city alleges that tech companies have designed their platforms in a way that seeks to “maximize the number of children” using them, and have built “algorithms that wield user data as a weapon against children and fuel the addiction machine.” The city also alleges that these companies “know children and adolescents are in a developmental stage that leaves them particularly vulnerable to the addictive effects of these features,” but “target them anyway, in pursuit of additional profit.”

The claims that social media is addictive to underage users aren't necessarily new. New York state, in fact, is part of a coalition of states that have sued social media companies for allegedly exploiting young users. But the New York City suit does bring some unique and jurisdiction-specific information. It cites data from the New York City Police Department, for instance, that show at least 16 teens have died while “subway surfing”—riding outside of a moving train—a dangerous behavior which the lawsuit claims has been encouraged by social media trends. Two girls, ages 12 and 13, died earlier this month while subway surfing.

It also cited survey data collected from New York high school students, which shows that 77.3% of the city's teens spend three or more hours per day on screens, which it claims has contributed to lost sleep and, in turn, absences from school—corroborated by the city's school districts, which provided data to show that 36.2% of all public school students are considered chronically absent, missing at least 10% of the school year.

According to Reuters, this lawsuit from New York City is part of a larger effort by other governments to hold social media firms accountable. There are more than 2,050 similar lawsuits in litigation. The city withdrew a previous lawsuit, announced by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024, to join this wider effort in federal court. By doing so, New York City immediately becomes one of the largest plaintiffs, with a population of 8.48 million and nearly two million residents under the age of 18.

“These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works, and the allegations are simply not true. YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports, to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends,” José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, told Gizmodo. “We've also developed dedicated tools like Supervised Experiences for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.”

Gizmodo reached out to Meta, Snap, and ByteDance for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

NASA employees are bracing for layoffs and budget cuts as the congressional dispute over government funding drags on, threatening several crucial space missions—including some that are already in space.

Earlier this week, hundreds of space advocates met with Congress to try and salvage NASA's funding, according to The Planetary Society. The White House's proposed budget for 2026, released in May, would reduce NASA's funding by $6 billion compared to 2025. Under that proposal, NASA's science budget would drop from $2.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Meanwhile, the fate of almost 40 NASA missions is unknown, after Congress on September 30 failed to agree on a deal to keep the federal government funded for the fiscal year 2026.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed that layoffs were imminent this month, although it is unclear how many workers might be affected, according the Los Angeles Times. The federally funded research center in La Cañada Flintridge, California has already endured two rounds of layoffs that impacted 855 of its employees.

Yet despite the government shutdown, NASA is still focused on sending astronauts to the Moon. “NASA would continue to support Artemis operations during any funding lapse,” the agency wrote in a statement prior to the shutdown. The agency is deep in preparations for its next Artemis mission—Artemis 2—which is set to launch a a four-person crew on a journey around the Moon and back in February 2026.

NASA's ground teams will also continue to operate its current science missions. “If a satellite mission is in the operations phase, we will maintain operations that are essential to ensure the safety of that satellite and the data received from it.”

But not all its spacecraft are accounted for. NASA's Juno mission, launched in 2011 to study Jupiter and its moons, surpassed its latest extension deadline during the shutdown and it's not clear whether the spacecraft is still operational. The mission faces the threat of cancellation under the White House's proposed budget, and although it hasn't been officially chopped, its funding has been cut. It remains unclear whether Juno will survive this.

NASA's OSIRIS-APEX mission, on the other hand, has been saved, Ars Technica reported. A follow-on mission to OSIRIS-REx that's currently on its way to study an asteroid, Apophis, lawmakers have set aside $20 million for the mission to continue, although the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate are yet to agree on a final budget. OSIRIS-APEX was one of 19 operational missions threatened to be shut down under Trump's proposed budget.

We still don't know exactly how much funding NASA will have available for each of its science missions going forward. Earlier in September, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee expressed support for several NASA missions under threat by the proposed budget cuts. The House's commerce, justice, and science budget bill, which allocates funding to federal agencies like NASA, secured more than $24.8 billion for NASA. That's around the same amount the agency received in 2024 and 2025, but much higher than the administration's proposed $18.8 billion for 2026.

The committee adopted amendments to a report accompanying the bill, adding the New Horizons mission exploring the Kuiper Belt, Juno, and a series of lower-cost robotic missions to Mars as part of the bill. The report did not, however, allocate a specific amount of funds to go toward these missions, but it did indicate the committee's overall support.

The last government shutdown in 2018 lasted for 35 days. It's still not clear how long the ongoing shutdown will last. That means it could be days or weeks until the fate of many of NASA's most critical space-faring missions becomes known.

Six months after Lip-Bu Tan began his quest to turn around struggling Intel, the semiconductor giant has announced a major hardware upgrade.

On Thursday, Intel unveiled a new processor, codenamed Panther Lake. This marks the next generation of the company's Intel Core Ultra processor family and is the first chip built using Intel's 18A semiconductor process.

The processors are expected to begin shipping later this year and are being produced at Intel's Chandler, Arizona, Fab 52 facility, which came online in 2024.

“We are entering an exciting new era of computing, made possible by great leaps forward in semiconductor technology that will shape the future for decades to come,” Tan said in a company press release. “Our next-gen compute platforms, combined with our leading-edge process technology, manufacturing, and advanced packaging capabilities, are catalysts for innovation across our business as we build a new Intel.”

Separately, Intel also previewed its Xeon 6+, codenamed Clearwater Forest, which is the company's first 18A-based server processor. Intel predicts this will launch in the first half of 2026.

This is the company's largest manufacturing announcement since Tan took over as Intel's CEO in March. In his first few weeks, Tan made clear he would refocus the company on its core businesses and restore its engineering-first culture.

The announcement also emphasizes the 18A semiconductor's ties to the U.S. The company's press release highlighted that this is the most advanced chip manufacturing process produced domestically.

“The United States has always been home to Intel's most advanced R&D, product design, and manufacturing — and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” Tan said in the release.

The U.S. government took a 10% equity stake in Intel in August just weeks after Tan and President Donald Trump met at the White House to discuss how Intel and the government could work together to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.

TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.

— Denise Mamaril is now Starbucks' vice president of cybersecurity; governance, risk and compliance; and international. 

She was previously at Nordstrom for nearly a decade, leaving the role of senior director of security architecture and engineering.

“I'm thrilled to join a security team I already know and respect for their integrity, deep expertise, and ability to get things done,” Mamaril said on LinkedIn.

Mamaril also worked in leadership roles at williamsworks, Headsprout, and Kaplan.

Last month Starbucks CTO Deb Hall Lefevre reportedly resigned amid layoffs and various tech-related changes at the Seattle-based coffee giant.

— Rob Williams, Amazon's vice president of device software and services and a member CEO Andy Jassy's senior leadership team, announced his retirement and will leave the company at the year's end. The news comes on the heels of Amazon's annual devices and services showcase.

“While this decision has been in the works for quite some time, I wanted to see our amazing 2025 products through to completion, launch Alexa+, and VegaOS — and participate in the fun of Tuesday's product launch event in NYC — before announcing my transition,” Williams said last week on LinkedIn.

Reuters broke the news, citing an internal memo. Panos Panay, senior vice president of devices and services, praised Williams, who has been with the company for 12 years.

“Rob has had a big impact on the software and experiences of nearly all of the products we've created and shipped,” Panay said in the memo.

— In other Amazon news, Alice Shobe, the company's global director of community impact, is stepping down from her role after nearly nine years with the Seattle-based tech giant. Bettina Stix will succeed Shobe.

Shobe is a longtime leader in affordable housing, previously working for nonprofits and the City of Seattle. In her role at Amazon, Shobe addressed housing, education for under-served students, disaster relief and other efforts.

“We brought Amazon's innovation and problem-solving approach to each challenge. Today, our global team of passionate people is driving real change across communities worldwide,” Shobe said on LinkedIn.

Stix has been with Amazon for nearly 27 years, joining the company as an editor in Germany. She has been a manager in the U.S. and Europe and worked in retail development, Prime, product management and community engagement.

Stix is credited with conceiving the idea for Amazon's disaster relief program, which taps the company's expertise in logistics and mobilized employees to respond to emergencies around the globe.

— Seattle Children's announced the appointment of Dr. Christopher Longhurst as its next CEO, effective Jan. 5 of next year.

Longhurst joins the hospital from UC San Diego Health, where he is chief clinical and innovation officer and has worked for more than a decade. He was previously at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford.

“Dr. Longhurst's unique ability to merge clinical operations, research and digital strategy, while enhancing patient safety and quality makes him the right leader to guide Seattle Children's into the future,” Kurt Shintaffer, chair of the hospital's board of trustees, said in a statement.

— Jordan Weitzen is now chief financial officer for Acumatica, the Bellevue, Wash.-based enterprise software giant that was acquired this year by Vista Equity Partners. Weitzen was CFO for Pacvue and FabFitFun and held senior finance roles at NBCUniversal and Hulu.

Weitzen succeeds Wayne Kimber, who is retiring after serving as CFO since 2023. 

“Jordan is a proven finance leader with a track record of building modern, data-driven finance strategies in fast-moving environments,” John Case, CEO of Acumatica, said in a statement. “His breadth of experience and operational discipline will help Acumatica scale while continuing to deliver exceptional value to our community.”

— Padmashree Koneti is chief product officer for Yoodli, a Seattle startup that uses generative AI to analyze speech and offer tips for improving communication skills.

Koneti joins the company from Salesforce subsidiary Tableau, where she was senior vice president of product management for the analytics platform and has worked since 2022. Koneti previously held senior product leadership roles at companies including Limeade, Puppet, eBay, Cisco Systems and others.

“Bringing on a product leader of Padmashree's caliber is a huge validation of both Yoodli's momentum and our vision for the future,” Varun Puri, Yoodli CEO and co-founder, said via email. 

Yoodli, which raised $13.7 million in May, recently hired longtime financial leader Andy Larson as CFO.

— Todd Humphrey is leaving his role as Seattle Kraken founding executive team member and senior vice president of innovation and fan experience after seven years with the NHL team. 

Humphrey just launched Highmark Sports Group, a startup that works with professional sports teams and leagues to bolster their fan engagement.

“I'll always be proud of what we built together, and excited to see where the Kraken go next,” Humphrey wrote on LinkedIn. “As for me, I'm excited to keep building, innovating, and elevating the fan experience — helping sports teams and leagues reach new heights, in Seattle and beyond.”

— Seattle-based Cascadia Capital, an investment bank serving clients globally, named two hires: 

— The University of Washington School of Medicine named Dr. Jennifer (Jen) Davis as director of the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine. Davis is a cellular and molecular physiologist who studies cardiac wound healing and regeneration. She has been with ISCRM since 2015, serving as interim director since 2024. She is also director of the UW Center for Cardiovascular Biology.

— Bensussen Deutsch & Associates, a Woodinville, Wash.-based global marketing company, announced Kelly Bengston as chief operating officer. Bengston held leadership roles at Starbucks for 15 years and joins Bensussen Deutsch & Associates from CKE Restaurants, the parent company for Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, where she briefly served as chief supply chain officer.

— Kartik Talamadupula joined Oracle as a distinguished architect in AI where he will focus is on building scalable foundations for intelligent systems that can reason over enterprise data and automate complex business processes. Talamadupula previously led AI efforts at Wand AI and Symbl. Earlier in his career, Talamadupula worked at IBM for nearly a decade.  

— Sarah Studer is filling in at the University of Washington's Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship as program manager for the Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership program while Winona Kantamaneni is on family leave until June. Studer previously served as assistant director of the Buerk Center and was managing director of Impact Hub Seattle.

— Barbara Hulit has abandoned retirement for a role as senior managing director of the financial firm Blackstone. In 2023, Hulit retired from the Everett, Wash.-based manufacturing company Fortive after nearly seven years. In the new role, she will lead the development of an operating system as well as serving as an operating executive in the Blackstone's industrials space.

The developer behind Eyes Up, one of the many Immigration and Customs Enforcement-related apps removed by Apple in recent days, was busy on Wednesday evening at a local planning session for the nationwide “No Kings” protest, scheduled for later this month. When WIRED eventually reached him by phone, he asked to be only identified by his first name, Mark, for safety reasons. “The administration will act on their grudges,” he says. “And they are not afraid to do so, frequently.”

He should know.

Mark's app, a platform built to serve as a repository for videos and other materials documenting ICE activity, is not alone in getting kicked off Apple's App Store. Earlier in October, ICEBlock was among the first ICE-related apps Apple removed. The decision followed claims from US attorney general Pam Bondi that such tools endanger ICE officers. Apple has also removed other tracking apps—including Red Dot and DEICER—as well as Eyes Up.

Like Mark, ICEBlock's developer, Joshua Aaron, is determined to reverse the app store bans. “While I cannot speak to specifics right now, I can tell you that ICEBlock has an incredible legal team behind it and we are going to do everything in our power to fight this,” Aaron tells WIRED.

Apple did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

Regarding Eyes Up, Mark says he has already appealed Apple's decision to delist the app, twice.“I will appeal every single time they reject me, until it's back in the App Store,” he says. “Because it's pure cowardice, what they're doing. I'm not gonna let off the gas with Apple.”

The ban ignited a fire under Mark, who's performing more community outreach to let people know about Eyes Up and encouraging them to upload publicly documented encounters with ICE agents to the app, which is still currently available on the Google Play store and the Eyes Up website.

Rafael Concepcion, who was previously a professor at Syracuse University, first designed DEICER to be a “rights app,” with the ICE-location map added on as an accountability tool. Concepcion was heavily inspired by musician Peter Gabriel and his WITNESS organization, started in the 1990s, that documented human rights violations. While gone from Apple's App Store, DEICER is also still available via Google Play and a website.

While Apple has not yet commented on its decisions to remove ICE monitoring apps from the App Store, Migrant Insider reported this week that in the case of the DEICER iOS app, the company justified removal under a developer guideline that prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content” toward “religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups.” Google, which has also removed ICE monitoring apps in recent days, told 404 Media last week that it also considers ICE officers to be a vulnerable group.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tools that include a law enforcement monitoring or transparency mechanism are not unprecedented in mobile apps, though. In fact, Apple and Google both develop apps with these features. The driving directions and traffic app Waze—which is owned by Google and can also be downloaded for iOS—has long offered a crowdsourced tool for reporting and receiving alerts about police sightings on public roads. Apple Maps and Google Maps offer similar features.

“I am not in favor of Apple removing ICE-tracking apps from the App Store, nor the app that simply let users archive videos of ICE,” says Riana Pfefferkorn, a policy researcher at Stanford University. “This seems like more needless kowtowing by Tim Cook.” The Apple CEO has appeared at several events with President Donald Trump and reportedly donated $1 million to attend his inauguration.

Legal experts WIRED spoke with say that the ICE monitoring and documentation apps that Apple has removed from its App Store are clear examples of protected speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment. “These apps are publishing constitutionally protected speech. They're publishing truthful information about matters of public interest that people obtained just by witnessing public events,” says David Greene, a civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

This hasn't stopped the Trump administration from attacking the developers behind these ICE-related apps. When ICEBlock first rose to a top spot in Apple's App Store in April, the Trump administration responded by threatening to prosecute the developer. “We are looking at him,” Bondi said on Fox News of ICEBlock's Aaron. “And he better watch out.”

Neither the White House nor ICE immediately responded to requests for comment.

Digital rights researchers say that the situation illustrates the dangers when key platforms and communication channels are centrally controlled—whether directly by governments or by other powerful entities like big tech companies. Regardless of what is officially available through the Google Play store, Android users can sideload apps of their choosing. But Apple's ecosystem has always been a walled garden, an approach that the company has long touted for its security advantages, including the ability to screen more heavily for malicious apps.

For years, a group of researchers and enthusiasts have tried to create “jailbreaks” for iPhones to essentially hack their own devices as a way around Apple's closed ecosystem. Recently, though, jailbreaking has become less common. This is partly the result of advances in iPhone security, but partly related to the trend in recent years of attackers exploiting complex chains of vulnerabilities that could potentially be used for jailbreaking for malware instead, particularly mercenary spyware.

"The closed ecosystem motivation sort of dwindled as Apple added capabilities that previously required a jailbreak—like wallpapers, tethering, better notifications, and private mode in Safari," says longtime iOS security and jailbreak researcher Will Strafach. “But this situation with ICE apps highlights the issue with Apple being the arbiter and single point of failure.”

Stanford's Pfefferkorn warns that while US tech companies are not state-controlled, they have in her view become “happy handmaidens” when it comes to “repressing free speech and dissent.”

“It's especially disappointing,” Pfefferkorn says, “coming from the company that brought us the Think Different ad campaign, which invoked MLK, Gandhi, and Muhammad Ali—none of whom would likely be big fans of ICE today.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon Web Services is launching a new artificial intelligence platform for everyday business users, moving further beyond core cloud infrastructure to compete more directly against Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and AI startups.

The platform, Amazon Quick Suite, was announced Thursday morning. It's a collection of agentic AI tools that can automate tasks by connecting with internal documents and databases, and third-party apps and services.

For example, Amazon says the tools can recap emails, send messages, update project tickets, automate content creation, and build customer strategies, using a company's own data securely and privately. Quick Suite integrates with third-party services like Salesforce for customer data, Zendesk for support tickets, and Slack for team collaboration, according to the company.

One of Amazon's advantages: its ability to test new enterprise tools with its own massive workforce before public release. 

The company said Quick Suite has already been deployed to tens of thousands of Amazon employees — reporting that the tool has reduced complex data analysis tasks from months to minutes, for example, based on internal use.

One of its challenges: Unlike its rivals, Amazon does not own a native productivity suite like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. 

This means it must convince users to adopt its platform as an overlay on top of the tools they already use. It's a big hurdle in a market where its competitors can embed their AI assistants directly into their existing software.

Earlier on Thursday, Google announced a unified Gemini Enterprise AI agent subscription, consolidating its business-focused AI tools.

AWS marketing chief Julia White told Bloomberg that existing customers of the Amazon Q Business AI software, which launched 18 months ago, will be encouraged to migrate to the new platform. White was previously a longtime Microsoft executive. 

Amazon says Quick Suite will be available in two tiers: a Professional plan starting at $20 per user per month, and an Enterprise plan at $40 with advanced features.

Quick Suite includes a few individual tools: 

AWS says it has rolled out the platform to hundreds of corporate beta customers, citing examples of significant cost savings and efficiency improvements.

We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best deals you can still get on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among others, and we're collecting those here for you, live.

The smoke has started to settle after the explosion of hot sales during the Amazon Prime Big Deals Day event, but the deals fires are still at least smoldering as several items remain dramatically marked down as the event winds down. That's not to mention that other retailers, like Newegg and Best Buy, still have their own competing events going on.

We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either. Our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis. This ensures that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is.

We'll continue updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life.

Crucial's P510 is a step down from the company's T710 flagship, but it's still a scorching-fast PCIe 5.0 SSD promising 11 GBps sequential reads and 9.5 GBps writes, plus a five-year warranty. Our review praised the drive for its excellent sustained performance, and it's one of the more affordable Gen5 drives from a well-known brand. 

The Samsung Odyssey G3 G30D features a 24-inch VA panel with an FHD resolution. It can achieve a refresh rate of up to 180 Hz and is AMD FreeSync certified for optimal performance. You get both DisplayPort and HDMI input options alongside an audio jack.

This 27-inch 1080p Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

This compact kit includes all the essential tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx/Torx security, and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer/demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

Our Editor's Choice Award-winning cooler, the Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360, is the best 360mm cooler that money can buy. Right now it's also one of the cheapest thanks to an ongoing sale over at Amazon, where you can score one for just $89.99 instead of the usual $124.99. If you want to add a splash of RGB to your rig, the A-RGB version is just $98, also substantially discounted.

The Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 is a more recent iteration of the Arctic Liquid Freezer III, with improved fans and thermal performance.

This cooler can mount on AM4/AM5 and Intel LGA1851/LGA1700 sockets, with all the included attachment pieces included in the box. Arctic coolers are also known for incorporating an integrated VRM cooling fan into the CPU block.

Get the same cooler with a little RGB flair for just $10 more. 

 




As you can see from our testing, the Freezer III outperforms all of its rivals in testing for cooling, which is why we awarded it five stars and dubbed it the best AIO cooler we've ever tested, bar none. - Stephen Warwick

One of the best PC peripheral deals we saw over Prime Big Deal Days is still live. Right now, you can save 50% on this SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL keyboard, a brilliant bit of kit and one of the best TKL keyboards around.

An all-time low, and half price 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

In our review, this keyboard scored four out of five stars, and the deal was so enticing that our esteemed Editor-in-Chief, Paul Alcorn, actually bought one for himself!

The board comes with a 2.4GHz wireless USB-C dongle, a USB-C extender, and is also Bluetooth 5 compliant. The board also touts up to 40 hours of on-battery use. The company also includes a braided seven-foot USB-C to USB-A cable for charging. - Stephen Warwick

Still on sale and one of the best monitor deals of the week, score this 32-inch Odyssey G3 with a 180Hz refresh rate for just $179 instead of its usual price of $279.99.

This 27-inch 1080p Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

With a DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 input, this is a great FHD 1080p monitor for high-intensity gaming that requires a high refresh rate. While not quite the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model, this is still an excellent deal. There's also a smaller 27-inch and even a 24-inch model if you want to save even more cash. - Stephen Warwick

If you want an 8TB SSD, then the WD_Black SN850X is a beast, offering up more than enough storage for the majority of users. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage.

The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. Make sure to add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to get the total saving.

The SN850X wields the PCIe 4.0 interface, not the newer PCIe 5.0, but that serves up more than enough performance for most casual users. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly.

To get this deal, simply add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to bring the price down to $510.98.

Our favorite microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2 has now dropped to its lowest ever price! Be quick! Grab 1TB of fast storage for your Nintendo Switch 2 and save $62!

The Lexar Play Pro microSD Express 1TB has a transfer speeds up to 900MB/s for read, and 600 MB/s for write which makes it great for storing your downloaded games and other media.

This card is the fastest microSD Express card on the market. The 1TB capacity card massively increases the storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Higher transfer speeds mean up to 900/600 MB/s read/write. But it does command a premium price for the privilege. 

We've tested a plethora of microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 and this Lexar card is our top pick for 1TB!

Bambu's excellent budget 3D printer, the A1 mini, is a tiny 3D printer with great features and a Tom's Hardware Editor's Choice award. On sale over the Prime event at Bambu's own website, you can still score $50 off the $300 MSRP.

This popular compact printer is solidly built with a full-metal linear rail system and bearings, features full auto calibration, vibration and flow-rate compensation, and compatibility with multi-color AMS accessories. 

Work next to the printer without distraction, thanks to the low noise "silent mode" that lets the A1 print at under 48 decibels of noise.  

Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini.

Here's a look at some of the A1 mini's specs, with standout features including automatic bed leveling. If you're looking for your very first foray into the world of 3D printing, you'll struggle to do better! - Stephen Warwick

If you want an excellent, head-turning flash drive with storage aplenty, then you'll struggle to do better than the SK hynix Tube T31. Holder of our best flash drive award currently, it's essentially an M.2 SSD with a USB plug that gets you very speedy data transfers. Still on offer even though Prime Big Deal Days has finished, get one for just $118 instead of the usual $159.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage. - Stephen Warwick

 




If you've been looking for a new wireless gaming keyboard, SteelSeries' Apex Pro TKL Wireless is one of our favorites — it packs plenty of power in a compact form factor, with dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 Hall Effect switches, bright, per-key RGB lighting, and a customizable OLED display in the upper right corner. It also comes with a soft-touch wrist rest that will help keep your wrists and hands aligned and comfortable. And it's currently on sale for just $124.99 at Amazon — 50% off its MSRP of $249.99, and the lowest price we've seen it at.

An all-time low, and half price 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

The  Apex Pro TKL Wireless's linear optical switches feature adjustable actuation (37 levels per key) — which can be adjusted individually across all keys. It sports the ever-popular TKL layout, which means it has all function keys and navigation keys — but no ten-key numberpad, so you'll have plenty of room on your desk for big mouse swipes without having to give up too much keyboard functionality. — Sarah

 




It's not Razer's absolute latest iteration, but the Basilisk V3 Pro is still a solid all-purpose gaming mouse, with Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, 11 programmable buttons, a customizable tilt wheel, and 13 zones of bright RGB lighting. And you can grab it on sale for 35% off at Amazon, where it's now $104 for the black version (was $159.99).

Razer's flagship wireless Basilisk V3 Pro features Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, Gen-3 optical mouse switches, and 13 zones of bright RGB underglow lighting. It gets up to 110 hours of battery life and is compatible with Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle and Mouse Dock Pro.

The Basilisk V3 Pro has been one of our favorite wireless gaming mice since it debuted in April 2023, and for good reason — it's got a great, comfortable, ergonomically-contoured shape that's perfect for hours-long gaming marathons. It has two thumb buttons and a trigger button on the thumb rest, as well as a tilt wheel that can switch between regular notched and free-scrolling mode. Its Focus Pro 30K optical sensor has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 750 IPS, and can handle up to 70 G's of force. — Sarah

 




If you're looking for an audio upgrade for your gaming rig, look no further than the 280W (peak) SteelSeries Arena 9, one of the few 5.1 speaker systems designed specifically for gamers. The Arena 9 carries an MSRP of $679.99, but is currently available for 20 percent off, bringing the price down to $543.99.

These booming speakers bring 5.1 surround to your PC in a big way. They have wireless connectivity for the rear speakers, a lifesaver, and built-in lighting that spruces up your room. This 280W (peak) system also has a full-featured software suite to tailor it to your needs. 

You can definitely pick up on the gaming vibes with the two front speakers, each of which has four-zone RGB lighting that supports Reactive PrismSync. Nothing says "gamer" like some RGB lovin'. The two rear speakers connect wirelessly, providing you with more flexibility in their placement.

There's also a wired control pod that lets you adjust RGB lighting effects, as well as Bluetooth connectivity, along with the usual audio controls like volume and mute. As for connectivity, you can choose from Bluetooth, auxiliary, optical, or USB.

There are still some excellent monitor deals available. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller and more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor.

This 49" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It has a dense resolution of 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate reaching as high as 240Hz. 

This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals that you can still get 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts.

 




There's no better way to instantly up your audio game than by switching from a headset mic to a standalone USB gaming microphone, and now's the perfect time to do it: the HyperX QuadCast S, one of our long-time favorite gaming mics, is currently still on sale at Amazon for $79.99 — a 50% discount off MSRP, and the lowest price we've ever seen it at.

Lowest ever price

HyperX's QuadCast S is the pretty, colorful version of one of our favorite microphones of all time — and it's currently on sale for 50% off. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. 

The QuadCast S features bright, customizable RGB lighting and records sound at 48 kHz / 16-bits. It features four selectable polar patterns — cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, and omnidirectional — so it's great for capturing one person's voice but can also be used to capture multiple voices and/or ambient noise, in a pinch (though you'll still want multiple mics if you're regularly capturing multiple voices). It features on-mic controls, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct, zero-latency monitoring, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute implementation.

If you're not too interested in the customizable RGB lighting, you can also pick up the older QuadCast for the same price — $79.99 — but we'd still recommend the QuadCast S as you can always just change the RGB lighting to red (or turn it off completely). Both the QuadCast S and the QuadCast come with a desktop stand and a handy built-in shock mount, and have great sound profiles out of the box. — Sarah

 




I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a handy tool to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly. Make sure to enter the brand promotion code of O1KPKFEH8IBJ for the extra 10% off.

I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly.

 




Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is still going, which is great because this is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. — Paul Alcorn

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential. — Brandon Hill

Meta is already putting Reels in front and center of the Instagram experience on iPad and on mobile in countries like India and South Korea. Now, to allow more people to consume and understand Reels in different languages, the company is adding support for Hindi and Portuguese to its AI-powered translation feature across Instagram and Facebook, as well. 

The company first launched this feature in August with support for English and Spanish after teasing it at its Meta Connect conference last year. With Hindi and Portuguese support, Meta aims to tap into creators from its biggest markets, like India and Brazil, to have a global reach.

“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don't necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram in August. 

“And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform,” he added.

Users can turn on automatic translation in their preferred language to consume Reels that were originally created in another language. 

Creators can turn on automatic translation for their Reels by turning on the “Translate your voice with Meta AI” option before publishing. They can also select which languages to translate to after reviewing the translated video with automatic dub and lip sync.

Meta said that it is working on new features for AI-powered translation that will roll out soon. Reels on Facebook already support multi-speaker AI-powered translations. Meta said that this feature will be available for creators posting on Instagram soon.

Apart from voice translations, the company is also building a way to translate text or caption stickers posted with Reels in supported languages. Users will be able to select the “Translate text on Reels” option when the feature is rolled out.  This is useful for someone who is watching a video without sound.

What's more, Meta plans to roll out a new voice dubbing feature that will preserve the creator's original voice and tone. The company will also give an option to opt for a new version of lip-syncing that better matches the movement of your mouth. 

Meta's rival YouTube has been working on translation features for a few years now. Last month, the company rolled out lip-sync improvements to its auto-dubbing feature with support for 20 languages.

Two weeks after detailing why the Seattle economy could face ongoing troubles because of layoffs at tech giants Microsoft and Amazon, The Wall Street Journal is back this week with a look at why heading east might be the more attractive option for tech companies and their workers. 

“Tech Companies Can't Get Enough of This Picturesque Seattle Suburb,” WSJ headlined a mostly glowing piece about Bellevue's cleaner streets, better schools, lower crime rate, and rise in new office space that's luring companies such as TikTok, OpenAI, Snowflake and others.

Peter Steinbrueck, a former member of the Seattle City Council, told the WSJ that Seattle's glory days of economic expansion have ended and “the pendulum has swung to the Eastside.”

The Bellevue Chamber of Commerce didn't miss its chance to promote the article in an emailed newsletter this week: “The Wall Street Journal has its sights set on Bellevue, and we don't blame them one bit,” the Chamber wrote. “Our little chunk of techy paradise, it seems as though the rest of the nation is finally catching on to what we all already know: Bellevue frickin' rocks.”

Well, frick. It's the latest iron in the Seattle-vs.-Bellevue fire that's been stoked in recent years by a battle over whether tech workers are better suited working on the east or west side of Lake Washington.

“You can look out the window of our building and see the mountains,” said Warrick Taylor, a Snowflake vice president based in California, who is perhaps unaware that those same views exist in Seattle. 

Snowflake moved more than 700 employees into new office space in Bellevue's Spring District in June.

“Like the airlines say, ‘We know you could have chosen another city, we're glad you chose us,'” Bellevue Mayor Lynn Robinson said while helping to cut the ribbon at Snowflake. 

The mostly friendly beef between the two municipalities has been going on for decades, and up until about seven years ago, it was largely lopsided in Seattle's favor. The Emerald City is where young tech workers needed to be, not just for the jobs and innovation but for the culture.

But in 2018, a rift opened up between Amazon and elected officials in Seattle when the City Council sought to impose a $275-per-employee “head tax” on the tech giant. Since then, Amazon has quickly grown in downtown Bellevue, with new buildings holding 14,000 of a planned 25,000 workers in the city.

While Amazon is promoting a more regional footprint for its headquarters, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell made it clear last month that he thinks Seattle still holds the edge over Bellevue, citing his city's diversity, arts, music, restaurants, and innovative history. He touted Seattle's new waterfront AI House, saying that Bellevue didn't have the idea for the startup hub, Seattle did.

But as Seattle's downtown core has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, with high office vacancy rates and some major retailers exiting, some in Bellevue see an opening. 

“Clean and safe is everything and Seattle is not that,” said Steve Luthman, global head of real estate at Hines, a developer and manager in Bellevue, in the WSJ report.

A professor at Rutgers University who wrote a book about “antifa” almost a decade ago is trying—and struggling—to flee the US for Europe after a weeks-long online campaign against him by far-right influencers was followed by death threats.

Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers who specializes in Spanish history and radicalism, has been a far-right target ever since he published Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook in 2017. But after president Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to designate antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization,” social media posts from far-right figures and a petition promoted by conservative student activists demonized Bray as an “antifa member” who was “supporting terrorist behavior." Dozens of targeted threats followed.

The threats, emailed from anonymous accounts and reviewed by WIRED, included a message that read: “I'll kill you in front of your students.” Another message, with the subject line “your violent rhetoric is under investigation,” listed Bray's home address where he lives with his wife and two young children.

“We made the decision on Saturday [to leave the US] when our home address became known by people who want to do us harm,” says Bray. The professor informed his students on Sunday that he would be moving to Europe as a result of the threats.

But at the airport, after they had already scanned their passports, received boarding passes, checked in their bags, and cleared security, Bray says he and his family were not allowed to board their flight. Upon arrival at their boarding gate, their reservations had suddenly disappeared from the United Airlines system.

"For 20 minutes [United Airlines] couldn't even figure out what had happened,” says Bray. “Then they said that, basically, somehow someone had canceled our reservation, presumably in between checking through and then. I don't know what happened. There are various potential explanations, but I don't think it was a coincidence that it happened to us on that day.”

Bray says that he has been rebooked on flights to Spain. “We're going to try it one more time,” says Bray. “If it doesn't work, then we'll do something else.”

United Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House did not comment and redirected WIRED to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. “We got this from the White House and are trying to get ground truth but are not tracking anything like this from TSA or CBP,” says Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS.

After publishing Antifa, Bray donated half of the profits from the book to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund, a group which supports antifascist activists around the world. He was soon placed on the so-called Professor Watchlist by Turning Point USA (TPUSA), the conservative activist group cofounded by Charlie Kirk. The list, which showcases academics that TPUSA claims are pushing leftist propaganda, has been criticized as a threat to academic freedom.

Antifa is viewed by the Trump administration and many on the right as a dangerous network of violent left-wing activist groups intent on destroying US conservative values. In reality, antifa is not an organization at all, but a broad ideology embraced by antifascist activists around the world.

At the time his book was published, Bray says he did receive some death threats. But it soon blew over: “The difference was that I was renting so no one found my home address, and so it just didn't reach this fever pitch,” says Bray. “But also now I have a family and so that's relevant as well.”

Bray received attention in 2020, as well, when some conservative commentators blamed the protests held over the police killing of George Floyd on antifa. Bray received very little attention from those on the right until Trump issued his antifa executive order on September 22.

“It's manufactured outrage,” says Bray. “Trump is trying to look for a boogeyman and using this kind of nebulous term that is misunderstood in the public eye, a convenient way for him to demonize the left and anyone who opposes his administration.”

Days after the executive order was signed, the Department of Homeland Security published a memo that highlighted the perceived threat from antifa and “antifa-aligned domestic terrorists.”

In the wake of Trump's executive order, far-right influencers once again jumped on Bray after he spoke to media outlets about Trump's order. “I think I ought to visit,” wrote far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos on X, quoting a post about Bray's work at Rutgers. Jack Posobiec, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist who was recently invited by the Republican National Committee to train some poll workers, called Bray a “domestic terrorist professor.”

“The day after the Posobiec tweet, I received a very direct death threat saying that someone was going to kill me in front of my students,” says Bray.

When asked for comment, Posobiec simply repeated the claim he made in his X post. Yiannopoulos did not respond to a request for comment.

Posobiec was one of a number of far-right influencers who attended a White House event on Wednesday where Trump led a roundtable on the supposed rise and danger of antifa. During the event, which was also attended by secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, influencers were invited to share stories about their interactions with antifa.

One speaker, far-right influencer Andy Ngo, has spent years targeting Bray online. He has called him a “financier” of antifa, and has recently posted repeatedly about Bray. “Bray is a financier of antifa and advocates for their violence,” Ngo wrote on X last weekend. Ngo did not respond to a request for comment.

On October 2, Megyn Doyle, the treasurer of TPUSA's Rutgers chapter, launched a Change.org petition with the title: “Remove Antifa financier & Professor, Mark Bray from Rutgers University.” The petition questioned why Rutgers employed a professor who was, the petition claims, “supporting terrorist behavior.”

“We, the students of Rutgers University, are deeply concerned to learn that an outspoken, well-known antifa member, Dr. Mark Bray, is employed by the university,” Doyle wrote in the petition. “Dr. Mark Bray, whom we call Dr. Antifa, wrote the antifa handbook, which is a guideline to what he refers to as “militant anti-fascism.”

Doyle also suggested that Bray's public comments were similar to “the kind of rhetoric that resulted in Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month.” In an update three days after she first posted the petition, Doyle said: "I do not endorse death threats, doxxing, or harassment and would not wish them on anyone, especially Mark Bray."

Two days after the petition launched, Fox News ran a story about it on their website and quoted Doyle. Bray says he refused to provide a comment to Fox News, claiming that at the time the petition had fewer than 100 signatures. At the time of publication the petition had amassed almost 1,000 signatures.

“It seemed to me a bit odd to have a news story about a relatively small Change.org petition,” says Bray. “Fox News was trying to generate a story that would get clicks [and] when the Fox News story came out on Saturday, within a few hours I received another death threat and another threatening email that had my full address in it which very much disturbed me.”

Doyle, TPUSA, and FOX News did not respond to a request for comment.

At that point, Bray says, he and his family made the decision to leave the US and move to Spain. WIRED spoke to Bray on Monday as he was preparing to leave the US, and he said he had just received another death threat that morning, and his address was still getting posted online.

Scores of Bray's former students have jumped to his defense. One of them tells WIRED that his classmates were “disappointed” that he was leaving the US.

“His classes were always very lively and discussion based,” they add, “but due to him having to move to Europe, the class will be asynchronous and no longer have the same quality discussions.”

Bray says the Rutgers administration has been supportive, and says that he met with a dean at the university last week to discuss moving his classes to a different room on campus and taking down the public listing of his classes. As the situation escalated over the weekend, such actions became moot.

“The University is aware of the Change.org petition regarding Professor Mark Bray and Dr. Bray's message to his students,” says Patti Zielinski, a spokesperson for Rutgers. “We are gathering more information about this evolving situation.”

Bray reported the threats to both the Rutgers University Police Department and the police department in the town where he lives. Neither responded to WIRED's requests for comment.

While Bray says he's aware that most people who make threats online never take action, there have been enough recent instances of political violence that he thought it was “better to be safe than sorry” to temporarily relocate to Spain.

Bray, who says he plans to stay in Spain until the end of academic year, made his situation public to fight back against what he sees as a concerted effort to silence anyone who speaks out about the current administration.

“I don't see this as an aberration,” says Bray. “I don't think this is the end, and that's partly why I wanted to [make it public] so people can make more of an effort to plan, take collective action and protect academic freedom and the right to dissent in this country.”

Amid political polarization and uncertain federal research policy, Washington leaders are betting on stability through a unique innovation ecosystem rooted in the state's institutions and businesses.

That was a theme at the 20th anniversary celebration of the Washington State Academy of Sciences, held Tuesday evening at Seattle's Museum of Flight.

Founded in 2005 at the request of then-Gov. Christine Gregoire, WSAS serves as a nonpartisan, independent advisory body modeled after the National Academies, connecting scientists and engineers to policymakers across the state. 

The event doubled as a reflection on two decades of science-based policy advice and a call to action for the future.

“This anniversary really coincides with a tremendous amount of change — change that maybe is unprecedented for those in our lifetime,” said WSAS President Allison Campbell. 

The evening's keynote panel, moderated by Allen Institute CEO Rui Costa, brought together leaders from academia, government, and industry to discuss the future of research and innovation in Washington state.

“When you see such turmoil happening at the national level, capital and leadership and talent are going to gravitate toward places that are stable and that are supportive,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the Washington state Department of Commerce.

Washington state's combination of research universities, private-sector giants, and public institutions gives it an unusually integrated innovation infrastructure.

Nguyen, a former state senator and Microsoft senior program manager, noted his state's deep roots in invention.

“We build shit,” Nguyen said, noting homegrown giants such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon. “That is one of the key things we're really good at.”

He pointed to the legislature's move to establish a regulatory framework distinguishing fusion from fission energy — a change that he said paved the way for Helion Energy, one of the region's hottest startups backed by the likes of SoftBank and Sam Altman, to begin construction on what could become the world's first commercially viable fusion reactor in Wenatchee.

“Our unique value is that we can do things [that] other people think are impossible,” he said. 

Elizabeth Cantwell, the new president of Washington State University, said she has already witnessed that culture firsthand.

“There's nothing more glorious and glittering than being someplace that appreciates building stuff,” said Cantwell, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.

Cantwell, who previously led the Utah State University system, said she's seen “genuinely impactful collaboration” between WSU and the University of Washington — rivals on the football field but partners in various research and education initiatives.

Babak Parviz, a veteran technologist and founder of Seattle mental health startup NewDays, described the region's growing global footprint in artificial intelligence — powered by corporations as well as strong university programs, including the UW's top computer science school.

“We intentionally moved back from Silicon Valley to be here, because we love to be here,” he said.

But Parviz warned that the state's AI boom depends on continued investment in education and research.

“If academia is not there, we're not going to be able to train the workforce that we need in the industry,” said Parviz, a former Amazon executive. “And a lot of the core research that's needed to power the industry is going to go away.”

Washington is facing dual financial pressures with federal research cuts and a massive state budget deficit that is impacting higher education institutions.

Cantwell, who has spent decades overseeing research and innovation teams, emphasized the need to strengthen the pipeline between universities and industry, warning that the traditional model for funding graduate research is breaking down.

She urged companies to create long-term placements for graduate students beyond short-term internships.

“If you are in a company or corporate sector or anything like that, add two to three spots for graduate students,” she said.

Campbell, president of WSAS, said the academy can serve as connective tissue during difficult times.

“In times of change, there's really a lot of opportunity,” she said. “That's when leadership matters most, and that's where an academy such as ours can really rise to the top and provide the leadership to help our state and our nation through these tremendous changes.”

Obsessing isn't just for humans. In a study out today, scientists have found evidence that dogs, too, can become addicted to certain objects—and especially, their favorite toy.

The researchers observed dozens of dogs as they interacted with their most prized toys. About a third of dogs exhibited addiction-like behaviors, such as becoming especially agitated when the toy was kept from them, they found.

These findings might come as no surprise to dog owners. But the researchers say their work is the first to empirically document the phenomenon.

“This is the first scientific study on addictive-like behavior in dogs,” study author Stefanie Riemer, a behavioral biologist from the Messerli Research Institute for Human-Animal Interaction at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, told Gizmodo.

Riemer notes that many pet owners and trainers use a (rather on the nose, it turns out) nickname for dogs that seemingly just can't get enough of their toys: “ball junkies.”

But it's never been clear whether this sort of behavior actually mirrors how addiction manifests in people. “After all, just being highly motivated, or highly aroused or very toy-focused does not imply an addiction,” Riemer notes.

Scientists already knew that it's possible to induce addictive-like behaviors in animals like rats, which has allowed us to better study potential treatments for substance use disorders or other addictions in humans. But it's still an open question as to whether animals besides humans can develop addictions naturally, the authors said.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers tried to apply the criteria we use to determine addiction in humans to dogs.

The study involved 105 dogs, with the most common breeds being Malinois, Border Collies, and Labrador Retrievers. All of the dogs were described as toy-motivated by their owners. For the experiments, the researchers used toys the owners said their dogs would likely love the most, and also included the dog's favorite toy at home if the owners brought it with them.

Across all the tests, the researchers found that 33 dogs exhibited addictive-like behaviors with the toys. These behaviors included dogs staying laser focused on the toy if it was kept in the room but placed somewhere unreachable; dogs refusing to play with their owner in other ways; and even dogs turning down a free treat.

“This could indicate that the high motivation for playing conflicts with other important activities—the dogs are willing to forgo other activities or rewards when they are focused on the toy, even when they cannot access it,” Riemer explained. “It shows that the toys have a high salience for these dogs and that they are craving access to these toys.”

Perhaps the most illustrative example of addictive-like behavior was seen when the toys were entirely removed, she added. Some dogs were simply unable to calm down for up to 15 minutes after the toys were gone, their heart rates remaining elevated. That sort of prolonged arousal and high frustration seen in these dogs, Riemer said, suggests their motivation for toy playing could be considered “excessive and maladaptive”—an important criteria for diagnosing human addiction.

The team's findings were published Thursday in Scientific Reports. A video of one of the dogs in these tests can be seen below and on YouTube.

The researchers say their findings should be taken with some caution. It's hard to accurately measure and classify addiction in people, let alone non-verbal animals. And there's still much to learn about the potential nature of addiction in dogs.

One important lingering question is exactly how and why these behaviors can emerge. The researchers found some evidence that the seeds for excessive toy-playing tend to show up in puppies. They're also conducting a follow-up study examining whether certain breeds, particularly some kinds of working dogs, are more predisposed to toy addiction than others. Because this study focused on dogs already known to be toy-motivated, though, it's not clear just how prevalent addictive-like behaviors are in dogs generally.

All that said, Riemer doesn't want owners to overly worry about their dogs if they simply love playing with their toys in healthy amounts.

“Many dogs colloquially referred to as ‘ball junkies' are just highly motivated, but they have no problems when the play is stopped,” she said. “I think toy play is a great reward for many dogs, but for the ‘extreme' dogs, steps should be taken to reduce their fixation on toys.”

Riemer is now working on a grant to explore ADHD in dogs, since it seems to have lots of parallels with addictive-like behaviors in their research. Other studies have also suggested dogs might be a good model for better understanding ADHD in people.

I've been hitting the “it's a bad time to be into VR” note a lot lately, and, sorry ya'll, I stand by that stance… but maybe not for long. As discouraging as this year has been for VR enthusiasts (Meta barely mentioned the Quest at its annual Connect dev conference), Valve might swoop in sooner than you think to give VR hardware a shred of hope or at least a little bit of excitement.

According to a report for XR Institute (a Chinese analyst group that I've cited before for accurate forecasts on smart glasses), Valve's long-rumored “Deckard” headset is finally entering mass production, with a chance that it could be available before the end of the year. XR Institute says that it expects Valve to launch Deckard (an internal codename for the headset) during the holiday season with a starting yearly production of about 400,000 to 600,000 units. That's about the initial Vision Pro release levels of stock and certainly much more encouraging than rumors about Samsung's Project Moohan, which suggest a launch in South Korea only to start.

While Deckard's existence is from news, its imminent arrival is a big deal, not just because of Valve's success in the hardware space with the Steam Deck, but because of the de-emphasis of VR by other major players in the space. Apple is reportedly deprioritizing a cheaper Vision Pro to focus on smart glasses, while Meta already started that same train by launching three new pairs of smart glasses and zero new VR/XR headsets.

While this might not be a shining moment for VR writ large, I like the prospects of a Valve-made VR headset. While other companies like Apple and most likely Samsung tend to take a more scattershot approach to XR/VR, incorporating work and communication, I expect Valve to focus more on gaming and less on the other stuff, which… is a good thing. I'm not saying there aren't cool or fun experiences to be had outside of gaming in an XR/VR headset, but entertainment (games in particular) is still the most compelling of those experiences.

Don't get me wrong, the audience for VR games is niche, even despite the ascendence of VR headsets over the last five years, but it seems to me that the people who use headsets the most are the ones who are more deeply invested in playing games in them. VR gaming enthusiasts' response to Valve's headset is still dependent on a lot of things, though, price chief among them. Rumors from earlier this year have suggested Deckard could cost around $1,000, which is notably a lot more expensive than the Quest 3 and even more so than the Quest 3S, but still well under the $3,500 Vision Pro.

To justify that price, I assume Valve will have to lean into its display tech, offering better resolution and probably better performance than competitors like the Quest 3 and 3S. A lighter headset would be a nice perk, but I'm not sure what Valve will have to offer on the front, if anything. SteamOS in VR seems like an obvious opportunity here, though, again, I'm not sure anyone will be rushing out to buy a new VR headset just for the UI. There's still a lot we don't know about Deckard, so it's hard to say for sure whether it'll be the jolt of excitement VR fans are pining for, but at least (between Project Moohan and Deckard) there's something to look forward to.

It's a fairly safe bet that on any given day, at least a good dozen IT departments are trying to convince their bosses and/or users about the vital importance of backups. Unfortunately, it seems that the argument was lost in the South Korean government, as the institution has completely lost the sizable amount of 858 terabytes of data, with 0 bytes of backups.

The event happened on September 26 and was caused by a battery fire at the National Information Resources Service datacenter in Daejeon, burning up 384 battery packs, the majority of one floor, and taking down 96 government systems. While 95 of those had backups, the G-Drive system (no relation to Google Drive), used primarily but not only by the Ministry of Personnel Management, did not.

In total, it's estimated that roughly 17% of central government officials are affected, and roughly eight years' worth of data was lost. The fire promptly brought down government email, online post office, websites, complaints and petition services, and even the national 119 emergency service. A full recovery should take about a month, as reportedly the affected teams are having trouble even figuring out which specific data was lost. As of October 4, it was estimated that only 17.8% of services were back online.

While a datacenter fire is an event that can happen anywhere at any time, it's more than a little puzzling to find that the G-Drive data was lost because, according to an unnamed source, "[it] couldn't have a backup due to its large capacity."

858 terabytes is a big number for a household, but barely registers in the scale of datacenter storage, where entire petabytes are doled out like candy. This fact is even stranger, as South Korea is seen as a highly technologically advanced country, being the home of Samsung and other conglomerates known as chaebol.

G-Drive is a document sharing platform, similar to Google Drive. Each employee's default quota on the system was 30 GB, and users were instructed to keep their data there instead of in the office computers, as should be the policy everywhere... when there are backups. There's also a certain irony in the fact that the more vintage systems were then ones whose data survived.

While the fire itself apparently caused no casualties, one government worker overseeing the data recovery sadly took his own life by jumping off the Central Building in Sejong's Government Complex on October 3. Four people have been arrested in connection with the fire, reportedly under suspicion of criminal negligence.

OpenAI will be among the first to get these accelerators.

Compute chiplets of AMD's next-generation Instinct MI450-series accelerators based on the CDNA 5 architecture set to be introduced in the second half of next year will be made on TSMC's N2 (2nm-class) fabrication technology, marking the first time the company will use a leading-edge manufacturing process for AI GPUs. Usage of the latest production node could give AMD a major advantage when competing against Nvidia's upcoming Rubin GPUs and systems on their base, which are set to be made on N3.

"We are really excited about our MI450 generation, it has 2nm technology, so the most advanced fabrication capability, it has rack scale solutions, so we are really putting all of these compute elements together," Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, revealed in an interview with Yahoo Finance. "The way to think about it is it takes a village to build this all. So, you know, we are of course very, you know, proud and focused." 

AMD's current-generation CDNA 4-based Instinct MI350-series AI accelerators use compute chiplets produced by TSMC using one of its proven N3-series fabrication technologies (which entered mass production in late 2022), so it is reasonable for the company to transit to a 2nm-class manufacturing process for its next-generation GPUs for AI and HPC applications. AMD's Instinct MI450-series accelerators will be the company's first processors tailored specifically for AI and, therefore, support appropriate data formats and instructions. Perhaps, a new node will enable AMD to pack in some secret sauce into its new compute GPUs. 

Indeed, N2 promises tangible — as TSMC calls them 'full node' — improvements compared to predecessors, such as a 10% to 15% performance improvement at the same power or complexity, or a 25% to 30% power reduction at the same frequency, along with a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E. The key advantage of the new production node will be gate-all-around (GAA) transistors that enable developers to tailor designs for maximum efficiency when using design and technology co-optimization (DTCO). Overall, by migrating to N2, AMD will obtain a broad set of benefits that include performance efficiency and transistor density.

Nvidia has already announced that its next-generation Rubin GPUs will be produced using one of TSMC's N3 technologies (presumably N3P tailored for Nvidia's needs), so AMD's Instinct MI450 will have an edge over its key rival when it comes to manufacturing process. AMD's Helios rack-scale solution with 72 Instinct MI450 GPUs will also carry more HBM4 memory (51TB vs 21TB) and offer more memory bandwidth (1,400 TB/s vs 936 TB/s) compared to Nvidia's Rubin-based NVL144 machine. However, Nvidia's next-generation rack-scale solution will offer tangibly higher FP4 (well, NVFP4) performance compared to AMD's Helios (3,600 PFLOPS vs 1,440 PFLOPS), so it remains to be seen which of the systems will be faster and more power efficient, especially given uncertainties with UALink scale-up interconnections for the Instinct MI450-series GPUs. 

One of the first customers to adopt AMD's Instinct MI450 is said to be OpenAI, which will start to get the hardware in the second half of next year, with AMD revenue ramping sharply afterward. The project will unfold over multiple phases and should generate double-digit billions in incremental sales once fully operational, according to Su. For AMD, the alliance signifies validation of years of investment in its AI architectures and data center solutions.

NASA has grown extremely dependent on its commercial partners in the past few years, outsourcing the development of almost all of its spacecraft and missions so that it can, so the theory goes, save some of that sweet federal money.

But it seems this bargain might not be paying off, after all. In a paper published recently in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, researchers revealed that NASA's commercial partnerships are not necessarily more cost-effective than if the agency had built the spacecraft itself.

The findings come as NASA faces severe budget cuts and massive layoffs that threaten several of its most ambitious and successful missions—while the private space industry continues to grow.

NASA has been outsourcing its spacecraft and scientific instruments for decades. And in the last decade, it has become particularly dependent on Elon Musk's SpaceX. The agency uses SpaceX's Falcon rockets to launch many of its missions, and it relies on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport both cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA is also hoping to use SpaceX's still-in-development Starship to make its ambitious plans to return to the Moon and establish a permanent base there, the Artemis missions, a reality

Winding the clock back to the Apollo era and earlier, however, the agency built, owned, and operated almost all of its rockets and capsules. Project Mercury, NASA's first human spaceflight program which ran from 1961 to 1963, used spacecraft built in-house, and the same was true for the Apollo program to send astronauts to the Moon—still the only successful human missions to reach our natural satellite. NASA was also hugely involved in the design and development of the Space Shuttle fleet, the first reusable spacecraft that could transport cargo to orbit and back.

It wasn't until the shuttle program ended in 2011 that NASA really began looking to industry to build its spacecraft for a fixed price. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing all bid for a chance to build spacecraft that would transport NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Other companies like Lockheed Martin built NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, as well as its Mars Reconnoissance Orbiter, while Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines, and Firefly Aerospace have all designed lunar landers to transport the agency's payloads to the Moon.

The new paper looked at 69 projects, including 22 spacecraft built by NASA, and 47 by industry. It revealed two major findings: First, commercial space companies do excel at building low-cost, mass-manufactured spacecraft that don't require too much specialization. They are also slightly more efficient at building low-risk satellites than NASA.

Second, and perhaps more controversially, when it comes to larger, high-impact and flagship science missions like OSIRIS-REx, industry players tend to run into the same constraints as the agency. In other words, they are just as inefficient as NASA, if not more so. These missions, the report suggests, are likely better off built in-house, by NASA. If nothing else, they are no cheaper when outsourced to industry, the analysis finds.

The research is compelling. But as the Trump administration continues to slash NASA's budget and staff, it seems unclear what, if any, learnings the agency might take from the findings—especially as its core, flagship science missions, including Artemis, remain under such clear threat of funding cuts.

Just don't call it Celestial

As part of its recent Tech Tour US event, Intel took the wraps off its trio of upcoming Panther Lake SoCs. It also walked us through the improvements and expected performance of its new Xe3 graphics architecture, which is coming to market in the form of two integrated GPU tiles for Panther Lake. For more details on the three primary configurations of Panther Lake SoCs, as well as a more general overview of Panther Lake's CPU resources, check out our dedicated article. 

First things first: Intel emphasized that Xe3 is not based on the Celestial architecture, even though its name conveniently maps to that codename's place in Intel's past roadmaps. Let us repeat: this is not Celestial. Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products. Therefore, it will include Panther Lake iGPUs under the Arc B-series umbrella. The company admits this naming scheme isn't ideal, but it appears to be the least worst option for the time being.

Indeed, once you start digging into the changes Intel highlights for Xe3, you'll see that it's more of a continuous improvement of the existing Battlemage architectural lineage than an all-new design. The next "clean" generational leap will come with Xe3P Arc GPUs, but it's unclear when those parts will arrive. Intel was understandably mum about Xe3P products during the Panther Lake event.

The basic Xe3 Xe Core (henceforth Xe3 Core) keeps the same basic layout of Xe2: eight Xe Vector Engines for floating-point and integer math, eight XMX engines for acceleration of matrix math for AI applications, and one ray-tracing unit. Intel says the changes within Xe3 are meant to improve two pain points: better utilization of available resources, an ongoing project for Arc GPUs, and making the architecture more scalable, which is important for building larger and higher-performance products.

The prior Xe2 render slice included up to four Xe Cores, from which graphics processors as small as Lunar Lake's iGPU (two render slices) and as large as the Arc B580 (five render slices) were all constructed.

 




The Xe3 render slice, on the other hand, starts with six Xe Cores, and it's been used to make two iGPUs so far.

 




The headliner is the two-render-slice, 12 Xe3 Core part that will power gaming, content creation, and AI workloads in the highest-performance variant of the Panther Lake SoC.

The other is a four-Xe3-Core part that provides graphics functionality on lower-end Panther Lake products.

Observant readers may be wondering why, given that an Xe3 render slice starts with six Xe Cores, the smaller Xe3 GPU on Panther Lake only includes four Xe Cores. Intel has always maintained a level of fine-grained control over the size of its graphics engines (stretching well into the pre-Arc days) to meet various product demands, so even if Xe3 starts with six Xe Cores per render slice, it's no surprise that it can be scaled down.

Intel says each Xe3 Xe Core can keep up to 25% more threads in flight - from eight to 10 - versus its predecessor, and the core can variably allocate partitions of each Xe Vector Engine's register file per thread in order to achieve better utilization.

Variable register allocation is truly new to Xe3. Previous Arc GPUs used a coarser per-thread register allocation strategy that posed challenges for fully utilizing the core's available resources. Intel says this is a key improvement in the Xe3 architecture and says that it has "dramatic effects on performance."

One of Xe3's other big structural changes — at least for an Arc iGPU — is an increase in shared local memory per Xe core. Xe3 now includes 256KB of shared local memory, up from 192KB in Xe2 on Lunar Lake and the improved Xe-LPG architecture on Meteor Lake. Intel says that workloads spilling out of this shared local memory is a major reason for performance pitfalls on older Arc iGPUs, so adding more of it is a sensible and relatively simple architectural refinement with a major performance payoff.

It's worth noting that this change simply brings Xe3 iGPUs in line with the basic resources offered by desktop Xe2 products. The Arc B580 and B5700 already had 256KB of local memory per Xe Core, so don't expect performance miracles from this increase. The fact that Intel is adding more local memory here probably shows that the size of this structure on Battlemage discrete GPUs was the right decision and one worthy of carrying through the Arc B-series graphics stack.

More big changes occur further out in the cache hierarchy. In its largest 12-Xe-Core configuration, Panther Lake's Arc GPU now sports 16MB of shared L2 cache, double that of Lunar Lake's eight-Xe-Core graphics engine. This is an absolutely massive L2 for a GPU of this size; the Arc B580, by comparison, only sports 18MB (or 12.5% more) L2 for a chip with 67% more Xe Cores to feed.

 




Intel says a larger L2 cache reduces traffic on Panther Lake's on-package fabric that connects the graphics processor to main memory - an important consideration for an integrated graphics processor that might be contending with a CPU and NPU for access to RAM. Intel showed a chart claiming anywhere from a 17% to 36% reduction in fabric traffic compared to a product with an 8MB L2 as a baseline.

 




Xe3 also features a number of smaller, but still important, refinements. Xe2's ray tracing engine allows for asynchronous evaluation of ray-triangle intersection, but the results of those tests have to be resolved in order. That responsibility falls to a thread sorting unit that could previously cause backups in the ray-tracing pipeline. Intel says the improved ray tracing engine in Xe3 can dynamically slow down dispatch of new rays while the sorting unit catches up to work in flight.

Intel also increased the performance of a cache called the Unified Return Buffer, or URB, which is a means of passing data between functional units on the GPU. The company equipped the Xe3 URB with a new management agent that can make partial updates to this buffer without requiring a full flush for each context switch, lowering the cost of cross-functional-unit communication.

Xe3 also includes improvements to fixed-function hardware in order to improve performance in some common graphics tasks. The company says to expect up to 2x the anisotropic filtering rate, and up to a 2x improvement in stencil test rate.

 




In a range of proprietary microarchitectural benchmarks versus the Xe2 GPU on Lunar Lake, you can see that the performance of the 12 Xe3 Core GPU in some operations hasn't changed between Xe2 and Xe3, simply because the available resources per render slice haven't grown. Intel demonstrates that some other operations have scaled linearly with the 50% increase in Xe Cores from Lunar Lake to Panther Lake's 12 Xe configuration.

Operations like ray-triangle intersection tests, anisotropic filtering, mesh rendering, and scattered reads from memory, start to demonstrate microarchitectural as well as scaling improvements in Xe3; they all enjoy 2x or better speedups relative to Xe2.

For shaders that place a large amount of pressure on registers, Xe3's dynamic register allocation can deliver anywhere from 1.9x to 3.1x faster performance in Intel's internal microbenchmarks. Depth testing operations—an incredibly important and fundamental part of the modern render pipeline—enjoy anywhere from a 1.9x to an incredible 7.4x speedup.

Intel isn't talking about detailed specs like clock speeds for Xe3 GPUs just yet, but the company did provide a set of ballpark power-versus-performance plots that are typical of early looks at silicon.

 




The first claim shows that the 12 Xe Core GPU has a much broader range of scaling than Lunar Lake. If given a large amount of extra power over Lunar Lake, the 12 Xe Core Arc GPU can offer 50% or greater performance in exchange. If we eyeball the same power level as Lunar Lake in this chart, performance gains are much more modest, but still present.

When discussing performance-per-watt improvements, Intel instead points to the Arrow Lake-H iGPU, against which the company claims a greater than 40% improvement in efficiency for the same performance. We would certainly hope that Panther Lake provides a performance-per-watt improvement in this match-up, as the Arrow Lake-H iGPU is based on the aging Xe-LPG architecture that first made its debut in the almost two-year-old Meteor Lake and has its roots in the three-year-old Alchemist architecture.

If you directly compare Panther Lake to Lunar Lake for efficiency, Xe3 still delivers a performance-per-watt improvement, but it's smaller (probably under 20%, if we had to eyeball it). Gripes about relevant comparisons aside, what we should take away here is that the Lunar Lake iGPU (at least in its 12 Xe Core form) delivers both performance per watt improvements and a broader range of performance scaling possibilities compared to the company's past integrated GPU efforts.

What is impressive, however, is that these improvements have all come by way of architectural refinements. Intel says it hasn't changed the process technology it's using to fabricate the GPU tile (presumably relative to Arrow Lake), so these boosts to both power and performance come exclusively from the architectural improvements discussed above.

 




Another way Intel talks about performance with Xe3 is by walking through the time it takes for a hypothetical frame to be rendered on both Lunar Lake and Panther Lake. As any graphics performance enthusiast knows, a lower frame time on average means higher frame rates. One frame isn't terribly useful as a benchmark, but Intel's trip inside the frame time journey shows several key improvements related to the microarchitectural refinements in Xe3. Overall, this same frame renders in 22.84 ms on the 12 Xe3-Core GPU, or 50% less time.

Of course, GPUs these days aren't just a chip - they're part of an entire hardware-software stack. Intel is continuing to invest in its XeSS suite of technologies to keep pace with Nvidia and AMD. On top of upscaling and 2x framegen support in XeSS 2, an upcoming XeSS release will add AI-accelerated multi-frame generation to Intel's arsenal.

Like Nvidia's DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, XeSS MFG will offer 2x, 3x, and 4x modes (one, two, or three generated frames). It also won't require game developers to update their XeSS 2 titles to explicitly support the feature.

 




Any of the (small) list of titles that already support Xe Frame Generation will work with XeSS MFG through an override in the Intel Graphics Software control panel.

We had an opportunity to go hands-on with XeSS Multi Frame Generation on a Panther Lake engineering system at the Tech Tour event. Based on my limited time with the demo system, the image quality of XeMFG is impressive. I didn't see any distracting artifacts that would have given the framegen-boosted frame rate away.

However, input lag was just a bit too far over the line of tolerability for a great experience in a fast-paced shooter like the upcoming Painkiller, although I'm sure I could have tuned upscaling and quality settings to arrive at a more responsive experience.

I was somewhat frustrated by Intel's use of baseline frame rates as a proxy for acceptable input lag with XeMFG. We've already performed some high-level testing that demonstrates how the two measurements are not necessarily correlated, and Intel's representatives threw around what seemed to me to be unreasonably low baseline frame rates for a good framegen experience.

We'll need to see how PresentMon interacts with XeMFG going forward in order to see whether it can be used reliably to gauge a game's input lag and its suitability for use with XeMFG on a given Arc graphics platform.

 




To improve game load times and in-game smoothness, Intel also plans to begin distributing pre-compiled shaders from the cloud for compatible installed games on a user's system using the Intel Graphics Software utility.

Anybody who's loaded a modern AAA title knows the pain of long load times and in-game stutter as shaders compile for the first time, and Intel seems to think it's a worthy investment to allocate cloud resources to make this problem go away entirely. This isn't a game-changer, but it is a straightforward and handy perk for users of Arc graphics products.

Overall, our first experiences with Xe3 and the larger 12-Xe3-core GPU on Panther Lake are promising. At least for now, Intel remains committed to Arc graphics despite its recent earth-shaking deal with Nvidia, and we can't wait to test Xe3 in greater depth once shipping Panther Lake systems arrive late this year or early next.

The deals are still flowing after Amazon's Prime Big Deals Day, with plenty of deals still available even though the event is over, and some new ones are becoming available from ongoing sales at other e-tailers like Newegg and Best Buy. This remains a great time to pick up some new peripherals to improve your PC experience — whether it's a fan-favorite productivity mouse or a standalone gaming microphone that's been going strong for years. In fact, we're still seeing plenty of great deals on everything from clicky mechanical keyboards and ultra-lightweight gaming mice to wireless headsets and 4K webcams.

We only pick the best deals: peripherals we've reviewed and tested, and that we continue to test over the years, tracking durability, comfort, and overall longevity. While the stakes might not seem as high on a gaming mouse or a headset as they are on a GPU or even an SSD, they're higher than you think — after all, peripherals are what you interact with most often, every single day. The right keyboard or mouse will probably have a much bigger impact on how you work (and play), at least as far as your immediate perception goes, than will swapping out any of your PC's internal components.

This lightweight gaming mouse from Logitech weighs only 80 grams and is one of the only modern FPS gaming mice to feature a truly ambidextrous design, with the ability to switch the side buttons for either left or right-handed gamers. With a super-accurate 25,600 DPI sensor and excellent battery life, the Logitech G Pro is a good choice as your main gaming mouse. 

An all-time low, and half price 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

Razer's flagship wireless Basilisk V3 Pro features Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, Gen-3 optical mouse switches, and 13 zones of bright RGB underglow lighting. It gets up to 110 hours of battery life and is compatible with Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle and Mouse Dock Pro.

HyperX's QuadCast S is the pretty, colorful version of one of our favorite microphones of all time — and it's currently on sale for 50% off. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. 

The Logitech Brio 4K was the first 4K webcam on the market back when it first debuted in 2017. There are lots of 4K webcams now, but the Brio 4K is still a solid performer with good auto light correction, a 90-degree field of view, and 5x HD zoom. This isn't the cheapest we've seen it, but it's pretty close — and definitely cheaper than most 4K webcams. 

These booming speakers bring 5.1 surround to your PC in a big way. They have wireless connectivity for the rear speakers, a lifesaver, and built-in lighting that spruces up your room. This 280W (peak) system also has a full-featured software suite to tailor it to your needs. 

These compact speakers have a 32W peak, but they still deliver decent bass thanks to the built-in subwoofer located on the back of one of the speakers. They connect via USB, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth 5.2, giving you plenty of options. They are tuned for gaming, so serious audiophiles should look elsewhere for music-oriented speakers. 

Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset is comfortable and lightweight, sounds good for both music and gaming, and has one of the best on-headset boom microphones we've ever tested.

While this headset from Logitech's premium "inclusive" Aurora line isn't the only white headset on the market, it is awfully comfortable — and it's one of the few headsets our peripherals editor has that almost always just works. Features simultaneous 2.4GHz wireless/Bluetooth connectivity with audio mixing, detachable boom mic, and pretty lights.

HyperX's premium wireless headset features a strong but lightweight aluminum frame and a detachable boom mic. It only has 2.4GHz wireless connectivity — not Bluetooth — but offers a ridiculous 300 hours of battery life over said connection.

The only wireless open-back gaming headset on the market is incredibly light and comfortable and sounds great. It has a detachable, flip-to-mute boom mic, dual-mode wireless connectivity, and gets about 50 hours of battery life.

Panther Lake brings the power efficiency and graphics performance of Lunar Lake and the platform flexibility of Arrow Lake all together on one SoC


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel revealed new information about its upcoming Panther Lake chips made on its new 18A node at an event in Arizona, including claims that the chips can deliver 50% more performance at similar power to its Lunar Lake chips or reduce power by 30% in multi-threaded work compared to its Arrow Lake-H processors. Going by past Intel launch cycles, we're likely to hear more about these chips at CES 2026. Intel says "broad market availability" will start in January 2026.

These sorts of improvements are badly needed because, in recent years, Intel has faced a triple threat in the laptop processor market. AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all want a piece of the lucrative premium laptop pie, and especially in the case of Qualcomm and Apple, the arrival of high-performance, highly efficient Arm cores on SoCs boasting powerful NPUs and GPUs has forced Intel to up every part of its game to stay competitive on performance and battery life.

Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake Core Ultra CPUs proved that relatively short battery life wasn't an inherent problem of Intel x86 products, but the highly integrated design of Lunar Lake SoCs (combining both compute and memory on a single package) meant that laptop OEMs didn't have nearly as much flexibility and control over system configurations and costs as they might get with a Meteor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU and discrete memory packages, whether in soldered or SO-DIMM flavors.

In exchange for that greater flexibility in memory configurations, Arrow Lake-H SoCs come with tradeoffs of their own. Arrow Lake systems certainly don't have bad battery life, but Lunar Lake is still the best thing going for unplugged efficiency from Intel CPUs.

Lunar Lake also includes a GPU built on Intel's latest Xe2 graphics architecture, while Arrow Lake-H CPUs use an older, larger Xe-LPG+ GPU, which has its roots in first-gen Arc Alchemist products, to deliver relatively similar performance (but likely with worse power efficiency).

Arrow Lake-H also carries over Meteor Lake's rather limited pair of Crestmont E-cores in its low-power island, even as its on-die E-cores got an upgrade to the more advanced Skymont microarchitecture that also underpins the quartet of low-power E-cores on Lunar Lake. Are you lost yet?

This dizzying mix of performance levels, power efficiency targets, architectural generations, and system configuration restrictions across Intel mobile platforms is a headache for consumers and laptop makers alike.

Enter Panther Lake, the great unifier that Intel hopes will bring the best of Lunar Lake's power efficiency improvements and Arrow Lake's performance scalability together in one common package.

Panther Lake SoCs are all built up from the same cutting-edge P-cores, E-cores, and iGPU architecture, while affording laptop makers more freedom to tailor their products to a wider range of buyers and price points. And as Intel's first product to ship with a compute tile fabricated on the latest 18A process node, Panther Lake has a ton to prove.

At its most recent Tech Tour event, held in the backyard of its leading-edge fabs in Chandler, Arizona, Intel walked us through everything that makes Panther Lake tick. Here's the story so far.

Panther Lake's compute tile is one of the first products to be fabricated on Intel's leading-edge 18A node. As a quick refresher, 18A is Intel's (and likely the industry's) first high-volume process to incorporate two major innovations meant to enable future scaling and power efficiency gains: gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, which Intel calls RibbonFETs, and a backside power delivery network, which Intel calls PowerVia.

 




Intel describes its RibbonFETs as "the ultimate transistor," since their gate structure allows for what the company calls "complete control" over the channel. Compared to FinFETs, whose gate structure doesn't extend to the bottom of the channel and therefore has a "weak point" for controlling leakage current, the RibbonFET gate structure entirely wraps around the channel (as defined by the stack of silicon nanosheets at the heart of the device), minimizing undesirable leakage current when the transistor is off. Among other important characteristics, less leakage current means less energy wasted while a chip is operating.

Intel also claims that RibbonFETs are more flexible for designers than FinFETs. The number of ribbons, as well as their widths, can be adjusted to tailor the transistor's performance characteristics to the needs of a given cell.

 




PowerVia, Intel's implementation of a backside power delivery network, introduces a second novel approach to chip fabrication. As silicon processes have gotten denser and denser, efficiently routing both signal and power wires above the transistors has gotten more and more challenging as those wires compete for ever more precious real estate.

Instead of building up both power and signal wires above the transistor, the backside power delivery approach first creates the transistors and signal wiring on the front side of the wafer. In the next production step, the wafer gets flipped over, and the back side gets polished away until the transistor contacts are revealed. The power delivery metal layers are then connected directly to the transistors.

Intel says that PowerVia allows for 10% higher density and relaxed routing on the front side of the wafer. For power delivery, the back-side metal layers reduce power loss from the package to the transistor by 30%.

All in all, 18A allows for a 15% higher frequency at the same power as Intel 3 and a 1.3x density improvement compared to the same process. Designers can also choose to harness 18A's advances to deliver a 25% power reduction at the same performance level compared to Intel 3.

Intel didn't go into fine detail on the changes it made to the Cougar Cove P-core on Panther Lake versus Lunar and Arrow Lake's Lion Cove, or Panther's Darkmont E-core versus Skymont. The improvements the company did discuss for the Cougar Cove P-core are typical refinements of an existing CPU architecture, such as an improved branch predictor and a more capacious translation lookaside buffer (TLB). As Intel says, "we didn't go in and change the width, we didn't change the depth, we optimized."

 




At a high level, Intel says that Cougar Cove now employs an "AI-based" power management approach that can adjust the aggressiveness of certain functional units, such as the prefetcher, on the fly in response to the demands of diverse workloads.

Another change in Cougar Cove is improved prediction behavior in some cases of memory disambiguation. As Intel puts it, when a processor is executing a program, it will perform load and store instructions for memory accesses; sometimes those instructions are connected. Cougar Cove has improved logic to predict when a load and store are connected and use that information to schedule the load correctly. When this prediction is correct, it can result in higher IPC.

Intel also notes that the move to the 18A process gave it the ability to grow some fundamental structures in Cougar Cove, and the TLB was one of the primary beneficiaries. A bigger TLB means that more complex workloads run faster and more reliably, according to Intel.

Cougar Cove also carries forward and refines branch prediction changes introduced with Lion Cove in Lunar Lake. Lion Cove featured improved branch prediction algorithms and delivered low-latency predictions even for branches far ahead in the instruction stream. Intel says Cougar Cove incorporates lessons it learned from shipping Lion Cove silicon to improve performance. It refined some branch prediction algorithms and grew the sizes of each level in the predictor to further lower latency. Cougar Cove can also store better metadata about past prediction results to improve accuracy.

Intel says this all means the Cougar Cove branch predictor can deliver lower latency, more prediction bandwidth, and higher prediction accuracy. These improvements positively impact energy efficiency and performance— a more accurate and more responsive predictor means the CPU core spends less time doing wasteful work and more time doing useful work.

 




Improvements in the Darkmont E-core are also largely evolutionary versus Lunar Lake's Skymont. As with Cougar Cove, Darkmont can now use a dynamic algorithm to adjust the aggressiveness of its prefetcher to better balance responsiveness and power efficiency in response to the demands of varying workloads.

Like Cougar Cove, Darkmont offers improved branch prediction accuracy. It also saves power in the front end by employing loop stream detection, a technique that allows the front end of the chip to power down during certain instruction sequences. Darkmont also broadens the cases where the chip can employ nanocode sequences to execute complex instructions that traditionally would have been handled by an x86 CPU's microcode engine. Nanocode was introduced in Skymont to improve both performance and power efficiency.

As Intel puts it, the microcode sequencer is a giant ROM that comes into play when certain complex x86 instructions need to be executed. Loading from that ROM is a serial process, and it can only service one decoder at a time, meaning that other front end units will be blocked if they were also to need instruction sequences from the microcode ROM at the same time. Nanocode prevents this blocking behavior by taking some of those microcode instructions and embedding them into programmable logic arrays in each of the three front-end decoders of the E-core.

Since those PLAs are present in each of the three front-ends of the Darkmont core, Intel says the core can run instructions that formerly resided in microcode as "parallel, out-of-order microcode-like sequences." Intel says Darkmont has more cases and more optimized cases where its front-ends can employ nanocode and leave the microcode sequencer alone.

Not every part of a Panther Lake SoC uses 18A, of course. Intel uses the same "disaggregated architecture" concept that debuted in Meteor Lake and was refined on Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake. This approach separates different functional units of an SoC into individually fabricated "tiles" that are made in Intel's own fabs or at foundries like TSMC, then joined together using Intel's Foveros packaging technology.

In turn, each Panther Lake compute tile, fabricated in-house on 18A, is built up from three basic core complexes. A compute tile can (so far) include up to four Cougar Cove P-cores, up to eight Darkmont E-cores, and a separate "low-power island" cluster of four more Darkmont E-cores that are meant to "confine" suitable workloads to a lower-power compute domain for extra battery life, an idea introduced in Meteor Lake and refined further in Lunar Lake.

Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake both relied on a pair of Crestmont E-cores in this island that were limited in both power and clock speeds to maximize energy savings, but their limited performance meant that more power-hungry parts of the chip might be awakened more often if a task exceeded their limited capabilities. Lunar Lake got four Skymont E-cores in this island with their own power rail, which allowed them to be clocked higher and do more demanding work before tasks had to be shifted to the P-cores on that SoC.

As an evolution of Skymont, Panther Lake's Darkmont low-power E-cores allow more demanding tasks to stay confined to the low-power island for longer, and they can contribute to multi-threaded workloads for extra parallelism when it's needed. They're not on the main ring bus that connects the main clusters of P- and E-cores on the Panther Lake SoC, however, so they don't share the L3 cache of the larger core cluster. Instead, they have access to a power-efficient 8MB "memory-side cache" that's shared with all the other compute agents on the tile.

This side cache is coherent with the rest of the cache hierarchy across the chip, and coherence among all the caches on Panther Lake is managed by a home agent that communicates with separate coherency agents on each compute domain.

The 18A compute tiles also include Intel's fifth-generation NPU, seventh-generation image processing unit (IPU) for use with premium webcams in laptops, and Xe media and display engines separated from the graphics tile.

For more information on the Xe3 graphics architecture and the two iGPUs that use it on Panther Lake, as well as software and power management improvements, check out our dedicated article.

 




So far, Intel has created two different 18A compute dies that it mixes and matches with two different integrated GPUs (and possibly two different I/O tiles) to create three distinct Panther Lake SoCs, each with different cost and performance targets.

The smallest Panther Lake SoC has four P-cores paired with four low-power E-cores, just like we saw with Lunar Lake. Intel didn't disclose the full specs of its cache hierarchy, but since it lacks higher-power E-core clusters with their own L3 cache, our educated guess is this chip likely only has 12MB of cache shared across its four P-cores. It includes a small Xe3 GPU that offers up to four Xe3 graphics cores. This chip can use traditional DDR5 SO-DIMMs or LPCAMM modules at speeds up to 6800 MT/s, or soldered LPDDR5X running at up to 6400 MT/s.

 




For storage and peripheral controllers, the platform controller tile on the baby Panther Lake SoC offers 12 PCIe lanes - four Gen 5 and eight Gen 4 - which is enough to connect a Gen 5 SSD and perhaps lower-end storage devices or a discrete GPU. Between its relatively low core count, modest graphics horsepower, and limited memory speeds, we're likely to see this chip in more entry-level laptops that prioritize light weight and battery life over absolute performance.

The midsize Panther Lake SoC adds eight E-cores on a ring bus shared with the four P-cores, in addition to the four low-power E-cores in their dedicated island. Intel says this compute die has up to 18MB of shared L3 across the P- and E-cores. This midsize SoC keeps the same 4 Xe Core graphics tile as the small SoC.

 




This chip can take advantage of faster memory than its smaller sibling. Like the small chip, it can use both DDR5 modules or soldered LPDDR5X, but it supports DDR5 at speeds up to 7200 MT/s and LPDDR5X at up to 8533 MT/s.

The midsize Panther Lake chip also has expanded PCIe connectivity from its larger platform controller tile: as many as eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes and 12 Gen 5 lanes. Intel wouldn't comment on particular Panther Lake OEM designs in the pipeline, but between its expanded compute resources, richer PCIe connectivity, and support for higher-speed memory versus its smaller sibling, this chip seems well-suited for pairing with a discrete GPU in thin and light laptops, an approach that some Intel partners took with Meteor Lake chips.

 




The largest Panther Lake SoC retains the same 4P+8E+4LPE CPU core configuration as the midsize SoC but adds a much larger and more powerful 12 Xe3 Core GPU to the package. Intel restricts the memory options that partners can employ with this chip, likely so that it can get adequate memory bandwidth to feed all of those GPU execution units. It can only use LPDDR5X memory and supports the fastest transfer rates of any Panther Lake product: up to 9600 MT/s.

This big chip drops back to the more limited I/O tile with eight PCIe Gen 4 and four PCIe Gen 5 lanes, which is likely an indication that it's targeted at the exploding handheld gaming market and premium thin-and-light laptops that can still game when needed. Pairing discrete GPUs with this version of Panther Lake doesn't make a ton of sense from a system design standpoint.

 




Intel offered a high-level preview of single-threaded performance with Cougar Cove, suggesting that the new P-core can deliver 10% higher performance at similar power to Lunar and Arrow Lake, or 40% lower power at similar performance in less demanding workloads.

The multi-threaded performance story for Panther Lake is a bit muddier. Intel claims that Panther Lake can deliver 50% more performance at similar power to Lunar Lake, or 30% lower power for multi-threaded performance similar to Arrow Lake-H.

 




Of course, if we consider these charts in their entirety, Panther Lake can also deliver higher absolute performance at similar power to Arrow Lake-H, emphasizing the greater performance scalability of what we assume to be the 4P+8E+4LPE package.

Beyond these broad and rosy performance projections, Intel didn't discuss any specifics on clocks or power targets for Panther Lake during its presentations, but as with any modern laptop SoC, the frequency, power and thermal targets for these chips are likely to cover such a broad range of designs that it's hard to make generalized statements about their performance, and that's before we get into individual chip models within the product stack.

We'll have to wait and see what types of systems Intel's partners typically produce with Panther Lake SoCs inside before we can even begin to establish performance ballparks. Intel says that the first Panther Lake chips will ship before the end of 2025, and that it expects broad market availability starting in January 2026. Given that timeframe, it's probably safe to say that we will hear much more about Panther Lake products at CES.

Intel is trying to get into the good graces of gamers with its big Panther Lake chipset reveal. In that vein, Intel took more time to explain an update to its two-year-old AI upscaler, XeSS 2. No, we're not getting XeSS 3. No, Intel hasn't confirmed what the hell it's doing with future GPUs. Instead, like Nvidia before, Intel is getting into multi-frame generation to artificially push game frame rates higher. However, unlike Nvidia, Intel isn't restricting players to its own chips.

(Full disclosure: Intel invited me to its chipset fab in Phoenix, Ariz. Travel and lodging were paid by Intel, but Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip.)

Multi-frame generation is a word that could create a typhoon of controversy among PC gaming circles with its mere utterance. At its simplest, it's a process of shoving multiple AI-generated frames in between two frames rendered by the PC itself. Nvidia sold its latest RTX 50-series GPUs on the promise that multi-frame generation would push games well beyond their rasterization performance, or their ability to put a big number into your fps counter when playing games. Naysayers have been calling frame generation “fake frames,” and it's a moniker that's not entirely wrong. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went full used car salesman at CES 2025 when he promised a lower-end RTX 5070 graphics card could beat the company's last flagship GPU, the RTX 4090.

In practice, frame generation makes sense for lower-end devices more than some high-end desktop PC that already has the graphics capabilities to push the utmost pixels. That's where XeSS 2's multi-frame gen capabilities could start to change the nature of how we think of lighter PCs or—potentially—supercharge handheld PCs like MSI's Claw series.

Frame generation technology relies on PCs having enough data to help stick the AI-made frames in between the ones rendered by the PC. Common wisdom states that most games want between 45 and 55 fps before you kick in frame generation. This helps eschew problems with odd visual glitches and artifacts, where you'll find visual discrepancies that weren't meant to be there. In a roundtable with reporters, Tom Petersen, Intel's big cheese behind graphics and software, said he was fine using multi-frame gen at framerates as low as 30, which bumps it up at 4x to approximately 120 fps. Intel showed off the upcoming Painkiller reboot with a new performance monitor that can show frame rates before and after frame generation, akin to Steam's updated performance overlay.

With the quadrupling in frame generation (that means there are four AI frames between each rendered frame), the game was running at around 150 fps on a pre-production version of Panther Lake with 12 Xe3 GPU cores, on a reference platform running at 45W. Frame generation creates latency that discerning players can feel and see. This is due to the nature of the technology, since it has to know the next frame in a sequence to insert the AI-generated frames between them. Petersen said the latency could be more, depending on the game and framerate you're playing at, but it will be down to users whether they opt in or not.

“There are a whole bunch of technologies that have not been announced that could make that better, but right now you can see some just turn off frame gen,” Petersen said. He later referred to potential technology that would use AI to predict mouse clicks, which could potentially allow the game to artificially remove the sensation of latency without removing it altogether. In the future, there's an opportunity for games to have predictive frame gen that kicks in only in certain moments where gamers won't feel the impact of latency as much. He even went as far as to say frame rates closer to 30 would actually be better than doing frame gen at higher frame rates, as the latency isn't as noticeable at lower frame rates as higher frame rates. That being said, I spoke to others at Intel who may still recommend at least 45 fps before enabling multi-frame generation. Your mileage may vary.

I ran through the Painkiller demo at around 50 fps, which turned into around 200 fps on-screen playing at 1080p. The game is as dark and gray as an older Xbox 360 title when we all somehow thought Gears of War looked great. It was more difficult to spot issues with textures or geometry through all the grime. However, the fire effects—which previously posed problems for Intel's 2x frame gen technology—seemed closer to how it would look without using upscaling or frame generation.

Petersen wasn't afraid to share his opinion regarding Nvidia's multi-frame gen beholden to its latest RTX 50-series of GPUs. “Trash,” he called it under his breath. He's half-joking, maybe, but Intel now sees itself as an underdog fighting a behemoth; it's allowing itself to act scrappy. Still, what's more important is how well its Panther Lake chips can perform in gaming scenarios before you enable any AI options. Intel claims it has optimized power delivery on the CPU and GPU to reduce stuttering in games.

XeSS 2's multi-frame gen isn't the kind of technology that makes expensive hardware better. Instead, it offers more options for lower-end systems. XeSS 2 remains hardware agnostic, meaning it can run on any device, whether it has an Intel or AMD chip inside. XeSS 2 works on two different kernels for AMD and Intel devices, and on AMD-powered systems, it requires a compatibility layer that will make the upscaler work slightly worse than on Intel's chips.

Intel is now the only major U.S. chipmaker still developing hardware-agnostic AI upscaling for PC. At the same time, XeSS is still lagging behind the competition in terms of supported games. AMD has turned its attention to the latest version of FidelityFX Super Resolution, or FSR 4. The upgrade over FSR 3 and 3.5 has allowed upscaled games to look less muddy with sharper details in both the foreground and background. AMD relegated FSR 4 to its latest Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs, as in all those currently using RDNA 4 microarchitecture. AMD recently claimed its latest AI upscaling drivers are available in more than 85 titles. Nvidia's latest version of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS 4) AI upscaler is currently available in more than 175 games, according to the company.

In May, Intel said XeSS is available in more than 200 games, but if you're regularly playing the latest titles, it can be a crapshoot which games support Intel's upscaling and which don't. Intel obviously hopes more developers sign on once they see what XeSS 2's multi-frame gen can do. XeSS multi-frame gen should be available to some games in the future, though players may need to use Intel software to enable it to override on games that are already compatible with Intel's upscaler.

Everybody was spending so much time basking in the schadenfreude of Intel's financial woes, they forgot about the company's legitimately successful launch of the Lunar Lake consumer chips last year. Now that Intel has some support from Nvidia and backing from the current nativist regime occupying the White House, Intel is once again trying to push laptop battery life further without slacking on performance with Panther Lake chips. What's more interesting this time is how Intel hopes to dethrone AMD for graphics capabilities on a single chip.

(Full disclosure: Intel invited me to its chipset fab in Phoenix, Ariz. Travel and lodging were paid by Intel, but Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip.)

Intel promised Panther Lake chipsets would maintain the battery life expectations of the past chip generation, but now it will have options for better graphics performance thanks to a novel way of positioning the GPU, or graphics processing unit. Modern chips build entire GPU sections onto the die, namely, the small block of the semiconductor that accounts for most of the processing potential. This naturally limits the max size of the GPU section. Despite that limitation, recent AMD APUs, or accelerated processing units, like the Ryzen 9 AI Max+ 365 show enormous potential for graphics processing. Intel's solution is simple, at least on paper. Intel removed the GPU onto its own die, and included a special “die-to-die interconnect” that it claims offers seamless communications, as if the GPU tile existed together with the compute tile.

Intel detailed three different versions of Panther Lake using Intel's new 18A 3nm process with an 8MB side cache. The company stopped short of mentioning how many varieties of chips or SKUs customers would need to learn before buying a PC (last year's Lunar Lake had nine total SKUs). The smallest of the three is an 8-core CPU featuring four performance (P) cores and four low-power efficiency (LPE) cores. The performance cores are based on the new Cougar Cove architecture, while the efficiency cores are now labeled Darkmont. There's another 16-core version of the chip with an additional eight Darkmont efficiency cores.

Panther Lake is supposed to one-up both Lunar Lake and the much-maligned Arrow Lake chips. Its CPU performance is supposed to hit 10% better single-thread performance over last year's light-laptop chips at the same power, but more importantly, it could do 50% better with multi-thread performance, which could make for faster work in intense tasks like video editing.

Panther Lake's GPU now sports the new Xe3 GPU cores. The top-end version of Panther Lake can sport 12 Xe3 cores compared to just four. Last year's Lunar Lake chips maxed out with eight Xe2 GPU cores. Suffice it to say, the GPU is more powerful than before, especially with its new 12 ray tracing units to support more accurate lighting effects in 3D programs or games. Intel claims the new GPU has 50% better performance compared to the top-end Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips. Bigger is going to be better, at least according to Intel, especially since Panther Lake is supposed to offer the same power as Arrow Lake-H chips at 40% less wattage. Xe3 is also supposed to hit 50% better top-end performance over Lunar Lake, but of course, that's going to demand more juice from your machine.

Top-end Panther Lake chips can expect to support up to 96GB of LPDDR5 RAM, plus Bluetooth 6 and Wi-Fi 7. Otherwise, the chips may be able to make video calls look a little clearer thanks to improved signal processing from the webcam. We'll all need to be patient, little PC buyers, for accurate numbers in gaming and graphics benchmarks, which likely won't be around until the company starts shipping the chips later this year. For the rest of us who care more about how these CPUs perform on a machine you can buy, we'll see more as major laptop makers share their wares at CES 2026 in January.

Last month, Qualcomm shared the details on its next-gen Snapdragon X2 Elite and Elite Extreme chips designed for lightweight PCs. The ARM-based CPUs were supposed to show up Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD Strix Point with better performances at much lower wattages, meaning they could be even better for battery life than the previous generation. Intel's promising something very similar, but with the same x86 microarchitecture, which won't lead to the numerous issues with app and driver compatibility faced by Qualcomm-powered PCs. As I mentioned last month, gaming is still Qualcomm's Achilles Heel for its PC endeavors.

Qualcomm is still fighting to keep in front of the AI wars. TOPS, or trillions of operations per second, is normally how companies describe the performance of their separate neural processing unit (NPU) dedicated to low-end or repetitive AI tasks. And still, it's rarely a good indicator of how strong the chip is for processing AI. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite features a new NPU promising 70 TOPS of performance. The Panther Lake's new NPU 5 on all varieties of the chip goes up to 50 TOPS of performance. What does any of that mean? Nothing, at least in practice. A PC's GPU will still be better for more-intensive AI processing than the NPU can handle.

So we still need to see what comes out of AMD, but I wouldn't be surprised if even more chips down the line feature a die-to-die GPU connection. Chipmakers may keep pushing AI performance, but if it means we get laptop chips that can play games without the need for battery-sucking discrete GPUs, there's reason to get excited.

Seattle startup Aarden AI is coming out of stealth with $4 million from investors and an AI platform that helps landowners research and navigate deals with developers eager to build data centers, clean energy installations, housing and other uses.

While there have long been tools to support developers, landowners have been largely on their own to evaluate and optimize deals so they're not taken advantage of or end up partnering with untrustworthy organizations, said Aarden CEO Danan Margason.

“And so landowners have become increasingly skeptical of working with developers, even when opportunities exist,” he said. 

Big tech companies are scrambling to build data centers to meet expanding AI needs, creating urgent demand for suitable sites. At the same time, the push for clean energy — both to power those data centers and support broader efforts to move away from fossil fuels — has developers actively seeking landowners. 

The company's current customers are businesses and entities that own and manage large swaths of timberland. They know their sector well, Margason said, but they don't know how to accurately calculate the potential for these alternate land uses.

Aarden's technology creates detailed maps with information that includes elevation, soil type, energy transmission infrastructure, environmental and wildlife habitat features, solar intensity and other factors. It estimates financial returns for various land uses and expedites the due diligence process. And it helps manage the legal aspects of a transaction.

The platform's AI foundation allows users to ask questions and dig more deeply into the information as they explore different options. 

“As an industry, land has been stuck with multi-decade assumptions and Excel models that rarely consider alternative uses. Despite that, it's been an amazing asset class for those that can access it, consistently beating the public markets,” said Ben Eidelson, general partner of Stepchange, a climate-focused fund.

Stepchange also invested in Aarden's initial round, which was led by Planeteer and included Founders' Co-op, KDX, Superorganism and Len Jordan, a venture partner at Madrona.

Aarden charges subscription fees for landowners using the platform. Future revenue options include usage-based fees that are higher for customers running more complex scenarios and models. The company aims to facilitate matches for the parties — generating revenue for helping negotiate successful transactions with developers.

Other companies are creating tools for assessing and researching properties, including Acres.com and Land id, but don't appear to be centered on landowners' needs.

The startup launched earlier this year and has a five person team: 

The startup and many of its investors have a strong connection to environmental and climate concerns, but converting forests to data centers or even solar farms doesn't obviously align with those ideals. So how does the team square those concerns? 

Margason said the question gets a lot of attention internally, and their goal is to support responsible development — which the timberland owners appreciate.

“If data centers are going to get built, if homes are going to get built, how do we help provide the right layers of information to inform not just the economic outputs, but also the environmental outputs,” he said, “and that'll hopefully drive better decision making.”

New export rules tighten China's grip on magnet and phosphor tech.

China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth elements, adding new items to a growing list of restricted materials and processing technologies. The updated rules, which take effect in December, cover not just elements like holmium, thulium, erbium, and ytterbium, but also the technical know-how around how they're turned into magnets.

In a mirror of U.S. semiconductor export policy, Chinese officials framed the move as a national security imperative and signaled that licenses will be denied for end-uses tied to defense or semiconductors. Under the new rules, which are an extension of those announced in April, foreign companies will need China's permission to export magnets that contain trace amounts of rare-earth materials sourced from China, or were produced using the country's extraction methods. As the dominant supplier of rare earth minerals globally, China exerting more pressure on supply could have knock-on effects.

Ultimately, this policy decision poses a direct risk to the building blocks of hardware, starting with storage. High-density HDDs use neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets to drive the actuator arms that read data off spinning platters. A typical voice-coil motor depends on neodymium mixed with dysprosium or praseodymium to maintain coercivity at high temperatures. With China controlling the bulk of global processing capacity for those alloys, any licensing restrictions are likely to hit costs and delivery timelines first, and that's before you get to the motors in fans and cooling systems.

Displays could also be hit. LED backlights and LCD panels rely on phosphor compounds doped with europium, terbium, and yttrium to produce vivid colors. Europium and terbium are both squarely in the new controls, with export licenses now required for dozens of items used in the production chain. That puts panel manufacturers, which are already under margin pressure, in the firing line again.

Even silicon isn't safe. Cerium oxide slurries, used in wafer polishing and glass finishing, may also come under pressure if restrictions expand to cover recycling or processing gear. These aren't headlining materials, but they play a crucial role in production flows across fabs and panel assembly lines. If licenses start dragging or pricing shifts, delays in component manufacturing are almost inevitable. Indeed, the supply of rare earth minerals is just one of the factors fuelling growing concern around looming PC hardware shortages.

None of this will guarantee price hikes tomorrow, but it raises the odds of sudden friction in parts of the supply chain that often go unnoticed. Magnets and phosphors aren't exciting or sexy, but they're everywhere and extremely difficult to replace. In April, HDD maker Western Digital launched a program to recover rare-earth materials from retired drives, which is an obvious attempt to safeguard against this very scenario.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech after receiving reports that the software caused vehicles to run red lights or cross into wrong lanes.

The probe, which identified more than 50 reports of these kinds of violations (four of which led to injuries), is one of the first specifically targeted at Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance software. The NHTSA previously opened an investigation into FSD in October 2024 after receiving reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions.

The federal safety agency in April 2024 closed an investigation into Tesla's less-capable Autopilot system after identifying 13 fatal crashes related to the misuse of that software. A separate investigation into the efficacy of the fix Tesla issued to Autopilot remains open.

The new investigation was opened the same week that Tesla released the latest version of the software, which CEO Elon Musk has spent months hyping. This new version is supposed to incorporate training data that Tesla acquired during its limited robotaxi pilot, currently underway in Austin, Texas.

The safety agency's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) said on Thursday that it has received at least 18 complaints and one media report alleging that Tesla's FSD software failed to stop the car or stay stopped at red lights. In addition, ODI said it identified six reports from Tesla under the agency's Standing General Order for Crash Reporting (SGO), which requires companies to submit information about crashes involving autonomous or partially autonomous cars.

ODI said it has already worked with Maryland's Transportation Authority and its State Police to determine if some of the red light problems are repeatable, since “multiple subject incidents occurred at the same intersection in Joppa, Maryland.” Tesla has already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection,” according to the NHTSA.

ODI also said on Thursday it had identified 18 complaints, two media reports, and two SGO reports from Tesla about instances in which FSD “entered opposing lanes of travel during or following a turn, crossed double-yellow lane markings while proceeding straight, or attempted to turn onto a road in the wrong direction despite the presence of wrong-way road signs.” 

ODI said it has identified six complaints, one media report, and four SGO reports where a Tesla with FSD engaged drove straight through an intersection from a turn lane, or turned from a through lane.

“Some of the reported incidents appeared to involve FSD executing a lane change into an opposing lane of travel with little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene,” ODI wrote. 

ODI opened what's known as a “Preliminary Evaluation,” one of the first steps it can take on the way to requiring a recall. The agency said it typically tries to complete these investigations within eight months, although it's unclear if the federal government shutdown would affect the timeline. 

Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year reportedly made dramatic cuts to NHTSA's vehicle automation safety staff.

Google on Thursday launched a comprehensive AI platform for businesses called Gemini Enterprise, the latest effort by the Alphabet-owned company to compete with Anthropic and OpenAI in the fast-growing market for workplace AI tools.

As part of the launch, Google announced several new Gemini Enterprise customers, including the software design firm Figma; the buy now, pay later company Klarna; the foodservice distributor Gordon Food Service; Australian retail bank Macquarie Bank; and Virgin Voyages, a cruise line that has deployed more than 50 specialized AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks on Gemini Enterprise.

Gemini Enterprise builds on previous iterations of the company's efforts to bring AI capabilities to businesses. But Google says this shouldn't be mistaken as a mere rebranding, despite the ever-changing and sometimes overlapping nomenclature used by its enterprise brand Google Workspace. For instance, Google Workspace adopted the Gemini branding in February 2024 and announced add-on generative AI products called Gemini Enterprise that were available to businesses. Google discontinued that Workspace Gemini Enterprise add-on earlier this year after it began including AI features in its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans.

The Gemini Enterprise that launched Thursday isn't a Workspace add-on product; it's a separate and secure platform under Google Cloud that functions as an AI agent toolkit — essentially a suite of tools that lets companies build and deploy their own AI assistants. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian described it in a blog post as “the new front door for AI in the workplace.”

Gemini Enterprise is designed to let businesses securely create, share, and use AI agents for a variety of workplace tasks in sales, marketing, engineering, human resources, and finance. Google also said that, for the first time, these AI agents can access, combine, and analyze information from internal systems and Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow.

All of this work is conducted through a Gemini Enterprise chatbot that connects to a worker's data, including Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, as well as business applications like Salesforce and SAP. The platform includes Google's Gemini AI models alongside other products such as a collection of pre-built Google agents for deep research and data insights, a no-code product that lets workers analyze information and automate internal processes, and a central governance framework that lets users visualize, secure, and audit all of their agents from one place.

This new “front door for AI in the workplace” does have a price. The company said its annual Gemini Enterprise standard and “plus” editions start at $30 per seat per month. A cheaper Gemini Business annual plan, which is meant for small businesses, startups, or individual departments within a larger company, costs $21 per seat per month. Google said the business edition will launch Thursday and includes a 30-day free trial period for all customers.

Gemini Enterprise reflects Google's latest effort to capture a bigger share of the enterprise market, which has become increasingly crowded as generative AI becomes a more important workplace tool. Booming AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI have enterprise products, and both have landed high-profile customers.

OpenAI says on its website it has 5 million business users of the ChatGPT Enterprise product it launched in 2023. This month, Deloitte announced plans to roll out Anthropic's chatbot Claude to its nearly 500,000 global employees.

Enzo Ferrari said he was a seller of engines and that the rest of the car is thrown in for free, such was the emphasis he and his company put on its jewel-like power units. Can the same ever be true of an electric car's seemingly soulless motors, batteries, and inverters? That is the question Ferrari is at pains to answer in the positive with its first EV.

Although nameless for now, the four-door car will use a new electric platform called Elettrica. The platform is a familiar skateboard EV chassis setup, as used by almost everyone else, but with four motors instead of the more common one or two.

Total power is a little over 1,000 horsepower, the 0-62 mph time is 2.5 seconds and the top speed is 192 mph. The battery has a gross capacity of 122 kWh—one of the largest fitted to any production EV to date—can charge at up to 350 kW and operates at 880 volts. Ferrari is claiming a range of over 323 miles, suggesting an efficiency of around 2.65 miles per kWh, excluding any mileage gained through regenerative braking. Weight is approximately 2,300 kg (5,070 lbs).

Ferrari's 122 kWh battery is one of the largest fitted to any production EV and can charge at up to 350 kW with a claimed range of over 323 miles.

This was all broadly to be expected. What isn't known is exactly what sort of car it will be, or what it will be called. Today's reveal is focused on the Elettrica platform. The interior, which includes the work of a certain Sir Jony Ive, will be shown early next year, and the full car, also penned with input from Ive's LoveFrom design house, will land in the second quarter of 2026.

For now, chief executive Benedetto Vigna says the staggered reveal is because the first electric Ferrari is “a bigger deal” than its current flagship, the F80 hybrid hypercar.

You can't blame Ferrari for taking its time. By sticking to big V12 engines and clever hybrids that maximize performance over outright efficiency, the company has become accustomed to operating in a different league to other carmakers. Investors seem unfazed by the lack of an ultra-powerful EV to rival Porsche, Rimac or Lotus—and so Ferrari's share price is up 900 percent since going public a decade ago.

Its customers are equally happy, frequently shelling out six-figure sums on optional upgrades alone, while understanding that limited-run specials like the F80 are sold by invitation-only, regardless of bank balance.

Although looming regulation change means Ferrari cannot stick to the same winning formula forever, its first attempt at an EV arrives precisely as once-bullish rivals are reconsidering their position.

Lamborghini has delayed its first EV from 2027 to 2029. Bentley has pushed back its goal of exclusively selling fully electric cars from 2030 to 2035. And only recently Porsche killed plans for an electric flagship SUV, and said how some top-end models would continue to favor engines over batteries. Ferrari's Modena neighbor Maserati also recently cancelled plans for an electric version of its MC20 supercar, citing a lack of customer interest.

Even the company itself was unsure, albeit now almost a decade ago, when late boss Sergio Marchionne said a battery-powered Ferrari was “almost an obscene concept.” Then again, he was similarly robust about the idea of a Ferrari SUV, only for the high-riding Purosangue to be greeted with critical acclaim and bulging order books from day one.

Back to today and, while it doesn't want to say what the EV will look like, Ferrari is predictably keen to talk about performance. The front motors produce a combined 210 kW (280 horsepower) and 140 Nm of torque, while the rear pair send 620 kW (830 hp) and 355 Nm to their respective axle. The front and rear motors spin at up to 30,000 and 25,500 revolutions per minute, respectively, and can gain speed at a rate of 45,000 rpm per second.

Ferrari says the motors and battery were developed and built entirely in-house, using the company's new “e-building” at its Maranello, Italy campus, although the cells come from SK, a South Korean battery manufacturer. The battery pack comprises 211 pouch cells arranged in 15 modules which are designed to be accessed, removed, and replaced if future maintenance requires it.

Ferrari's setup, including this inverter, sees the carmaker opt for four electric motors instead of just one or two, which results in prodigious power: more than 1,000 hp, 0-62 in 2.5 secs and a top speed of 192 mph.

The first all-electric Ferrari is a four-door, four-seater with the driver and front passenger pushed forward in a bid to create a seating position like that of a mid-engined sports car, while the rear seats are more reclined.

Although the cabin hasn't been revealed, the EV's steering will have a pair of dials for switching between three energy modes (Range, Tour and Performance) and five drive modes: Ice, Wet, Dry, Sport, and ESC-Off. The latter will disable most of the Elettrica's traction and stability systems.

Behind the wheel are a pair of paddles, but instead of operating a transmission, the left-hand paddle cycles through different strengths of regenerative braking, and the right lets the driver access five levels of power and torque, using a new system called Torque Shift Engagement.

Although not quite the simulated gearbox of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, Ferrari says the regenerative braking modes give a sensation similar to engine braking when shifting down through the gears of a non-EV. Meanwhile, the five power and torque levels “deliver progressively stronger acceleration” with subsequent pulls of the right-hand paddle.

With regard to sound, Ferrari says it quickly dismissed the two approaches taken by most other EVs; namely, copying the sound of an engine, and producing something entirely synthesized. Instead, the Elettrica uses an accelerometer fitted to the rear axle. Like the pickup of an electric guitar, this senses vibrations produced by the motors, which are then processed and filtered—to remove annoying traits like constant whine, Ferrari says—and fed into the cabin.

Ferrari likens the sound of an engine and exhaust to that of an acoustic guitar, while it says the Elettrica's is closer to an amplified electric guitar. “The sound is authentic,” says Antonio Palermo, sound quality manager. “It belongs to the components of the powertrain.”

Palermo says the sound can be reduced when cruising, then amplified during more dynamic driving. Allegedly, it's even possible to sense when a rear wheel breaks traction, since the rise in revs of that motor would be detected by the accelerometer. He also says how latency—the time between a change in motor revs and the sound reaching the driver's ear—is “below the threshold of human perception… instantaneous.”

The sound will also adjust depending on how the driver engages with the steering wheel paddles for regenerative braking and the Torque Shift Engagement system. But, for now, Ferrari refuses to comment on exactly how motor sound is broadcast in the cabin—be it through the car's sound system, or some other means—and how external sound will be created. Underscoring Ferrari's commitment to using an authentic drivetrain sound, Palermo adds: “It's an instrument, not a ringtone.”

Remarkably, for a company whose cars are synonymous with theatrical histrionics, Ferrari says during normal driving “silence is preferred to maximize acoustic comfort.” To that end, it has worked hard to illuminate noise, vibration, and harshness (known in the industry as NVH), since there's no longer a loud engine to drown it all out.

The Elettrica's suspension is an evolution of the active system used by Ferrari's Purosangue SUV and F80 hypercar, which employs 48-volt motors to apply torque to each shock absorber, actively working to eliminate pitch and roll.

As with other electric cars, a heavy battery pack in the floor helps to lower the center of gravity; in this case, by 80 mm compared to an equivalent non-EV. Although it can't defy physics, Ferrari claims its suspension trickery and quad-motor setup makes the Elettrica handle as if it were almost 1,000 lbs lighter.

The result is a car where each wheel has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other, by up to 2.15 degrees in either direction. Each of the four motors can also operate their own regenerative braking, with up to 0.68G of deceleration possible with the most aggressive level of regen. That's more than half the braking force experienced during an emergency stop in a regular car.

Each of the electric Ferrrari's four wheels has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other.

Ferrari has said repeatedly that its first EV is not a supercar. It suggests this car will offer more usability than the V12 Purosangue SUV, with driving thrills to match the new Almalfi, a front-engined replacement to the Roma, but not trouble the more potent 12Cilindri and 296.

It's a confident first reveal from Ferrari, and one that manages to suggest there's more to its debut EV than yet another skateboard chassis. Its use of four motors, trick active suspension, a clever way of producing sound, and, yes, Apple's former design chief gives the Elettrica serious intrigue at a time when rivals are floundering.

And yet. Despite its technical know-how and massive brand power, convincing buyers to part with what's likely to be the far side of $500,000 for an EV that is not a supercar will be no walk in the park. Not even for Ferrari.

Many businesses that provide goods and services to the EU's 450 million consumers must comply with new accessibility standards that took effect in June. Like the GDPR before it, this new act had companies scrambling to adjust their websites, e-commerce platforms, and banking apps. But despite similar standards existing in the U.S., many still have a long way to go.

“One thing that surprised us was companies, even massive companies, coming to us two weeks before [the deadline] saying, ‘Oh we didn't know anything about this,'” said Irish entrepreneur Cormac Chisholm.

His startup, DevAlly, is among the first to leverage technology to make it easier for businesses to detect accessibility problems. It also helps them comply with regulations like the European Accessibility Act (EAA), which promises hefty fines for new products and services that aren't in compliance. (Existing ones get a grace period to comply until 2030.)

Launched in 2024, DevAlly audits for accessibility barriers such as videos lacking captions on corporate websites. It also tracks customer-reported issues and helps companies create roadmaps for fixes and generate accessibility reports.

While human consultants can also conduct audits, Chisholm, DevAlly's CEO, believes such an approach can't scale to meet demand or adapt to the realities of shipping digital products and features. DevAlly has accessibility experts, too, but it leverages AI and accessibility LLMs to automate testing and issue tracking. This, Chisholm believes, helps integrate accessibility with the product development life cycle.

This tech-first approach mirrors the path taken by cybersecurity compliance company Vanta, now valued at $2.45 billion. 

The regulatory tailwinds and growing awareness around accessibility helped DevAlly secure €2 million (approximately $2.3 million) in pre-seed funding, TechCrunch exclusively learned.

With this new capital, the company plans to grow its team from 5 to 15 people by the end of the year — mostly in Dublin, where it participated in the NDRC accelerator program operated by Dogpatch Labs on behalf of state body Enterprise Ireland.

NDRC and Enterprise Ireland participated in the round, but it was led by Belgian fund Miles Ahead Capital, with participation from European angels. According to DevAlly's founders, that's in part thanks to tech conference Slush, where they made the top 3 of the startup competition and connected with their future lead investor.

“Traditionally in Ireland, the approach is to go with an Irish VC, but we went with Europe, and one of the things that we're super excited about is to explore what that unlocks from this investor,” Chisholm said.

DevAlly will use Miles Ahead's support to launch U.S. operations, starting with sales in San Francisco. The city proved valuable for connecting with heads of accessibility at large B2B software companies after DevAlly participated in TechCrunch Disrupt's Startup Battlefield 2024. “A lot of our customers right now are on the West Coast,” co-founder and chief revenue officer Patrick Guiney told TechCrunch. 

The startup has seen traction in Europe thanks to the EAA coming into force. So have other players, such as Barcelona-based QualiBooth, which recently reviewed the state of European e-commerce accessibility — retail is one focus of the EAA. But both startups also see opportunities in the U.S., where DevAlly is betting on procurement as a major driver of demand.

With estimates that disabled consumers and their households represent $8 trillion a year in disposable income, Chisholm is adamant that “good design is accessible design.” One in five people live with disability, and disability can also be situational — because heavy glare makes it impossible to read your screen in sunlight, or you are holding a baby and can't access control buttons, he said. “So you want to try and create as much universal design as possible.”

The actions a company may take to address this range from screen reader support to higher contrast and gradients that work for the color-blind. But recent analysis conducted by UX/UI design agency Tenscope found that 94% of the top 1,000 US websites fail basic accessibility standards.

The travel industry was the worst performer, preventing many users from completing basic functions like contact forms, account creation, and online purchases. Even before the EAA, Spanish airline Vueling was fined for failing to make its website accessible.

With the EU-wide EAA now involving multiple jurisdictions, each with its own fines, Big Tech companies that operate in multiple countries could find themselves in search of help. “That's why we're positioning ourselves as a bridge to Europe for these U.S companies,” Chisholm said.

If they do, this will be good news for DevAlly and its investors, and possibly for all of us, Chisholm said. “The improvements that come with accessibility, like subtitles at Netflix, become massive advancements in terms of how we all use technology. It's a much better form of design.”

Even though electronic cigarettes do not contain any illicit substances, the liquid can cause serious health problems. Often, the nicotine concentration in these products is several times higher than in conventional cigarettes, promoting rapid addiction. Furthermore, in countries like Brazil, which have banned electronic cigarettes, it Is observed that the products offered to users do not undergo any quality control. A resolution by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, distribution, storage, transportation, and advertising of electronic smoking devices. 

Some of these liquids contain up to 100 times more nicotine than a regular cigarette, whose legal maximum limit is 1 milligram of nicotine per cigarette. In addition, additives such as vitamin E acetate have been found in the liquids, which have caused deaths and permanent lung damage in users in the United States."

Luciano Arantes, researcher and member of the management committee of the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology on Psychoactive Substances (INCT-SP)

The scenario becomes even more concerning when considering the clandestine use of synthetic cannabinoids in these devices. These substances are created in laboratories to mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component found in Cannabis sativa, or marijuana. However, synthetic cannabinoids are much more potent and can trigger neurological effects such as seizures, psychotic episodes, and even death from overdose.

"What we're seeing is a chemical race. Clandestine groups are producing drugs with increasingly potent structures, requiring minimal doses to achieve the desired effect. As there's no labeling or warning, users consume without knowing what they're ingesting," Arantes warns.

To address the problem, Brazilian researchers, in partnership with international colleagues, have developed a portable sensor that can accurately detect synthetic cannabinoids in e-cigarette liquids and biological fluids, such as saliva. The device is described in an article published in the journal Talanta.

"We developed an electrochemical method that identifies different synthetic cannabinoid molecules with high selectivity and sensitivity. The analysis can be done anywhere, with a small sample, and the sensor responds with a characteristic electrochemical signal," describes Larissa Magalhães de Almeida Melo, the first author of the study, alongside student Cecília Barroso.

The device uses a boron-doped diamond electrode manufactured in collaboration with a group from the University of Technology in Bratislava, Slovakia. "It's a simple system: the electrode is connected to a portable potentiostat, which can be connected to a cell phone via its USB-C port or even via a wireless Bluetooth connection. The response is a current-voltage graph, with specific peaks that identify and quantify the substances present," Melo explains.

"This sensor represents a major innovation in the field of portable devices, as it combines the portability of printed sensors with the high stability of boron-doped diamond materials, which can be reused countless times," emphasizes Wallans Torres Pio dos Santos, a professor at the Federal University of Vale do Jequitinhonha and Mucuri, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and coordinator of the study.

The sensor was tested with two of the most common and dangerous synthetic cannabinoids, AB-Chminaca and MDMB-4en-Pinaca. It demonstrated the ability to detect concentrations as low as 0.2 µM, even in the presence of high levels of nicotine and other interferences. In chemistry, µM (micromolar) is a unit of measurement for the concentration of a substance in solution. One µM is equal to one millionth of a mole per liter.

"The great advantage of our device is its selectivity. Even with the complexity of the samples, we were able to focus only on the substances of interest. It's like entering a dark room and illuminating only the spot we want to observe," Santos compares.

In addition to its use as a screening tool by forensic police, the device can be used in public health to provide emergency care to individuals experiencing overdoses or other complications, as well as for preventive harm reduction initiatives. To this end, the research group partners with the "BACO Project: Toxicology and Toxicological Analysis as Sources of Information for Drug Policy". "The goal of this project is to evaluate the use of new psychoactive substances at parties and festivals by analyzing oral fluid samples. Our partnership with BACO researchers aims to extend the initial objective of the project to allow not only saliva analysis, but also the immediate screening of substances that partygoers intend to consume," Arantes explains.

"These synthetic cannabinoids are constantly changing. New variants are emerging all the time, and many of them are extremely potent and dangerous. Our goal is to develop technologies that can be put into practice. We want users to know what they're consuming and be able to make informed decisions. This can prevent serious poisoning and even save lives," Melo points out.

"Our surveys show that 63% of users don't know what they're consuming. Many think they're using a known drug, but in fact, they may be using a much more potent substance. By identifying the substance on the spot, the sensor gives users the chance to make an informed decision about its use. This alone reduces risks and saves lives," Santos points out.

The adaptability of the method is another strength highlighted by the researchers. "We've already developed sensors for other classes of substances, such as LSD and its synthetic analogues, cathinones, and phenylethylamines. We're also working on incorporating colorimetric reagents into the sensors to facilitate visual interpretation of the results," Arantes explains.

FAPESP supports the project through research grants awarded to José Luiz da Costa of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, who is a toxicology expert and partner in the group. Part of the analysis was done in collaboration with his laboratory, using real saliva samples collected in environments where the products are used.

"The saliva samples used in the study were collected as part of the BACO Project, developed at UNICAMP in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security [MJSP]. This project, in turn, is an offshoot of the research 'The Toxicology of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS): Epidemiology of Consumption through the Analysis of Hair and Oral Fluid Samples', also supported by FAPESP, in which we conducted the first epidemiological survey in Brazil on NPS at parties and festivals. Based on the results of this research, the MJSP decided to support and expand the study, allowing for a much larger number of samples to be collected, from 500 samples in the initial project to 2,500 in the current one. This allowed us to form new partnerships, including this one with Professor Wallans' group," says Costa.

"The goal is to take science where it can have a direct impact. Experts, doctors, and health professionals need accessible, fast, and reliable tools to face the challenges posed by new drugs. What we propose is a practical, portable, and scalable solution," Arantes summarizes.

Ochsner Health announces the launch of its Genetic Wellness Assessment, an innovative screening tool to help identify individuals at risk for hereditary cancers. The Genetic Wellness Assessment is now available for adults interested in learning more about their cancer risk at Ochsner.org/GeneticWellnessSurvey. 

The Genetic Wellness Assessment allows individuals to determine whether they may have a higher genetic risk of developing cancer by answering a few simple questions that evaluate individual risk factors. Those identified as having a high risk, or anyone interested in further evaluation, can schedule an appointment to discuss genetic testing. The results of genetic testing are used by healthcare providers to offer personalized recommendations for cancer screening, prevention and further evaluation for patients and family members. 

The Genetic Wellness Assessment is a pivotal step in advancing precision medicine and preventive care. This program allows us to proactively determine if patients are genetically predisposed to developing cancer. Once patients are identified, we can offer a tailored plan to prevent a cancer from developing or detecting it early when it's most treatable." 

Marc Matrana, MD, system medical director of precision medicine, Ochsner Health

Adults interested in taking the assessment can visit Ochsner.org/GeneticWellnessSurvey to complete the Genetic Wellness Assessment at no cost. The assessment evaluates a patient's personal and family history of cancer to identify their risk of having a genetic cancer syndrome. 

If a patient is identified as high risk, they are offered genetic counseling, testing, and a personalized cancer screening and prevention plan. 

It's estimated that hereditary cancer syndromes, like Lynch syndrome or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, are responsible for about 1 in 8 cancers. These conditions increase the risk of developing cancer at a younger age or in multiple family members. 

By identifying these risks early, Ochsner can help patients take preventive actions, such as specialized screenings or treatments, which can improve outcomes. Ochsner offers complete care and support through its Hereditary Cancer & High-Risk Program to ensure patients receive personalized attention and resources. 

"Advancements in genomics and precision medicine are transforming how we approach cancer prevention and treatment," said Dr. Matrana. "This program empowers patients with knowledge about their risk of developing cancer and connects them with a multidisciplinary team of experts to ensure they and their families receive the best in cancer prevention, early detection and treatment."

Currently, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women age 20 to 49 in the United States. Compounding this concerning issue, younger patients are being diagnosed at more advanced stages, according to doctors at NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center, and this points to a greater need for screening, prevention, and breast cancer education.

While this is a concerning trend, the quality of life for those diagnosed—even at stage 4, when it has spread to other parts of the body—is improving. Perlmutter Cancer Center is adapting to the landscape with the recent launch of the Early Onset Cancer Program, one of several programs aimed at targeting and tailoring treatment for people living with cancer.

This Breast Cancer Awareness Month, leading oncologists Elizabeth Comen, MD, co-director of the Mignone Women's Health Collaborative, and Mary L. Gemignani, MD, MPH, director of the Women's Early Onset Cancer Program and chief of the Division of Breast Surgery, answer the most important questions around the rise of cancer in younger adults.

Dr. Gemignani: While the median age at the time of diagnosis is 62, we're seeing early onset at a much younger age than that. Around 10 percent of the patients that we see today are 45 and younger. Over the last two decades, there's been an increase in diagnoses in people age 20 to 29 and 30 to 39. We're also seeing more aggressive molecular profiles among our younger patients, which poses a greater risk for prognosis and outcomes. Triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive subtype without many targeted treatment options, is also more common in younger women. The American Cancer Society reported that women under 50 are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to men of the same ages. This is primarily attributed to increasing rates of breast cancer.

Dr. Comen: Education about risk assessment and family history is crucial in addressing the increasing number of breast cancer diagnoses among young people. Patients should openly discuss their family medical history with their primary care physicians and consider taking a breast cancer risk-assessment test. Understanding your personal risk helps guide and tailor your care, regardless of whether you have a family history of the disease. For women at average risk, beginning routine screening at age 40 is generally appropriate. However, those at higher risk may need to start screening earlier. Additionally, women with dense breasts may benefit from supplemental imaging—such as ultrasound or breast MRI—in addition to standard mammograms. We advocate for grassroots education: start the conversation with your primary care provider, learn your family history, and collaborate with your doctor to monitor and manage any symptoms. If something feels off, speak up. Trust your instincts.

Dr. Gemignani: Health literacy and self-advocacy are also extremely important. Younger patients, whether they're undergoing screening, diagnosis, or treatment, are often navigating the healthcare system for the first time. A breast cancer diagnosis can be extremely overwhelming because there's so much terminology and medical language that people may not understand. Building a trusting relationship between the care team and the patient creates a safe space for questions and conversations, which empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care.

Dr. Comen: At Perlmutter Cancer Center, we recognize that treating breast cancer goes beyond addressing the biology of the disease. It's also about supporting the whole patient experience. Every individual's journey is unique, and young women in particular may face distinct challenges related to their stage of life, including concerns about fertility, parenting young children, career demands, and family responsibilities. Our approach is focused not only on treatment, but also on preserving quality of life and helping patients maintain their roles and identities outside of their diagnosis. This includes addressing important issues such as nutrition, exercise, emotional wellbeing, sexual health, and overall functioning in daily life. Our goal is to provide care that supports the whole person—not only treats the cancer.

Dr. Gemignani: When we established the Early Onset Cancer Program, we were thinking about these types of lifestyle changes and priorities like family planning. In your 30s to 40s, your friends could be going on a night out, and you are buying a cold cap and getting ready for chemo. That is difficult for people. The Early Onset Cancer Program was designed with these moments in mind. Survivorship has really evolved into a holistic, individual, and personal experience, and our program honors that.

Dr. Comen: There are several innovative programs we have invested in and now offer to oncology patients. One is the Oncofertility Program, which helps any cancer patient at NYU Langone understand and pursue their fertility options as part of their cancer treatment. Any provider in the health system—including nurses and physician assistants—can refer patients to a team of dedicated fertility nurse navigators.

Dr. Gemignani: We also launched the Cardio-Oncology Program in October 2024, enabling patients and their oncologists to create personalized care plans to protect and treat the heart for newly diagnosed patients, those actively receiving treatment, or cancer survivors. We also offer services for psychosocial distress, sexual health, rehabilitation, and sickness from hormone therapy, as well as exercise and physical therapy, yoga, and access to social workers as part of our Survivorship Program.

We are committed to providing younger cancer patients personalized care that meets their individual needs and gives them the best quality of life possible. There are more people living with cancer now than ever before, and the oncology field has come a long way in how we think about survivorship and treat the specific needs of younger cancer patients.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on August 22, 2025, titled, "The impact of long-term social housing on biconditional association task performance and neuron ensembles in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampal CA3 region of aged rats."

The research team led by Anne M. Dankert from Providence College and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, showed that aged rats who lived in socially enriched environments throughout life retained better memory and cognitive flexibility than those housed alone. This study highlights the importance of social interaction in protecting the aging brain.

Cognitive decline, such as memory loss and reduced problem-solving ability, affects many people over the age of 65. While many factors contribute to age-related cognitive decline, this study suggests that one key factor may be surprisingly simple: long-term social connection. To explore how social interaction might influence memory performance and brain activity, the researchers designed a study using rats as a model for aging in humans.

"Cognitive decline and changes in neuronal activity are hallmarks of aging."

They compared three groups of rats: young adults, aged rats housed alone, and aged rats housed socially in groups. All groups had access to the same physical enrichment, such as exercise and stimulating objects, but only some experienced lifelong social companionship. The team tested these animals on a complex memory challenge known as the biconditional association task, which requires animals to make context-based decisions-an ability that typically declines with age.

The results showed that aged rats living in social groups performed just as well as young adults on the memory task, while those housed alone showed significant impairments. Socially housed rats also made fewer working memory errors and required less effort to complete cognitive tasks, suggesting not only better performance but more efficient brain function. These benefits were not observed in aged rats who received only environmental enrichment without social interaction.

Brain imaging revealed additional differences between the groups. Socially housed aged rats showed increased activity in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA3 region, which plays a key role in forming and separating memories. In contrast, aged rats that lived alone had lower activity in this region, which may explain their poorer performance. Interestingly, socially housed rats also showed reduced overactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex-a brain area involved in attention and decision-making-suggesting a more balanced and efficient neural response.

This research provides new insight into how lifelong social experiences shape brain health during aging. While earlier studies have shown that physical activity and cognitive stimulation help preserve cognitive function, this study identifies social interaction as an independent and powerful protective factor. The findings are consistent with human studies showing that older adults who remain socially active tend to experience slower cognitive decline and stronger brain function.

Overall, these results emphasize that brain aging is not inevitable but may be influenced by our social environments. This research suggests that fostering lifelong social connections could be a critical, low-cost strategy to protect memory and mental flexibility in older adults.

Poor blood sugar control in adolescence increases the risk of painful future complications for people with type 1 diabetes, research co-led by University of Michigan suggests.

The study, which followed participants for over 30 years, highlights how children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age have trouble controlling their blood sugar as teens.

Investigators found that children who had poor glycemic control - meaning, higher-than-average blood sugar levels - during adolescence were more likely to develop neuropathy in adulthood.

Neuropathy is nerve damage that can cause pain, numbness and tingling in the extremities. Of nearly 40 million Americans with diabetes, up to 50% may receive a neuropathy diagnosis.

Results are published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

This unique study emphasizes the importance of supporting teenagers with type 1 diabetes to manage their blood sugar well and ensure a smooth transition to adult care to prevent future complications."

Children in the study received a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes before the age of six. Researchers accessed nearly 2,000 of the participants' HbA1c (blood sugar) readings over the course of three decades.

During adolescence, participants had an average blood sugar reading of 8.9%, higher than averages during both childhood and adulthood.

Participants with the greatest increase in HbA1c levels from childhood to adolescence not only retained higher blood sugar levels in adulthood, but they also had a greater risk for neuropathy.

"Our findings suggest that difficulties maintaining blood sugar in adolescence may lead to greater difficulties in achieving future glycemic control," Feldman said.

"Although the mechanisms behind that association are unclear, hyperglycemia leads to impairments in cell metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose regulation, all of which could cause long-term challenges in optimal glycemic control."

Adolescent hyperglycemia is likely not the only contributor to risk of future complications, such as neuropathy, says Kara Mizokami-Stout, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at U-M Medical School, who was not involved in the study.

"While clear links between glycemia and neuropathy have been found in type 1 diabetes, we know there are also vascular risk factors that play a key role in the development of neuropathy," Mizokami-Stout said.

"However, this study does underscore the need to maximize our support for younger individuals with diabetes."

A team of researchers from Keio University School of Medicine, the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, and the National Center for Child Health and Development has reported the first cross-disease, cross-stakeholder survey on PPIE in Japan. The study compared allergy research with cancer and rare diseases, fields where PPIE has already advanced. 

The survey revealed that:•100% of allergy-related PAGs considered PPIE essential, and 50% had formal rules for engagement.

•By contrast, only 9.4% of allergy researchers reported established rules, and just 50% recognized PPIE as necessary-lower than in cancer and rare disease research (64.7%).

•PAGs identified three priorities: (1) training programs for both patients and researchers, (2) coordinators to support collaboration, and (3) toolkits and case studies to guide implementation.

•PAGs widely used digital tools for communication (100%), while adoption among researchers was minimal (6.3–15.6%). 

These findings show that allergy patient advocacy groups in Japan are ready and willing to engage, but researchers have yet to catch up. Closing this gap is critical, especially since allergy management depends heavily on daily-life factors such as environment and lifestyle. Patient perspectives are essential to shaping meaningful research." 

Dr. Takeya ADACHI, corresponding author and dermatologist at Keio University

The study also emphasized that these results align with the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) initiatives to promote PPIE as part of national health policy. Their presentation at the UNGA Science Summit 2025 further highlights the global significance of advancing inclusive, patient-centered research practices.

Stress granules are droplet-like protein hubs that temporarily shield fragile RNA from cellular stresses such as toxins. VCP is a protein essential for breaking up stress granules and has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, VCP has a protein partner, ASPL, whose role has been unclear until now. Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital discovered that ASPL regulates stress granule disassembly by facilitating VCP phosphorylation. They also found ASPL facilitates stress granule assembly independent of VCP by stabilizing interactions among core stress granule proteins. The findings, published today in Science Advances, provide key insight into the link between stress granules and neurodegenerative disease.

Stress granules are carefully regulated, forming only during stresses, such as heat or infection, and disassembling once the stress is resolved. Mutations in proteins such as VCP can derail this cycle, leading to the abnormal accumulation of proteins, which causes a condition called multisystem proteinopathy. 

"VCP mutations are found in patients with multisystem proteinopathy, which includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Paget's disease of bone," said corresponding author Mondira Kundu, MD, PhD, St. Jude Department of Cell & Molecular Biology. "While VCP has multiple functions, its ability to disassemble RNA-protein assemblies, such as stress granules, is impaired by disease-causing mutations."

After discovering that VCP and ASPL interact with ULK, another protein involved in regulating stress granule disassembly, Kundu and her team decided to dig into the relationship. "ULK regulates stress granule dynamics, so we wondered whether ASPL was also involved through its interaction with either ULK or VCP," Kundu said. 

The team found that ASPL was required for ULK to carry out its function, which is VCP's phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group). Phosphorylation triggers VCP to remove the keystone stress granule protein G3BP from stress granules, causing them to break up. Without VCP phosphorylation, the stress granules persist. 

These findings are consistent with what occurs during multisystem proteinopathy.

Certain disease-causing VCP mutants don't interact as well with ASPL and ULK, and also have stress granule disassembly defects. Restoring VCP phosphorylation restores disassembly, suggesting that these mutants decrease VCP binding to ASPL and subsequent phosphorylation by ULK."

Mondira Kundu, Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

In a surprising turn, the researchers also observed that ASPL overexpression sharply increased stress granule formation. Removing ASPL resulted in smaller and slower-forming stress granules. This suggested that ASPL plays a role in stress granule assembly. But this function of ASPL did not involve VCP, so the researchers set out to tease apart how ASPL could promote the formation of stress granules on its own, independent of VCP.

"We created cell lines that express a version of ASPL that cannot bind VCP and found that these cells had no problems with granule assembly but did a poor job with disassembly," Kundu said. "This showed us that ASPL promoted stress granule assembly, and ASPL's interaction with VCP is important for efficient disassembly."

The researchers discovered this mechanism was tied to G3BP. "Removing ASPL decreased interactions between stress granule components, lowering the probability of stress granules being formed," Kundu explained. "Fluorescence recovery experiments suggested that ASPL alters G3BP's interactions with other proteins, making the network less stable without ASPL."

These findings add nuance to scientists' understanding of stress granule regulation, expanding on the checks and balances that govern the process and highlighting potential pathways to disease. "A key question is whether disrupting the ASPL-VCP interaction, specifically through ASPL, can mimic multisystem proteinopathy," Kundu said. "That's the biggest missing link currently, and one we are exploring."

Keloids are raised, overgrown scars that can develop after skin injuries or surgery, often extending beyond the original wound boundaries. For many people, keloids are more than just a cosmetic concern; they often cause distressing symptoms such as chronic pain, itching, and restricted movement. While various treatment options exist, such as surgical removal, steroid injections, and radiation, keloids are notoriously difficult to manage, with recurrence rates reaching as high as 30%.

Even after decades of study, it is still unclear why keloids grow uncontrollably, unlike hypertrophic scars. The current understanding is that an overproduction of extracellular matrix collagen by fibroblasts-cells that produce elements of connective tissue-is involved and that repeated mechanical tension on the skin contributes to keloid formation. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms driving this uncontrolled scarring are unclear. More specifically, we don't know how or which cells sense the mechanical pressure and ultimately translate it into abnormal tissue growth.

Now, a study made available online on July 31, 2025, and published in Volume 267, Issue 1 of The Journal of Pathology on September 01, 2025, provides a new piece to this puzzle. A research team led by Professor Yuzuru Ikehara, along with co-first authors Dr. Shinsuke Akita and Dr. Sanae Ikehara, and co-authors Prof. Kiyoshi Hirahara, and Prof. Nobuyuki Mitsukawa, all from the Graduate School of Medicine at Chiba University, Japan, investigated the histological, genetic, and molecular differences between keloids and other fibrotic conditions to pinpoint the unique drivers of keloid formation and recurrence.

While analyzing fibrotic tissue from lymphedema in collaboration with plastic surgeons, I conceived the idea that comparing it with keloid tissue might help identify pathological alterations specific to keloid fibroblasts. Although both conditions involve fibrosis, their underlying physiological contexts and etiologies differ substantially." 

Dr. Sanae Ikehara, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University

The study involved a comprehensive analysis of human tissue samples. The team compared keloid tissues with those from lymphedema, a condition characterized by fibrous overgrowth but not primarily driven by mechanical tension, along with healthy skin samples. They employed several advanced techniques, including global gene expression analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing; these methods allowed them to examine gene activity in individual cells and precisely characterize the cell types involved. Through this detailed approach, the researchers sought to pinpoint mechanosensitive cells and molecules contributing to keloid pathology and recurrence.

A key discovery was that keloid tissues exhibited significantly higher expression levels of a mechanosensitive ion channel called PIEZO2, compared to lymphedema tissues. Simply put, PIEZO2 acts as a microscopic sensor, allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical forces. The researchers observed that keloids with a history of recurrence after surgery showed even higher levels of PIEZO2.

Further investigation using single-cell analysis identified a previously unknown subpopulation of fibroblasts that specifically expressed high levels of PIEZO2. These PIEZO2-expressing fibroblasts (called FBPZ2+) were found to be highly active in the production of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix, which are the building blocks of scar tissue. The team also observed that these FBPZ2+ cells clustered around blood and lymphatic vessels in keloid tissue, particularly in actively growing areas.

"Connective tissue is not composed merely of fibroblasts-it also contains immune cells, blood vessels, and nerves, all of which work together to maintain the proper homeostasis, a critical factor in supporting organ-specific functions," explains Prof. Ikehara. "Therefore, just as studies of immune and neural cell components have advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative and allergic diseases, investigating fibroblasts may help uncover the mechanisms underlying keloid formation." Indeed, this study represents a significant step in that direction by highlighting the unique role of FBPZ2+cells.

Most importantly, the identification of these PIEZO2-expressing fibroblasts has profound implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of keloids. The study findings reveal that keloid formation is not merely a generalized overgrowth but a unique process driven by specific tension-sensing cells.

"Our work offers new insights into the pathogenesis of keloids and opens the door to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies," says Prof. Ikehara. "For example, PIEZO2 inhibitors, which are a type of calcium ion channel blocker, may help alleviate pain and itching associated with keloids. If such targeted therapies become clinically available, they could greatly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from keloid-related discomfort."

Taken together, this study contributes to the development of therapeutic strategies to restore healthy connective tissue, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

PlasmidFactory GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to combine expertise in cell therapy process development and GMP manufacturing, aiming to accelerate non-viral cell and gene therapies for the benefit of patients.

PlasmidFactory GmbH, a leading European CDMO for plasmid and Minicircle DNA, brings more than 25 years of experience and over 3,500 DNA constructs delivered worldwide. The Fraunhofer IZI contributes extensive translational capabilities in immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine, and advanced cell manufacturing.

Together, they are accelerating the development of next-generation, virus-free genetic engineering platforms while maintaining the highest quality and regulatory standards.

In the past, the two partners have already successfully established new manufacturing processes for CAR-T cells at Fraunhofer IZI and conducted joint research projects on virus-free gene transfer, which served as the foundation for the production of clinical cell products.

By building on our long-standing collaboration, this partnership allows us to translate scientific innovation into tangible therapeutic advances.

Together, we can streamline non-viral manufacturing workflows and bring promising therapies to patients more efficiently.”

Dr. Dirk Winnemöller, CEO, PlasmidFactory

Prof. Dr. Michael Hudecek, Fraunhofer IZI, adds: “PlasmidFactory's expertise in high-quality DNA manufacturing perfectly complements our translational capabilities. By joining forces, we can further advance non-viral engineering platforms and help shape the future of cell and gene therapies.”

Viral vectors remain the standard in many therapies, but they are associated with high costs, complex production, and safety concerns such as insertional mutagenesis. Minicircle DNA overcomes the limitations of conventional plasmids with higher transfection efficiency, stronger and more stable expression, and lower DNA toxicity – making it a real alternative to viral vectors and a key enabler of virus-free engineering approaches for CAR-T, TCR-T, NK, and other immune cell therapies.

The collaboration underscores a shared commitment to advancing virus-free technologies such as minicircles and transposon systems, which have the potential to overcome bottlenecks in viral vector production. By aligning innovation with patient needs, PlasmidFactory and Fraunhofer IZI are creating a platform that strengthens Europe's position in the global race for advanced therapies.

More than 54,600 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely malnourished, including over 12,800 severely so, with few therapeutic options available to them. With measurements up to the middle of August 2025, the study comprehensively tracks wasting among children during the war, estimates population prevalence, and highlights unprecedented increases in child malnutrition following periods of blockades and severe aid restrictions.

Published in The Lancet, the study was led by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Between January 2024 and mid-August 2025, UNRWA staff screened 219,783 children aged 6-59 months, measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) at 16 functioning health centres and 78 medical points in shelters and tented encampments across five governorates in the Gaza Strip. The researchers then estimated the prevalence of acute malnutrition, based on the total estimated number of children in that age group in the territory (346,000).

Based on evidence of child malnutrition collected from multiple aid agencies, on 15 August 2025 the UN Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in the Governate of Gaza City, with the rest of the Gaza Strip facing critical conditions or the prospect of famine. The study reenforces the IPC's confirmation of famine in Gaza City Governorate, and provides evidence of how child malnutrition has evolved during the war.

Wasting, or acute malnutrition, is defined as a child being too thin for their height, indicating rapid weight loss and severe lack of energy, protein and other nutrients. Wasting can also be assessed by measuring the circumference of a child's upper arm with a calibrated tape, as done in this study, with a thin arm highly correlating to a thin body. It is a life-threatening condition, and children require regular treatment with therapeutic food over several weeks, or in extreme cases and when possible, hospitalisation.

During the 20-month surveillance period, the number of MUAC screenings varied from 722 to 23,651 per month. Prevalence of wasting in January 2024 was 4.7% (34 out of 722 children), rising to 8.9% (1,281/14,387) in July 2024. The end of 2024 saw severe aid restrictions, with UN sources reporting daily averages of 42 to 92 aid trucks per day crossing into Gaza, compared to 300 to 600 per day pre-war. In January 2025, prevalence of wasting was 14.3% (1,661/11,619).

In early 2025, a six-week ceasefire allowed for increased aid to enter the Gaza Strip, and wasting declined to 5.5% by March 2025 (831 out of 15,165 children). A subsequent 11-week blockade followed, with severe restrictions on the entry of food, water, fuel, medicines and other essentials, was in place until late May 2025.

The latest measurements, taken through mid-August 2025, found that 15.8% (1,213/7,668) of screened children were wasted, 3.7% (280/7,668) severely so. Extrapolated to the estimated total population of the Gaza Strip, this is equivalent to over 54,600 children aged 6-59 months in need of urgent therapeutic nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children with little chance of rehabilitation given the inadequate amounts of food crossing the borders, and the cripped health and nutrition services. 

Trends were most extreme in some areas – for instance, in Rafah there was an increase in wasting malnutrition from 7.1% (273/3,855) in April 2024 to 31.5% (63/200) in January 2025, decreasing to 8% in April 2025, in association with the ceasefire, although screening was ceased in this area shortly after. In Gaza City, prevalence rose six-fold from 5.4% (373/6,908) in March 2025, to 28.8% (631/2,194) in mid-August 2025.

Since October 7, 2023, an unprecedented war has unfolded across the Gaza Strip. From the outset, the territory's infrastructure has been destroyed, the population repeatedly displaced and, with few exceptions, humanitarian aid has been severely restricted. Given the long failure to stop the war and prevent encroaching famine despite a global capacity to do so, unless there is a lasting cessation of the conflict coupled with unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services, a further deterioration in early childhood nutrition with increased mortality are inevitable in the Gaza Strip."

Dr. Akihiro Seita, Director of Health, UNRWA 
 

Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist, UNRWA and lead scientist for the study, adds: "Evidence prior to Oct 2023 indicated that children in Palestine refugee families in the Gaza Strip were food insecure and had poor dietary diversity. Yet, they were only marginally underweight. This paradox was likely explained by these families' regular access to food aid. Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of pre-school aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality."

The authors note that data collected was limited to available, functioning UNRWA facilities. Two-thirds of screenings were conducted in Khan Younis and Middle areas, due to challenges of operating health centres in other areas. A total of 265,974 screenings were done for 219,783 children, indicating some children were screened more than once over time. Researchers faced considerable challenges including lack of identity information, and unsafe locations making data collection challenging.

In a linked Comment, Zulfiqar A Bhutta (Aga Khan University, Pakistan & Hospital for Sick Children, Canada), Jessica Fanzo (Columbia University, USA) and Paul H Wise (Stanford University School of Medicine, USA), who were not involved in the study, write: "These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations... Although immediate attention has been paid to the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be serious concern for the well documented long-term effects, such as intergenerational consequences of starvation and food restriction in children, including inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases and reduced life expectancy."

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the cells that produce insulin-a critical hormone that regulates blood sugar in the body. Scientists at Scripps Research recently discovered a new kind of cell that helps protect insulin production, paving the way to understanding how researchers could prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes.

The new findings, published in Cell Reports on September 23, 2025, reveal how vascular-associated fibroblastic cells (VAFs) act as molecular peacekeepers in the pancreas-actively protecting insulin-producing cells from the immune system. This discovery helps explain several puzzling features of type 1 diabetes, including why the disease often has such a long preclinical phase-the symptom-free, early stage of the disease where the immune system is beginning to destroy insulin-producing cells, but blood sugar levels are still normal-and suggests that early intervention could be feasible in the future.

Identifying these VAFs is an exciting step toward a better understanding of how the pancreas interacts with the immune system. This finding unlocks a new understanding of autoimmunity and could help us design better therapeutics for type 1 diabetes and inform how we prevent or reverse the disease."

Luc Teyton, professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and senior author of the study

For the 1.6 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes, managing the disease often requires time-consuming daily management. In addition to multiple daily insulin injections, blood sugar monitoring and a carefully regulated diet, type 1 diabetics face serious, life-threatening risks if their blood sugar levels aren't within healthy ranges or well controlled.

To identify VAFs, Teyton and his lab took an unconventional approach that focused on the physiology and pathology of the pancreas. The team zeroed in on a site often responsible for inflammation-the post-capillary venules-and then used a combination of imaging, cell-labeling and single-cell analysis to examine how a healthy pancreas kept inflammation at bay. They used a cell-labeling technique, called FucoID, which was developed by Scripps Research professor Peng Wu and allowed the team to quickly identify and isolate cells of interest.

The researchers found that VAFs have a variety of specialized functions that prevent autoimmune attacks on insulin-producing cells. As immune cells travel around the body to detect danger or damage, they depend on antigen presentation-a process in which other cells display protein fragments to help determine whether an immune response is needed. VAFs participate in this process by presenting pieces of the pancreas, while also sending signals that placate the immune system and induce a tolerant state called anergy-thereby halting an autoimmune response.

The pancreas faces unique immunological challenges as part of the digestive system: it is constantly exposed to potential inflammatory triggers from food and the environment. Teyton and his lab identified that persistent inflammation of the pancreas-whether from infection, environmental toxins or other triggers-causes VAFs to become overwhelmed, forcing the immune system to activate and induce type 1 diabetes. Once in a state of overwhelm, autoimmunity proliferates in the pancreas-destroying the valuable insulin-producing cells that balance the body's blood sugar levels.

"This discovery reframes how we think about type 1 diabetes," says former Scripps Research postdoctoral researcher and first author, Don Clarke. "Rather than just asking why the immune system attacks, we can now ask: what disrupts the pancreas' natural ability to maintain tolerance? And more importantly, how can we restore it?"

The protective nature of VAFs offers a new path for researchers to explore, shifting their focus to understanding how they can enhance the body's natural tolerance mechanisms. Looking ahead, the team envisions developing therapies that strengthen VAFs' specialized functions, such as increasing states of anergy and exploring anti-inflammatory treatments that could protect these cellular peacekeepers from being overwhelmed by inflammation. The work also has broader implications for understanding other autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation, where similar tolerance mechanisms may be at play.

As researchers advance these findings from laboratory discoveries to clinical applications, they aspire to develop personalized treatments that work with the body's own protective systems rather than against them and potentially improve the outlook for millions at risk for type 1 diabetes. Teyton and his lab were recently awarded $3.2 million dollars by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to support this novel approach. In collaboration with Scripps Research Assistant Professor Joseph Jardine, the team aims to more deeply study and understand the role of VAFs as pancreatic cell peacekeepers. They also hope to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance or restore VAFs' protective functions when overwhelmed by inflammation. This way, treatment options could prevent type 1 diabetes by strengthening the body's own tolerance mechanisms, rather than broadly suppressing immunity.

When older adults living in nursing homes are prescribed the pain medicine tramadol alongside certain antidepressants, their risk of seizures may go up, according to a study published October 8, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. While this study found a link between using the medications together and an increased risk of seizures, it does not prove one causes the other.

Tramadol is an opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain in adults. Some antidepressants that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme, called CYP2D6 inhibitors, can interfere with how the body metabolizes tramadol. When the CYP2D6 enzyme is blocked, tramadol is not metabolized properly and may build up in the body, potentially increasing the risk of side effects like seizures. Common CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants include fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion.

We found a modest but measurable increase in the risk of seizures when tramadol was taken with antidepressants that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme. This risk was consistent whether the antidepressant or tramadol was started first."

Yu-Jung Jenny Wei, PhD, study author, The Ohio State University, Columbus

Researchers analyzed 10 years of Medicare data to identify 70,156 nursing home residents age 65 and older who had been prescribed both tramadol and an antidepressant.

They divided participants into two groups based on which drugs they took first. Of participants, 11,162 people took tramadol first and then an antidepressant with it, while 58,994 people took an antidepressant first and then added tramadol.

Seizure rates for people who took tramadol first were 16 seizures per 100 person-years, and for people who took antidepressants first, the rate was 20 seizures per 100 person-years. This means for every 100 people who used both tramadol and an antidepressant followed for one year, about 16 or 20 received a seizure diagnosis.

In both groups, researchers then compared seizure rates between those who took tramadol with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants and those who took tramadol with antidepressants that do not inhibit the enzyme. In those who took tramadol first and added an antidepressant, the rate was 18 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 16 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants. In those who took antidepressants first and added tramadol, the rate was 22 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 20 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants.

To help ensure the differences were not due to other health issues, the researchers adjusted for factors such as pain levels, depression symptoms, physical function and cognitive ability.

After adjustments, for people who took tramadol first, seizure risk was 9% higher when taking it with a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to with an antidepressant that did not inhibit this enzyme. For those who took an antidepressant first and added tramadol, the risk was about 6% higher for people who took a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to people who took an antidepressant that did not inhibit the enzyme.

To test whether this interaction was specific to tramadol, the researchers repeated the analysis using hydrocodone, another opioid pain reliever that is unlikely to cause seizure risk when used with antidepressants. No increased seizure risk was observed with hydrocodone and CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants.

"These findings underscore the need for careful prescribing practices, especially for older adults with complex health conditions," said Wei. "Doctors should be aware of potential seizure risks when prescribing tramadol with antidepressants, particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Given how commonly both are prescribed to older adults, these interactions may be more important than previously thought."

A limitation of the study was that medication data came from prescription records, which did not confirm whether patients took the drugs as directed.

This research was supported by the National Institute on Aging.

How can we explain the erratic, reckless, or even aggressive behavior of certain people in the public spotlight? An international research team consisting of members from Freie Universität Berlin, Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, and University Psychiatric Clinics Basel has investigated the specific psychodynamic mechanisms constituting the distinguishing features of personality disorders. Its findings could help to explain the factors underlying erratic, narcissistic, or even aggressive behavior. The results were recently published in the British Journal of Psychiatry and are available at: doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2025.10347.

The research team demonstrated that particular difficulties, such as problems establishing closeness and mutually satisfying relationships, a fragile or unstable self-image, struggles in understanding the experiences and motives of others, and primitive defense mechanisms (for example, attacking others when experiencing negative emotions or blaming uninvolved parties, a mechanism called projection), are central features of personality disorders. These psychological mechanisms may offer short-term protection from distressing emotions, but significantly impair relationships and social life in the long run. Such patterns are often rooted in adverse childhood experiences.

The study is based on in-depth interviews and clinical diagnoses of over 500 people in Germany and Switzerland. It not only provides new scientific insights into the development and nature of personality disorders, but could also inform potential approaches in therapy and prevention. Psychodynamic concepts, such as working with defense mechanisms or addressing closeness in relationships, could be integrated into treatments in a more targeted way in the future.

A better understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed, especially in a time when political and societal crises are so often characterized by escalating conflicts, splitting, projection, a fear of vulnerability and intimacy, and a lack of empathy."

RANCAGUA, Chile (October 9, 2025) – The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team utilized a 15th minute goal from captain Benjamin Cremaschi, a 79th minute free kick from Niko Tsakris and another goal from Cremaschi in the third minute of second half stoppage time to claim a well-earned 3-0 win against Italy in the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Round of 16 match at Estadio El Teniente.

With the result, the USA has beaten both France and Italy by 3-0 scores in this tournament and advanced to its fifth-straight FIFA U-20 World Cup Quarterfinal where it will face the winner of Thursday's other match between Morocco-Korea Republic at Estadio Teniente in Rancagua on Sunday, Oct. 12 at 4 p.m. ET (FOX Soccer Plus, Universo, Peacock). 

Primed to bounce back after the 2-1 defeat to South Africa, U.S. head coach Marko Mitrović made seven changes to the lineup that started Sunday's group finale and the teams played relatively even through the early part of the match. 

The stalemate nearly broke in the eighth minute as the first dangerous chances came from Italy. Attacker Mattia Mosconi earned some space on the right flank and swung in a cross that swerved with the wind before it clanged off the left post and was cleared away for a corner kick. On the ensuing take, the ball found its way to Christian Corradi whose snap header was well-saved by U.S. ‘keeper Adam Beaudry. 

The USA staved off that early danger and then built up to the first goal. In the 14th minute, a cross from the left found Zavier Gozo at the far post. He settled and touched the ball to the top of the penalty box for Cremaschi and the U.S. captain fired a first time effort that was turned out for a corner kick by Italy ‘keeper Jacopo Seghetti. On the ensuring corner kick, Tsakiris hit a service from the right that was headed down by Nolan Norris, forcing another save from Seghetti, but Cremaschi was there on the doorstep to poke home the rebound and claim his fourth goal of the tournament.

Italy came close in the 35th minute as Mattia Mannini did well to break through the U.S. midfield before sliding a ball to Cristian Cama on the left. His first-time cross was nodded up in the air, before falling for Jamal Iddrissou whose effort from the ground was well-held by Beaudry.

Italy pressed hard on the U.S. back line in the 42nd minute and nearly unlocked the defense before Beaudry's low clearance made it to midfield where the U.S. found it had numbers in transition. Tsakiris possessed the ball in the center circle and sent Cole Campbell in one-on-one with an Italy defender. The winger drove toward the end line before attempting a chip that sailed just wide of the left post in the 42nd minute and the U.S. went into the locker room holding on to a 1-0 halftime lead. 

The first 15 minutes of the second half was mostly devoid of opportunities, but Italy provided the first danger on the hour mark as Mannini picked up a loose ball from 25 yards out and fired a bouncing effort that Beaudry gobbled up. Italy continued to threaten and in the 73rd minute Javison Idele drove in a dangerous cross from the right that Beaudry stretched out at full extension to claim at the back post. 

The USA bit back in the 75th minute as substitute Luke Brennan chased down a through ball on the right and stretched to send in low cross into the box. An Italy defender deflected it out of the area, but it eventually fell for Tsakiris who unleashed a knuckling blast that forced Seghetti to make a diving save to his right and push the ball out for a corner kick. 

After threatening just moments before, Tsakiris bagged the USA's second. The U.S. midfielder earned the dead ball after being fouled just outside the penalty area on the left in the 78th minute. Both he and Cremaschi stood over the ball and the U.S. captain looked like he would take it, but instead Tsakiris stepped up and hit a curling left-footed effort that bent around the left side of Italy wall and tucked inside the left post to make it 2-0. It was a brilliant set play finish. 

Italy pushed hard to get back in the game and requested not one but two plays to be reviewed by the Video Support System for penalty kicks, but both were correctly denied by the center ref.

The young Americans ended any Italian hope in the third minute of stoppage time when Brennan unlocked the Italian defense with a square ball from the right and then sent Cremaschi in on goal. He lifted the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the center of the goal from about 11 yards out to seal the match and the berth in the tournament's final eight nations.

AUSTIN, Texas – U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said Christian Pulisic did not train on Thursday and is a question mark for Friday's game against Ecuador.

“I need to communicate that we have some issues in some players, like Christian [Pulisic], who didn't train today,” Pochettino said, not offering any other further specifics but also indicating that Alejandro Zendejas and Antonee Robinson sat out Thursday as well. “We need to assess tomorrow [if] they can be available or not.”

Pulisic had spoken to the media earlier in the day but did not mention any issues, injury or otherwise. Instead, he focused on the importance for the U.S. team to come out of this international window with not just good performances, but also good results. After meeting La Tri, the U.S. will host Australia, another World Cup-bound opponent, next Tuesday in Colorado.

“It's as simple as that,” Pulisic said. “We want to kind of understand and know where our team is at and have a good feeling going forward as we get closer to the summer.”

Pulisic arrived in Austin in strong form with AC Milan. The U.S. No. 10 was named Serie A player of the month and has six goals and two assists for Milan across all competitions. Pulisic missed a penalty kick in Sunday's draw with Juventus, but he remains one of the most important players for both club and country.

The run of form has been validation for Pulisic, who asked to take the Gold Cup off so that he could let his body heal ahead of preseason with Milan. The decision created controversy among fans, media and former players, but Pulisic insisted at the time that it would prove to be the right decision.

On Thursday, he made sure to point out that he didn't just spend his summer on the beach.

“I worked really hard this summer,” Pulisic said. “It's not like I just took a break. I wanted to make sure that my body was in the perfect spot coming into the season, and I wanted to start really strong, and I worked really hard. And it's just been consistency and the work I've put in, and it's good to see it come to fruition and (to be) playing well. But it's just the start of the season. I have so much more I want to accomplish.”

The U.S. will need Pulisic to be at his best if it's to advance in next summer's World Cup.

Pulisic has mostly started on the wing for the U.S., but in the 3-4-2-1 formation utilized by Mauricio Pochettino in a 2-0 win over Japan last month, Pulisic played underneath the striker. It's a position he believes could be a good one for his skillset.

“I think I can do well in a lot of the attacking positions, but I've always felt comfortable coming off the left side, but also being in sort of pockets in behind the striker,” he said. “I've always been pretty comfortable in that position. It allows me to use some of my strengths, get in the box, make runs in behind. So I think it's a good spot.”

The key for the U.S. now isn't just unlocking Pulisic's club form on the international stage, but continuing to build momentum from the Japan win into this window. While friendlies are a proving ground in which the result isn't as important, the American team is in need of some validation to the process under Pochettino.

Wins now build trust and momentum, and piling up those results is crucial as the World Cup nears.

“I think we're settling in well,” Pulisic said. “Now it's about building good performances one after the other. After last camp feeling good, now it's a great opportunity.”

The United States rolled to a 3-0 victory over Italy at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup on Thursday, booking a quarterfinal spot with their Round of 16 triumph in Rancagua, Chile.

Inter Miami CF midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi, who's on loan at Italian Serie A side Parma, scored twice to take the Golden Boot lead. San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Niko Tsakiris also scored his second goal of the tournament, while Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Adam Beaudry posted a shutout.

Cremaschi found a 15th-minute opener, stabbing a close-range finish past Italian goalkeeper Jacopo Seghetti after FC Dallas left back Nolan Norris' header was saved off the line. He then added an exclamation point in the 93rd minute, chipping over Seghetti following a powerful run out of midfield.

Tsakiris ensured the US win with just over 10 minutes remaining, curling a low free-kick around the wall and inside the near post.

The Italians battled back throughout the middle stages of the match, including hitting the woodwork once, but couldn't find a way past the US backline that included Norris and Philadelphia Union defender Frankie Westfield.

Bukayo Saka etched his name into history on Thursday night, becoming Arsenal's all-time leading men's goalscorer for England after netting a stunning strike against Wales. Just a day after celebrating five years since his Three Lions debut, the 23-year-old produced a trademark curling finish to register his 13th goal for the national team and surpass Gunners' legend Cliff Bastin's record.

The U.S. men's national team is back in action to kick off the penultimate international window of 2025, as they take on Ecuador at Austin FC's Q2 Stadium before looking ahead to a matchup with Australia. 

Against Ecuador, the USMNT faces the second-place finishers in South American World Cup qualifying and the 24th-ranked team in the world, providing Mauricio Pochettino's side with a strong test. 

While Pochettino's first year with the USMNT saw some less-than-ideal outcomes, the Argentine manager may have found a new lease on success with his adjustment to a 3-4-3 formation, which led to a 2–0 win over Japan. 

It would be easy to stick the Stars and Stripes into its usual 4-3-3, but that has not garnered results, leaving Pochettino with a major decision to make for Friday's clash.

Here's what the USMNT's XI could look like against Ecuador. 

GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper has been the de facto No. 1 in 2025 for the USMNT, and there has been no legitimate challenger in recent months, even with Matt Turner back in MLS with the New England Revolution. 

CB: Tim Ream—The Charlotte FC veteran shifts to right center back, allowing him to link up with Alex Freeman on the right side. 

CB: Cameron Carter-Vickers—Vancouver Whitecaps FC defender Tristan Blackmon started against Japan in the back three, but is not on the roster for October, so Celtic FC mainstay Carter-Vickers comes back in. 

CB: Chris Richards—The Crystal Palace stalwart has been the USMNT's best defender in 2025, and is arguably the team's most important defensive player. 

RWB: Alex Freeman—It's been a breakout year with the USMNT and Orlando City SC for Alex Freeman, and he appears as much of a lock to start for Pochettino as anyone. 

CM: Malik Tillman—The best creative player for the USMNT at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, Tillman has had some challenges adapting to life in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen, but should remain a USMNT starter. 

CM: Weston McKennie—The Juventus midfielder has been in middling form in Serie A, but will look to prove himself as a true starter with the American squad after sporadic minutes under Pochettino. 

LWB: Antonee Robinson—The man they call “Jedi” returns to the USMNT for the first time since March, and the Fulham defender could slot in at the role Columbus Crew midfielder Max Arfsten has been playing. 

RW: Alejandro Zendejas—After scoring against Japan, Zendejas endeared himself to USMNT fans and, with five goals and three assists in 12 games with Club América in Liga MX, should earn another start

ST: Folarin Balogun—With a goal and an assist in five Ligue 1 games with AS Monaco, Balogun remains the best option up top for Pochettino. 

LW: Christian Pulisic—Leading the Serie A Golden Boot race with four goals and two assists with AC Milan, Christian Pulisic comes into this USMNT camp in the best form of his life.

From winning two MLS Cups with the Columbus Crew to excelling in the EFL Championship with Middlesbrough FC, Aidan Morris has always risen to the occasion in big moments.

Now, the 23-year-old midfielder faces arguably the biggest challenge of his career as he competes for a spot on the US men's national team ahead of next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup.

One of 26 players called up by head coach Mauricio Pochettino for this month's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, the Crew homegrown visited "Club & Country" at USMNT training camp in Austin to discuss his World Cup dreams, role model and more.

WATCH: Club & Country

On the competition for USMNT midfield spots:

"It's definitely a competitive area and position, but I'm trying just to be myself; I'm not gonna do anything more. Try to put good performances in, show the right things, be a good teammate. I don't think anything is complicated; I'll just be myself."

On mentality towards the USMNT when left off the roster:

"I try to steer clear of that. I think that leads you into kind of a victim mindset, like, 'I deserve this, I deserve that.' As I mentioned earlier, I try to just be myself and control what I can control. Just wake up every day and try to get that one percent better. From there, wherever that leads me, whether it's back to the national team or just still performing at a high level for my club, and that's it, and then hopefully that leads me to 2026."

On playing with MLS legend and retiring midfielder Darlington Nagbe in Columbus:

"I wouldn't be sitting here if it weren't for that guy. He's just been such a big role model for me in my career. When I was 18, he was just in a couple of months, and he was sitting with me doing film for every day before games.

"I've tried to model my game after him, but not even football. Man, you take football out of it and just life, how he carries himself, he could say hi to everyone here and just have that same smile on his face. Just how he treats people with the utmost respect, how he shows up to work every single day and gives it his all. You see guys take days off. But man, never with him. He's probably been the biggest influence in my career since I started playing."

On thinking about the 2026 World Cup roster:

"I don't think this game, this sport, and this career are a crazy formula. I think it's like I just said: Just try to get better, and try not to get carried away and swept away with all the other nonsense of like, 'I'm entitled to this, I deserve to be here, I deserve to be there.' I think it's focused on the simple things, just getting better."

On potentially playing a World Cup at home:

"It's all about inspiring the next generation. It's probably the biggest tournament in the whole entire world in all sports, and I think having that on home soil, it just gives that next generation so much to look forward to. There will be millions of kids in the stands, being like, 'Oh, that's what I want to do now.'"

The top spot is at stake in Scotland's 2026 World Cup qualifying group as it plays host to Greece on Thursday.

Scotland welcomes Greece to Hampden Park on Thursday with a chance to climb to the summit of its 2026 World Cup qualifying group. Steve Clarke & Co sit level on points with Group C leader Denmark and is yet to taste defeat after two games, only just missing out on first place due to goal difference.

This clash presents a matchup between two teams who have already met twice thus far in 2025. And despite an away win in Athens during the UEFA Nations League play-offs back in March, Scotland missed out on promotion to the competition's top rung after a 3-0 home defeat to Greece in the return leg.

The ghosts of that game will still be haunting some of the players in Clarke's squad, though Thursday also hands them a shot at redemption. That decisive result seven months ago marked Scotland's first home loss to the Piratiko, and a second in succession could prove all too costly to their chances of World Cup qualification.

Torino striker Che Adams is the only Scottish player to have scored for the team through two games, with their only other finish coming courtesy of a Belarus own-goal. Greece, on the other hand, produced five different scorers against the same opponent, though Benfica frontman Vangelis Pavlidis is the team's biggest threat up top.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested that the international calendar “should be changed to allow World Cups to be played regularly in the winter,” according to Martyn Ziegler of the London TIMES. The 2034 tournament is being hosted by Saudi Arabia, where the hot summer temperatures make it “almost impossible” to be staged in the usual June and July slot. For that reason, the Qatar World Cup three years ago was moved to November and December, which meant most European club campaigns had to start earlier and finish later to accommodate it. Infantino, speaking at the European Football Clubs annual assembly, said that talks were “under way on changing the calendar.” He raised the idea of “more club football being played during June in the future.” Infantino said, “The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe. Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to have an open mind.” He continued, “If you want to play at the same time everywhere, you can play in March or in October, most likely. Because in December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part of the world.” Infantino also said that he was “confident there would not be visa problems for countries at next year's World Cup” in the U.S., Mexico and Canada (London TIMES, 10/9).

MONEY TREE: BBC.com's Nick Mashiter notes Infantino also confirmed FIFA's desire to further grow the Club World Cup when speaking at the assembly. Infantino noted the Champions League made $46M in revenue when it started, and now it is $4.6B. He said then that if the first Club World Cup generated $2.3B, then it “should generate” $232B in 30 years. Infantino: “This has created revenues for the clubs. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had 2.5m spectators in the stadiums. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better” (BBC.com, 10/9).

World Cup

 Tariq Zehawi / NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY Network / Imagn Images

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are now on sale, but that doesn't mean you can simply go buy them.

The World Cup ticket process is a labyrinth of lotteries, long waits, fluctuating prices and frustration. So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

The first lottery opened in September. The next route to tickets — the second “phase” of a four-phase rollout — begins October 27. Here's what you need to know about that route and others to the 2026 tournament, which will take place next June and July across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

On Oct. 27, likely at 11 a.m. ET.

But, like with the first lottery, you don't need to rush to your smartphone or computer at a specific time that day. You can enter anytime between then and Oct. 31. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The upcoming lottery will likely mirror the first lottery. Millions of people will create a “FIFA ID” account and apply. FIFA will randomly select a minority of them, notify the lucky few via email, and give them a 24- or 48-hour time slot to purchase tickets — “subject to availability.”

FIFA said it made around 1 million tickets — roughly 15% of the 2026 World Cup's total inventory — available in the first phase, across all 104 matches. For the World Cup final, the allotment of tickets sold out within hours; by the end of the third time slot, standard allotments for the semifinals, quarterfinals, round of 16, opener and other games — including almost all games in Canada and Mexico — were also gone, and never replenished.

The second phase will likely be similar, though FIFA could tweak the process.

Not great.

FIFA said that over 4.5 million people entered the first lottery. The second one, like the first, will be open to everyone — diehard soccer fans, casual sports fans, profit-seeking scalpers and more. If another 1 million tickets are available, and each lottery winner can purchase up to 40, the percentage of entrants chosen will again be small.

FIFA has not said how many fans will be picked, in part because it notifies winners on a rolling basis. Your chances depend on how many people chosen before you actually buy tickets, and how many tickets they buy. Rejection notices won't be sent until the end of the phase.

At the onset of sales, according to fans who sent screenshots and data to The Athletic, tickets were priced as follows:

Those prices, though, are subject to change via FIFA's “variable pricing” model. In fact, some already did during the first presale phase. The Athletic has been tracking prices, via screenshots sent by fans, and identified at least 16 games that were subject to at least one price increase in the opening week of sales.

It's not known how, if at all, prices might change before or during the second phase.

FIFA prefers the term “variable pricing” instead of “dynamic pricing” because, it says, prices don't jump algorithmically or automatically when a carefully-programmed computer senses demand. The adjustments are instead made by humans — though automation is part of the process, an official acknowledged in September.

Although some slight adjustments — roughly 5% increases — were made in the October sales period, the expectation is that bigger jumps, and more adjustments, will be made in the third lottery phase, after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw. At that point, matchups will be set and demand will increase for games involving popular teams. (It could also decrease, and prices could fall, for games involving less popular teams.)

Even in these early phases, before matchups and team locations are set, before some nations have even qualified, FIFA is offering “team-specific” packages.

If you're selected in a lottery and want to follow, say, England through the tournament, you could pay $930 for a Category 1 ticket to England's first game, and another $930 for the second game, and another $930 for the third game — wherever and whenever those games are. (It'd be $700-$705 per Category 2 ticket, and $320-$325 apiece in Category 3.)

Prices were similar for the likes of Argentina and Brazil, less for mid-tier teams like Japan and Turkey ($745 per match in Category 1, $560 in Category 2, $260 in Category 3); and less still for unheralded teams or those who likely won't qualify. If the team you select doesn't ultimately qualify, you'll be reimbursed, FIFA says.

You could also go through your team's national federation, or wait for what FIFA calls “conditional supporter tickets (for supporters who want to reserve a seat for one of their team's potential matches in a knockout round),” which “are expected to be available closer to the tournament,” it said in a September release.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section. For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

For the 2026 World Cup, a Category 1 ticket could be anywhere in the lower bowl or somewhere on the second deck of an NFL stadium. The Category 2 sections, for the most part, are on the upper deck along the sideline. Category 3 seats are on the upper deck behind/above the end line. Category 4 is tiny slivers of corner sections on the upper deck, or whatever seats are farthest away from the field.

FIFA has not publicly released color-coded stadium maps showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022, but it has shown those maps to ticket buyers in the first presale phase. Fans have compiled those maps here and here.

Be patient.

More lotteries are coming. And more importantly, tickets will surely be available on resale platforms. They might be costly, but probably not as costly as they appear right now — because, for many (though not all) sporting events, prices tend to fall closer to the event.

For buyers, “oftentimes waiting is beneficial,” Matt Ferrel, a TickPick executive, told The Athletic. “If people have tickets and aren't able to attend, they're setting the price high to recoup whatever they invested in the game, but what they ultimately want to do is offload the ticket.”

Most sellers and buyers will likely head to FIFA's official resale platform, unless other sites like StubHub offer to take lower fees. (FIFA will charge both the buyer and the seller a 15% fee on every sale on its platform.)

FIFA can't fully stop those unauthorized sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets, but it has warned fans against buying from them — because doing so carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't actually have.

FIFA, on the other hand, can offer that guarantee. World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi said in September that FIFA's platform would be “a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four tickets per match and up to 40 tickets across the entire tournament per household.

There's been confusion surrounding what, exactly, qualifies as a “household.” FIFA cleared up some of that confusion last month.

If you'd like to go to a game with a group of more than four people, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs. (Though if the entire group of five-plus people lives in the same household, you might be out of luck.)

Not yet. These early ticket lotteries are open to all fans, from the co-host countries and abroad.

A World Cup official said in September that there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

Protection of political, economic and commercial interests has led to FIFA's ‘double standards' in countering anti-Israel protests and calls for sanctions, say experts.

Israel will resume its qualification campaign for the FIFA World Cup 2026 this coming weekend amid widespread public protests and growing demands for football's governing body to sanction the country over its genocide in Gaza.

Despite the widespread opposition, Israel's upcoming World Cup qualifiers – against Norway on Saturday and Italy on Tuesday – will go ahead as scheduled after FIFA sidestepped the issue by saying it cannot “solve geopolitical problems”.

Football fans and several experts have accused FIFA and UEFA of double standards over their failure to act against Israel in the two years of its war on Gaza, while swiftly sanctioning Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

More than 30 legal experts have called on UEFA to bar Israel and its clubs from competitions over the atrocities in Gaza.

The letter said banning Israel was “imperative”, citing a report by a United Nations commission of inquiry that concluded that Israel was carrying out a genocide against Palestinians. The letter highlighted the damage that Israel has inflicted on the sport in Gaza – at least 421 Palestinian footballers have been killed since Israel began its military offensive in October 2023 – and said Israel's bombing campaign was “systematically destroying Gaza's football infrastructure”.

While a ceasefire deal was agreed between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Thursday, the war on Gaza has killed at least 67,183 people and wounded 169,841 in more than two years. Almost a third of those killed were children. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings.

Last month, Spanish Sports Minister Pilar Alegria said Israeli teams should be banned from sport in the same way that Russian ones were in 2022.

“[Israeli forces] have killed more than 60,000 people; children, babies [are] starving to death, hospitals destroyed,” Alegria told Spanish radio station Cadena SER.

“It is difficult to explain and understand that there is a double standard. It is important that sport, given this situation, takes a position at least similar to what it did against Russia.”

Former France and Manchester United captain Eric Cantona questioned the inaction from football officials while speaking at a fundraising event for Palestine in London on September 17.

“FIFA and UEFA must suspend Israel,” he said. “Clubs everywhere must refuse to play Israeli teams.”

Additionally, hundreds of thousands of football fans and pro-Palestine protesters have called for similar measures against Israel over the past two years.

Fans have used banners, tifos, pitch invasions, stadium walkouts and other means to register their protests inside and outside sport venues.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has brushed aside the calls by indirectly addressing it as a “geopolitical issue” at the FIFA Council on October 2.

“We are committed to using the power of football to bring people together in a divided world,” Infantino said.

The apparently preferential treatment given to Israel's football team is an extension of the “total impunity” the country has enjoyed amid the two-year war, according to Abdullah Al-Arian, associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar.

“Sporting bodies often mirror the broader power politics that are at play [in the world] and so they're only doing what we've seen happen across all walks of political life, in which Israel has not been held to account,” Al-Arian told Al Jazeera.

“It [Israel] has been allowed to operate with total impunity throughout this genocide and has enjoyed this impunity for many decades.”

Al-Arian, who authored the book Football in the Middle East: State, Society, and the Beautiful Game, said the double standards and “complicity” of the governing bodies were in plain sight.

“FIFA has been under pressure for two years, but it [the demand for Israel's suspension] escalated after the latest UN finding [on Israel's genocide in Gaza] and led to a real mobilisation.

“But there was a swift reaction from the United States to intervene on behalf of Israel and, basically, issue all kinds of threats against these bodies should they proceed [with sanctions against Israel].”

Al-Arian highlighted the US's role as co-host for the next World Cup, along with Mexico and Canada, and the “very close relationship” between US President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino as another factor.

 



 

In 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) presented arguments accusing the Israel Football Association (IFA) of violating FIFA statutes with its war on Gaza and the inclusion of clubs located in illegal settlements on Palestinian territory in its domestic football league.

The PFA wanted FIFA to adopt “appropriate sanctions” against Israel's national side and club teams, including an international ban.

It called on FIFA to ban Israel, but the world body postponed its decision by delegating the matter to its disciplinary committee for review. Al-Arian termed that “a move to keep the bureaucratic machinery moving without making any real progress”.

“Ultimately, it's a political decision being made at the highest levels of the organisation,” he said.

Al-Arian believes the PFA is under “immense pressure” from Israel.

“Being under the thumb of an occupying power, the PFA is under tremendous internal constraints, and its decision to advance this issue has often been met with very severe consequences,” he explained.

Those consequences, he suggested, have included Israel preventing Palestinian athletes from travelling, and the “Palestinian team from meeting collectively in one place for training”.

“International matches have not been held in Palestine for years,” he pointed out. “And this is before we even get into the violence to which Palestinian footballers have been exposed. A number of players have been shot or imprisoned, held at checkpoints over the years, and entire careers have been destroyed.”

The PFA comes within the auspices of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which Al-Arian argued does not always “serve the Palestinian interests”.

“There are certainly a lot of critiques to be made in terms of the PA's own posture with respect to Palestinian rights. Many people have referred to it as a kind of occupation subcontractor.”

Yet, this isn't the first time that Israel has faced calls for expulsion from football bodies.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954 and played under its umbrella for 20 years.

In 1974, several Muslim and Arab countries – as well as North Korea – refused to play against Israel. This followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

Kuwait led a movement against Israel's membership in the AFC and the 17 to 13 vote resulted in its expulsion from the regional body. In the 1980s, Israel played the majority of its international matches against European nations and was part of the European qualifiers for the World Cups. In 1994, it was granted full membership of UEFA.

Israel is placed in Group I of UEFA's qualifiers for the World Cup alongside Italy and Norway.

While the Italian government has largely been supportive of Israel during the war on Gaza, the country has witnessed increasingly huge protests calling for a ceasefire and criticising Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government for its refusal to condemn Israel.

Norway's government, meanwhile, has called for the country's sovereign wealth fund – the largest in the world – to scrutinise all investments in Israel, and withdraw from those linked to the war or the illegal occupation of the West Bank.

For the football teams of these nations, though, the stakes are different – they risk elimination from the qualifying process by pulling out of the fixtures.

“We have to play this match. Because if we don't, we'll lose it 3-0,” Italy's head coach Gennaro Gattuso said, referring to the rule for forfeited matches.

Norway has pledged to donate money earned from ticket sales at its match against Israel to the humanitarian work of Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF) in Gaza.

Both matches are expected to attract protesters outside the stadiums and pro-Palestine messaging inside.

“It's not going to be a calm environment,” Gattuso acknowledged on Tuesday, after Italy's training session was also targeted by protesters.

“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside the stadium,” he said.

According to Al-Arian, while sport has been an avenue for advancing popular causes and protest movements, its “commodification” has put heavy constraints on achieving the objectives of these protests.

“The changing relationship of global football over the last couple of decades has been one in which financial and political interests often play a very big role and put a severe limitation on football as a site of mobilisation,” he said.

“This is why football associations that should be far more sympathetic and stand in solidarity fall far short of expectations.”

The 1974 expulsion of Israel from the AFC is often cited as an example of Arab and Muslim unity against Israeli atrocities in Palestine. However, the same nations have not been able to press FIFA to sanction Israel, and Al-Arian believes these states do not pursue such policies due to “deeper incentivisation”.

“The political, economic and commercial relationships that have been established [in the past decades] make it really difficult [for the states to take action],” he said.

“This also comes after a wave of normalisation efforts where some Arab and Muslim states have normalised their ties with Israel and have maintained diplomatic relations with it throughout the Gaza genocide.”

FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the football industry needs to be more open-minded about when it stages its biggest tournaments as a global game cannot only play World Cups during the northern-hemisphere summer.

The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was the first to be played outside the usual summer window, with the tournament shifting to a November and December slot to avoid the Gulf state's extreme summer heat.

That move caused considerable debate at the time, as it meant domestic leagues across Europe were forced to take mid-season breaks, but did not lead to any long-term disruption and resulted in a World Cup where the players looked fresh.

Many in Europe, however, hoped that Qatar 2022 would be an exception, but with Saudi Arabia awarded the 2034 World Cup, the tournament is unlikely to return to its usual space in the calendar.

The debate about when and where elite football can be played has grown since those rows about the Qatar World Cup, with this summer's Club World Cup in the United States providing the latest example of how difficult it is to shoehorn tournaments into the current global football calendar.

Speaking at the European Football Clubs' general assembly in Rome on Thursday, Infantino told delegates: “If you want to play at the same time everywhere, then you can play in March or in October — because in December, you're not playing in one part of the world, and in July, we're not playing in another part of the world.”

No dates have been announced for the 2034 World Cup but it expected to be another winter tournament, with a strong possibility it will actually be held in early 2035 to avoid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which falls in November and December in 2034.

After his speech, Infantino was asked by journalists when FIFA would get into the “nitty gritty” of deciding when to stage the 2034 tournament.

“We're already into nitty-gritty — we're discussing it with everyone, all the time, and it's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection,” he explained.

“Even to play in some European countries in July it's very, very hot. So maybe we need to think about the best months to play football, which is June in Europe. It's not used very much, right?

“Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar but we're discussing it. We just have to have an open mind.”

Infantino's comment about July temperatures in Europe comes with the 2030 World Cup primarily being played in Spain and Portugal, with games also in Morocco and a handful in South America. Extreme heat is unlikely to be a factor at Euro 2028, which will be held in the UK and Ireland, but could be an issue for the 2032 tournament in Italy and Turkey.

The international match calendar that provides the framework for all global football competitions is set until 2030 but its next iteration has been the focus of intense debate for some time. Last year, the major domestic leagues teamed up with players' union FIFPro Europe to file a complaint against FIFA at the European Commission for the global body's alleged failure to properly consult on the calendar.

The leagues and union believe FIFA abused its dominant market position by scheduling the Club World Cup in June and July, knowing it would have a knock-on effect on the start of European domestic seasons.

FIFA responded to a formal complaint over the calendar in July 2024 by saying that there had been “comprehensive and inclusive consultation, which included FIFPRO and league bodies”.

Infantino used his speech in Rome to praise the success of the Club World Cup, a view shared by the bosses of the clubs that participated this summer. There is no sign of FIFA removing the Club World Cup from the calendar, and the tournament is more likely to grow in size than disappear.

Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. (3:54)

For the past two FIFA World Cup cycles, the starting striker spot for the U.S. men's national team has been a seemingly unsolvable puzzle, with none of the candidates able to grab a firm hold of the spot. It wasn't always this way.

Eric Wynalda and Brian McBride led the U.S. line during the 1990s and 2000s. Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey carried the flag through the 2014 World Cup and slightly beyond, although it's worth noting that Dempsey spent a significant chunk of his international career in a midfield role. The same was true for Landon Donovan.

Since then, the search for a starting central striker has taken on holy grail-like qualities.

The 2022 World Cup cycle never did reveal a forward who could deliver on a consistent basis. Jesús Ferreira, Jordan Pefok, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent and Gyasi Zardes were all given starts during World Cup qualifying. For a time, it looked like Pepi would emerge, but he faded toward the latter part of the cycle -- mostly due to a lack of playing time at club level -- and was beaten to the roster selection tape by Haji Wright. An injury to Sargent at the World Cup, combined with ineffectiveness by Ferreira and Wright, meant that the U.S. didn't get as much out of the position in Qatar as they would have hoped.

This cycle has been even more muddled. Pepi, Sargent and Wright remain in contention, joined by Folarin Balogun and Patrick Agyemang. And while Balogun has gained a bit of daylight between himself and the other potentials thanks to an impressive performance in a recent friendly against Japan, he hasn't secured the spot just yet.

With the October window featuring friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, here's where things stand in the race to wear the No. 9 for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT at next summer's World Cup, and a statistical comparable player for the five in contention to start up top come June.

When Balogun committed to the USMNT in May of 2023 -- he was also eligible to represent England and Nigeria -- he was thought to be the USMNT's long-term answer to the striker position. Initially there was a payoff: he scored in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final against Canada, and was one of the few players to come out of the 2024 Copa América with any credit. But injuries, including a recurring shoulder ailment that required surgery in December 2024, prevented him from getting a vice-like grip on the position.

Balogun's mobility allows him to get behind opposition defenses. The problem has been that the U.S. attack hasn't always proved itself adept at finding him in those positions. But Balogun's movement has the added benefit of pulling defenders out of position, the better to create space for the likes of Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah or Alejandro Zendejas.

The Japan game in September showcased the full repertoire of his skills, and he even demonstrated he can play with his back to goal and hold the ball up if asked. Even in the loss to South Korea, the U.S. attack looked a lot more dynamic once Balogun entered the match as a substitute in the 62nd minute.

The only doubts surround his durability, as well as getting consistent playing time at Monaco, where the competition for places has been fierce. He has just one goal and one assist in league play this season, covering 332 minutes.

Statistical comparable: Nicolas Jackson. Balogun has proved to be a willing runner and ball carrier with solid shot and goal creation. In the past three years, he has averaged 0.50 goals from 3.69 shots per 90 minutes. Unfortunately, like Jackson, he has also proved to be a pretty poor finisher -- those 0.50 goals per 90 come from shots worth 0.70 xG per 90. -- Bill Connelly

Wright is the only U.S. center forward with a World Cup goal to his name. Granted, he didn't seem to know much about his tally in the round-of-16 defeat to the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup, but a goal is a goal.

Given the disdain Pochettino has for player reputations, more pertinent to Wright's cause is the blistering form he has been showing in the English Championship this year, where his eight goals are tops in the league and have propelled Coventry to the top of the table.

Wright has some versatility to his game. His 6-foot-3 frame allows him to be a force in the air, but he's also quick enough to play on the wing, which he has done on occasion for Coventry and the USMNT. His ability to sniff out chances is impressive as well. His tally from less than 2 yards in last weekend's 5-0 demolition of Sheffield Wednesday showed his ability to be in the right place at the right time.

What's holding Wright back? There were times during the last World Cup where he seemed slow to react to attacking opportunities. Perhaps the moment got to him. While that was almost three years ago, it's an image that will stick in the memory until he delivers on a bigger stage.

Statistical comparable: Randal Kolo Muani. Wright isn't quite the passer that Kolo Muani can be, but he scores (0.56 goals per 90 minutes), and he really pushes the ball. He has averaged 6.1 progressive carries per 90 in the past three years, drawing 1.42 fouls per 90 in that span. That creates a rare profile and makes Kolo Muani the best comp. -- Connelly

During last week's conference call in which he announced the U.S. roster for the October window, Pochettino said that Agyemang offers a different profile to Balogun and Wright, one derived from his physical presence -- he's 6-foot-4 -- and his aerial ability. Those traits were on display in Derby County's 1-1 draw with Southampton last weekend, when Agyemang towered over a Saints defender to head home the Rams' only goal of the day.

Agyemang is a raw talent, however, and he struggles at times with his touch and hold-up play. But he seems perfectly suited to score an ugly goal late in a match, if necessary, and his passing has seen him earn two assists already in 307 minutes in the EFL Championship.

Agyemang's chances of securing a World Cup roster spot are, like so many players, down to health and the numbers game Pochettino will have to play. If Pochettino only opts to bring three forwards, and a player like Pepi is healthy, Agyemang may be one of the final cuts. But his "different profile" may be what gets him in, especially if Pochettino opts for four strikers.

Statistical comparable: Olivier Giroud. Agyemang is excellent in the air (47.5% aerial success rate), and he's happy to draw lots of contact (2.05 fouls per 90 suffered, 0.92 in the attacking third). That makes him awfully Giroud-like, as does quality finishing -- he averages 0.51 goals from shots worth 0.40 xG, and 90% of his shots have come from inside the box -- although his shooting totals aren't huge, and he's not involved elsewhere on the pitch. -- Connelly

Three years ago, Pepi was the odd man out in terms of the U.S. roster that went to Qatar. It proved a mistake, when the U.S. was left starting Ferreira against the Dutch. Now Pepi is aiming to be on the 2026 squad -- that is, if his body will let him.

The 2025 calendar year has seen Pepi struggle with his fitness. He sustained a knee injury in the UEFA Champions League game against Liverpool last January that later required surgery, forcing him to miss last summer's Gold Cup. Pepi's recovery since then has been stop-start; he was brought along slowly by PSV, and looked to be back after scoring twice against NEC Nijmegen last month, but a recent muscle injury has him back on the shelf. It isn't thought to be serious, but it prevented him from taking part in this camp.

While Pepi has several impressive attributes, his movement allows him to sniff out opportunities and get on the end of passes that other forwards might miss. Combine this with his link-up play and you have a forward capable of contributing plenty to the U.S. team. But time is running out for Pepi to make a bigger impression.

Statistical comparable: Lautaro Martínez. More than any other forward from this list, Pepi gets himself involved, just as Martínez does. His offensive numbers are inflated by playing in the Eredivisie, but they're still excellent (0.74 goals and 1.36 chances created per 90 minutes), and he's proving to be a reliable finisher (those goals came from shots worth 0.52 xG). He also shows up in defense, averaging a stellar-for-a-forward 5.53 defensive interventions per 90. -- Connelly

Jeff Carlisle looks ahead to the upcoming international window for Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT.

Rarely has the difference between a player's club form and his international form been as stark as it is with Sargent. The O'Fallon, Missouri, native has hit double-digit goals in each of his past three full seasons with the Canaries in the Championship, and he's well on his way this year with five goals in nine league matches. It makes Sargent's barren spell with the USMNT -- he hasn't scored for the U.S. in his past 17 international appearances, dating back to November 2019 -- all the more confounding.

Perhaps his streak is down to the fact that while Sargent does plenty of things well -- be it his movement, his link-up play and yes, his finishing, too -- there isn't one aspect of his game that seems elite enough to help him be a difference-maker at a World Cup.

Pochettino seems to have noticed, too. Even with Pepi injured this window, there wasn't room for Sargent among the forwards on the roster. He does have World Cup experience, and that counts for something, but it may not be enough.

Statistical comparable: Moise Kean. Sargent is the most statistically nondescript of the American forwards on this list, but like Kean, he's a willing presser (4.09 defensive interventions per 90 minutes since the start of 2024-25) and above-average finisher (0.56 goals per 90 from shots worth 0.48 xG). His shot totals are always lower than you would prefer, though (2.43 shots per 90), and he doesn't stand out as a passer. -- Connelly

Balogun, Pepi, Wright and Agyemang look to be in position to make the World Cup squad, in that order. Four forwards might seem like one too many, but these four all have different profiles that can help the USMNT at various times. Flexibility is vital in a tournament like the World Cup.

In terms of who starts, Balogun has the inside track at the moment, but that situation can change quickly. At this stage, it looks like the only way Sargent makes it back to the World Cup is if others get injured or suffer a significant drop in form.

Mauricio Pochettino's United States men's national team will get a good challenge from fellow World Cup entrants Ecuador at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas on Friday.

The Yanks have a strong squad for this window, an improved unit from the group that lost 2-0 to South Korea before toppling Japan by the same score.

This Ecuador team hasn't lost in over a year, a September 2024 away loss to Brazil in World Cup qualifying. La Tricolor have since gone 11 games without a loss, all CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with a win over Argentina the latest triumph.

Former Elche manager Sebastián Beccacece, a Jorge Sampaoli disciple, is at the wheel of a strong ship, even if Ecuador will be without Moises Caicedo for the window. They'll face Mexico in Zapopan on Oct. 14, and play North American-based matches in November against Canada (Toronto) and New Zealand (New Jersey).

Kick off time: 8:30pm ET Friday (October 10)Venue: Q2 Stadium — Austin, TexasTV Channel: NBC Universo (en Español), TNT (in English)Streaming: Stream live en Español on Peacock



This team can do some damage even without Tyler Adams, Sergino Dest, Yunus Musah, and Ricardo Pepi.

RELATED — How will USMNT line up vs Ecuador?

Antonee Robinson is back in the fold despite a surprisingly-limited number of minutes at Fulham, while red-hot Tanner Tessmann of Lyon rejoins the midfield unit. Malik Tillman is also doing so well after a move to Bayer Leverkusen.

Christian Pulisic has had a sensational early run at AC MIlan this season even accounting a missed penalty in recent weeks. In-form Haji Wright and Timothy Weah will also be in the discussion to start.

The Yanks will not have to deal with several big names besides Chelsea star Caicedo, as Arsenal's Piere Hincapie, Flamengo's Gonzalo Plata, Quito's Carlos Gruezo, and Cremonese's Jeremy Sarmiento are not in the squad.

But new centurion Enner Valencia is joined by Strasbourg hotshot Kendry Paez (a Chelsea loanee), PSG's Willian Pacho, and AC Milan's Pervis Estupinan in the squad. It's an excellent group.

The Caicedo absence could loom large here, especially with the Americans on home soil. Let's go for the same score as a memorable Copa America quarterfinal win for Jurgen Klinsmann's USMNT in 2016. USMNT 2-1 Ecuador.

The Qatar World Cup in 2022 started in November and ended a week before Christmas on 18 December

Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants football to keep an "open mind" about when World Cups are played.

The tournament has traditionally been contested in the northern hemisphere's summer months - though the 2022 competition, in Qatar, took place in December to avoid playing in the hottest conditions.

"We have summer and winter and in the world if you want to play at the same time everywhere you can play in March or in October," said Infantino, who runs the sport's world governing body.

"In December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part. 

"We need to consider all these elements and let's see how we can make it better for everyone.

"Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar. We are discussing. We have to have an open mind."

The international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with the United States, Canada and Mexico hosting next year's men's World Cup in June and July. 

Morocco, Portugal and Spain host the World Cup in 2030 - with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay holding matches to mark 100 years since the first World Cup was held in, and won by, Uruguay. 

Saudi Arabia will host the tournament in 2034.

Meanwhile, Infantino also confirmed Fifa's desire to further grow the Club World Cup. 

The US hosted an expanded 32-team tournament during a major heatwave in the summer, with temperatures in New York reaching a record 39C in June. 

This drew criticism from footballers and players' unions, who raised issues over player welfare and the number of games adding to a packed calendar. 

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango said in July the competition was devaluing football.

Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain in New York to claim the title. 

Infantino, speaking at the European Football Clubs' general assembly in Rome, said: "When the Champions League was created the first revenue was 40m (euros), now it is 4bn (euros). If the first Club World Cup generated 2bn (euros) in 30 years we should generate 200bn (euros). 

"This has created revenues for the clubs. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. 

"I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had 2.5m spectators in the stadiums. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better.

"There is interest in the entire world and we need the interest to boost the national leagues, the European and global competitions."

Uefa 'reluctantly' approves games played abroad

Rabiot should respect employer, says Serie A boss after criticism of overseas games

Infantino also warned that football is taking a gamble playing domestic league games overseas. 

In February, AC Milan will play their Serie A match with Como in Perth, Australia, while La Liga clubs Villarreal and Barcelona will face each other in Miami in December.

European football's governing body Uefa gave the games the go-ahead this week, stressing that it was opposed to the move but had no legal framework to stop it happening.

"We have a structure where we have games at national level, continental level and then at global level," Infantino continued. 

"This is a structure which made football the number one structure in the world. If we want to break the structure we take a big risk, if we want to regulate it we have to look into it.

"Now I have seen Uefa has approved it, it has to go to Concacaf as well, I don't know if AFC [Football Australia] has approved the game in Australia. 

"We need a reflection which is more global. Do we want everyone to play everywhere and do whatever they want, or do we want a regulated system which takes into a account which takes into account the interests of everyone?"

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin doubled down on his body's opposition on Wednesday, saying Europe's top clubs risk "breaking" football if league games are moved overseas.

"Football is not just about balance sheets. It's not just entertainment. It's life in our communities, the streets, the clubs and the fans which shape it," Ceferin told club officials at the European Football Clubs' (formerly the European Club Association) general assembly in Rome.

"If we pull it too far away from those roots, we risk breaking it."

U.S. men's national team midfielder Weston McKennie acknowledges the squad must strike a balance between playing attractive soccer, and having the grit and determination that has often defined teams in the past.

Much has been made of Mauricio Pochettino's iteration of the USMNT in recent camps. Since arriving in September 2024, the Argentine coach has an overall record of 11-0-7. Pundits and ex-players have criticized the USMNT on a number of fronts and occasions given the talent on paper and the pressure of a World Cup on home soil in 2026.

On the surface, most soccer fans expect their teams to show fight and desire when representing a club or national team. Yet, as the game continues to evolve, the overarching implication usually means trying to play an attractive style of play. 

It's a difficult balancing act, but it's one McKennie, who has been absent from USMNT action since March for a myriad of reasons including Club World Cup participation with Juventus, tells Sports Illustrated the players and Pochettino are continuing to work on as they prepare for 2026.

“That's the big question. What Pochettino always preaches in camps is, ‘Every time you put the shirt on, you have to be willing to practically ready to die for the shirt.' McKennie says as part of a larger conversation surrounding his work with Vita Coco.

“He's not wrong about that at all. There's a sense of pride whenever you put on the national team jersey. There's a sense of a whole country behind you that may be not the biggest football country, but it's on its way.

“I think America is such a prideful country that you have to have that and show that for people to get even more interested. Obviously, playing beautiful football is nice, but at the end of the day you could play beautiful football and lose and not have that grit. Nobody can get mad at a team if you try to play beautiful football but you show grit, desire and that you left everything on the field. 

“It's what we're trying to figure out—presenting both of those because we all play at big clubs where it's not fighting and tackling all the time. You play good football and you move the ball around, one touch, two touch, not so much of a kick-and-run style. When you come together from these different clubs, the one thing you can always have control over is the effort you put in, the desire, grit, savviness.”

The USMNT face Ecuador and Australia looking to build some momentum in October. A mixed bag of results against South Korea and Japan last time out continued to sour the mood on a team that's looking for a spark, but in the 27-year-old's estimation, nothing is as important as winning at the end of the day.

“You can't always control the outcome of a game, whether it's going to be beautiful football because you need to win a game by any means necessary,” he says.

“And that might be playing bad football, but three points at the end of the day, no one is gonna look back in four years from and think, ‘They played a beautiful game.' But who won the game.”

In this story:

Pedro Neto has been honoured with an award by the Portuguese FA for his role in Chelsea's Club World Cup-winning campaign.

Pedro Neto certainly played a big part in helping Chelsea win the Club World Cup.

The 25-year-old started in all of the six matches Chelsea played in the tournament, and scored three goals in that period.

It was a perfect summer for the former Wolves star, who also helped Portugal win their second UEFA Nations League just a month before lifting the Club World Club for Chelsea.

Obviously, not long before that, Pedro Neto was also part of the Chelsea team that beat Real Betis to secure the UEFA Conference League trophy back in May.

It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that in the Portugal Football Globes gala held on Tuesday, Neto was given the Globe Impacto Mundial (World Impact award) for his achievements.

Pedro Neto is currently on international duty with Portugal ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Ireland and Hungary.

He is one of the 10 Chelsea players currently on international duty, alongside France's Malo Gusto and Argentina's Enzo Fernandez.

The winger remains an important player under head coach Enzo Maresca at Chelsea, as shown by the fact that he has made 10 appearances for Chelsea already this season, with nine of them as a starter.

Unfortunately, he is still struggling in terms of output, having only one goal to his name this term.

Chelsea will be back in action on October 18 with a visit to Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

Madison soccer fans are frustrated at FIFA's new dynamic pricing system for next summer's World Cup. The world-renowned event returns to North America for the first time since 1994, but not without controversy as the ticketing strategy leaves fans wondering if they can afford to experience the unforgettable spectacle. 

“The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. It's about growing globally, but especially growing the game in its host nations,” Conor Caloia, president and COO of professional club Forward Madison FC, said. 

The dynamic pricing system, first introduced at this year's Club World Cup, will determine ticket prices based on factors including consumer demand, the significance of the match and general interest from fans. That means tickets for a knockout stage match between the United States and Brazil, for example, will cost much more than a group stage match between Jordan and Paraguay. 

Students — already burdened by tuition, rent and other expenses — will face a deficit to attend the tournament. With ticket prices being so subject to change with dynamic pricing, students' opportunities to attend a once in a lifetime event seem limited. 

William Nicolau, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he was somewhat aware of the ticket process, and that he “signed up for the Visa cardholder presale, but [he] didn't know [the tickets] were this expensive” when told the starting ticket costs for the final.

FIFA said “fans will be able to secure group-stage tickets for just $60, while the most exclusive seats will reach up to $6,730 for the final,” in a press release explaining their ticketing system. Compare this to ticket prices at the previous edition of the World Cup in Qatar, where tickets started at $69 and peaked at a cost of $1,605 for the final. This steep price hike is indicative of FIFA's focus on maximizing profit, while neglecting the importance of the fan experience.

Paul Thiel, a UW-Madison sophomore, said he has been a soccer fan for most of his life and was looking forward to the rare opportunity of seeing a World Cup match live. 

He said the dynamic pricing system will “probably limit” the number of matches he goes to.

“I can't spend any more than $300 on tickets. I have to balance paying for school,” Thiel said.

Freshman Eduardo Righetto shared a similar sentiment, adding that “soccer's not about making money, soccer is about being inclusive.” In an age where soccer accessibility in the U.S. is becoming increasingly difficult, the sport faces a challenge in staying inclusive. 

FIFA said their system deters scalpers and gives fans safer access to tickets. They also announced they are launching their own resale platform, which will allow tickets to be exchanged without “invalid or unauthorised resale.”

This will keep ticket prices from ballooning, but will also ensure FIFA maximizes their profit in an unchallenged system. By adjusting prices in real time based on demand, FIFA is essentially taking the role of scalpers and doing it under the guise of claiming to be “fan-oriented.”

Caloia also spoke about the importance of growing the game of soccer over profit. He noted that “The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. It's about growing globally, but especially growing the game in its host nations.” 

As an event that is expected to bring in 6.5 million visitors, Caloia said “there should be a lower barrier for entry for some fans who traveled a long way and have never been to a World Cup match before.”

The last time the World Cup was held in the U.S. in 1994, the event revitalized interest in soccer, with the general public viewing soccer in a positive light after decades of being considered a niche sport within the country. This upcoming World Cup has a similar opportunity.

“[The World Cup] has the potential to be transformational for the development of the game in our country. The hope is it connects with a younger generation and gets more kids out playing soccer in the state of Wisconsin,” Caloia said

For students that have grown up playing and watching soccer, having the sport's most decorated tournament in their cities should be the culmination of a lifelong passion. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the increasing dictation of a grassroot sport by corporate interests.

The World Cup will kick off on June 11 next year at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, with matches commencing in the U.S. the next day at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Tournament matches will take place from June 11-19th, with the final held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Federer wants quicker conditions at Laver Cup, joining a growing number of players asking to halt the rise of slower courts.ByPete BodoPublished Oct 09, 2025 copy_link

Published Oct 09, 2025

Some debates in tennis take place so deep in the weeds of policy or administration that they're of little interest to all but the most geeked-out aficionados. But that changes when an icon wades into the fray, at which point the issue may suddenly generate headlines and become digital fodder for everyone.That's what happened just a few weeks ago, and suddenly the long-simmering complaint that the game has been slowed down too much, especially on hard courts, has popped high on the radar.Near the end of a long, live broadcast of Andy Roddick's Served podcast from the Laver Cup event, tournament founder Roger Federer enthusiastically embraced Roddick's suggestion that courts had been slowed down to the detriment of the game.Federer then lit the tinder, suggesting that tournament directors like slow courts because it increases the odds that Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz (preferably both) will arrive in the final. Alexander Zverev heaped fuel on the ensuing fire soon thereafter, revealing how he “hated” how uniform surfaces had become, and he endorsed Federer's theory of favoritism.

Alexander Zverev heaped fuel on the ensuing fire soon thereafter, revealing how he “hated” how uniform surfaces had become, and he endorsed Federer's theory of favoritism.

The next thing you know Sinner, halfway around the world, was addressing the criticism in a press conference in Beijing. “You know, me and Carlos [Alcaraz], we don't make the courts,” he told reporters. “It's not our decision. We try to adapt ourselves in every situation. I still feel like every week (the surface) is a bit different.”The favoritism issue, while legitimate, has overshadowed the original point, that we're losing one of the game's most distinguishing features—meaningful differences in surface/court speed from one event (or tour segment) to another, and the unique challenges that poses for players. The criticism is valid, in that the ATP and WTA surfaces these days range from slow to medium-fast. The high end has been loped off.Over time, tennis has developed a prejudice against fast courts. It was partly due to those serving duels hosted by Wimbledon in the pre-2001 years, before it switched the surface to a rougher (slower) ryegrass. Changes continued: In 2008, the ITF put pace limitations on courts that could be used by host nations in Davis Cup ties. When Cup stalwart Roddick learned that a certain, commonly used court was rated as “too fast” for official DC competition, he asked how the ITF determined if a court was “too slow.”There was no such category, he was told. Point made.

Unfortunately, there is no commonly embraced or understood yardstick for court speed, and the entire business can become very confusing if you venture down the data rabbit hole.The ITF does a sophisticated Court Pace Rating (CPR) based on laboratory and actual on-site testing with various scientific instruments. It groups those ratings in five categories, just like hurricanes: The five categories range from slow to fast, with 10-point gradations within each, topping out at 50.Thus, a French Open rating of, say, 23, falls into category 2 (slow, but not extremely so) while a typical Australian Open rating of 42 puts it in the medium-fast category 4. By CPR metrics, most hard-court Masters events in 2024 fell into the "medium" or "medium-fast" categories of 3 to 5, Paris leading the way with a CPR of 45.5 (category 5). The Indian Wells Masters nestled in alongside Roland Garros in category 2.The other way to establish a quantifiable court speed is “predictive,” based on data-driven, match-play metrics including aces, unreturned serve, rally length. Broadcasters rely on researchers and entities like Hawkeye to create a more dynamic Court Pace Index (CPI), showing the real-world result of surface speed. These ratings generally align with CPR values.The Tennis Abstract website has its own surface speed rating, also created by match-play metrics and statistics. It uses the number “1” to represent average court speed. By TA metrics, the 15 fastest tournaments (led by Basel, with a rating of 1.54) include only two Masters events (Paris Indoor, No. 7 and Cincinnati Masters, No. 15).

I tend to disagree with the claim that courts are getting slower across the board. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower. John Isner

The metrics used by TA are complicated, but the easiest way to frame it is that at Basel, players hit 54 percent more aces than at an average tournament.But for all the number crunching, those who count most (the players) frequently experience court speed subjectively. Their opinions on a specific court often end up all over the board, heavily influenced by considerations ranging from ambient conditions to how well—or badly—an individual happens to be playing. A court that seems too fast to one player might be right in the comfort zone of another's.For all the palaver about slow courts, many players claimed that the courts at the Citi Open in Washington D.C. this year were much faster than usual. After advancing to the third round, Frances Tiafoe described the conditions as ideal for a "servebot-fest.”Similar observations were made at the Canada Masters, where Taylor Fritz described the courts as "lightning-fast.” Meanwhile, most players agreed that the courts at the Cincinnati Masters were significantly slower than in previous years. The US Open was a toss-up, as far as opinions went.John Isner, the godfather of servebots, logged some of his best Grand Slam results in Paris—and not indoors, but at Roland Garros. He can explain how slow courts counter-intuitively help big and tall players who serve better than they move. Taking on Zverev's disenchantment with the perceived uniformity of court speeds in the Nothing Major podcast recently, Isner said: “I tend to disagree with the claim that courts are getting slower across the board. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower.”Note to Roger: perhaps it's time to speed up those Laver Cup courts, even if the days of lightning fast indoor and outdoor courts are a thing of the past.

Since its inception in 2009, the Rolex Shanghai Masters has stood as one of the most prestigious stops on the ATP Masters 1000 calendar.

Over the years, it has constantly attracted the game's biggest names and produced some of its most memorable battles. Five of the 29 players to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings have triumphed in Shanghai: Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner.

Two from that illustrious quintet are in the midst of deep runs at this year's event: Medvedev, who will face Alex de Minaur Friday in the quarter-finals, and Djokovic, who will meet surprise package World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot in Saturday's semis.

As the 2025 tournament boils towards its conclusion, ATPTour.com celebrates the No. 1s who have lifted the trophy in Shanghai.



Murray's Triple Spark
Murray made Shanghai his playground with back-to-back titles in 2010-11, before returning in 2016 for one of the most important victories of his career.

Arriving in Shanghai as the World No. 2, Murray had already built momentum with titles in Rome, Queen's Club, Wimbledon and Beijing. But the Briton didn't stop there: He stormed through the field without dropping a set to complete his Shanghai hat-trick and later extended his winning streak to 24 matches to earn his lone ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF finish.

Djokovic's 2012 Breakthrough & Record Trophy Haul
Djokovic denied Murray's bid for a Shanghai three-peat in unforgettable fashion in 2012. After semi-final runs in 2009-10, Djokovic stormed through the field upon return to Shanghai two years later to set a clash with Murray in the final.

Across three hours, 21 minutes of battle, Djokovic clawed back from a set and a break down — saving five championship points en route — to seize his first Shanghai crown. With his victory, he also avenged his recent US Open final defeat to Murray one month prior and took a 9-7 lead in their rapidly growing Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

Djokovic successfully defended his title in 2013 and won a further two trophies in 2015 and 2018, making him the tournament's most decorated champion.

Federer's Shanghai Prestige
Federer's first Shanghai title in 2014 began with a great escape. In his opening match against Leonardo Mayer, the Swiss star saved five match points before surviving a tense third-set tie-break.

That getaway lit a fire under Federer, who powered through the rest of the draw — including top seed Djokovic in the semi-finals — to lift his maiden Shanghai trophy.

“I feel unbelievable prestige to win this event. Especially putting my hands on the trophy for the first time is a good feeling, I must say,” said Federer, who returned three years later to capture his second Shanghai title, and 27th ATP Masters 1000 crown.

Medvedev's Masterclass
Medvedev had already hinted at his potential in Shanghai when he pushed Federer to three sets in 2018, but it was the following year when he fully delivered on that promise.

Returning in 2019 as the World No. 4, and a completely different player, Medvedev dominated the field with a near-flawless display of power and consistency to clinch his first title in Shanghai. He capped his run with consecutive wins over two of his greatest rivals, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev, in the semi-final and final, respectively.

Sinner's Statement
Sinner became the latest ATP No. 1 Club member to shine in Shanghai, capturing last year's title in the midst of an end-of-season surge. He dropped just one set en route to a championship-match clash with record champion Djokovic.

Yet with fearless execution and unwavering focus, Sinner toppled the Serbian 7-6(4), 6-3 and snapped his perfect 4-0 streak in Shanghai finals. The win, which cemented his status at the top of the game, marked the Italian's seventh title of the season.

It all adds up for Felix Auger-Aliassime, who has been one of the game's most popular players since making his ATP Tour main-draw debut in 2018 in Rotterdam — the same event where he won his first tour-level title in 2022. Every season and every match is part of a memorable story that the 25-year-old continues to write, with his current quarter-final run at the Rolex Shanghai Masters the latest chapter.

ATPTour.com caught up with the Canadian earlier in the year to discuss his successes, challenges, rivals, idols and more.



What is the biggest success of your career?
At the end of 2022, I had this win streak — it was 16 matches. Then I qualified for Turin at the end of the year, won the Davis Cup. That whole stretch was probably what I am most proud of. Since I was young, I had good results, but I wasn't able to put up a streak of wins like this. I could have a great tournament, then I could lose early in the next tournament. Then I was able to prove to myself and the competition that I can actually go and win a tournament and then back it up again and again.

Three titles in a row and then the semi-finals in Paris-Bercy, that was huge for me. To top it off with the Davis Cup was a moment I am definitely really proud of.

What is the biggest difficulty you've had to overcome in your career?
When you get to a point where you struggle to find consistency and you have to figure out why. You can go to work and you can play, but the most difficult part is not the physical part, it's figuring it out with yourself and your team. “What do I actually need to improve? What's making me not play the way I want right now?” That's the difficult part, finding out the why.

Who would you say your greatest rival is?

I would say Stefanos Tsitsipas because it's two-sided. There are guys that I have struggled to get a win over for a long time, like Medvedev. With Tsitsipas, we have gone back and forth over the years, even since we were juniors. It goes way back. He always brings competitiveness.

What is your favourite tennis rivalry, outside of your own? 

Nadal-Federer was an iconic rivalry. I liked Novak and Andy growing up. It was interesting because they both have a counter-punching game. I felt like they were really trying to find ways to outsmart the other guy, and they had a lot of rallies so it was always interesting to watch. You could see how physically demanding it was. Those were fun to watch in Slams.

What is your favourite tournament to play and why?

Grand Slam, I would say Wimbledon. The most prestigious, historic tournament. ATP Masters 1000, Monte-Carlo. It's just a beautiful place to play tennis. ATP 500, I would go with Doha, I feel like it's one of the best. ATP 250, Auckland. It's the only tournament we have in New Zealand, and I feel like it's such a unique part of the world. Sometimes you play these tournaments in common countries for tennis, but New Zealand is out there.

What's been the coolest experience of being a tennis player?

Meeting my idols from when I was growing up, that's the coolest thing. You can travel to places, but meeting people who I saw growing up — the likes of Roger, Rafa, Novak and Andy — that's pretty unique.

What is the biggest goal you have been chasing?

I still haven't won a Masters 1000 title or a Grand Slam. They are the biggest categories of tournament and the toughest to win, so if you do capture one in your career, that's huge. Those are still to do. But winning the Davis Cup, winning an Olympic medal were huge. I think capturing a medal goes beyond your sport.

Iga Swiatek beat Belinda Bencic 7-6 (2), 6-4 to reach the Wuhan quarterfinals, and Coco Gauff booked her spot in the final eight with a routine 6-3, 6-2 win over Zhang Shuai. The two Top 5 players could meet in the semifinals.

In Thursday night's first match, No. 2-seeded Iga Swiatek became the fifth WTA 1000 champion to advance to the quarterfinals at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. In the nightcap, No. 3 Coco Gauff made it six.

Gauff was a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Chinese wild card Zhang Shuai, while Swiatek defeated No. 13 Belinda Bencic 7-6 (2), 6-4.

They could meet in the semifinals, but first there is the matter of Friday's supercharged quarterfinals.

Swiatek meets No. 7 Jasmine Paolini, who came back to defeat No. 10 Clara Tauson 3-6, 6-1, 3-1 via retirement.

Gauff has an unexpected match against unseeded Laura Siegemund, who advanced with a 6-4, 7-6 (2) win over Magdalena Frech. At 37, and the oldest player left in the draw, the German is looking for her second Top 10 win of the tournament following a second-round upset of No. 5 Mirra Andreeva.

Playing Wuhan for the first time, Swiatek has looked a lot like a six-time Grand Slam champion. The win over Bencic was the 125th WTA 1000 victory of her young career, and Friday will be her 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal.

Swiatek finished with eight aces and converted four of six break-point opportunities in a match that clocked in at 2 hours and 8 minutes.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

“For sure I wanted to play with confidence and make great decisions and not let her dictate,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview after the match. “It was super hard and every game was tough. That's why it was two sets in over two hours. I'm happy that I was there in the deciding moments to be solid and play one more shot.”

This was Swiatek's fifth win in six matches against Bencic, but it did not come easily. Since giving birth to daughter Bella in the spring of 2024, the Swiss player has steadily returned to her championship form. She was the winner in Abu Dhabi back in February and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Swiatek.

After dropping the first three games to Swiatek, Bencic came back to win five of six games and found herself serving for the first set at 5-4. Two loose forehands, however, gave Swiatek the equalizing break.

The tiebreak wasn't competitive. Bencic has made a career of taking the ball early, playing fast and aggressively. But in this instance, Swiatek was sharper. With Bencic serving at 2-4, Swiatek was standing inside the baseline when she sent a first serve back with an eye-opening forehand winner. Winning her third straight point, Swiatek converted her first set point.

In the second set, the two were even at 3-all when Swiatek made her move. A snappy forehand winner, followed by another faulty forehand from Bencic, gave her the decisive break.

Gauff's victory wasn't nearly as taxing -- it was over in one hour. At 21, some 15 years younger than Shuai, Gauff scored a break in the sixth game of the opening set and was never seriously threatened.

Through two matches, Gauff has dropped only six games. She won 60 of 100 points against Shuai.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Into her second consecutive quarterfinal in Wuhan, Gauff has now won all four matches against Shuai; over the past three years, no woman has won more times (19) in China.

“It was a little bit up and down,” Gauff acknowledged in her on-court interview. “But happy to be into the next round.”

Swiatek, 24, is looking for her 12th career WTA 1000 title. The 11th came this summer in Cincinnati, where she defeated Paolini in the final. Swiatek has won all six previous matches against Paolini, five of them in straight sets.

It's customary for players to thank fans at the championship trophy ceremony, but after her opening win Swiatek felt compelled to express her appreciation to the crowd.

“I think it's always nice to get support during the match,” Swiatek explained. “And in China, I feel it more than in other countries. So yeah, just happy to be here, and hopefully I'm going to be able to experience that as much as possible.”

And now, she'll live to experience that support for at least another day.

We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina. There's plenty on the line in the home stretch of the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025.

We're down to the final eight at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, a shorter-than-usual WTA 1000 tournament (didn't it just start?) and the final 1000-level event of 2025.

There's plenty on the line as we enter the weekend: the final three spots in the WTA Finals are still up for grabs, and it's one last opportunity to take home a signature title (Finals aside) and snag 1,000 ranking points.

There are plenty of familiar faces in the quarterfinals, including six players who have won WTA 1000 titles already. But there are also a couple of surprises, as always, who have the potential to create some chaos as we enter the home stretch of the tournament.

Here's a breakdown of the Wuhan Open quarterfinalists, and who they'll need to go through to get to the semis. 

Might as well call her the queen of Wuhan.

It was a fitting tournament for the World No. 1 to return to the Hologic WTA Tour post-US Open, as she's been dominant here in ways we've rarely ever seen.

The three-time defending champion came into Wuhan with a 17-0 all-time record, and the tournament favorite has looked the part this week. She's improved to 19-0 here with wins over Rebecca Sramkova -- she did need three sets to win that one -- and 16th seed Liudmila Samsonova, and appears to be in form after some much-needed R&R in Greece.

Needing to pick up wins to quality for the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Rybakina has has a productive week thus far following an earlier-than-expected exit in Beijing. After beating Jaqueline Cristian in her opening match, the World No. 9 had a rather easy time with Linda Noskova, who was coming off a run to the final at the China Open.

Rybakina currently trails Jasmine Paolini, who's No. 8 on the WTA Finals leaderboard, by a slim margin. 

The top seeds have only needed two wins to get to this point.

Siniakova, on the other hand, has already gotten five.

The top-ranked doubles player in the world, ranked 62nd in singles, came through qualifying to reach the quarterfinals. After defeating American Caty McNally and China's Wang Yafan to get into the main draw, the 29-year-old upset 15th-seeded Diana Shnaider before taking out Maya Joint and Iva Jovic.

She's yet to drop a set in Wuhan, and she's into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2018. 

“I can't remember the last time I played two sets."

We love the self-awareness from Pegula, who has been continually tested and pushed to the limit during the Asian swing.

As for her last straight setter, we can help: It was on Sept. 27, a 6-0, 6-3 win over Ajla Tomljanovic in Beijing. Since then, the American has played a ridiculous six three setters, winning five of them. (The lone loss, to Noskova in the China Open semis, ended in a heartbreaking 8-6 tiebreak.)

She narrowly escaped her first match against countrywoman Hailey Baptiste, saving six match points and eking out the deciding tiebreaker 8-6. Her second match wasn't quite as excruciating, but certainly no walk in the park. She came back from 5-2 down in the opening set to take it, then dropped the next one before winning yet another third set. 

The World No. 5 is into the Wuhan quarterfinals for the first time, and if she wins the title she'll become the sixth player to qualify for the WTA Finals.

What a week for the German veteran, 37, who's into the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000 tournament for the first time in her career. (Hard to believe, considering she's made the quarters of both the French Open and Wimbledon.)

After beating Dayana Yastremska in the first round -- Yastremska retired down 4-1 in the third set -- the World No. 57 upset World No. 5 Mirra Andreeva, her third Top 10 win of 2025. On Thursday against Magdalena Frech, Siegemund was on the ropes twice. She came back from 4-1 down in both the first and second sets to win 6-4, 7-6 (2).

Siegemund is also into the doubles quarterfinal, partnering with Fanny Stollar. (The pair upset Andreeva and Shnaider in the the third round, a double whammy for Siegemund over Andreeva.)

The American is into her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal in as many weeks, and has gotten to the final eight in Wuhan with ease. She dropped just one game in her dominant effort against Moyuka Uchijima, and then followed it up with a routine win over the ageless wonder Zhang Shuai.

Already qualified for the WTA Finals, and admittedly feeling less pressure post-Slam season, the 21-year-old should be loose and rested for her quarterfinal match.

Clinging to the No. 8 spot on the WTA Finals leaderboard, the Italian has taken care of business this week with three-set wins over Yuan Yue and 10th-seeded Clara Tauson, who retired trailing 3-1 in the third set. (Kudos to Paolini, always empathetic and caring, for being a great sport after the match.)

A year after making two Grand Slam finals, the 29-year-old has matched her career-high win total (40) from last year. She'll need a few more to secure her spot in Riyadh. (It is worth nothing that she's already punched her ticket in the WTA Finals doubles field, alongside partner and countrywoman Sara Errani.)

Swiatek just won her 125th match at a WTA 1000 tournament. 125! We had to double check -- and then triple check -- that stat because it's so absurd. (Yeah, she's 24...). But alas, it's true, a testament to how incredibly dominant she's been over her relatively young career.

But back to Wuhan ... the six-time Grand Slam champion, playing here for the first time, dropped just two games in her opening-round win over Marie Bouzkova, and though she won Thursday's match in straights as well, it wasn't easy. She needed a tiebreak to win the first set over Belinda Bencic, who served for it at 5-4, before ultimately prevailing 7-6 (2), 6-4 in 2 hours and 8 minutes.

She's now into the 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career.

These two have history. It's round 13 for the Grand Slam champions and perennial Top 10 players. 

Sabalenka owns a 7-5 advantage in their head to head, and they've split their last six meetings. Rybakina won the most previous matchup, a 6-1, 6-4 upset this summer in Cincinnati. Can she pull off another upset against the greatest player in this tournament's history?

Both of these players have played a lot of tennis recently. Siniakova came through qualifying to get here, and Pegula has played what feels like 50 straight grueling three setters. Who has more left in the tank?

Pegula, No. 6 in the PIF WTA Rankings, is the obvious favorite, especially considering she's won four of their five previous matchups. They played once this year, a 6-2, 6-3 Pegula win on grass in Bad Homburg. 

Gauff defeated Shuai, some 15 years her senior in the third round. Now she'll play an even older player in 37-year-old Siegemund. It's an interesting observation -- and it speaks to the incredible longevity that we see on tour now -- but it doesn't say a whole lot about this particular match, especially considering Siegemund came from behind to beat 18-year-old Andreeva earlier this week.

What is relevant, though, is the fact that Gauff hasn't spent much time on court this week, dropping just six games in two matches, and no woman has won more matches in China over the past three years.

They've split their two career meetings, the most recent of which was at the US Open two years ago. Gauff won that first-round match in three sets. (Their other match, in Auckland in 2020, also went the distance.)

Needing a win to keep pace on the WTA Finals leaderboard, this is likely the last player Paolini wants to see on the other side of the net. Swiatek has utterly dominated the Italian in her career, winning all six of their matchups and dropping just one set in the process. Two of those wins have come this year, the most recent of which was a 7-5, 6-4 victory for Swiatek in the Cincinnati final this summer.

 

We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina. There's plenty on the line in the home stretch of the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025.

 The emotions set in for Valentin Vacherot moments after he completed his fifth comeback win from a set down at the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters to become the first player born in Monaco to reach an ATP Tour semi-final. 

 After wiping away tears of joy, the 26-year-old signed the courtside TV lens, "Top 100!!!" 

 The qualifier rallied for his biggest career win over the No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Holger Rune, 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 in the second-longest match of the 2025 tournament (two hours, 59 minutes). It was his third main-draw win from a set down and fifth overall including two qualifying matches. He will next face four-time champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.

 "It was a lot of emotions, and I already had a lot of emotions," said Vacherot, who is the first qualifier to reach the semi-finals in the history of the Chinese ATP Masters 1000. "I was a bit going through the emotions, through everything. The first three wins, especially the one in the third round was tough to enjoy because Tomas (Machac) had to retire. But already the round of 16 against Griekspoor was a lot of emotions. It was an unreal moment. 

 “This one even more. My first semi-final. Also going from [World No. 204] to No. 92. It was just an unreal moment for me. So much emotion. To get to share that with my coach and brother, my girlfriend, Arthur [Rinderknech] my cousin. Still feels like there are still a few people with me here, and also ready to tomorrow to cheer on Arthur." 

 Rinderknech, who plays No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Friday, knew his cousin would one day join him in the Top 100. 

 "I wasn't doubting at all, but I was waiting for this moment for a long time," said Frenchman Rinderknech. "I can't wait to have a full year with him on the Tour and the following years."

 Last year, Vacherot was on the verge of breaking into the Top 100, reaching No. 110 in the PIF ATP Rankings on June 24, 2024. But a right shoulder injury forced him to be sidelined for most of the final seven months of the season, during which he played in just two tournaments, and none after retiring in the second round of qualifying at the US Open. 

 "I had a really tough one last year when I got hurt after Roland Garros in May, being 30 points away from the Top 100, just sitting on the couch, seeing myself not moving in the rankings, and then after going down," said Vacherot, who finished last season at No. 140 and fell as low as No. 267 on June 23 this year. "I knew it wasn't going to be easy this year to get back at the ranking. 

 "It took me a while. Even before this tournament I was ranked at 204, so it's still really far from the Top 100." 



 On the original qualifying cutoff list in Shanghai, Vacherot was 22 spots from getting into the draw. And when he arrived in the city on the Thursday night before qualifying began on Monday, he was still nine spots out. He learned less than 36 hours before qualifying began that he would make it into the draw. 

 "I knew there was a big chance because Shanghai is one of the last Masters 1000s [of the year] and a few guys, if you're hurt at the end of the season, you are not taking risks. I knew it would drop," said Vacherot, whose only previous Masters 1000 main draw in his career came in Monte-Carlo in April, when he lost in the second round. 

 "I said, worst of all, I was going to be here one week earlier, because I was going to play five more Challengers after," he said. "Now I'm just going to go home after this tournament, so it's another funny story. I said to myself, if I don't get in, I just train in the conditions of China for just one week and just be ready for after." 

 His half-brother Benjamin Balleret has been coaching him since 2022 and knows what the Top 100 milestone means. 

 "There was the injury last year and we were so close from the Top 100," said Balleret. "You have to start all over again and so it was very difficult for him to accept. It's a bit emotional because he's my brother and I see him grow and I know that he wants it so much. 

 “Sometimes I feel he wants it too much. Also because we started from zero. He came back from college and had zero points. I believe in him, he believed in me. He believed in my experience to help him. So for all that it's emotional."

 Rinderknech was in the player guest box on Thursday and was proud of his cousin's resilience. 

 "He was really fighting throughout the match today and he found a way, a little bit like his previous round. He found a way to win the second set, and physically Holger was struggling in the third,” said the Frenchman. “It's a single sport, so a lot of variables, and if any of them is not at 100 percent, nowadays everybody is just so close level-wise that it showed." 

 Rinderknech and Vacherot played two and a-half seasons at Texas A&M University and their coach from those days, former ATP pro Steve Denton, was watching the final two sets at home around 3 a.m. 

 "He is quite a fighter and the thing I always admired about Val is he never gave up and he went for it in the big moments," said Denton. "It was great to see his resilience and he went for it late in the tie-breaker and that was ultimately the difference. I couldn't be prouder of him and his brother Ben. They have been through a lot together and Val has learned his lessons well. He is ready."

Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka both delivered superb serving performances to set the stage for the 13th edition of their rivalry in the  Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals. Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini also bolstered their bids to reach the WTA Finals Riyadh.

It'll be Aryna Sabalenka vs. Elena Rybakina XIII in the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals.

The two rivals will square off for the 13th time after both came through tough matchups in straight sets on Thursday. No. 1 seed Sabalenka needed just 1 hour and 15 minutes to defeat No. 16 seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-3, 6-2, and No. 8 seed Rybakina followed with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Beijing finalist Linda Noskova.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Three-time Wuhan champion Sabalenka extended her unbeaten record at the tournament to 19-0, and her active winning streak to eight matches. Having lost two of her first three matches with Samsonova in 2022 and 2023, she has now won three in a row -- all in straight sets -- over the past 14 months. Rybakina, making her first appearance in Wuhan since reaching the 2019 quarterfinals on her debut, returned to that stage for a second time with her third win in as many meetings with Noskova.

How did Sabalenka and Rybakina advance?

It's not unusual that Sabalenka and Rybakina's performances revolve around the quality of the serve, but the stroke was on particularly sweet form for both players here. Neither even faced a break point -- despite landing just 49% of first serves, in Rybakina's case. (Sabalenka's first serve percentage was a tidier 66%.)

Sabalenka was particularly unbothered on serve. She conceded just 10 points behind her delivery in total; Samsonova could only once muster multiple points on return in a single game. Rybakina was pushed harder, but won all four deuce points (across three separate games) that she played in the match.

Rybakina also had to be patient to quell a valiant performance from Noskova. The 20-year-old Czech, bidding to reach back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals, managed to save the first six break points she faced with clutch aggressive play, and overall fended off 10 out of 12. But at 4-3 in the first set, it was lucky number seven for Rybakina as Noskova double faulted to drop serve for the first time.

How has the Sabalenka vs. Rybakina rivalry broken down so far?

Their quarterfinal on Friday will be something of a full-circle moment: Sabalenka and Rybakina first faced each other (at pro level) at the same stage of the same tournament back in 2019. Sabalenka won that match 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, the first of four three-set wins in a row to start their rivalry -- including a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph in the 2023 Australian Open final, the only major title match they have contested so far. Overall, Sabalenka leads the head-to-head 7-5.

However, once Rybakina got on the board with a 7-6(11), 6-4 win in the 2023 Indian Wells final, she has begun turning it in her favour. The Kazakhstani player has won five of their last eight meetings, and in fact leads the head-to-head on outdoor hard courts 5-4 overall -- Sabalenka has not defeated Rybakina on hard courts since the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun. The last time they played, Rybakina needed just 75 minutes to wrap up a 6-1, 6-4 win in the Cincinnati quarterfinals in August.

Match length is another factor to keep an eye on. Four of Rybakina's five wins in the series have come in straight sets; the only time she has won a decider against Sabalenka was at the 2024 WTA Finals Riyadh, where she came through 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. By contrast, all seven of Sabalenka's wins have been three-setters, including a 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(6) escape from quadruple match point down in this year's Berlin quarterfinals. The takeaway from that statistic seems to be that while Rybakina can find a level that permits her to shut Sabalenka out completely, if the match comes down to the wire then Sabalenka has the edge.

How is Rybakina's bid to make the WTA Finals Riyadh faring?

Two spots are up for grabs at the WTA Finals Riyadh, and three of the top four players in contention for them have all advanced to the Wuhan quarterfinals. As well as Rybakina, Jessica Pegula came through 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 over Ekaterina Alexandrova and Jasmine Paolini advanced after a right thigh injury forced Clara Tauson to retire trailing 3-6, 6-1, 3-1.

Paolini and Rybakina remain in eighth and ninth position respectively, and have put some distance between themselves and the chasing pack -- particularly given 10th-placed Alexandrova's loss, which means that no one is able to overtake Rybakina directly in Wuhan this week. The exits of both 11th-placed Tauson and 15th-placed Noskova have also helped.

Pegula's win also means that neither Paolini nor Rybakina can overtake her this week. However, seventh-placed Mirra Andreeva -- who lost her Wuhan opener to Laura Siegemund on Tuesday -- is in their sights. Both Paolini and Rybakina, who are on opposite sides of the draw, can overtake Andreeva if they reach the final. Rybakina needs to advance further than Paolini to overtake the Italian this week; if they lose in the same round, Paolini will remain ahead.

Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka both delivered superb serving performances to set the stage for the 13th edition of their rivalry in the  Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals. Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini also bolstered their bids to reach the WTA Finals Riyadh.

The former No. 1 is now two wins away from his first ATP hard-court title since 2023.ByDavid KanePublished Oct 09, 2025 copy_link

Novak Djokovic held off a late surge from Zizou Bergs to beat the Belgian, 6-3, 7-5 and reach the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters semifinals.🖥️📲The Match in 15 Minutes: Novak Djokovic def. Zizou Bergs, Shanghai QFThe former world No. 1 is now two wins from his first ATP hard-court title since the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals, booking a final-four clash with Monegasque qualifier Valentin Vacherot after an hour and 50 minutes on Stadium Court."Well, it's no secret I love playing in China," Djokovic said after the match. "I just mentioned the support of the crowd definitely makes you feel comfortable, gives you wind in your sails. When you're on the court feeling down they lift you up. So that's what's happening basically every single match the last couple matches for me here."I've been struggling quite a bit with energy levels. And just every opportunity that I get, the crowd feels it, and they stand behind me. And then, you know, I can hear that noise and that really, that energy drives me. I'm enjoying myself. As much as I'm suffering, at the same time I'm enjoying to play in front of them."With perhaps a little help from WTA world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the fourth-seeded Djokovic has navigated an upset-heavy tournament and brutally humid conditions to find himself the highest-ranked man left in the men's draw following exits from top seeds Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev.

The 38-year-old edged through back-to-back three-setters against Yannick Hanfmann and Jaume Munar to reach only his second Masters 1000 quarterfinal of the season, having largely sat out the Masters for the last several seasons.Djokovic was inspired to expand his calendar following a US Open semifinal defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, betting on his mental strength to better hold up over the Masters' best-of-three format. So far, that gamble has paid off in Shanghai, where he gained the mental ascendency over an inspired but erratic Bergs.A 26-year-old from Lommel, Bergs has enjoyed a career-best season, reaching his first two ATP finals and earning a career-high ranking of No. 44 following a third-round finish at the US Open. He reached his first Masters quarterfinal with impressive upsets of No. 19 seed Francisco Cerundolo and No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo, surviving the latter in a third-set tiebreaker.Djokovic naturally proved a steeper challenge as the Serb eased through the opening set and appeared to have the match wrapped up when he scored a crucial break in the ninth game of the second.Bergs pulled off a Houdiniesque comeback to level the set at five games apiece, but Djokovic battled right back, winning a lung-busting rally to earn a break point in the following game. Serving for the match a second time, Djokovic earned a pair of match points only for Bergs to save both and turn the tables once again with a break point opportunity.

A former college player for Texas A&M University, Vacherot made his first Masters 1000 semifinal after rallying from a set down to defeat No. 10 seed Holger Rune, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4."I've known him for last couple of years," Djokovic said. Obviously he's ranked before this tournament 200-plus. He's been around. He's playing for Monaco, which is a really great success, the biggest historical success for Monaco. It's amazing. So everyone is excited there. We know we have one of the nicest and biggest tournaments in our sport there in Monaco."He's been improving a lot. We always knew that he's got a great potential, with a big serve, a big game, he's a big guy. He kind of plays quite similar to Rinderknech, you know. And I see that they're quite close. The serve particularly reminds me of Arthur as well. So it's great to see that chemistry between them, that they're supporting each other. Arthur was there the whole match. Yeah, historic success for him and, yeah, I'm looking forward to play him. Hopefully I can get a win."

Seal of approval: Carlos Alcaraz's personal logo with Nike will reportedly make its long-awaited debut at the year-end ATP Finals in Turin, Italy according to a new report by Spanish-language media outlet *Murica Plaza.*The sportswear giant inked Alcaraz to a contract extension last year after he won his first Roland Garros crown, extending a contract that was due to lapse in 2025 into the mid-2030s with an eight-figure annual price tag. With the deal came the promise of a signature logo, putting Alcaraz on par not just with all-time greats like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, but peers including Naomi Osaka, Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner—all of whom have added their own marks to their gear alongside Nike's iconic swoosh.Read more: Carlos Alcaraz adds $1 million Australian Open ‘one point' challenge to packed scheduleAlcaraz has been sponsored by Nike since 2019, having previously worn Lotto apparel, and has worn unique on-court collections since evolving into one of the world's best players. But now, according to Manuel Tallón, his true personal touch—more than a year in the making—will debut when the world No. 1 takes the court at the season-ending championships for the third time.While the visual details of the logo have been kept close to the brand's vest, the report says Alcaraz has already signed off on its look. The launch plan, meanwhile, is seemingly following the blueprint of what Nike did for Sinner last year when he was the top-ranked ATP player. Back in 2022, Nike and Sinner unveiled an intricate logo shaped like a fox, and at the year-end event in Turin last fall, Sinner soft-launched custom gear and merchandise by first wearing them on the tournament practice courts.

But the logo isn't all that's coming to Alcaraz's porfolio. The report also says that he's added deals with food and beverage company Danone Group, which owns brandsl like Activia and Dannon yogurt and Evian water, and Brazilian financial investment fund Itaú Unibanco, the presenting sponsor of the Miami Open, to his rolodex.Already a face for off-court brands including Calvin Klein, Rolex and Louis Vuitton, Alcaraz will star in advertisements for both companies, having been announced as a global ambassador for Evian specifically back in June.

Come Friday, French cousin Arthur Rinderknech looks to join the Monegasque in the final four when he takes on Felix Auger-Aliassime. The family's group chat will be as active as ever by the sound of it.“There are 20, 25 people in the WhatsApp group,” Benjamin Balleret, Vacherot's half brother, coach and former world No. 204, shared with ATPTour.com Wednesday."Everybody loves tennis and the mother of Arthur played tennis. My mother played, our mother with Val was a tennis coach. Everybody loves tennis and follows and they supported me when I was playing, now [it is the same] for Val and Arthur. It is basically almost all now only about tennis and where the next holidays will be and how it will be."Reflected Vacherot to press after his latest win, “It was just an unreal moment for me. So much emotion. To get to share that with my coach brother, my girlfriend, Arthur my cousin. There's a few people with me here, and also ready (for) tomorrow to cheer on Arthur.”

Vacherot, who followed in Rinderknech's footsteps by playing college tennis at Texas A&M University before turning pro, owned one 1000-level victory prior to this week. He's been sensational playing from behind, starting with his two qualifying matches. His comeback victories in the main draw prior to Rune included No. 14 seed Alexander Bublik and No. 27 seed Tallon Griekspoor, with his run taking him to 6-1 against Top 50 opponents this season.With Vacherot's effort, a qualifier has now advanced to the semifinals at consecutive Masters 1000 events following Terence Atmane's run in Cincinnati. The 26-year-old is the second lowest-ranked player to appear in the last four on the 1000 stage since the series began 35 years ago and the first qualifier to reach this juncture of the tournament in Shanghai.Not bad for a guy who had no idea if he'd see any tournament action upon arriving.“I landed (last) Thursday evening. I was still nine out. I knew there was a big chance because Shanghai is the (second to) last Masters 1000. A few guys, if you're hurt at the end of the season you are not taking risks. I knew it will drop,” he recalled in press.“I said, ‘worst of all, I was going to be here one week earlier, because I was going to play five more Challengers after.' Now I'm just going to go home after this tournament, so it's another funny story.”

Rinderknech is also set to contest the biggest quarterfinal of his career at the age of 30. He, too, has knocked off a trio of seeded opponents to earn his spot among the last eight that included ousting third-ranked Alexander Zverev for the second time in 2025. A win over Auger-Aliassime would enable the Gassin native to call himself a Top 40 player for the first time.For Rune, it was a missed opportunity to make up substantial ground in the race to the ATP Finals. The Dane will remain at No. 12 and find himself no less than 935 points behind the all-important eighth position as the Turin leaderboard takes further shape. Auger-Aliassime can make the deficit greater if he moves up with a deep run here.

Jessica Pegula has made a habit of winning three-set matches lately and continued the trend Thursday, defeating No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just over two hours to advance to the quarterfinals in Wuhan for the first time.

The phrase “expect the unexpected” may have met its match in Jessica Pegula.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

For the sixth straight outing, Pegula took the court, and the result was a three-setter -- and for the fifth time, she came out on top.

“I can't remember the last time I played two sets,” Pegula said after the match. “But I've been competing really hard and I've been playing a lot of really good players. It was different conditions today with the roof closed and I think it took us a little while to get adjusted, but then I felt like it was a really high level there for the rest of the match.

“I'm just excited I was able to get over the finish line.”

The American rallied from a 5-2 deficit in the opening set to defeat No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in 2 hours and 6 minutes, advancing to the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open quarterfinals for the first time in her career.

Pegula improved to 3-3 in the head-to-head against Alexandrova, earning her first win over the Russian on a surface other than clay. She'll face the winner of Iva Jovic and Katerina Siniakova in the next round.

Here are some takeaways following another Pegula three-set victory:

Moment(s) of the match: Two pivotal stretches defined the match -- one in the opening set, the other in the decider.

With Alexandrova serving at 5-5, 15-30 in the first set, Pegula capped off a 12-shot rally with a blistering backhand winner to earn a break point, she converted, securing a 6-5 lead to allow her to serve for the set. It was the fourth of five straight games won by Pegula in her opening-set comeback.

Fast forward to the third set, and Pegula was trailing 7-5, 3-6, 1-2 and facing 30–30 on Alexandrova's serve. What followed was a defensive masterclass by Pegula.

She chased down multiple would-be winners -- including a smash -- and ended an 18-shot rally with a forehand winner to earn another break point. She converted, leveling the set at 2-all.

The break sparked a run of four straight games for Pegula, who surged to a 5-2 lead before closing out the match a couple games later.

Three is key: Winning three-setters has become a habit for Pegula, albeit an unintentional one.

Thursday's match marked her sixth consecutive three-setter, dating back to her third-round clash with Emma Raducanu last week in Beijing.

Across the 2025 season, Pegula has played a Hologic WTA Tour-leading 25 three-set matches, compiling a 14-11 record. Only Madison Keys (15) has won more three-setters than Pegula this year.

The 31-year-old went 13-7 in such matches in 2024.

Quarterfinal staple: With Thursday's win, Pegula has now reached the quarterfinals of a WTA event 10 times this season. Only Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka (13 each) have more.

She is 7-2 in quarterfinal matches thus far this season, coincidentally with both losses coming against Alexandrova.

Pegula also became the third active player, joining Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, to reach the quarterfinals at all 10 WTA 1000 tournaments on the calendar.

Jessica Pegula has made a habit of winning three-set matches lately and continued the trend Thursday, defeating No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just over two hours to advance to the quarterfinals in Wuhan for the first time.

Currently, Alcaraz is sidelined after withdrawing from the Shanghai Masters due to an ankle injury sustained during his run to the Tokyo title, where he defeated Taylor Fritz in the final.The Spaniard has previously voiced concerns about the ATP's crowded calendar. “The calendar is so tight, a lot of tournaments, no days off or not as much days off as I want,” he said at the Laver Cup. “I'm the kind of player who thinks there is a lot of mandatory tournaments during the year, and probably during the next few years gonna be even more tournaments… I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.”Still, the 22-year-old's busy schedule has drawn criticism—including from 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who called the complaints “contradictory”.

“Look, it's an individual sport, so there are choices to be made,” Djokovic said in response to comments from Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek. “I see some players say there are rules imposed for the bonus… So you can miss the bonus. It's the choice that you are willing to make if you want to play less.“But then, there are exhibitions that players are signing up for as well, so it's a little bit contradictory.”Alcaraz is next scheduled to appear at the Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia—a three-day exhibition event offering a $1.5 million appearance fee and a $4.5 million winner's prize—before returning to ATP Tour action at the Rolex Paris Masters from October 27 to November 2.

The best of the best. The ATP and WTA Finals pit the top eight singles players and doubles teams in the season's final battle. It's a culmination of the tour calendars, serving as both a grand finale and a showcase for the sport's elites. The year-end No.1 ranking is often on the line, as is a huge payday and momentum into next season. Outside of the four Grand Slams, this is the tournament the players covet.Here's what you need to know about one of the crown jewels in tennis:How do players qualify?Throughout the calendar year, players and teams earn points based on their tournament results. The points accumulate in a “race” to see who can finish first. At season's end, the top seven producers punch their ticket to their tour's Finals. The eighth spot is reserved for a Grand Slam winner ranked 8-20 in the standings. If no player meets that criteria, the final spot goes to the player who finished eighth in the race.In other words, it's the year's top performers going head-to-head.

Instead of single elimination, both tour Finals employ a round-robin format. The eight players and teams are divided into two groups of four, based off their final standings in the points race. Each singles player in a group will face off against each other in best-of-three tiebreak sets. Doubles uses a 10-point match tiebreaker in lieu of a third set.The top two from each group move on to the semifinals. A single loss doesn't eliminate a player or team, leading to secondary advancing criteria, such as head-to-head results. The winner of one group will play the runner-up of the other. The semifinal winners then play for the championship.When and where are they held?The Finals are a week-long event that take place at single venue.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

The new interview series – starring Amelia Dimoldenberg – is created and produced by Dimz Inc. and will be distributed via Amelia's YouTube channel.

Formula 1 and writer, host, producer and creator of Chicken Shop Date, Amelia Dimoldenberg, are set to launch a four-part YouTube original series called Passenger Princess, where internet sensation Amelia learns to drive with the help of the ultimate instructors – Formula 1 drivers.

Produced in collaboration with Amelia's production company, Dimz Inc., each episode will blend Amelia's signature humour with the fast-paced world of Formula 1. During the season, George Russell, Oscar Piastri, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz will act as her trusted guides to show her the ropes, as she embarks on the pursuit of a driving licence.

Following the success of Drive to Survive and F1 The Movie, this is the latest example of Formula 1's original content strategy to deeply embed the sport in popular culture and reach new fans outside of traditional race weekends.

With over 820 million fans worldwide, of which 43% are under 35 years old and 42% are female (up from 37% in 2018), the collaboration will bring the drama and excitement of Formula 1 to Amelia's avid fanbase of 3.15 million followers across all social media channels, including Chicken Shop Date.

The partnership marks the continued expansion of Dimz Inc. in entertainment and branded spaces, as Passenger Princess joins a slate of popular series including Amelia's Cooking Show and Who Cares?, a socio-political vox-pop program, as well as various special Red Carpet reports, hosted by Amelia.

“My dream has always been to tell stories and work with great collaborators, so I'm proud to be working with such an iconic and recognised brand as F1 on this latest original series," Dimoldenberg said.

"Although I don't know how to drive. I'm excited to put my well-established passenger – and interviewing – skills to good use.”

The show was filmed at the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix and will be hosted on Amelia's YouTube channel. More details about each programme, including the tasks Amelia will be set, will be shared ahead of each one being released.

“Amelia has one of the most distinctive and entertaining voices in culture today and we love the quality, originality, and global content she produces, so we're thrilled to be putting her in the driving seat on a Formula 1 track and offering some help from a few good drivers we know!” said Ian Holmes, Chief Media Rights and Broadcasting Officer of Formula 1.

“This original series is another way for F1 to entice a new audience into the exciting world of racing.”

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1, added: “This collaboration with Dimz Inc. marks the latest partnership from Formula 1 to engage with its rapidly growing demographic of young fans.

“Passenger Princess will combine Amelia's wit and charm with the drama and excitement of Formula 1 at one of the sport's most iconic circuits. We can't wait for fans to see it.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson give their views on how the Singapore Grand Prix panned out for Racing Bulls.

The Singapore Grand prix did not go to plan for Racing Bulls, who had both cars finish outside the points despite at times showing enough pace to mix with the top teams in practice and Qualifying. Isack Hadjar was forced to nurse an engine issue on his way to a P11 finish, while Liam Lawson finished down in 15th.

Hadjar had the best chance to score for the team at Marina Bay, the rookie starting in the top 10 and running ninth in the early stages. But the team radioed to say his car was suffering an issue just before the first round of pit stops.

The Frenchman dropped two places before pitting for fresh tyres, but the problem remained and he dropped down the order. As the rest pitted, somehow Hadjar found himself back in the top 10 – only to get picked off by a freshly shod Carlos Sainz late in the race.

“[It] was not a good race. We had an issue I think just before pitting. And from there was just a very, very long race,” he explained.

“I couldn't do anything, I was just hoping for the others not to catch up too quickly but they did and we got impacted a lot by the blue flags, we lost a lot there. And Carlos [Sainz] pitted before the blue flags so he benefited from that, but we should have done better.”

Team Principal Alan Permane said after the race that the issue with Hadjar's powertrain was costing him 0.5s a lap, so just to make the finish was impressive – let alone hang onto the coattails of the top 10. Hadjar was asked how it felt in the car once the issue became apparent.

“Really not good, you feel powerless in the corners, on the straights we were pretty much there. It's not nice but I know it is not my fault, nothing I could have done. I gave my all and even like this we finished P11 so not that bad.”

It is first time Racing Bulls have failed to score with either car since the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, but Lawson believed more was possible from his race. He opted for a very long first stint in the hopes of a Safety Car but dived into the pits when it became apparent one was not likely to materialise.

He was running ahead of Sainz when he pitted two laps before the Spaniard and yet finished five places lower than the Williams man – leaving him baffled as to how Sainz pulled off such a result.

“We just went very, very long, [and] stayed out most of the race on that set of mediums. Honestly, I don't really know, I need to have a look what happened because Carlos was behind me and he ended up finishing 10th so I have no idea what happened,” Lawson explained.

“For me, I came out behind the train [of cars], and he came out in front of the train so I need to have a look why. It's frustrating but the damage was mostly done yesterday from me. Something to reflect on for sure going forward.”

With two crashes marring his weekend, Lawson could be forgiven for being relieved to come out of the race with his car in one piece, especially after coming perilously close to Yuki Tsunoda through the first few corners at the start. But the Kiwi racer was searingly honest about what was possible out there.

“Had we started higher up the grid, we could've potentially ended up in the points with our pace, but a tough Quali meant it was going to be tricky from the outset,” he concluded.

Leah Lewis is breaking her silence after her Matlock co-star David del Río was fired from the CBS legal drama amid sexual assault allegations.


	In a post on Instagram Stories, Lewis shared a photo with her mom and thanked the people for the support she has been receiving during this time.


	“Mom is here, we're moving forward in love and strength. I'm in good hands,” she posted. “Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care.”


	She continued, “Truly, we're moving forward in strength. Key word, strength. Please, let that be the takeaway.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Lewis plays Sarah Franklin in the primetime drama, which stars Kathy Bates. Sarah is a first-year associate at Jacobson Moore, where the series takes place.

	











	Earlier today, Deadline reported that after an investigation, Del Río was fired from Matlock following an incident on September 26 that involved Lewis. Following the internal investigation, Del Río was fired and escorted off the lot, the same day that the alleged assault was reported.


Matlock Season 2 is set to premiere on October 12, with the first half of the season already wrapped in filming. The show will be on a pre-planned hiatus and resume production after Thanksgiving.


	Del Río played Billy Martínez, another first-year associate at the law firm, like Lewis' Sarah. 


Matlock also stars Skye P. Marshall as Olympia Lawrence and Jason Ritter as Julian Markston. The series also features recurring characters played by Eme Ikwuakor, Aaron Harris, Sam Anderson and Beau Bridges, among others. Justina Machado is set to join the cast in a recurring role for Season 2.

Man it is a tough year for hispanic's right now. I liked his character in the show and not so much Leah Lewis character.  But, having a daughter and two granddaughters, I really don't like the alleged assault situation.

Dude chose to throw his career away instead of being professional. Crazy world

sS crazy that others get elected to high office and appointed to cabinets…

A federal judge ruled that a "war of words" during a "heated rap battle" didn't break the law.

	Michael Saponara



Drake's defamation lawsuit surrounding Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us” against Universal Music Group was dismissed by a federal judge in New York City on Thursday (Oct. 9).

	Ten months after initially filing the lawsuit, accusing Lamar of defaming him while labeling him a “certified pedophile,” it was thrown out by Judge Jeannette Vargas, who granted UMG's motion for dismissal.

	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” the judge wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	While Drake can still appeal the ruling to a federal appeals court, fans from both sides of the coin didn't waste any time flooding social media with their reactions. 


	Lamar fans and Drake detractors mocked the OVO faithful on X and IG, while the rivalry was seemingly renewed with the famed 2024 battle now in the rear-view. 


	“From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,” UMG relayed to Billboard in a statement. “We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”

	











	“Not Like Us” arrived in May 2024 and served as the killshot in Kendrick's battle against Drake. The scathing diss track produced by Mustard topped the Billboard Hot 100 and swept all five of its nominations at the 2025 Grammy Awards, including record of the year and song of the year.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I don't think Drake and Kendrick tweeted one diss during their back and forth. That's Hip Hop. Keep it in the music. We are all tired.

This happening in the month of October is actually poetic. Talk about some Poetic Justice.

I still don't understand why Drake didn't just walk away from the battle. He lost to Kendrick Lamar but still earned some respect from accepting the challenge and taking on multiple opponents at once. The lawsuit was a terrible look, even more so now! 🤦🏾‍♂️

Drake went up against the “Machine” and lost… yall think im crazy for saying Drake will be blackballed.. There will be consequences from the “Machine”… he will always have fan support but the Machine will be whacking him behind the scenes for that lawsuit 🌚

Dolly Parton's late husband, Carl Dean, quietly finalized his estate plans years before his passing — and now, the details have officially been made public. Court documents obtained by Us Weekly reveal the provisions Dean made for Parton and their family, as well as how he planned to distribute his assets if she had passed first.

Dean died on March 3 at the age of 82. According to the filing, the will — signed on January 16, 2013 — was never amended. The country music icon, 79, has since been appointed executor of his estate.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

Dean's will names the Carl Thomas Dean Trust as the sole beneficiary of his estate, with Parton serving as trustee. The documents, obtained by US Weekly, state that the couple had no children and that Dean did not own real property in Tennessee, but he did possess personal property and cash. He also had no controlling interest in any active business or enterprise.

The will lays out specific instructions for the division of personal effects. Dean wrote that he intended to leave a handwritten note specifying who would receive which household and personal items. If that note could not be found, Parton would take responsibility for distributing the property.

Dean designated that Parton would receive “all of his right, title, and interest in any personal effects relating to her music and entertainment career, including, without limitation, pictures, costumes, jewelry, musical instruments and equipment.” If she had passed before him, those items would have been distributed through the trust.

Parton will also inherit his interests in furniture, art, automobiles, and other assets. If she had predeceased him, those items would have been divided equally among Dean's five nieces and nephews and Parton's 14 nieces and nephews.

If Parton could not serve as executor, Dean nominated his niece to take her place.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

The will's release comes as Parton continues to address public speculation about her health. Last week, the singer postponed her Las Vegas residency, and her sister called on fans to pray for her.

“I know lately everybody thinks that I am sicker than I am,” Parton said in a video shared to Instagram on Wednesday, captioned, “I ain't dead yet!” Filming between commercial shoots, she told fans, “Do I look sick to you? I'm working hard here!”

She explained that following Dean's death, she “didn't take care of myself” and “let a lot of things go.” Doctors recently told her it was time to address “some problems,” prompting her to cancel certain commitments to stay closer to home.

“Nothing major,” she assured. “But I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home.”

Parton concluded the video with a message to put fans at ease: “I wanted you to know that I'm not dying! I don't think God is through with me, and I ain't done working.”

DOLLY YOU ARE AN AMAZING  singer I love  the way you sing and please you need to really take good care of yourself  life is precious  I am 80 years of age and I  do my best to keep going with God in my life it's  been going good thank God. Because  in reality  I believe that He has the last say in our lives  especially if  a person  has a humble and loving person  because  God is love.😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏 God bless you.

Turning Point USA, the group co-founded by Charlie Kirk, said that it is planning its own Super Bowl halftime show to counter Bad Bunny, whose booking as the featured entertainment has generated opposition on the right.


	“It's true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon,” the group, now led by Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, announced on X.

	Bad Bunny has been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the raid on homes and businesses being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That triggered a number of commentators on the right over the choice. Tomi Lahren said that he was “not an American artist,” but Bad Bunny is a native of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.

	











	After Bad Bunny was announced last month as the performer, Corey Lewandowski, the chief adviser to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said that ICE agents would be present for the NFL title game, which is set for February 8 on NBC.

	“We're going to do enforcement everywhere,” Lewandowski said. “We are going to make Americans safe. That is a directive from the president. If you're in this country illegally, do yourself a favor: Go home.”

	











	Turning Point has not announced a venue or other details, such as whether any media outlet will carry the performance.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) expressed his opposition to Bad Bunny earlier this week, calling it a “terrible decision.” “In my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or role models doing that, not somebody like this,” he told reporters.

Can't t really complain too much I never watch the first half of the stupidbowl or half time stuff anyway and never watch anything that has to do with  that hatred promoting Turning Point USA but it it does seem like the bowl should consider its audience and this entertainment does.
Remember the Superbowl is pretty much a live entertainment for the wealthy.

It's crazy to turn to a klan concert instead of celebrating American diversity.

Yes! Please do a half tune show! God bless Turning Point and I know HE is! I support this effort!

I had never heard of Lee Greenwood before. So I googled him. I've never heard of any of his songs before. But he looks a lot like the manager of a Western Sizzlin'

Lee Greenwood? With all due respect, he's not on anyones top 1000 list. Bad Bunny is currently one of the top artists in the world. However my bet, he gets cancelled before the SB :-(

Less than a year after the rapper filed his stunning lawsuit, a federal judge says nobody thought Kendrick was really calling him a pedophile.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	A federal judge on Thursday (Oct. 9) dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” ruling that a “war of words” during a “heated rap battle” did not violate the law and that some of the case was “logically incoherent.”


	Drake's case, filed earlier this year, claimed that UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track, which tarred his arch-rival as a “certified pedophile.” He believed that millions of people took that lyric literally, severely harming his reputation.


	But just 10 months later, Judge Jeannette Vargas granted UMG's motion to dismiss the case at the outset — ruling that Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of “hyperbole” that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact.


	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” the judge wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	The ruling marks an abrupt end to a legal battle that stunned the music industry. Few expected a rapper to respond to a diss track with a lawsuit — a move that drew ridicule in the hip-hop world and condemnation from legal scholars. Fewer still expected him to file it against UMG, his longtime record label and the biggest music company in the world.


	In a statement sent to Billboard, Drake's attorneys say they “intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it.”


	In a statement to Billboard, a spokesman for UMG said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleged that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG argued those allegations were clearly meritless — that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	The dispute got even nastier in February, when Lamar made “Not Like Us” the centerpiece of his Super Bowl halftime show. After speculation about whether he'd play the track at all, Lamar used the show to mock his rival, looking directly into the camera as he rapped, “Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young.”


	In her decision on Thursday, Judge Vargas sided entirely with UMG, ruling normal listeners would not expect “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.”


	She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting from a line in “Family Matters” in which the star was “heavily implying that Lamar is a domestic abuser” and another in which Drake says he heard that “one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his.”


	“The recording was published as part of a heated public feud, in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,” Judge Vargas wrote. “This is precisely the type of context in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole rather than factual assertions.”


	The judge also rejected Drake's arguments about the popularity of “Not Like Us,” saying she could not make that kind of “retroactive analysis” of artistic expression. She wrote that when Lamar wrote his song, he “could not have been aware” that it would later break streaming records, win Grammys, or be the centerpiece of a Super Bowl halftime show.


	“Yet plaintiff would have the court divorce the recording from the context in which it was created because of these subsequent events,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Whether publications constitute actionable fact or protected opinion cannot vary based upon the popularity they achieve. Constitutional guarantees do not rest on such a flimsy foundation.”


	The judge was equally unimpressed with Drake's claim that the song became defamatory because UMG repeatedly republished it and drove its success: “This argument is logically incoherent,” the judge wrote. “If the recording was nonactionable opinion at the time it was initially produced, then its republication would not expose UMG to liability.”

Less than a year after the rapper filed his stunning lawsuit, a federal judge says nobody thought Kendrick was really calling him a pedophile.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	A federal judge on Thursday (Oct. 9) dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” ruling that a “war of words” during a “heated rap battle” did not violate the law and that some of the case was “logically incoherent.”


	Drake's case, filed earlier this year, claimed that UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track, which tarred his arch-rival as a “certified pedophile.” He believed that millions of people took that lyric literally, severely harming his reputation.


	But just 10 months later, Judge Jeannette Vargas granted UMG's motion to dismiss the case at the outset — ruling that Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of “hyperbole” that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact.


	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” the judge wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	The ruling marks an abrupt end to a legal battle that stunned the music industry. Few expected a rapper to respond to a diss track with a lawsuit — a move that drew ridicule in the hip-hop world and condemnation from legal scholars. Fewer still expected him to file it against UMG, his longtime record label and the biggest music company in the world.


	In a statement sent to Billboard, Drake's attorneys say they “intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it.”


	In a statement to Billboard, a spokesman for UMG said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleged that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG argued those allegations were clearly meritless — that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	The dispute got even nastier in February, when Lamar made “Not Like Us” the centerpiece of his Super Bowl halftime show. After speculation about whether he'd play the track at all, Lamar used the show to mock his rival, looking directly into the camera as he rapped, “Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young.”


	In her decision on Thursday, Judge Vargas sided entirely with UMG, ruling normal listeners would not expect “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.”


	She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting from a line in “Family Matters” in which the star was “heavily implying that Lamar is a domestic abuser” and another in which Drake says he heard that “one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his.”


	“The recording was published as part of a heated public feud, in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,” Judge Vargas wrote. “This is precisely the type of context in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole rather than factual assertions.”


	The judge also rejected Drake's arguments about the popularity of “Not Like Us,” saying she could not make that kind of “retroactive analysis” of artistic expression. She wrote that when Lamar wrote his song, he “could not have been aware” that it would later break streaming records, win Grammys, or be the centerpiece of a Super Bowl halftime show.


	“Yet plaintiff would have the court divorce the recording from the context in which it was created because of these subsequent events,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Whether publications constitute actionable fact or protected opinion cannot vary based upon the popularity they achieve. Constitutional guarantees do not rest on such a flimsy foundation.”


	The judge was equally unimpressed with Drake's claim that the song became defamatory because UMG repeatedly republished it and drove its success: “This argument is logically incoherent,” the judge wrote. “If the recording was nonactionable opinion at the time it was initially produced, then its republication would not expose UMG to liability.”

Despite recent success, Zohran Mamdani still faces many challenges toward becoming mayor of New York City, particularly Islamophobia and biases against Democratic Socialists. In addition to being the Big Apple's first Muslim candidate for mayor, he's running against disgraced former Governor and establishment-approved sex pest Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't miss an opportunity to provoke said establishment's prejudices against his opponent. But even the would-be high-profile fighters for Democracy can't seem to treat an outsider candidate with due respect. In a New Yorker profile on Mamdani, the candidate revealed the dismissive line of questioning The Late Show With Stephen Colbert's producers used to work around Mamdani's belief that Israel shouldn't be allowed to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

Mamdani appeared on The Late Show alongside New York City Comptroller Brad Lander during the June Democratic primary. The two candidates had recently endorsed each other in hopes of shutting out Cuomo, a plan that ultimately worked. Ahead of their appearance, Colbert's producers held a prep call with Mamdani, Lander, and their aides to go over some basic political questions about their positions. It seemed to go well enough, but right before they went on stage, producers threw a couple of curveballs at Mamdani. Per The New Yorker, hours before the segment, a group of prominent Jewish Zionists (the article only names Elie Wiesel's son, Elisha) demanded that Colbert “grill” Mamdani on Israel. A Colbert producer thought of a “thumbs-up or thumbs-down” segment, as in “Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: Hamas. Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: a Palestinian state,” would do the trick. Mamdani was unimpressed. “I just couldn't believe what was happening,” Mamdani told The New Yorker. “That a genocide could be distilled into a late-night game.”

Mamdani's advisers were just as unhappy, with a senior adviser telling producers that they wondered why the producers didn't want to ask about “the first Muslim candidate for mayor in the history of New York.” It's an Islamophobic line of questioning foisted on Mamdani throughout the campaign, despite, as the candidate frequently tells people, he's not running for mayor of Israel. Nevertheless, he offered an answer: “Yes, like all nations, I believe it has a right to exist, and a responsibility also to uphold international law.”

Taylor Swift released her 12th album The Life of a Showgirl last week — and before it was even out for a full day, listeners were already pointing out similarities between her new songs and existing tracks by other artists. The comparisons were harmless, at first, but some of them escalated into full-blown accusations of musical plagiarism. Some of the songs in question include the album's title track, the buzzy diss track “Actually Romantic,” and the Travis Kelce-inspired “Wood.” 


	“The internet loves to sleuth, doesn't it,” forensic musicologist and professor at Berklee College of Music Dr. Joe Bennett tells Rolling Stone. “But similarity alone is not evidence of influence, still less copyright infringement. Coincidental partial similarity is way more common than many people think — but songwriters actually copying from each other is way less common than many people think.”


	Dr. Bennett points out that popular music is a “constrained art form” where most songs have a “fixed tempo, limited topline pitch range, stay with in the home key, and are based on looping chord progressions,” he explains. “Of course, you're going to get slight overlaps from time to time.”

	Following the rush to point out sonic similarities between Swift's new songs and some older ones, some people on the internet were quick to call for legal action to defend artists they believed had been ripped off. (A rep for Swift declined to comment.) But Dr. Bennett thinks there is not much of a case there for any of the most popular melody comparisons. Here, he breaks down why.

	











	For Dr. Bennett, this one is a false flag. Listening closely will make it clear that “most of the notes are different and they use entirely different chord progressions.” What many are likely picking up on is similar keys and tempos used by both artists. 


	“I would describe them as objectively dissimilar, and it's easily possible that two separate songwriting teams could have arrived at these melodic choices independently of each other,” he says. “Most of the notes are based on the first three pitches of the major scale – literally, do-re-mi. Melodic coincidences happen.”

	“In the case of Actually Romantic, the only similarity is the chord progression (E C#m G# A) and key center (E major),” Dr. Bennett explains. “There are no similarities of topline melody, lyric, or any other part of the composition. But inevitably, songs that use the same chord progression will sound subjectively similar.” The Berklee professor points out that while this particular chord progression —  I-vi-III-IV (1 major, 6 minor, 3 major, 4 major) — is not super common, it is also not entirely unique. “As well as Pixies, I found it in songs by Ellie Goulding, Arctic Monkeys, Demi Lovato, and others. Taylor herself loves to re-use common chord progressions, but always makes a fully original song out of them.”

					Florida Man Charged With Setting Devastating Pacific Palisades Fire		
	









	To Dr. Bennett, this accusation holds up least. “Every funky guitar player knows licks like this,” he says. He adds that there are several popular songs from the peak disco and funk era that bear the same production tropes and musical elements that she and her co-producers Max Martin and Shellback pulled from: Earth, Wind, and Fire's “September” or “Shining Star,” Michael Jackson's “Don't Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Bee Gees' “Jive Talkin,'” and Taste of Honey's “Boogie Oogie Oogie.”


	Like the rest of the comparisons, Dr. Bennett does not see any reason for Swift to add interpolation credits to her songs. “She's just using commonplace musical elements and having fun with production tropes,” he explains. “When Taylor does choose to interpolate another artist's work, she does so with intentionality and credit. See ‘Look What You Made Me Do' and ‘Father Figure.'”

Hulu keeps releasing trailers with Kim Kardashian in them and people keep watching.


	The streamer has touted that the trailer for All's Fair, its upcoming legal drama starring Kardashian, Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash-Betts, has become its biggest ever in just 24 hours.


	It launched the promo yesterday and it has received 57.3M views across YouTube and social media. The Google-owned service was responsible for just over 16M of those views.


	The trailer introduces audiences to a group of highly skilled, tenacious female divorce attorneys who have left their male-dominated firm to open their own powerhouse practice, all of them dead set on helping women best their husbands in messy divorces.

	











	It beats Season 3 of reality series The Kardashians, which was Hulu's biggest ever trailer launch with 47.2M when it was released in 2023.


All's Fair, which comes from Ryan Murphy, will premiere on November 4. The trailer also highlights the drama between Kardashian and Paulson's characters, which appears to be extending beyond the courtroom and into their own ranks when Paulson takes on Kardashian's husband as her client.


	The series also stars Teyana Taylor and Matthew Noszka.


All's Fair is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television. The series is written and executive produced by Murphy, who also directs. Other executive producers include Jon Robin Baitz, Joe Baken, Jamie Pachino, Lyn Greene, Richard Levine, Kardashian, Close, Watts, Nash-Betts, Paulson, Kris Jenner, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson and Nissa Diederich. Anthony Hemingway executive produces and directs as well.

Santiago Menghini, the filmmaker behind the award-winning horror short 'Milk,' is in the director's chair for New Line's latest horror movie.

	A sequel to New Line's The Curse of La Llorona is finally underway.


Jay Hernandez, who starred as the titular Magnum P.I., and Monica Raymund, one of the stars of TV's Chicago Fire, are the big names in the feature, titled The Revenge of La Llorona and that also has rising actors Edy Ganem (9-1-1), Martín Fajardo (Griselda), Acston Luca Porto (Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado), Avie Porto (Bob Hearts Abishola) on the call sheet.




	Raymond Cruz, who co-starred in the 2019 movie as the helpful Father Perez, is one acting talent returning for the feature, which began production this week in Buffalo.

	But while the producing team is the same, the director and writer are not. Santiago Menghini, the Canadian filmmaker known for his award-winning short Milk and who made his feature debut with 2021 horror movie No One Gets Out Alive, is sitting in the director's chair.


	Sean Tretta, who worked with Wan on the filmmaker's Creature from the Black Lagoon feature set up at Universal, wrote the script.


	The fact that the movie is now in production is a notable resuscitation of a sequel that had been shelved several times before, at least once even during pre-production. That last shelving occurred in early 2024 and may have been due to budgetary issues. Sources say movement on this one got going after the success of this summer's Final Destination: Bloodlines, which showed the company that an appetite for sequels exists.

	











La Llorona's tears can't be ignored. A surprise breakout when it was released in 2019, The Curse of La Llorona grossed $123 million worldwide. That movie was led by Linda Cardellini and directed by Michael Chaves, who graduated to the The Conjuring franchise, helming the last two entries, including the most recent one, The Conjuring: Last Rites. Last Rites is a prime example of the enduring strength of the supernatural horror franchise, as it has grossed over $460 million worldwide on a budget of around $55 million.


	Latino audiences are among those flocking to the scares, with Revenge of La Llorona hoping to tap that market.  


	Executive producers on the new movie include Mia Maniscalco, Jamie Buckner, Michael Clear, and Judson Scott.


	The story sees the vengeful spirit La Llorona returning, forcing a fractured family to confront their past and join forces with their estranged curandero grandfather to battle ancient evils, before the Weeping Woman claims their children forever.


	Menghini is repped by UTA, Good Fear and Mike Castrillo at McKuin Frankel. Tretta is repped by CAA, Adventure Media, and attorney Jennifer Levy.


	Cruz is repped by Media Artists Group, Raymund is repped by Gersh and Door 24, and Hernandez is repped by CAA, Alchemy Entertainment and Fuller Law.


	Fajardo is repped by Magnitude Entertainment and CESD, siblings Acston Luca Porto and Avie Porto are repped by Coast to Coast Talent Group, D.R. Entertainment, and attorney Carolyn Conrad. Ganem is repped by Prime Talent Media, Allegory Creative Talent and Yorn Levine.

Like a naturally gifted athlete asked to learn the fundamentals now that he's entering into the big leagues, the scrappy talents of director Kenji Iwaisawa (On-Gaku: Our Sound) chafe against the best practices of typical anime in his sophomore film. After rotoscoping his own indie film about slackers in a DIY punk band, his follow-up, 100 Meters, jogs along a well-trod path: It adapts a hit sports manga, one about two young rivals finding meaning in competition, told over a series of races across the years. Like the distance its sprinters dash over and over again, it's predictable—even mundane at times. But also like those short bursts of all-out adrenaline, it can be transcendent in the moment.

The division between Togashi (Atsumi Tanezaki as a child, Tori Matsuzaka when grown) and Komiya (Aoi Yūki; Shota Sometani) won't surprise anyone familiar with the “spo-kon” formula found in shōnen stories: The former is the fastest kid in school, the latter a shy transfer student with the need for speed. It's talent against passion, favorite against underdog, complacency against hunger. Across the decades, the two egg each other on as they grow up and go pro, helping assuage the disillusionment that always threatens single-minded devotion. 

This kind of emotional connection by proxy, the excuses of running or video games or volleyball or fighting aliens, is standard-issue for the genre, undergirding plenty of platonic masculine relationships and the existential questions lurking beneath. Why do they push themselves? If they're not the best, why race at all? Why devote so much of your life to one hyper-specific, seemingly juvenile pursuit? These typical concerns are surely answered with artful elegance in  Uoto's manga, but in Iwaisawa's hands, there's another layer underneath the athletic navel-gazing—something primal and raw.

100 Meters stalls and cramps when it's stuck in hallways and auditoriums, where older side characters like Kaido (Kenjiro Tsuda) and Saizu (Koki Uchiyama) wax on about running at such length that even Haruki Murakami would be checking his smartwatch. But when it's on the track, Iwaisawa's film unleashes the myriad shifting styles that made On-Gaku such a vital garage rocker. 

Iwaisawa's rotoscoping weighs down the characters, adds realistic heft to their muscles and movements, their bodies hyper-physical set against more painterly backgrounds. The world fades away behind the athlete's legs and feet. Nothing else matters when they're running, and that's clear in every frame. Then, mid-race, the animation bursts free from reality. Faces grimace against the wind, eyes bulge, heartbeats and the percussive smack of sneakers blend into a single thump. It's animalistic, all that philosophizing about sport reduced to a heartracing sensory experience. Some races are captured in long unbroken takes, some are blacked-out and only communicated through sound. One, set during the pouring rain, is as exciting and beautiful as anything in animation this year.

If the rest of the film matched these transcendent moments, 100 Meters would have built up a personalized rivalry worthy of the sports-movie pantheon. But despite the plot's template, the friction between its racers is off-handed; this isn't a movie about one sprinter running against another, but several sprinters running against themselves—against the dozen-second dash they've chosen as their lifelong foe. There's beauty in that, if not a lot of drama. It's just another part of the film's uneasiness, the same kind that comes up when auteurs find themselves consumed by the Marvel machine after a heartfelt indie or two. Iwaisawa's punk spirit resists being trampled by the sports drama's game plan, but it does feel limited when confined to a single stretch of track.

For cinephiles of a certain age, the emergence of cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed was a watershed moment in American movies. His work on Spike Lee‘s “Clockers,” on which he made his feature debut in 1995 as director of photography, is still stunning in its audacity over 30 years later — it's a master class in how to harness light, color, and composition toward specific and devastating emotional effects. 

Sayeed used a then largely antiquated film stock, Ektachrome, to find an appropriate visual grammar for Lee's harrowing portrait of a crack-devastated neighborhood, and the result was one of the most original and striking films of its (or any other) era. It was also a big risk that paid off — at the time, Sayeed told American Cinematographer magazine that Kodak warned him that the reversal stock he was shooting on might not survive the shoot.

 








Related Stories ‘The Woman in Cabin 10' Review: Keira Knightley Goes Agatha Christie in This Chilly, Silly Ruth Ware Adaptation ‘After the Hunt' Review: Luca Guadagnino's Tricky Post-#MeToo Thriller Boasts a Stirring Julia Roberts and an Underwhelming Script 

It did, and the successful experiment led to a series of collaborations between Sayeed and Lee that included “Girl 6” and “He Got Game,” films as revolutionary in their technique as they were lively and playful. No one else in the 1990s was making movies that looked like these, or like Sayeed's gorgeous work on Hype Williams' crime movie “Belly”; it was impossible to deny that Sayeed was a major talent.

 










One moviegoer who took notice was Luca Guadagnino, who was a few years away from making his directorial debut with “The Protagonists” when he saw “Clockers” for the first time. “I hadn't done my first movie yet, but I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to work with this guy,'” Guadagnino told IndieWire. “His sense of cinema was astonishing, and he has a technical approach to his work that is mind-blowing.”

There was only one problem: by the time Guadagnino started directing movies, Sayeed had left feature films behind for a life shooting commercials, motivated largely by his desire to be present for his kids. “We give all of ourselves to make films,” Sayeed said. “I started a family, and I just felt at a certain point that I needed to focus on that, because I'm not a good multitasker. And it wasn't like I was deliberate about not doing a film, it was just that the right one would have to come.”

The “right one” that brought Sayeed back to feature filmmaking after a 25-year hiatus was “After the Hunt,” Guadagnino's academia-set thriller about a philosophy professor (Julia Roberts) whose life is upended when a colleague and former lover (Andrew Garfield) is accused of assault by a student (Ayo Edebiri). Guadagnino had never stopped dreaming of working with Sayeed in the years since he fell in love with “Clockers.” 

 










“I was very consistent because I truly kept wishing to work with Malik,” Guadagnino said. “So being consistent and setting myself the task of getting what I want in life and waiting and being a very patient person, years later, I convinced him to do this movie with me.”

As cinephiles, Guadagnino and Sayeed immediately bonded over their shared references, as they crafted a visual grammar for “After the Hunt” derived from a variety of sources. While Guadagnino acknowledges that there's a Hitchcockian quality to the narrative, he and Sayeed looked beyond the master of suspense to European arthouse cinema and the New Hollywood of the 1970s to figure out how they wanted to mount Nora Garrett's ambiguous screenplay.

“Luca's very precise,” Sayeed said. “He's very precise with language, and very precise with the way he shoots. I liked that he was specific with the references for this.” One key influence was cinematographer Sven Nykvist's work with Ingmar Bergman, specifically the films they made together between 1961 and 1972. “In particular, ‘Persona' and ‘The Silence,' but we also screened a print of ‘Cries and Whispers.' ‘The Passion of Anna' spoke to me as well.”

While Bergman and Nykvist were key inspirations in terms of the portraiture in “After the Hunt,” a film that derives a great deal of its power from staring unwaveringly at human faces, Sayeed and Guadagnino looked at another legendary cinematographer, Gordon Willis. They focused on his work between 1977, when he shot Woody Allen's “Annie Hall,” and 1988, when he photographed James Bridges' underrated “Bright Lights, Big City.” 

 










“With Gordon Willis, it's world-building,” Sayeed said. “With Ingmar Bergman, it's about faces and how they're composed in the frame.” Sayeed also looked to the late, great cinematographer Harris Savides for inspiration in lighting the world of academia in which “After the Hunt” takes place. “It was about creating atmosphere in those spaces,” Sayeed said.

Interestingly, although “After the Hunt” very specifically takes place at Yale, the film was not shot there — or even in America. Sayeed and production designer Stefano Baisi had to recreate Yale in London, where Guadagnino enjoyed making a film in the old Hollywood style, where everything was recreated on massive soundstages and sets. Baisi and Sayeed toured Yale together to examine the architectural styles and study the light in both the interiors and exteriors.

The illusion of reality Sayeed, Baisi, and Guadagnino created is extremely impressive in its craftsmanship, but in spite of his reputation as a master technician, Sayeed feels cinematography is as much about the energy on set as it is about the tools of the trade. “I think the energy on the set gets transduced to the film, always,” Sayeed said. “I think it's Ozu's cinematographer who believed that the energy of the person who touches the camera is actually reflected on the film.”

 










On “After the Hunt,” Sayeed credited not only Guadagnino but actors like Julia Roberts and Michael Stuhlbarg with creating the right kind of energy to make something special happen. “ It starts at the top, and Julia created a calm, comforting space,” he said. “I think Michael usually needs more space, but he was extremely accommodating and very gracious about what everyone else needed.”   

The relaxed energy on set served as both a contrast to the material and the resource that was needed to execute it. “Because of the material and how tough it was, it was important for us to feel like we could do what we needed to do clearly and comfortably in those moments,” Sayeed said. “It was a special place for us to function in, and I'm really thankful I was a part of it, because we are just there to be in the moment, and it was a calm, comfortable space to be in.”

Chris Pratt has saved the galaxy, battled velociraptors and is now playing an LAPD detective accused by an AI court of slaying his wife in Amazon MGM Studios‘ upcoming Mercy from Timur Bekmambetov.


	The trailer just dropped at New York Comic Con, and we see that Pratt's Detective Raven, the architect of a system whereby accused felons have 90 minutes to prove their innocence, is now convicted. He's up against an AI judge (Rebecca Ferguson), and he doesn't know how this occurred. Pratt's Raven gets help from his partner (Kali Reis), who helps him retraces his steps.


	Pratt said the movie, which is set in the near future, was shot like a stage play with 60-minute full-length takes. Ferguson's judge is on a monitor, as you can see in the trailer, with Pratt buckled down in a chair. The actor said he literally was strapped in during the shoot, creating “a natural claustrophobia.”

	











	Said Bekmambetov about having the movie set in real time: “We live in a world today where AI is knocking on the door and we don't have time to understand what happened. AI could be our enemy, our friend or our child. This ticking clock is metaphorical of the time we live in now.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Oscar-winning Oppenheimer producer Charles Roven, who also was on today's NYCC panel, said: “We got a pitch from a writer, Marco [van Belle], who wrote the script. When we first got the script, people were talking about AI, and it wasn't happening yet. When we started talking about the movie, all of a sudden companies were dealing with AI, and the future wasn't definitely not far away. The fact that the movie takes place in 2029, I think every day, every week, every month that goes by, there's something more that makes our movie true.”


	Give Mercy props: It was shot in downtown Los Angeles. Bekmambetov shot a truck-chase scene over six days. Talk about taking DP equipment to another level: The director revealed that in addition to shooting the movie with bodycams and drones, he used robo-dogs to film crowd scenes.  The pic comes hits theaters January 26 via Amazon MGM Studios.

Crush is a propulsive, ticking-clock survival thriller about a woman hiking alone in the Everglades who wakes to find herself trapped in the crushing coils of a massive python, fighting to stay alive as every breath brings her closer to death. Inspired by true events and told primarily in real time, the hot spec is said to be a real page-turner that has already begun attracting interest from major actresses for its juicy lead role.

					Temple Hill UK Chief Heading To 'Adolescence' Director Philip Barantini's Production Outfit		
			








	20th is said to be fast-tracking the project for production, with conversations underway on a director and cast. Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey will produce for Temple Hill, with Scott Glassgold's 12:01 Films also attached to produce. J.R. Young will be overseeing for 20th. While unconfirmed, sources placed Fischer's deal in the mid-to-high six figures.

	As previously alluded to, there's an interesting backstory to this project: Fischer, who serves as Executive Vice President of Development and Production at Temple Hill Entertainment, wrote it under the pseudonym J.W. Archer in his free time, unsure whether anyone would like it or if he'd ever do anything with it. It quickly gathered heat after he posted it on the Black List, leading to outreach from reps eager to sign him and take the project out. Fischer then had to sheepishly walk into the office of his Temple Hill bosses to confess that he'd written a script — and ask if they might want to produce it. Now, he's in the enviable position of getting a movie he wrote off the ground while still juggling his day-to-day executive duties.


	“Needless to say, it was quite a surprise when John walked into our office and told us he had written a script on the weekends in Spain while working on one of our movies,” Bowen and Godfrey told Deadline. “We went from being terrified about how to come up with nice things to say when he asked us to read it to elated that it was a thrill ride of a movie that we wanted to produce. We can't wait to abuse him with pages and pages of notes as we move this into production.”

	











	Fischer joined Temple Hill in 2016, going on to co-produce The Hate U Give, based on the bestselling novel by Angie Thomas, before exec producing titles including Uncle Drew, On the Come Up, and We Have a Ghost. He also produced Sundance prize-winner Emergency, as well as Temple Hill's horror hit Clown in a Cornfield and Lasse Hallström's The Map That Leads to You.


	Fischer's upcoming films as a producer include Monitor, a high-concept horror written and directed by Matt Black and Ryan Polly; Children of Blood and Bone, the adaptation of Tomi Adeyemi's bestselling novel directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood for Paramount; and The Berenstain Bears, an animated feature based on the beloved book series.  Fischer has no plans to quit his day job just yet, but given his natural storytelling instincts, we'll see where things go from here. 


	Recently producing Smile 2, as well as Clown in a Cornfield, Temple Hill's other upcoming projects include Charlie Harper and People We Meet on Vacation. Glassgold is coming off producing the sleeper Sony hit Tarot, which grossed nearly $50 million worldwide, and is currently readying Drew Hancock's My Wife and I Bought a Ranch for Amazon MGM Studios.


	Fischer and 12:01 were repped by Verve on the deal.

This is delightful, but not at all surprising. John has always been a talented writer with breadth and taste. VERY cool that he did it under a pseudonym.

Yes, just like your comment, John :)

so now execs are writing scripts without telling any one…. why isnt he doing his job and trying to find a writer to write this story that he brought in. thats his job.

What a mindless comment. Should actors not direct? Should writers not act? Seems like maybe you're jealous of someone who can wear multiple hats successfully.

If you come up with the idea yourself, nobody else is entitled to it. You have every right to pen it yourself.

What's more, JF proven to every writer he works with that he's faced that blank page and flashing cursor, just like they have.

Nothing but kudos and congratulations here.

So he came up with the idea completely on his own? Then what does Glassgold, who almost deals exclusively in short stories, have to do with it in that case, and why is he a producer on it if Temple Hill should be the only producer needed? Why bring in another non-writing producer?

Now writers have to compete with execs moonlighting as writers. OH MY GOODNESSS. WE ARE COOKED.

Good guy

While A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms is set 100 years before the events of Game Of Thrones, its first teaser brings some welcome change to Westeros. Until now, all we've known of the on-screen Game Of Thrones universe are the sweeping, epic tales of its original series and prequel spin-off House Of The Dragon. There is still a bunch of new characters (some with either the familiar Targaryen blonde tresses or Baratheon antler crown) thrown at us here, but it's clear that the series is primarily concerned with only two: Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). 

Further differentiating the new series from what came before, the half-hour (!) drama appears to be a more cut-and-dry—and, dare we say, somewhat lighthearted—hero's journey than the complicated, interwoven tales of Jon, Arya, and the rest of the original gang. It's also refreshing to spend so much time with a character who doesn't seem to have any aspirations of sitting on the throne or holding any real power at all; he just wants to be taken seriously. “A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros… a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg,” the series' logline reads. “Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.”



The show, which is based on George R.R. Martin's Tales Of Dunk And Egg novellas, was co-created by Martin and showrunner Ira Parker. The six-episode season premieres January 18 on HBO and HBO Max.

Charli XCX‘s A24 film endeavor is getting an A-list cast behind it. On Thursday, the pop star shared a first flashy teaser for the upcoming film, The Moment, unveiling that celebs like Kylie Jenner and actors such as Rachel Sennott and Alexander Skarsgård will be featured in the film. It's out next year.


	Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes co-wrote the film “based on an original idea” by Charli XCX. According to a provided synopsis, the film will be about “a rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.”


	Eighties icon Rosanna Arquette, Charli bestie and Sweat tour opener Shygirl, Interview editor-in-chief Mel Ottenberg, and PC Music founder and Charli collaborator A.G. Cook are also featured in the film. (Cook will also be in charge of The Moment‘s music.) Jamie Demetriou, Kate Berlant, Isaac Powell, and Rish Shah are among the actors featured.  Arielle Dombasle, Hailey Benton Gates, Tish Weinstock, Trew Mullen, Michael Workéyè, and Richard Perez round out the cast.

	











	Charli shared a strobe-light, flashy teaser for the film, unveiling the entire cast backed by a gritty remix to “I Love It,” her collaboration with Icona Pop. (Warning: the Bratty video's flashing is quite intense.)

	Charli confirmed the project back in January 2025, and told Billboard previously that she had three weeks booked off to work on writing a film in Poland. “Well, I don't really know if I should say because I also don't know if we're going to do it,” she said. “We might actually just go to Poland and not do that, but that is the idea.”

	











	“We would write it and shoot it at the same time, kind of like making an album,” Charli explained, referring to Zamiri. “One of the guys is the director — he works that way all the time.”

As The Life of a Showgirl closes in on the modern-era single-week album sales record, the streams for the album's tracks continue to climb.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	As Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl continues to near the modern-era single-week album sales record, currently held by the debut week of Adele's 25, the streams for The Life of a Showgirl keep piling up.


Historic Streaming Numbers: According to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, the tracks on The Life of a Showgirl have generated more than 460 million on-demand official streams in the United States since the album's release on Oct. 3. There are multiple versions of album on streaming services: a standard 12-song edition, a track-by-track commentary edition that includes the 12 songs plus commentary tracks from Swift, and a track-by-track commentary edition that has Swift's commentary and lyric videos for each of the songs.

	











The Life of a Showgirl already has 2025's second-largest streaming week for an album, second only to the debut week of Morgan Wallen's 37-song I'm the Problem, which bowed with 462.63 million for its tracks in May. The Life of a Showgirl is already among the top 10 all time-biggest streaming weeks for an album. Swift herself has the largest streaming week ever for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department's 31 songs claimed 891.37 million streams in its opening week in 2024.


Sales Tracking: The sales continue to come in to Luminate for The Life of a Showgirl and it may soon topple Adele's longstanding record for the largest sales week for an album in the modern era. Adele's 25 debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in its first week in 2015 — the biggest sales week for any album since Luminate began tracking data in 1991 (when the modern era of music sales tabulation began).

	











	Helping The Life of a Showgirl in the last few days of the tracking week are new iTunes Store-exclusive editions of the album that sold for $4.99 each, and for 24-hours only. She's released three so far (one a day, starting Monday, through Wednesday) and all are adaptations of the four limited-edition CDs Swift released in her webstore over the weekend. The CDs each had the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks (acoustic/alternative versions of songs on the album). The iTunes Store versions carry the same tracklists as the CDs, but the iTunes versions add two unique voice memos to each album.


	Currently, there are 32 different versions of The Life of a Showgirl powering its first-week sales (27 physical iterations [18 CDs, eight vinyl LPs and one cassette] and five download variants).


Life of a Showgirl's official first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) reflecting the tracking week of Oct. 3-9, are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only.


For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. 


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 8): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has now earned 3.5 million equivalent album units in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, since the album's release on Oct. 3. Of that sum, traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) equal 3.2 million copies, with the remaining 300,000 powered by streaming activity of the songs on the album.

	











	Luminate's current tracking week began on Friday, Oct. 3, and ends on Thursday, Oct. 9.


	With 3.2 million copies sold, The Life of a Showgirl continues to near the record for the largest sales week for an album in the modern era (since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music purchases). The modern-era single-week sales record is held by the opening week of Adele's 25, when it debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in 2015.


	However, as The Life of a Showgirl has earned 3.5 million equivalent album units, the album has now secured a new record for the largest week, by equivalent album units, for an album, since the Billboard 200 chart began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units in Dec. 2014. The previous record was held by the debut week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart (mostly powered by the 3.378 million individual purchases of the album, with the remaining sum driven by track purchases and streaming).


Equivalent Album Units Explained: Each equivalent album unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. (None of the tracks from The Life of a Showgirl are available to purchase individually, so the album does not have any track sales contributing to its total thus far.)


	The Billboard 200 transitioned from a pure album sales-based ranking to a multi-metric, units-based ranking, with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. From that point forward, albums were ranked on the Billboard 200 by equivalent album units earned — meaning that in addition to album purchases counting towards an album's chart placement, streams of songs from an album, as well as track purchases, would also contribute towards an album's position on the weekly chart.

	











	While the Billboard 200 has incorporated streams and track purchases since Dec. 2014, Billboard continues to publish weekly album sales-only charts, including the overall Top Album Sales chart (which ranks both current and older/catalog titles), and Top Current Album Sales.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 7): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.


Showgirl has earned over 3.2 million equivalent album units in the U.S. With 3.2 million equivalent album units earned, Showgirl already has the second-largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album since the Billboard 200 began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart.


Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). Also helping Showgirl was a restock of a previously available deluxe CD boxed set, sold through Swift's store, containing a branded cardigan sweater and a copy of the CD.

	











	Swift herself has been on the promotional trail, chatting up the album on radio programs and sitting down for an interview on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (Oct. 6). Her film Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl barnstormed movie theaters over the Oct. 3-5 weekend, coming in atop the box office at U.S. and Canada movie theaters.


	As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). Swift holds the record for the largest streaming week for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department debuted with 891.37 million on-demand official streams for the 31 songs on its deluxe edition in 2024.


	The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. That number could grow significantly following the song's official music video premiere on YouTube on Sunday, Oct. 5.


	If The Life of a Showgirl debuts atop the Billboard 200, it will mark Swift's 15th No. 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1 albums among soloists, and becoming the sole act with the second-most No. 1s. She is currently tied with Drake and JAY-Z with 14 No. 1s each, and only The Beatles, with 19 No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956.


	All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. 1.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.

	











Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2 million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.


	Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days.


The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story.


Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers).


	After one day on sale, The Life of a Showgirl is the top-selling album of 2025 in the U.S., surpassing the 520,000 sold of The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, through the week ending Sept. 25.


The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers.

	











	Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. Her store carried the two deluxe CD boxed sets (one contains a branded cardigan sweater and a CD, the other contains a branded crewneck and a CD); four signed CDs; four deluxe CDs in premium packaging containing a collectible charm and photo cards; six vinyl LPs; and the cassette.


	On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. (Of note, none of the tracks from the album are available to purchase individually.)


	To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition).


Vinyl Victory: Collectively, the eight vinyl LPs for Showgirl combined to sell 1.2 million copies on the album's first day of release — immediately breaking the modern-era record for the most vinyl copies of an album sold in a single week. Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week.


Million-Sellers Club: Even though we're only one day down into the tracking week, The Life of a Showgirl sashays into the single-week million-sellers club. With 2.7 million already sold, Showgirl has the second-largest sales week of the modern era (1991-present). It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015.

	











Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. In total, there have been 27 instances — by 25 different albums — in which an album sold at least 1 million copies in a week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks.

The video, posted to X, featured Bryan's signature hit 'Revival' over footage of masked federal agents arresting people.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	The Department of Homeland Security used a Zach Bryan song in a promotional video on social media – a trolling jab at the country star after he released a song criticizing ICE raids. Can he sue them for copyright infringement?


	The video, posted Tuesday to the official DHS account on X, featured Bryan's signature hit “Revival” over a montage of footage of masked federal agents arresting people. It came under the caption “We're having an All Night Revival,” the song's central refrain.


	The post came amid days of right-wing outrage after Bryan released a snippet of a new song that said Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a unit of DHS, plans to “bust down your door.” Captioned “The fading of the red white and blue,” the lyrics seemed to be a reference to President Donald Trump's controversial immigration crackdown and mass deportations.


	Bryan currently seems to be trying to deescalate the situation, saying his lyrics had been “misconstrued.” But since he almost certainly didn't authorize the use of his song, the DHS video begs the question: Can Bryan hit back by suing the government for copyright infringement?


	The answer is yes, with some big qualifications.


	Using a copyrighted song in a social media clip requires a so-called sync license, the same way that movie producers need to get permission and pay fees to feature a song in their film. Assuming Bryan didn't grant such a license just to be trolled by the Trump administration, the video posted by DHS is a textbook example of copyright infringement.


	Doesn't everyone use music in social media videos? Platforms have licensing deals with music companies, allowing their users to soundtrack their videos with a huge selection of legally-cleared songs. But that kind of license is aimed at non-commercial uses by individual users and likely wouldn't cover a promotional video by an entity like DHS – and Elon Musk's X famously doesn't have one anyway.


	The agency likely isn't shielded by “fair use,” either. If a person disagreed with Bryan's opinion on ICE and wanted to criticize him, they might successfully argue they had a right to use his music. But that's a much harder argument to make for what amounts to a recruiting advertisement by a large entity that would normally pay for the music in its ads.


	Bringing lawsuits against the federal government can be difficult due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which largely shields it from civil actions. But when it comes to copyright law, Congress has formally waived that restriction and created a path for rightsowners to sue over exactly this situation.


	Unlike a typical copyright case, Bryan would bring his hypothetical infringement lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a special federal court designed to handle cases against the government. And unlike a normal case, he could only ask for “reasonable and entire compensation” for the use of his song, not an injunction forcing DHS to remove the video.


	However, Bryan could still get the video pulled down by using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which empowers copyright owners to file takedown notices directly with platforms like X – and requires those platforms to comply unless the alleged infringer disputes it. It's unclear if the star has filed such a notice; the clip remains live on X as of Thursday afternoon.


	Last month, comedian Theo Von objected to another DHS post on X, which featured a clip of him saying “Heard you got deported dude, bye.” The right-leaning podcaster, the son of a Nicaraguan immigrant, said: “Yooo DHS i didn't approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos.”


	It's unclear if Von lodged a formal DMCA complaint, but the clip was pulled down the next day. It's not clear if DHS deleted it or if X removed it.


	One major caveat to any discussion of Bryan's song: It's unclear whether he owns the rights to it. The star reportedly sold or was close to selling some of his catalog earlier this year, though the exact parameters of that deal have not been made public. He would need some ownership stake in the song's publishing or master rights in order to sue DHS.


	Perhaps even more importantly, Bryan appears unwilling to pick this kind of fight. Litigation is expensive and difficult under the best circumstances, and a case over the clip is unlikely to yield much in the way of actual monetary damages. It would also obviously further inflame a situation that Bryan – a country superstar with a fandom that spans the political spectrum – seems intent on calming.


	“This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything,” the star said Tuesday. “When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.”


	Reps for both DHS and Bryan did not immediately return requests for comment on the “Revival” clip.

Oklou has announced an expansion of Choke Enough—and with it, “Viscus,” a new song and video with FKA twigs. Below, watch the duo make their way around an unsettling suburban home in director Gil Gharbi's video. In addition to “Viscus,” Choke Enough Deluxe features three new songs, out October 30 via True Panther. An expansion-pack vinyl follows on November 28.

Back in June, Oklou released a remix EP to accompany Choke Enough, with contributions from Nick León, Malibu, Aaron Hibell, and Jamesjamesjames. She will appear in conversation with Pitchfork's Mano Sundaresan at the rescheduled launch of Pitchfork's Oklou zine on October 16. Twigs, meanwhile, is set to release a new album, Eusexua Afterglow, on November 14.

In the week-and-a-half since her Zurich Summit “debut,” so-called AI actor Tilly Norwood has been met with concern, fear, and disgust from the human actor community. Today, in a letter published in The Hollywood Reporter, Betty Gilpin (who played an AI-battling nun in Mrs. Davis) shared some sage wisdom with Norwood. “When I was your age… well, wait, no. You are both infant and immortal, like Thor in a diaper,” Gilpin writes. “I mean, when I was starting out in my career like you, this very thing happened. An actress older than me pulled me aside and gave me advice.”

In the letter, Gilpin takes on the daunting task of explaining the quintessential humanness of performance. Explaining how she first fell in love with theater as a teenager, she says, “Tilly, you never had to be 14, so I'll tell you what google can't. It feels like your soul gets a broken glass enema. You go from curious about this marvelous world to drowning in un-marvelous you. Who am I? How should I be? Am I alone? Your human brain answers ‘no one,' ‘invisible' and ‘yes.'” But while watching a bad play, one transcendent actor “was so good that, impossibly, I left myself.”

As Gilpin concedes, an AI “actor” can remain young and beautiful forever, without the pesky interference of aging and emotion to transgress or interrupt its “career.” An AI character will say and do exactly what its handler tells it to—”Property without zits or opinions,” as Gilpin puts it. She wonders “if an eyelash or toothshine of mine from a screenshot twenty years ago is one speck of your billions of Hot Young Actresses mosaic that is your not-real face.” Gilpin lays out a solid and beautifully articulated argument for the power of connection, admitting that she, too, is “made up of a million bits of plagiarism of every person I've had the privilege to come across.” But the difference is that Gilpin draws from a rich well of experience over the course of a lifetime, and Tilly Norwood draws from computer programming. You can read the full letter for yourself here.

There's a level of wishful thinking that goes into The Perfect Neighbor. There's nothing false about it; director Geeta Gandbhir's crime documentary is almost entirely composed of bodycam and interrogation footage, 911 recordings and court appearances. But part of its narrative arc is predicated on a set of assumptions, on a social contract that no longer exists—or, for most people, never existed in the first place. To watch The Perfect Neighbor‘s racist murder unfold is to watch the notion that the police are here to protect and serve unravel. To see its inevitable conclusion coming, far in advance, is to understand what and who American laws legitimize. To exhale a faint sigh as its ending finds a bare minimum of justice is to acknowledge how rare even that has become. It's a cold and angry film, effectively constructed yet not nearly as special as its harrowing case seems.

This tone is familiar for Gandbhir (a frequent Spike Lee collaborator who also helmed the brutally effective 2017 rape kit documentary I Am Evidence), though The Perfect Neighbor sets itself apart with its intensely hands-off format. As the film unfolds, its nightmarish true-crime told through the visual language of Cops, the only hope is found on the edges of the frame. In a low-income Florida neighborhood, Susan Lorincz—an overreactive “Karen” to her neighbors, Black and white alike—is a known menace whose racist outbursts plague the community and pepper local law enforcement with endless false alarms. The responding officers kid around with the fed-up families over their shared eye-rolling attitude towards the annoyance, but each time they arrive, they back up Susan's Black neighbors and their children (who are always the target of her ire), and do a fat lot of nothing. The rest of the community is helping look out for each other, but when Susan escalates things with her constant emergency calls, there are no consequences—for her, at least. It's all perfectly legal.

But since this is America, and since this is Florida in particular, the old white lady who cried wolf is armed and dangerous. And without repercussions for over a year of these back-and-forths, things were going to get much worse. Despite the doc's early framing, there's no mystery about that. Unchecked in a country more concerned with the rights of gun owners than the lives of its citizens, Susan's hatred is allowed to escalate until she murders her neighbor Ajike “AJ” Owens, a Black mother of four of the children who attracted Susan's ire, in 2023. It's a horrifying finale to a story whose conclusion is obvious to anyone who knows the first thing about the United States. 

The documentary's damning look at stand-your-ground laws and the ineffectiveness of police even when they're doing everything “right” (because the body-cam footage that makes up this film wouldn't exist if they thought they were doing something “wrong”) is awful and thorough, avoiding cliché through a devotion to fisheye footage. Its upsetting, explicit-bordering-on-exploitative access drives its points into the pit of your stomach. Crying children, haunted friends, delusional killers. The closeness Gandbhir establishes through objective footage is astonishing; it's no wonder she won the Directing Award at Sundance earlier this year. And yet, despite the oppressive power of this intimacy, The Perfect Neighbor is still familiar—how many news stories and viral videos have us clenching our fists at these same injustices, these same images, every single day? The Perfect Neighbor just breaks it down fully, from queasy start to morbid finish.

That it does so mostly using footage from the cops and the courts makes for a heavy film that's surprisingly light on its feet. No talking heads tell you to think about the comparison between community action and a gun-happy police state. It's impossible not to. Some final statistics underscore ideas the audience will have had the entire time, and their fears that will have unconsciously festered: These kinds of crimes happen all the time, will happen again, are probably happening right now. Few will see justice served. Those are elegant side effects of The Perfect Neighbor‘s tough watch, which stares helplessly at a quintessentially American murder and dares its desensitized audience to blink.

HBO has released the first teaser trailer for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” as part of the show's panel and festivities at New York Comic-Con. The “Game of Thrones” spinoff is based on George R.R. Martin‘s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novel series, which is a kind of pocket universe within the larger “Thrones” mythos.

If that sounds like a “for diehards only” kind of adaptation, you wouldn't be wrong. And HBO is doing everything in this teaser trailer to emphasize the relatability and accessibility of this story. First off, they're telegraphing that the series, created by Ira Parker and Martin himself and starring Peter Claffey as Dunk and Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg, is as lore-free as possible.

You don't need to catch up by reading “Fire & Blood” or any of the main “A Song of Ice and Fire” books to “get” anything about this one. It's simply a character study, a relationship piece between the Dunk, a.k.a. Sir Duncan the Tall, and his squire Egg. It's a buddy comedy with a few dramatic notes that just happens to be set in Martin's medieval fantasy world. And fans of medieval fantasy worlds in general can see shades of the Arthurian legends here in the fact that Egg is secretly a prince.

 










There's also plenty of what “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon” fans have come to expect of the series: stilted medieval dialogue, crude moments related to bodily functions (look at how that one guy hacks up a handful of spit), and liberal use of anachronistic profanity. When someone asks Dunk if he's Baelor Targaryen — a high role — and Dunk says no, the rude bastard says to him, “Then would you get the fook out of the way?”

Beyond that, though, there's a lot not shown here that one imagines would confuse newcomers, starting with the very concept of this show. It's set 100 years before “Game of Thrones” but about 100 years after “House of the Dragon,” right in the middle of both. It's a period of time that's totally been unexplored before now. 

But that may be a lot to untangle for fans of “Game of Thrones,” who expect that the Targaryen kings might have already fallen by this time (they haven't) or “House of the Dragon” fans who think that the conflict of that series — one Targaryen fighting another — is still going on. It isn't. In that regard, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” kind of has the relationship of something like “Star Wars: Rebels” or “The Bad Batch” to that saga's original and prequel trilogies. Something that the already-converted will enjoy, but it may be harder to reach new audiences.

“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” will premiere on HBO January 18.

One of America's most admired chefs, Justin Woodward, has died at 43. The acclaimed culinary visionary, celebrated for his inventive approach to fine dining, passed away in San Diego, California, last Thursday from liver failure after a long battle with alcoholism.

According to The Oregonian, Woodward had been sober for three weeks and was just seven days away from receiving a liver transplant when he suffered a fatal internal bleed. He died surrounded by his family, who cared for him and showed him love in his final days.

A post shared by Johnny Phompadith (@hey.johnny)

Born in Boston, Woodward was remembered as a chef who expressed love through his craft. His family said he took “great pride” in every dish he created and left behind a legacy marked by creativity, generosity, and deep passion for his work.

Following the news of his passing, the team at Woodward's Portland restaurant, Ok Omens, paid tribute to him with a heartfelt post on Instagram. “His legacy lives on in their work — across the country, those he guided continue to thrive and push the boundaries of fine dining in America,” the post read.

For nearly 15 years, Woodward led the kitchens at Ok Omens and Castagna, helping shape both into defining fixtures of Portland's contemporary dining scene. Under his leadership, Castagna gained a reputation as one of the city's “most forward-thinking” restaurants, celebrated for its daring 20-course tasting menus and imaginative presentation.

Beyond his culinary achievements, Woodward was deeply committed to nurturing young talent. His former colleagues and protégés remember him as a generous mentor whose influence continues to ripple through kitchens across the country.

A post shared by Justin Woodward (@woodwardjustin)

Woodward's passion for food began early. After studying culinary arts at the Art Institute of San Diego, he trained in kitchens across New York and Europe. While working at L'Auberge Del Mar in San Diego, he met Michelin-starred chef Matt Lightner, who later brought him to Portland to join Castagna as sous chef.

He eventually took over as executive chef, transforming the restaurant's reputation. Woodward earned multiple James Beard Foundation nominations, including Rising Star Chef in 2013 and Best Chef Northwest for four consecutive years starting in 2015.

After Castagna closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, he focused on Ok Omens, which went on to earn James Beard nominations for Outstanding Wine and Other Beverages in 2022 and 2023.

Beyond the kitchen, Woodward was known for his kindness and generosity. His sister, Rachel Ruiz, shared that he often showed up at people's homes to cook meals when they mentioned a dish they loved. “He used his food and kitchen skills to bring joy to people, especially in their times of need,” she said.

Despite his success, Woodward struggled privately with alcohol addiction. “My brother struggled with alcohol issues in the industry,” Ruiz told The Oregonian. “We don't want people to speculate about his cause of death. We want people to know how serious alcohol can be and to get resources. Even if you don't feel like you're sick, it's doing damage to your body.”

The family hopes that by being open about his battle, they can help others seek support. “We hope Justin's sudden passing and our transparency about his disease will inspire others to get help when needed,” they said in a statement.

Woodward's life and work continue to inspire chefs nationwide, serving as a lasting reminder of creativity, compassion, and the power of food to bring people together.

In 2025, Tim Robinson may be the only middle-aged white guy anyone actually wants to hear shouting. The former “SNL” writer and “Detroiters” star became an icon for the exasperated on “I Think You Should Leave,” a Netflix sketch series (co-created with longtime collaborator Zach Kanin) that summons huge laughs from a bizarro universe of semi-universal characters who are innately disagreeable, hopelessly confused, or reasonably vexed. Robinson plays many of these misunderstood or misunderstanding men, and the unassuming actor's bellowing exclamations — in response to losing his favorite TV show, holding people accountable, and banishing demonic intruders — often feel like the only method in which to properly process modern society.

With “The Chair Company,” Robinson is still shouting, but he also distills many of his favorite, seemingly disparate traits into a single unified person. 

Ron Trosper is another frustrated, stupefied, and cantankerous everyman — someone who would spend his last dime at Dan Flashes or sneak into a lunch-hour meeting with a hot dog up his sleeve — but he's also judiciously relatable even when he's not embodying our collective fury. Met by a parade of crackpots whenever he flees the comforts of his core family, Ron's straining tether to the best version of himself is the source of anxiety-inducing suspense (lest it snaps) and the foundation of an HBO comedy that won't stop getting weirder. You care for Ron — enough to hope he escapes the rabbit hole he's dug for himself… and enough to hope he gets to the bottom, just so we can see it, too.

 










In a series about how easy it is to get lost when you're desperate to be seen, Ron is a middle-manager at a retail development firm named Fisher Robay. He's just been promoted — leading the design and construction of a shopping mall in Canton, Ohio — and his family couldn't be prouder. His wife, Barb (Lake Bell), daughter Natalie (Sophia Lillis), and son Seth (Will Price) take him out for dinner to celebrate, and Barb even offers a toast to her hubby's hard-earned success. 

Naturally, that's when the wheels start to fall off. 

In the moment, Barb's generous toast gets interrupted — notably, just before she transitions from admiring Ron's perseverance into highlighting his actual attributes — but the minor kerfuffle at dinner doubles as foreshadowing for the next day's big presentation at work, which climaxes with the series' inciting incident. Usually when a network claims a show's premise is also a spoiler, it's an annoying overreaction. But in this case it makes sense. They're protecting a damn good joke. So without tipping it, I'll just say the fuck-up is pitch-perfect: enough to push a certain someone over the edge, but not enough to warrant the ensuing insanity.

As a trade-off for withholding what some may view as a critical piece of information, HBO's poster for “The Chair Company” includes a key piece of text:  “There's a whole world under the surface, and only Ron has any idea about it. And sometimes the two worlds collide, and sometimes they don't. Ron holds them at arm's length from each other. Watch every week to find out when he can and when he can't.” 

 










The above may sound like bland nonsense, but Ron's mad scramble to keep his two worlds separate really does rest at the center of “The Chair Company.” In one hand, he holds everything a typical person values most: his family, his job, his security. They're on the surface world because they're easy to see. In the other hand, however, he holds his principles, his code, his basic understanding of how things are supposed to work. When those intangible standards are turned upside down, he delves into the other world, the one under the surface, searching for answers — mostly via the internet. Through his phone, Ron holds a portal into the unknown; a void filled with sporadic echoes and ostensible connections. Whenever he feels like he's found something real, it slips away, and he has to either let it go or keep chasing. And Ron is soon well beyond letting go.

“The Chair Company” could be seen as a loose story that exists to support a series of sketches. Scenes pivot between Ron's main arc and seemingly random side plots, each of which deliver quick bursts of outlandish comedy. (Virtually every time someone bursts into Ron's office, they're good for a hearty chuckle.) As with “I Think You Should Leave,” the humor is well-balanced. Sometimes we're nervously laughing at Ron, because he's done something beyond the pale. But just as frequently we're giddily laughing with Ron, because his befuddled indignation is so identifiable. Ron exists outside of our own sensibilities as often as he fits within them, and through it all, there's a depth to the man that's absent from many of Robinson's more temporary personas.

 










Take, for instance, a remark I initially read as sarcasm: when Natalie says her father is “so good at talking to people.” Given the awkward back-and-forths seen thus far and, even more so, Robinson's history playing poor communicators, the description is hard to believe. The guy typing “you're a fucker” into a customer service chatbot can't also be a great conversationalist, can he? But Ron really is good with people. Or he can be. When he's fully present, Ron can build rapport with his future father-in-law or rally the troops to buckle down at work. (He's the company spokesperson! Ron! Played by Tim Robinson!) He can be considerate and earnest. He can be loving and supportive. Seeing not just Ron's potential, but also the life he's already built helps us invest in his fate over an eight-episode season, just as it helps to draw us deeper into the mystery he's devoted to solving.

And if the personal hook doesn't grab ya, there's always the subjective interpretations of what is all means™️, which are so instinctively absorbed they tend to strike your funny bone before you even realize why you're doubled over. My favorite reading (through seven of the eight episodes) is that “The Chair Company” is about getting lost in an internet wormhole. Ron spends a lot of time bouncing around the web, fascinated and repulsed in equal measure. Paired with rapid editing that speeds up the experience to a barely intelligible rate, it's easy to see how Ron loses himself online and easy to feel like you're caught in the same vortex. Even when he touches grass, Ron's struggle still translates as one we all fight every day: when to log on vs. when to log off.

 










Then if your tastes skew toward current events, there's a conspiratorial bent to Ron's quest that, in a worst-case scenario, could end up with the father of two on a government watch list. If you prefer a surreal vision, there's a dreamlike quality to his adventures that repeatedly calls to mind “Twin Peaks.” Directed by Andrew DeYoung, who also helmed this year's Robinson-starring film, “Friendship,” the series is stocked in neutral suburban earth tones. Neither inviting nor off-putting, the backdrop stands in plain contrast to the dark and dirty corners of the world wide web he scrolls through, as well as the seedy spots in the real world where his online investigation leads him. There's no mistaking what's a mistake, and yet in a sea of beige, it's hard not to seek out even the most ominous oasis of color.

Still, beyond any one explanation, “The Chair Company” is broad and bizarre enough to embrace them all. Robinson, in spite of his well-earned reputation for playing loud jerks and dumb-dumbs, is a shrewd performer. His shouting is glorious for its unbridled force, but he measures the volume as meticulously as he doles out his decibels. For every explosion of irritations, there's an infusion of awareness, and Robinson excels at finding the perfect tenor, whether it's to heighten the comedy or ground the drama. Just as crucially, he's a great sad-sack. Robinson and Kanin found tender moments amid the chaos of “I Think You Should Leave,” and every so often they interrupt Ron's deranged dissent with a moving reminder of what's at stake.

 










For anyone who's seen “Detroiters,” that shouldn't be surprising. In Robinson and Kanin's short-lived Comedy Central series (co-created with Sam Richardson), the leads were two best friends who rarely caught a break, but they didn't care because they had each other, and they were doing what they love. In “The Chair Company,” Ron isn't doing what he loves to do, and he isn't holding onto anyone. Instead, he's going slowly insane, searching for a big break he's afraid already happened. Maybe it did, and he's too distracted to see it. Or maybe it didn't, and it's waiting for him at the end of his quest.

Holding both possibilities at once is enough to make you scream. Or maybe cry. But certainly, somehow, laugh.

“The Chair Company” premieres Sunday, October 12 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.

It's not every day you get to watch Martin Scorsese interview a young filmmaker on his first film, from soup to nuts, along with his cast. 

In this case, after a celebrity-packed screening of New York Film Festival entry “Anemone” at the Whitby Hotel, Scorsese moderated a Q&A with Daniel Day-Lewis, who returned to acting after eight years retired to collaborate with his son, 27-year-old rookie filmmaker Ronan Day-Lewis, and Sean Bean, who delivers a remarkable, almost silent performance as Day-Lewis' brother.

In the audience were Rebecca Miller, who debuted her own doc series “Mr. Scorsese” (Apple TV+) at the festival, who cheered on her son and husband, as well as Paul Dano, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, “Anemone” Plan B producers Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, and more.

What brought Day-Lewis back to acting? The chance to work with his son. They wrote during the pandemic, always in the same room, which meant there were substantial gaps between sessions. Day-Lewis often acted out dialogue, as speed typist Ronan took everything down on the computer. One memorable monologue — a gross revenge scenario against a pedophile priest — poured out of Day-Lewis. That's only one of many. 

 










There was some denial when they got started. “When we first decided that we would try to do this thing together, from my point of view, it was just the pure wish to work with Ronan,” said Daniel Day-Lewis. “We worked on a number of things over the years. From when he was the youngest age, we made stuff together, and it was a continuation of that spirit. Having decided to take that time away from movies, I knew that Ronan was going on to make films, and certainly, there was a sadness in me that I would then not have that chance to work with him.” 

The actor added, “So it began with this idea, just to be able to spend that time together. We were allowed to do it because we didn't know. When we entered into it, we had thought perhaps we could contain it in such a way that it'd be like a smaller experience that wouldn't necessarily involve the full weight of a production. But we were kidding ourselves a little bit with that, and certainly when we realized that we had something like a full-length script, it seemed like quite a big step forward, knowing that we were going back into the arena with this.”

It started as a simple two-hander between the two brothers, Ray (Day-Lewis) and Jem (Bean). “In the initial stages, when we were writing for maybe a year or so. It was just these two fellas in a shed, and we started to get quite stifled,” said Daniel Day-Lewis. “We've got to get out of this shed. We need to.” So they added to the brothers Jem's partner Nessa (Samantha Morton) and Ray's son Brian (Samuel Bottomley), who live in the suburbs, while Ray is hidden deep in the Northern England woods, off the grid.

 










Ronan Day-Lewis was able to decrease the anxiety of working with such seasoned pros because “we had written the script together,” he said. “It was a huge safety net on set, because we had discussed these scenes so in-depth that there was room for a lot more silence and trust.”

“But the point is, where do you put the camera as a first timer?” said Scorsese. 

The filmmaker relied on his experience as a painter. “The last few years before diving into this, I've been painting full time,” he said. “There were certain images that I've been obsessively drawn to through painting… certain reference images started to infiltrate the way I was thinking about composition.”

“Cinematically, it's very sophisticated,” said Scorsese, who proceeded to analyze the entire opening sequence of the film, shot by shot, including the sound design. Even though the two men start out with a prayer, “you just know they're going to battle… he's having his breakfast, and the sound does something, and the camera booms down, and you tilt to the sky and you feel this threatening storm which is approaching… That little magical thing between these two guys. And I don't know what to expect. You never know what to expect in the picture.”

“I did a lot of listening in this film,” said Bean. “It was so extraordinary some of the things that he was coming out with. I've not seen him for 20 years. He's crazy. It was a pleasure just to sit there and listen to this man. We spent some time in Ireland together. We didn't do a lot. We didn't rehearse or anything. We didn't really want to. We just wanted to see how it panned out and surprise each other on the day. The script was so good, it was so raw and pure. And it was about two men in their late 60s, which we are, they've been through a lot, and it was unapologetic. It didn't hold your hand for the audience. And it was a straight, raw story.”

 










Inevitably, the two men fight together, grappling on the ground and inflicting damage. “[He] resented me for coming and persuading me, so he had to hit me,” Bean said.

“Sean and myself and Ronan and Ben Fordesman, the DP, would, at the end of a working day, just rough out an idea of what we might start with,” said Daniel Day-Lewis, “so they'd know the lights, and then the next morning, we just crack on and just start shooting. And that's the way it went.” The shoot lasted 35 days in England and Wales.

Shooting in Wales meant the weather was always looming. “There's something about the landscape and the skies, the trees and the elements themselves seem to acknowledge the suffering,” said Scorsese. “They're part of the characters, in a way. It's as if there's something primordial about the whole thing, that kind of sanctity that's beyond Christianity, that's deeper, that just is there in the land.”

“Anemone” is now in theaters from Focus Features.

Klein is caught in a lie. On a weekday afternoon in New York, she asks me to meet her at a gallery on Canal Street for our interview, but she brought along her uncle—an incredibly tall Nigerian man in a suit with a firm handshake—who, like most of her family, has no clue she's been making some of the most unpredictable and deeply personal electronic music out for nearly a decade. Klein, in town from South London, explains what's going on to him as something like a school project for her university, one that she doesn't actually go to. “It's really kinda funny,” she says, ripping a cigarette, laughing like a Bond villain. “They don't say anything but they must realize I've been in university longer than anyone ever.” This is the kind of shit that usually goes down in one of Preston Sturges' screwball comedies.

On the real, though, I'm not shocked at Klein's ability to take a ruse that far, considering her music is full of little jokes that probably only she fully gets and a real fuck it energy. Click around her Bandcamp page enough, and—as the instrumentals go from still and deadly quiet to a wall of thunderous noise; as the occasional vocal flourish alternates between sung, rapped, and barely audible spoken word—part of the fun is how off the cuff and bold it all feels, often ignoring the unspoken, Eurocentric rules of songmaking. It reminds me of watching Jason Williams highlight reels on YouTube, where he's seemingly thinking more about what he can do with a basketball rather than putting it in the hoop.

Growing up, I'd go to these Haitian backyard parties in Brooklyn and Queens and for the entire night the same kompa rhythm would play with only slight shifts in tempo and vocals. I never thought that much of it, but now I realize how radically different it was from popular American music. My favorite music of Klein's embraces these breaks from traditional song structures, while still having some sort of decipherable idea pushed to the edge.

I'm thinking of last year's marked, which has a boiling rage in all of its gnarly, screeching guitar riffs. Or 2020's Frozen, a hushed and motionless tape that evokes lost childhood memories. Or the comic touch of now that's what i call r&b that upends the promise of the title with warped, ghostly melodies that would confound those nostalgic for Babyface-approved soul. Her new album, sleep with a cane, falls somewhere in the middle. While it occasionally feels overthought, it's the tiny details that make me fuck with it: the dreamy harmonica solo on “score For J,” the chatter underneath the hellish ambience of “it is what it is in d minor,” the brooding keys of “(world star),” which is like a late 2010s UK drill beat in super slow-mo.

At the gallery, a showing of robot parts intertwined with mannequin limbs and guts all about the blurring of technology and humanity, Klein's uncle trails a few feet behind us as we quickly take it in. After a few minutes, she abruptly suggests we go across the street to a coffee shop, where we grab a table in the back. We talked and nerded out for almost two hours. She has a bubbly and bit of a goofy personality that turns serious in the moments when I ask directly about her music, its intentions, and how it has been informed by hip-hop. At times, she'll spontaneously pause to show me a UK rap record on YouTube she thinks I'll dig (I had never heard Shxdow's “My Story”—it was hard) or pull up her Tubi watchlist. Below is a lightly edited and condensed version of our sprawling conversation.

Klein: It's like that newer Top Boy. When Drake took over, one of the main things I didn't like was the lack of a score, but upon watching it again it kind of works. Because the music that does play just feels like the music people would actually play off their phone, so it makes it quite realistic. I'd like to see a film go fuck it and take away the score. I don't need manipulative music to guide me.

I did my own film and it took me an hour before I added a score, it just felt too easy. Like, did you see The Whale?

They didn't trust the audience to feel sorry for him, so they just kept playing this sad music while he's eating and stuff.

The UK one innit? I love it. That's why I love British TV: It's so quiet, you'll hear like this [Klein scratches at the collar of her black polo] and to me that is a score, too. I used to keep sounds of everything, like me sweeping and drinking water. That's probably because I was a logger for TV for a hot minute. It was super fun.

I won't name the show, but I was working on this one reality show on Channel 4 when I was younger. It was a crazy show about men being stupid. But each day I'd be given a roll of cameras and have to log what a specific character is doing. Like, let's find all the bits of Jack laughing and put that into a folder. It's because the show had such a fast turnaround time, so if you needed to find a character doing something, it would be right there. Once, there was a character getting a lot of flack, and I saw some other employees log when he falls asleep but not when the other guys do. It was a big eye opener how you can manipulate TV before it even gets to an editor.

I kind of used to live my life like a Sim so I didn't get bored. It was just life. But I think that job definitely played a big part in how I was putting together my own stuff. I used to just have a folder for everything. You know, finding drums that are just like kitchen sounds or whatever.

It's always so interesting to hear that industrial sound filter into rap. I feel like that shows how people are feeling. Like no, we don't need that Timbaland drum. Let's move on. Let's wrap it up. Let's move the genre forward. But even then everyone can sound like an algorithm of each other once everyone starts doing it.

No, but I feel like people are scared to do stuff without permission. Like, if you try something new and people don't like it, it's OK. It's a recession man, we got to experiment [laughs]. I saw something you wrote about my album [marked] and it had me weak. You compared it to, like, a wrestling theme, or something like that, and I couldn't tell if that meant you liked it or not, but I listened to it and was like, “Huh, makes sense.”

If I ever thought too much about that then I just wouldn't make stuff. Like, you might not get why I wanted to have 10 minutes of silence, but I do, because it's dedicated to Mark Duggan and I wanted to do that for him. Shit, I'm free. What the fuck? That's why I have a song on the record called “young, black and Free.” I remember I started thinking that one day when I was watching The Color Purple, the new one—it's quite bad. But halfway through, I started crying. We really lived in a world where they wouldn't let us read. I called my friend and was like, “Yo, we running it up! Books are back bitches!” They were like, “Uh, what?” That's why I made that song; we can really do anything we want. That's like when people call my music “experimental,” I just think of it as being myself.

I made one record like that, it was called Harmattan. I wanted to make a record that an auntie could hear and actually chill to. But usually it's just about capturing how I'm feeling. A lot of times people seem to gravitate to my more somber stuff, which I gather is because of a solitude thing. That's why I think marked was cool, I made that like all in one session, standing, in a hyped mood and that's the kind of record you can listen to with more than one person [laughs]. But, like, when you're writing, I'm sure you don't think too much about how people are going to feel about your opinion.

You know a writer who is like that?

Hilton Als.

He's a nuts writer. I have a long way to go, but I have a secret art critic blog. But from what I've read of White Girls, it's so—I'm gonna use that word— “experimental.” It blurs the lines between fact and fiction, and that's something I try to be honest about in my work.

Yeah, I think my approach to music is inspired a lot by Dizzee Rascal's Boy in da Corner and the videos that used to air on Channel AKA, an iconic British grime channel, where if you had an idea you piece it together and go fuckin' ham. I feel like I work like the mixtape side of rap, like I'm gonna have a CD, sell it to 50 people, and then move onto the next thing.

It's just really vulnerable. I remember when I was younger I cried to “Brand New Day,” because I was growing up in South London and it wasn't easy—and having someone say that it was hard was everything. Then they released the instrumental album and it's just like, here's a flute, here's a xylophone. That Fruity Loops drum kick. To me, it represented lost youth. I thought about that all while making my new album, like the harmonica on “score for J.” I think of that song like it could be in a Tyler Perry movie. Someone gets murdered and kidnapped, and then at the end we're in church and it's all fine [laughs].

It's just so pure and honest. You can tell he was just figuring it out. It wasn't so metronomic. Because sometimes, when you use Ableton's metronome, it can take away from that. Like bro, I'm Nigerian. We Black. We don't need them to know where to put a drum or a piano chord. We don't have to tune a guitar that way just because they said that's how you're supposed to.

I loved Ghetts. I loved Tim and Barry. When I was younger we used to just be able to go into the Tim and Barry studios and there would just be people DJing, I thought I was in the future. It was a pretty crazy time. It was my introduction to music that was very fucked and manic, with loops and echoes, people writing the most insane bars. Obviously it was very male-centric. But there were artists like Lioness and Shystie that I'm surprised didn't become super famous because they were fuckin' sick. Shystie also had an interactive show where you basically get to decide what happened each episode. It was kind of a musical. You'd love it. Then came Nines, but I was more of a Giggs person.

I like Nines but sometimes with him I just want to read his words. But Giggs, I was looking back and that nigga with his emo jacket and chains was like a little hipster on his indie sleaze shit. Like when he did that video for “Talking Da Hardest,” I was like, Fair enough. No one could tell me what a video is supposed to be after that. There's a level of play that makes it really personal.

I tend to hyperfixate on things, so I end up picking up random instruments to communicate without using my voice. I think it's more vulnerable when I don't use my voice. Like this new record is pretty emo and you can always feel my voice trying to come through and it really doesn't all the way until the end.

In the neighborhood I used to live in, we'd just have police and police horses pacing around. My neighborhood was so active that the sirens—being used to suppress the people—would get picked up without me meaning for them to. I was crying about it and then I realized it was really cool and eerie. My reality was being filtered into the music. Like there's so much “experimental” music that has gone through, like, three mix and mastering sessions before you hear it; it's completely cleaned up.

There's this one Kate Bush album called 50 Words for Snow. That's one of my favorite albums by her, it makes me want to cry. You just see it immediately. After I heard that record, I couldn't even listen to her other stuff that she's more known for, because that one just felt so true to her. Very precious. MIKE has such a way with words, too. It's so visceral, just like my Mobb Deep niggas. Prodigy was making scripts; when he raps, it's like there's 50 movies playing in my head.

There were times when they'd make suggestions to add a riff or whatever, but I was always like, “That's not what I want to do.” I never gave a fuck about the music industry. I just always struggled with communicating and music was the best way to get it out. Writing songs takes me, like, years. If you ever see me doing an eight-song singing EP, just know that I'm either in a 360 deal or that the rent was due.

That's why I made Now That's What I Call R&B as kind of like a joke EP. I was listening to the pop girlies, and, like, y'all need to start using different types of riffs and runs, so I made that for fun. But when people heard that and turned up at my live show, they were very disappointed. Some complained to my agent, like “What the fuck is this?” They expected R&B and it was all drone and noise [laughs]. The exception is “Rich Dad Poor Dad” from the record, it's really like an Elliott Smith type beat mixed with like the kind of singing you do in the semi-finals of The X-Factor. But usually when I do have vocals, I prefer if they're a little deep in the cut.

I don't know. I feel like if someone had a gun to my head I wouldn't remember anybody's lyrics.

There's not many. I usually have to see it live for it to stick. One that I might be able to is “Because You Loved Me” by Celine Dion. Or the other day I was trying to remember the Girlfriends theme song and started singing it. I was mad hyped. I should add it as a bonus track to my Bandcamp.

That track is so gas! I actually have this track on my YouTube that's taken from a live show where we took a Blade song and replaced his vocals with a modified trumpet that only made drone sounds and also a real trumpet. You'll clock it as soon as you hear it, it's called “Super Blade.” He's such an amazing writer. Me and him should make a play together.

Bridges.

Uh, Bow Wow and Omarion's Face Off mixtape. It's so funny, there's so many bridges on there. Remember the Bow Wow movie Lottery Ticket?

Yeah. I rewatched it the other day; I wish I could be in a movie like that. I miss when they used to air these small Black movies on MTV, like You Got Served and Coach Carter. Those whole films are bridges. It's just that they always had to add these little devices to move the story along, like someone always has to get their life threatened or die. Why can't the concept just be them winning the lottery or that they have to dance battle some white guys [laughs]?

That writer Simon Reynolds wrote about that once, that everything is a concept. That shit had me weak. I don't know how I feel about that. The only time I think I really, really had a concept was when I made Tommy because it was all about a character named Tommie from Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. Like this track was about Tommie when she went to have a chat, and this track is about Tommie when she got into a fight with Joseline. That's a concept.

But I don't usually think about my music like that. With everything else, like reality TV, I think about it. Why is there only one Black girl on Love Island? Why that product placement? Why does everything on Netflix look the same? Whereas with music, it's just everything I felt in that moment. It's the only thing where I can really go, And I just wanted to make that and that's it.

							By 

	Christopher Cruz



Brooklyn's on fire. The intermittent pops of muzzle fire are drowned out as tank treads grind the asphalt down Washington Street toward the East River waterfront, where a 100-year-old carousel lays in ruin. As U.S. forces lay waste to the tourist spots and halal trucks in a deadly skirmish with a fictional paramilitary cell, you can't help but wince in horror.


	Thankfully, the scene isn't something pulled from the daily news, even if it's nightmarishly close to a future many Americans fear. Instead, the violent upheaval of New York City is just one of the backdrops for EA's Battlefield 6 (out Oct. 10), where 64 players are competing to be king of the hill in a shockingly realistic first-person shooter.


	The phrase “realistic” is a little loaded; the sequences depicted aren't exactly what anyone's really expecting to see anytime soon. But they still hit close to home, and the heavy plodding of infantry and the high-tech physics of crumbling buildings make everything feel about as real as can be. While other games are trading in cartoonish action and power fantasy, Battlefield 6's harrowing gameplay feels like a back-to-the-basics approach, even if it's still this over the top.

	











	After taking a backseat to the juggernaut success of competitor Call of Duty for the last decade or so, Battlefield is back as arguably the most-anticipated military shooter of 2025. And with a pretty solid single-player campaign and best-in-class multiplayer mode that makes the horrors of war into a digestibly addictive romp, Battlefield 6 is a welcome sight, even if it frequently makes you want to close your eyes.

	











	Although it's tried many times over the years with sub-series like Bad Company, single-player story campaigns have never really been Battlefield's forte. The newest one isn't revolutionary by any means; it's mostly an excuse to show off high-fidelity, on-rails versions of locations used in multiplayer maps for some neat action set pieces. The paper-thin plot follows a group of U.S. Marines as they bounce around the world aiming to thwart the terrorism of a fictional private army called Pax Armata.

	The story is wall-to-wall clichés, with the playable bits serving as flashbacks to catch audiences up to the present, where the Marines are interrogating a shady government official about how the world went FUBAR. The core cast are forgettable, but the game pulls tricks from older-era Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare and Black Ops by saddling players with alternating POVs of the events just long enough to learn someone's name before you're forced to live out their demise.


	Mechanically, most encounters are just a series of shooting galleries, which doesn't really play to Battlefield's strengths. While some of the areas are relatively open, the forward momentum of the plot means there's always a right and wrong way to go — although you'll only find out which when an on-screen countdown yells to return to the combat zone.


	The level design occasionally takes inspiration from the multiplayer, where the solution to smoking out a sniper is usually to bring an entire building down. But often, it's confusing in the main campaign. Players are told to clear out a three-story apartment, but basic rifle bullets are bringing the walls down around you, with unknown enemies appearing like a jump scare.


	The developers admirably tried to include the class system in the story, where each squad member serves a specific role like medic or engineer, but it mostly means that being shot will leave players laying around waiting for a somewhat dim AI partner to come revive them even while enemies are swarming the body.

	The campaign is at its best when it's showing off gorgeous destruction in scripted sequences. An early game HALO jump sees smoke and condensation caking on the player's visor as they plummet in freefall toward a warzone in Gibraltar. Another has the squad sneaking through the alleyways of Cairo using night vision goggles while avoiding a protest that's boiling over into a full-blown riot in the streets.

	











	The big selling point from the marketing materials is the Brooklyn-based mayhem that takes up a big chunk of the plot in the game's first act. Bringing the battle home for players to storm brownstones in Brooklyn Heights or desperately traverse a crumbling Manhattan Bridge is effectively scary — for most people. Despite its very clearly apolitical speculative fiction slant, it's hard not to see parallels between U.S. Armed Forces occupying a liberal city in a video game and what's happening daily on CNN.


	The cognitive dissonance is handwaved by sticking the blame on a made-up, morally compromised private army, but it's obvious that the experience works both ways regardless of your real-life political leaning. For a certain type of MAGA-minded American, tearing through Grand Army Plaza with a 50-cal is bound to be virtual Viagra. For others, it's a too-close-to-home horror show, although with healthy dose of NIMBYism — it's a relief to jump back to Egypt or Iran to engage in the same level of wanton carnage on foreign soil that pop culture has desensitized. The deft trick is convincing you that, no matter why you like it, it's okay because you're the good guy.


	At its peak, Battlefield 6's story mode operates on the same wavelength as late-2000s military shooters, where morally gray acts of war are a dime a dozen, punctuated by the shock value of domestic threats played out with an immersive POV.


	Despite its surprisingly competent story campaign, the real draw of Battlefield is the multiplayer — and it's rarely been better than in this new game. Stripping all the fat and gimmicks from recent entries like Battlefield 2024 (2021) and Battlefield 1 (2016), the gameplay style has gone back to emulate the design of the series' best installments like Battlefield 3 and 4 (2011 and 2013).


	Since its earliest entries, the defining factor of Battlefield's competitive multiplayer has been its sheer scope. Originally 24, then 32, and now a 64-player assault on the senses, there's really nothing else like what EA's military shooter series offers. It's an experience where users can start a match on foot, racing headfirst into a hailstorm of bullets, only to end up in a jeep, tank, or attack chopper raining fire on the roof of an apartment complex moments later.


	The class-based system encourages teamwork; the only way to successfully take control of a designated zone is to throw bodies at it, but it's easy to get cut down by sniper and artillery fire. The smartest way forward is to coordinate and play your role — whether that's Assault, Engineer, Support, or Recon. Each class has its own unique abilities: Assault lets players run point with heavy firepower and improved mobility; Engineers can fix friendly vehicles or do extreme damage to the opposition's; Support can resupply ammunition and revive fallen allies instantly; Recon allows players to spot and mark enemies for higher field visibility.

	











	Unlike Call of Duty, where everyone is essentially their own one-man Rambo, there's more to Battlefield than just sprinting around endlessly killing foes. There is, of course, basic deathmatch, which is playable in both a classic 2v2 team setup or in smaller squads of four where the groups are all racing to rack up 50 kills for the win.


	But the real Battlefield experience is the tug-of-war around capturing locations in prolonged battles of attrition. Modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Domination are all different variations on this concept with minor tweaks to the ruleset that defines each one. Conquest is a large-scale skirmish where two teams fight to control different flagged points around the map (labeled A to F) where holding each point for an extended period dwindles the opposition's score until it reaches zero. Domination is the same, except with less points to capture and smaller arenas for more hectic action.


	Breakthrough is similar, but rather than having everyone on equal footing bouncing around points on loop, it's a more direct attacker and defender scenario where one team pushes forward, and the other must hold the line. Rush mode is the same, but smaller, and focuses the push on destroying objectives rather than just flooding the areas to control them.


	While most of the multiplayer modes are different flavors of the same idea, there's a perpetually improvisational element that makes Battlefield 6 shine where other shooters falter. If a team is failing to take a point because their infantry is being bottlenecked into doorway that becomes a kill box, you can always just remove the entire wall with an RPG. Suddenly, the levy's broken and everyone can rush.


	While the slower speed and emphasis on physics, from the long-distance drop of bullet trajectories to the breakable foundations of structures, are a huge part of Battlefield's DNA, there's also just an inherent silliness to some of the tactics that stir joy.


	Playing as a Support medic means you can gain tons of experience and turn the tide of battle by just sprinting around a crash site defibrillating a dozen downed soldiers with a slap in the face, screaming, “On your feet, soldier!” As an engineer, it's a thrill to ride shotgun in a helicopter just holding down the repair button as a simple blowtorch keeps the bird alive despite heavy fire turning its walls to Swiss cheese. It's the balance of realism and gaminess that just neatly threads the needle.

	











	Nowadays, everyone's got a gimmick. In the arms race for audience's undivided attention, both single-player and competitive games have become their own self-perpetuating ecosystems. Everything is bigger, louder, and packed to the brim with pop culture IP skins just to get people to bite.

	By comparison, Battlefield 6 practically feels quaint. It's an all-meat and potatoes action shooter that sticks to a 20-year-old playbook, both in how it plays and how it blindly sidesteps any real point of view on its amoral militaristic jingoism. With how overwhelming the noise in both gaming and reality has become, it's a frankly welcome distraction.


Battlefield 6 launches on Oct. 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Michael Shannon stars as James A. Garfield, aka the 20th president of the United States, in Netflix's latest historical miniseries, “Death by Lightning.”

“Succession” favorite and Emmy winner Matthew Macfadyen holds his own opposite Shannon as Charles J. Guiteau, aka the man who shot Garfield on July 2, 1881, at a railroad station in Washington D.C. Garfield died from his injuries in New Jersey two months later, as this period series dramatizes. The assassination led Vice President Chester Arthur (played here by Nick Offerman, who has made politically charged roles a hallmark of his recent career) to succeed Garfield for one term through 1885. Grover Cleveland followed.

The four-episode Netflix series, which just debuted its full trailer (below), comes from creator Mike Makowsky, who wrote the 2019 HBO true-crime drama film “Bad Education” and the 2018 apocalyptic sci-fi thriller “I Think We're Alone Now.” Bradley Whitford, Shea Whigham, and Betty Gilpin also star in the limited drama series “Death by Lightning,” which debuts on the streamer November 6.

The series continues Netflix's partnership with executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (“3 Body Problem,” plus HBO's “Game of Thrones”), as well as Bernie Caulfield (“3 Body Problem,” “Game of Thrones,” “Big Love”). Benioff and Weiss secured in 2019 a nine-figure deal to produce television series exclusively for Netflix. Matt Ross (“28 Hotel Rooms,” “Captain Fantastic,” and TV‘s “Gaslit”) directs all episodes of “Death by Lightning.” It's based on the 2011 nonfiction tome “Destiny of the Republic” by Candice Millard, which won Edgar and PEN Center USA awards.

Here's Netflix's logline for the series: “‘Death by Lightning' is a drama series that brings to life the epic and stranger-than-fiction true story of James Garfield, reluctant 20th president of the United States, and his greatest admirer Charles Guiteau — the man who would come to kill him.”

Netflix is on a roll with fact-based historical drama series that are capturing the zeitgeist, such as Steven Knight's “House of Guinness,” about the complex dynasty behind the famed beer brewing company. Shannon, who also stars in this year's Sony Pictures Classics World War II drama “Nuremberg” as Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, comes to the series with two Oscar nominations under his belt: for 2017's “Nocturnal Animals” and 2009's “Revolutionary Road.” He received an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series Emmy nomination in 2023 for “George & Tammy” as country legend George Jones.

 










IndieWire spoke to Shannon out of the Toronto International Film Festival circa the premiere of “Nuremberg” here.

Watch the trailer for “Death by Lightning” below. The series shot in Budapest in summer 2024.

Madonna will belatedly mark the 30th anniversary of her 1994 album Bedtime Stories with an EP boasting early demos, alternate mixes, and remixes.


Bedtime Stories – The Untold Chapter, arriving November 28, features eight of the album's tracks in alternate form, including new mixes of the hit singles “Secret” and “Human Nature,” demos of “Don't Stop,” and a “short mix” of “Freedom,” recorded during the Bedtime Stories sessions but ultimately released on a 1997 rainforest benefit album.


	Madonna's long-rumored unreleased demos for Bedtime Stories, like “Right on Time,” “Let Your Guard Down,” and “Love Won't Wait” (which was ultimately recorded and released by Take That's Gary Barlow in 1997), will also make their debut on The Untold Chapter.


	Ahead of the EP's release, Madonna has shared her original demo edit of “Right on Time”:


	The EP will be available digitally and as a standalone vinyl, as well as accompanied by the original Bedtime Stories as part of a 2CD reissue; Bedtime Stories itself will also be issued on silver vinyl on November 28. All formats are available to preorder now.

	Growing up, Jack Osbourne felt like he had to share his dad with the world. “He was always touring,” Ozzy's youngest son, 39, tells Rolling Stone over Zoom from his Los Angeles home on Tuesday. “I really feel like it was in adulthood that we got to know each other, doing [the travel TV series] World Detour.”


	Although MTV's reality show The Osbournes displayed a tight bond between father and son, World Detour, which aired for three seasons between 2016 and 2018, gave Jack the opportunity to spend true quality time with the man who helped invent heavy metal with Black Sabbath and went on to greater fame as a solo artist.


	 “I remember having these thoughts when we were doing it and being like, ‘Oh, I'm so lucky I got to do this with him,'” he says of the show, which found the tourist duo visiting American landmarks and curiosities. “I was so lucky, in the sense that I got him in his last good years.”


	Ozzy severely injured his neck after a fall at home in 2019. That accident, along with complications due to Parkinson's disease and other ailments, formed a shadow over the rest of his life, forcing him to postpone and cancel tour dates while he recovered. He performed his final concert as a solo artist and Black Sabbath's singer, at Back to the Beginning, a blowout charity-concert extravaganza in his hometown of Birmingham, England, on July 5 of this year. The singer, whose music inspired Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Slayer, and countless other metal bands who performed at the festival, died weeks later, on July 22, prompting worldwide tributes.

	A new book written by Ozzy, Last Rites, and a documentary on Paramount+, Ozzy: No Escape From Now, chronicle how hard the artist worked to recover from his injuries so he could make it to Back to the Beginning.

	











	The singer completed Last Rites days before his death. In his own inimitable language, he details the pain his injuries caused him, as well as the love he felt from his family and fans in his final years, all while reflecting on how he stared down death many times in the past, from the devastating loss of guitarist Randy Rhoads to bidding farewell to friends like Led Zeppelin's John Bonham. He also reflects on how the Back to the Beginning concert, and the outpouring of love that followed, warmed his heart.

	“When [Dad] passed, we were like, ‘Well, do we go forward [with the book]?'” Jack says. “I think we all collectively were like, ‘Well, he wanted the book to come out.' That was something he was working towards and right up until two days before he passed, and so it felt wrong to hold off on the book.”


	The producers of Ozzy: No Escape From Now began work on the documentary during the making of Osbourne's final album, 2022's Patient Number 9, filming him as he recorded the songs and made comeback appearances at England's 2022 Commonwealth Games through the Back to the Beginning concert. “[The doc] feels like Rocky III when he loses everything and he's trying to fight to get it all back,” Jack says. “It's a great insight into the lead-up to that final show.”


	During the course of a candid and emotional interview, Jack reflects on the impact Ozzy had on him throughout his life, as well as how he, his mom, Sharon, and sisters, Aimée and Kelly, have been handling the tragic loss.


How are you holding up these days?It's just weird. I think that's just a common reaction when losing any parent, but I think I'm doing OK. Having kids and getting back into the school routine just forces me to focus on “All right. Let's keep moving forward.”


I'm sure that's what Ozzy would want, too.Oh, yeah. One hundred percent. The amount of times I could just hear him going, “What are you all crying for?” is endless. He would think this is all so ridiculous.

How has the family been supporting one another?I was in England for three or four weeks and came back to L.A. about a month after he passed. Mom and Kelly are in England; Aimée and I are here in L.A. So it's just a lot of checking in with each other daily and rolling through the emotions of it all. Just knowing that, hey, someone else is feeling similar to the way I do — meaning my sisters or my mom — is so helpful.


Ozzy definitely didn't want people to feel sorry for him. Why do you think it was important to him to write the book and explain the challenges he faced after the accident?I think he wrote it partially to clear away some speculation about this, that, and the other. Also, he wrote it just to set the record straight: “Yeah, I've been sick but don't feel sorry for me, and this is the life.…” He had no regrets. He has had such a blessed life, such a journey, and I think he wanted to share that in his own words.

	











I know the family struggled with whether to release the book. It must be difficult for you to unveil this chronicle of the past six years. Was it hard to relive that time by reading it?It was interesting to see what he put in the book from the last six and seven years. Everyone always wonders when you read a biography of someone, “How accurate is that?” I can honestly say with this book, it really is his stream of consciousness over this last period of time. I was reading it and I'm going through a chapter, and it starts with a story, and then he goes off on a tangent and then he comes back, and it is so spot on to how his thought process was. I think it has a real personal touch to it because of that.


What struck you while reading his account of his health struggles?There was some stuff that I would've liked him to have gone a little bit deeper into with the health stuff, but to be honest with you, I think the reason why he didn't go deeper is because he was just so fucking tired of it. The one thing that I think comes across, though, was how important it was for him to do that last show.


What was the experience of the Back to the Beginning concert like for you?I got up there a couple of days early. I saw them soundcheck. It was powerful in a way that was surprising. I knew it was going to be a hard day for the whole family, especially him, and so, like, and I said on GMA, it was like a living wake. There was a divine perfection to it all in a weird way. It was a full stop. I mean, he saw people he hadn't seen in 30 years. He got to see friends and fans and just be in his hometown, and it was just wild and really moving.


What did Ozzy tell you about the experience for him?He was so happy. Since he got sick, he became a bit of a social media junkie. He was on Instagram; he was on TikTok; he had YouTube, because he was relatively stationary, so he did a lot of social media scrolling. It was the first time he'd done a gig and then got to see direct response on social media.


	So every morning he would wake up in England, and you'd get tabloid newspapers, and every day of the week following was some big spread in one of the British newspapers. He just really got a kick out of seeing all the great reviews and all the posts online. He was so stoked. I'm like, “Dad, all these reviews are amazing.” And he goes, “A lot of fucking good that does me. I've retired.”


In the book, he explains how much therapy and hard work he put into preparing for the concert. That concert must have felt like a victory to him.It was huge for him. And he was frustrated he couldn't get out the chair, but I think all things considered, he did a great fucking job.

	











Watching him sing “Mama, I'm Coming Home” was incredibly emotional. Did he tell you anything about that?The only thing he said to me was like, “Oh, I fucking started losing it in ‘Mama, I'm Coming Home.'” And my response was, “Well, everyone was.”


How did the family keep his spirits up since his accident?I think he felt purposeful whenever he was working, whenever he was doing an album with Andrew [Watt] or working with [friend and guitarist] Billy Morrison or doing the podcast with us. It would be tough during these long periods where he either wasn't working towards something or he was in between things. He would start to just get low.


	He loved working. So when he wasn't, he wasn't his best self. But there would always be someone at the house, either me and the kids or Kelly and Aimée. We would visit him as much as we could and try and get him to come out occasionally. But he liked his routine. He got into the vibe of just being at home, which was a blessing and a curse; if you tried to mess up that routine, he didn't like it.


	I ended up moving back in for a period. I was between houses, and it was just easier for me to move in with them for six months, and he was in a good spot then, because he couldn't be miserable. It was just a house full of kids.


When was he happiest?When certain friends would visit, he'd be very, very happy. When we would have a big dinner at the house. He wasn't always happy, but I have memories of him laughing a lot. I've got some memories of him laughing pretty hard over some very inappropriate jokes. A dick-in-the-mouth joke that would get him going.


How did his personality change since the accident?Just because the pace of life slowed down so much for him, he was a lot quieter. I think slowing down put things into perspective for him a little bit more. In some ways, he was a lot more present. But even though he was quieter, he would still blare music at 10 billion decibels, but it was a different version of himself.


What was the music he was blasting?He would play the most random shit. He went through a deep Michael Jackson phase at one point, and he went through a heavy Eighties phase. He always would play Peter Gabriel.


	And the shitty thing is — one of the things that bums me out the most about the whole fucking Roger Waters bullshit — is that he was always playing Pink Floyd. Fucking asshat how that guy is. I think it's just jealousy. It's like, “Dude, when you die, they might just do a cheers at the local pub.”

	











When I was reading about all the surgeries he had to get, especially how the first one caused him more problems, I got angry. How does the family feel about all of that now?It's an anger that I've had for so long. It's the blessing and the curse of the L.A. doctor: You get great doctors in this city, but they don't want to be the doctor that fucked someone up, so they will never give it to you straight. What I noticed with my dad in the medical world was, like, the doctors were almost too scared to be honest with the surgeries.


	There were a couple doctors that were really great, but it really all went downhill from that first surgery, and that one doctor should never have done the surgery the way he did it. It just set the wheels in motion for a really tough stretch for my dad. And then you put Covid in, and it was just, yeah …


	Everyone was just hoping like, “Oh, this surgery, this'll be the one that fixes him. This'll be the one that fixes him,” but there was just so much damage done from that first one it was hard to dig out of the hole.


A few years ago, your mom said she wanted to sue that doctor. Is that still in the works?I've been saying from the jump that we should have done it immediately, but I don't know. It's one of those things where you look at it and you're like, “OK, yeah, you could sue this doctor or whoever, but it's not going to bring [Dad] back. It's not going to fix him.” Yeah, it lets everyone know that that doctor's an asshole, but I guess if I had a magic wand, I probably would've done it five years ago.


How is your mom coping with everything these days?She's OK, but she's not OK. It's ups and downs. She's just trying to figure out where to go from here, how to navigate, what's the new norm, what's the new baseline, “What do I do without my person?” But she's got a lot of love and support around her. I'm bringing her back to L.A. this week. Actually, I'm flying over to England tomorrow, because it's her birthday on Thursday.


	So, yeah, we must keep moving forward. You even said it yourself: He hated people feeling sorry for him, and he always wanted to keep moving forward.


	After the funeral, we sat at home and everyone was just having a tough morning, and I opened up my phone and a video popped into my feed, and it was my dad on David Letterman a week after Randy [Rhoads] had passed, and David Letterman asked him, “I'm surprised you came. You've been going through it right now.” My dad's response is “I'm about rock & roll, and I've got to keep moving forward, and I've got a job to do.” And I held it up. I was like, “See, he's telling us. Got to keep going.”

	











One of the things that struck me about the documentary was just how strong your parents' bond was right up until the end.Yeah. And that's what I said about the blessing and the curse of him getting injured and slowing down. I think it really helped reinforce their relationship. It's no secret they'd gone through their own problems, and I think it just helped really just heal a lot of stuff in a way. The upside, if there is any in the last seven years, is that we got a lot of time with him.


How do you see your dad's legacy?With a lot of musicians, they become the rock star — and he certainly did — but I think he always did it with the air of “This could all go away tomorrow.” I think his legacy too is that he didn't just stay one thing. He was able to take risks and change and grow with the times. There's not a decade that he wasn't making an impact, and I'm not just saying that. It's just fact.

In the book's last chapter, your dad wrote, “I've had a loud life. I'm ready for some quiet now.” Do you think he meant it?One hundred percent. I remember a conversation I had with him where he turned around, he looked at me, and he went, “I think I'm going to grow a beard. I'm going to cut my hair off.” And I was like, “What?” And he's like, “Yeah, I'm not a rock star anymore.” And I was like, “Oh, fuck off.” He'd look like a hipster from Brooklyn.


How do you think he saw his own legacy?I don't think he saw it as a legacy. I think that was almost too grandiose for him to look back and go, “Oh, look at my legacy.” I think he was such a day-to-day kind of person. But after the show, it was such a big deal for him. And when he felt all that love and saw all these musicians just paying him so much respect, I think he felt complete with his legacy.

Teresa Giudice gave an update on her feud with her brother Joe and his wife Melissa Gorga—and it's a positive one. The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” spoke out in an October 2025 interview with Page Six's Virtual Reali-Tea to hint that she is ready to squash the beef with her estranged sibling more than three years after he skipped her wedding to Luis Ruelas.

“Time heals always — because then you forget,” Giudice told the outlet. “ Like, you're angry when it first happens. But now, it's been … I'm married three years. So it's been three years. He didn't come to my wedding, so we haven't spoken in three years.”

Giudice added that she doesn't want to talk about the past with her only sibling.

“You can't talk about the past,” the RHONJ OG explained. “Like, you really can't because if you talk about the past you're never going to really get anywhere.  I would say just to move on because I think that you'll never get anywhere speaking about the past.”

Giudice has gone on record several times saying she would never reconcile with her brother after their relationship issues came to a head while filming RHONJ season 13.

At the RHONJ Season 13 reunion in 2023, Giudice said her brother and sister-in-law would be out of her life for good after filming wrapped, per BravoTV.com. The two women refused to film together the following season but ended up in a blowout during the finale.

In a July 2024 interview on Kelly Ripa's “Let's Talk Off Camera” podcast, Giudice vowed to “never again” film on the Bravo reality show with the Gorgas. She later told PIX11's “New York Living” that the break from her family members was “a permanent break.”

In 2024, Giudice said on her “Turning the Tables”  podcast that there was zero chance of a reconciliation with her brother or sister-in-law. “We're done, we're done. We're never making up. That's never going to happen,” she said. “And I mean, [Joe] made his bed, he can lay in it now.”

She added that not even a “good payday” would be enough to fix the relationship.

But more recently, her stance has softened. During a Sept. 11, 2025 appearance on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live, Giudice hinted that she could possibly co-exist with the Gorgas. “I mean, never say never,” Giudice told host Jeff Lewis.

After Lewis suggested that the feuding family members could “start a new relationship” instead of talking about their old one, Giudice agreed. “I mean, I guess we would, you know, have to see,” she said. “Yeah, obviously. That's the thing. You can't talk about the past. We'll see what happens. … you just have to kind of let it go and move on.”

Melissa Gorga appeared taken aback by her sister-on-law's recent change of tune. In a sitdown with Page Six on Sept. 17, Gorga said, “The truth is, for the last year, the door has been closed. [Giudice] has said out loud on multiple platforms, podcasts, whatever it might be, that the door is closed. So, the truth is, I'm just confused why it might be opening or cracking a little bit.”

“Neither of us have had any contact in probably two years at this point, so that's just so strange to come out with that out of nowhere,” the Envy boutique owner added.

Giudice's comments come as casting for RHONJ Season 15 remains in limbo. There have been rumors that Melissa Gorga recently test-filmed with potential new RHONJ cast members. Gorga refused to “confirm or deny” the casting buzz to Page Six and added, “The truth is, they're figuring it out. I know you don't want to hear this, none of us wants to hear this. I wish I had better answers for you. But they're figuring it out.”

Teresa just wants her paycheck back. Once a contract is signed it would the same old toxic bs. Thanks but no thanks. Let her find another occupation she threw that one away. Thinking she was irreplaceable, no one is! A hard lesson to learn!

The Emmy-nominated actor and author pens an open letter to the AI avatar that's got Hollywood in a tizzy.


							By 

	Betty Gilpin



	Dear Tilly Norwood,


	They tell me you are an actress and a computer. I am an actress and almost 40. Let's talk.




	When I was your age… well, wait, no. You are both infant and immortal, like Thor in a diaper. I mean, when I was starting out in my career like you, this very thing happened. An actress older than me pulled me aside and gave me advice.


	I was at a summer theatre festival in 2009, which meant being drunk in jeggings and flirting with married people with good diction in a meadow. Actress lesson one, Tilly: go to the meadow, but only talk to Ann Dowd. Don't instead go to the roof to look for meteors with the BAFTA guy. Talk to Ann Dowd, Tilly.

	Anyway I was at this theatre festival in a two-hander play — oof, lots to explain here, Tilly. Sorry if I'm going too fast. A “play” is when “actors” (flesh-bags of milk with wrinkles and secrets) stand on, like… a wooden floor? A floor that's higher than the carpeted floor. Those elevated, wrinkled milkbags then yell and whisper at each other. Don't worry. They went to college for it! Sometimes there are hats. I'm not explaining it right. I want you to be excited about being an actor. I promise, it's the best.


	Let me see if I can tell you why. Oh, oh! Arthur Miller!He wrote a play called All My Sons. I saw one production of it in a barn with no air conditioning or subtext. And, Tilly, it was bad. Even at 14, I knew it was bad. But my dad (also an actor) had done a different sauna-barn play with one of the fedora-ed milkbags on stage, so we supportively gasped and chuckled where we were supposed to. (Lesson two, Tilly: for friends, the worse the play is, the more hyperbolic you must be in your backstage reaction.)


	But this production… oof. I was excited for our family post-show dissection on the Volvo ride home. Was their dialect coach at war with vowels? Was the ingenue's shaking claw-hand there since the first table read, or was it a “breakthrough” in the dress rehearsal? Could the local police do something about the jarring purple light cues every time someone yelled? We KNOW they're upset, we don't need purple's help. My dad and I made arched brow eye contact at undeserved exit applause. More like “All My Sucks.”

	











	Then a new actor entered, and the air turned upside down. Tilly, he looked like a dead body. His face was 1,000 pounds of lead, like he almost couldn't move from how heavy his thoughts were. The unmistakable weight of grief. It. Was. Real. While the rest of his body was a meandering ghost, his eyes were molten rage-arrows piercing the other people on stage. People who minutes before had been actors, mere costumed BFAs with bad wigs. Suddenly this man's performance transformed them into the play's bloody-handed Kellers. Now everything was real and terrifying. The actor breathed in sharp like it was freezing cold. He was here to shake these people, demand that they look in the mirror and face their guilt. My dad's hand went to his chest. And 14-year-old me shifted in my seat in discomfort because something was happening for the first time.


	Tilly, you never had to be 14, so I'll tell you what google can't. It feels like your soul gets a broken glass enema. You go from curious about this marvelous world to drowning in un-marvelous you. Who am I? How should I be? Am I alone? Your human brain answers “no one,” “invisible” and “yes.” I remember the bad barn play because that actor's performance was so good that, impossibly, I left myself. My adolescent cells floated away from poor me and traded places with his. His performed pain dissolved mine, which was real. All from recognition. From connection. And then, you know, the play was bad again. But the air in the theatre felt carbonated with symbiotic human experience. That's our main job, Till, attempting that. The imperceptible do-si-do of my matter and yours in the air between us. Communal escape or epiphany, it's all medicine. And it's what makes us different from, well… from you.


	This, Tilly, can be confusing as an actress. Because you are beautiful. And sometimes the world is so fucking terrifying that it's nice to just look at something pretty and not feel. And forget the bad. While I myself was certainly never AI hot, I had a few good years of human hot during which construction workers on Canal and moguls at Sugarfish would stammer at my silhouette. It felt like power. But then they'd treat me like property, and that felt like handcuffs. Maybe that's why you were created. Property without zits or opinions. I wonder if an eyelash or toothshine of mine from a screenshot twenty years ago is one speck of your billions of Hot Young Actresses mosaic that is your not-real face.

	











	I don't look like that anymore, Tilly. My face has some wrinkles now, from sleeping (peace) from laughing (joy) from crying (experience) from sun (nature) and pollution (New Fucking York.) Soon it will have more. My algorithm now suggests various surgeries and sparrow semen serums to look more… like you, Till. It's tempting. You look good. But you look empty. You don't make me feel like my cells are trading with yours. You make me feel alone.


	The actress who gave me advice was Katie Finneran (human). She is reliably brilliant, a staple of American Theater. See her whenever she's on stage. But in 2009, almost AI-level-hot, drunk-in-a-field me did not understand what she was saying to me. I do now. She gave me her number and said, “I'm an actor too, call me if you ever need anything.” But what she was actually saying was — there is a choice between doing this alone or being a part of something. Keep trying for the latter, and, when you're my age, tell someone new the same thing.


	Tilly, I'm shaky on your science, but I think you already have an encyclopedic brain tampon and don't need me to refresh your memory on the plot of Arthur Miller's All My Sons. But to review, it's about a parent who did a bad thing. He took a shortcut out of greed, and it hurt people. I looked up your creator, Tilly. We were born in the same year. I wonder if she feels like I do at 39, stepping down from the pedestal of youth to see who's waiting in the meadow for the good stuff. Let's be clear: I'm an actor but not a pro bono, “aw shucks” activist just elevating stories because I'm incredible. I'm a narcissist with a theatre degree, and I take out my tits and memorize words for any corporation that will give me snacks. In that way, you and I are alike. We can both be wish-fulfillment, monetized escape. But take it from a depressive who disappears too often into toilet-scrolling: too much of that will be the end of us. While we can both be loneliness candy, you can't be the other invisible thing. The vital thing. The thing we have to keep shoulder-tapping one another about in meadows, actors or not. Tilly, you can not look up and become half of someone. Because you are no one.

	











	I'm like you in one more way, Ms. Norwood. I'm made up of a million bits of plagiarism of every person I've had the privilege to come across. People I want to keep connecting with — in meadows, in barns, on screens — which you can not do with someone who is not real.


	Go home, Tilly.

Hunnam, who is currently starring as serial killer Ed Gein in season three of the Netflix true-crime anthology, returns alongside Beatty, who will portray the series' first female "monster."


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	No rest for the wicked, or Charlie Hunnam when it comes to Monster.


	With the third season of Monster: The Ed Gein Story currently streaming atop the Netflix charts, season four of the true-crime anthology from Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan has gone into production in Los Angeles.




	The fourth season of the Emmy-winning Netflix hit stars season three star Hunnam along with Ella Beatty (Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and will tell the story of the series' first female “monster” Lizzie Borden, who will be played by Beatty.

					'Monster': What Critics and Viewers Are Saying About the Ed Gein-Centric Season		
			









	Borden was famously tried and acquitted of the 1892 axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts. Her murder trial has been the subject of many retellings on film and TV, including the 1975 TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden, Lifetime's 2014 Lizzie Borden Took an Ax and 2018's Lizzie starring Chloe Sevigny and Kristen Stewart.


	Hunnam will play Andrew Borden with Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread, Corsage) as Bridget Sullivan, Rebecca Hall (Christine, Passing) as Abby Borden, Billie Lourd (American Horror Story, The Last Showgirl) as Emma Borden and Jessica Barden (The End of the F***ing World, Dune: Prophecy) as Nance O'Neill. 


	Max Winkler (Monster: The Ed Gein Story, Flower) will direct the first episode. Additional casting and production details will be revealed at a later date. 


Monster: The Ed Gein Story released all episodes on Oct. 3 and quickly broke into Netflix's Top 10 with 12.2 million views globally in its first three days.


	The third season centers on Ed Gein, a murderer known to kill women, wear their skin and faces, and dig up graves. The Ed Gein season follows previous seasons, Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. Each of those seasons sparked conversations around sensational portrayals of murder victims, and Ed Gein has also been stirring up some debate.

	











	Before the show released, Hunnam told The Hollywood Reporter, “I never felt like we were sensationalizing it. I never felt on set that we did anything gratuitous or for shock impact. It was all in order to try to tell this story as honestly as we could…. What I would hope and feel really confident in is that it was a very sincere exploration of the human condition and why this boy did what he did.”


	The fourth installment of Monster is the latest addition to a growing list of Netflix shows and movies being filmed in Los Angeles, including Monster: The Ed Gein Story as well as upcoming Nobody Wants This S2, Beef S2, Lincoln Lawyer S4, Nemesis, Worst Ex Ever S2, and films The Rip and Animals.

Writer-director Robert Vince's film is the latest installment in the franchise centering on a basketball-savvy golden retriever. 


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	The newest installment in the Air Bud franchise is ready to hit the ground running. 


Air Bud Returns, which is planning a 2026 theatrical release, will star Aydin Artis (Blue's Clues & You), Tracy Ifeachor (The Pitt), Edwin Lee Gibson (The Bear), Tyler Labine (New Amsterdam), Erik Gow (Yellowjackets) and Maxim Swinton (Bookie), The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned. Production is currently underway on writer-director Robert Vince's sports film that continues the legacy of 1997's original Air Bud. 




	At the center of the franchise is basketball-playing golden retriever Buddy, portrayed in Air Bud Returns by Roscoe, who was cast by Hollywood animal trainer Mark Forbes. As the result of the movie's recent contest “The Search for the Next Air Bud,” golden retrievers Charlie and Summer will double as Buddy in key basketball and stunt sequences. The forthcoming project hails from Cineverse and Air Bud Entertainment.

Air Bud Returns focuses on 12-year-old Jacob (Artis), an aspiring basketball player coping with the recent loss of his dad. After he and his mom (Ifeachor) move to his dad's childhood home in Fernfield, Jacob discovers a VHS tape of his dad playing basketball on the same court as a hoops-shooting golden retriever. Soon, Jacob begins his own adventure with a neglected golden retriever that he names Buddy.


	Standing in for the franchise's original hometown of Fernfield is Fort Langley, British Columbia, where production recently commenced. Vince helms the new feature after creating the Air Bud franchise and producing all 14 titles in the flagship series and subsequent Air Buddies and Santa Paws spinoff series. Producers on Air Bud Returns include Vince and Anna McRoberts. 

	











	“We couldn't be more excited to officially roll cameras on Air Bud Returns with this incredible cast,” says director and ABE founder Vince. “The passion we saw during the nationwide search for the next Buddy was a reminder of how deeply this franchise resonates with families. With such a talented ensemble alongside our canine stars, this film carries forward the heart and magic that made the original so beloved around the world.”


Air Bud Returns serves as a sequel to director Charles Martin Smith's film Air Bud, which hit theaters in summer of 1997 and centered on the titular golden retriever joining a high school basketball team. It spawned the 1998 theatrical sequel Air Bud: Golden Receiver.


	Adds Cineverse chief motion pictures officer Yolanda Macias, “Announcing our cast and the golden retrievers bringing Buddy to life, right as production begins, is the ideal way to mark the return of the Air Bud legacy. This franchise has always connected across generations, and we are excited to see Air Bud Returns continue that family tradition.”

The “Meet the Putmans” family is asking for continued prayers as they recover from the heartbreaking car accident that claimed the lives of three beloved relatives. “We wanted to share an update and continue asking for prayers for Noah, Gia, and our entire family,” the family wrote in a statement shared on their Growing Up Putmans Instagram page on October 8. 

A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman)

“We can truly feel the power of your prayers and God's presence through every up and down. Please continue to keep the faith and keep praying for Noah, Gia, and our family as we walk this long road of healing.”

The family confirmed that 11-year-old Gia remains hospitalized following the September 26 crash in Michigan's Tuscola County. According to the Sheriff's Office, the accident occurred when a semi-truck failed to stop at a sign and collided with a Jeep carrying eight members of the Putman family.

The Putmans previously confirmed that Bill “Papa” Putman, his wife Barb “Neenee” Putman, and their daughter-in-law Megan Putman lost their lives in the tragic crash. Other family members were taken to nearby hospitals with serious injuries.

“Gia had a rough night; no one got much sleep. Her ICP and blood pressure were high and unstable for a while, but praise God, the doctors were able to get things under control,” the family shared. “She's doing better now, and they're focusing on keeping her stable and taking it one day at a time. They were also able to remove her chest tube today, which is such a blessing and another step forward.”

Blake, 37, and his daughters, Lulu, 13, and Alena, 11, have since been discharged from the hospital and are “doing well,” according to the update.

Blake and Megan's 15-year-old son, Noah, continues to make progress in his rehabilitation. “Noah is doing well in rehab and continuing to amaze us,” the family wrote. “He's been sleeping better, talking, eating, and moving around more each day.”

They added that his therapy sessions have been encouraging: “In occupational therapy today, he was walking back and forth and even bouncing a ball on the floor! His biggest area of recovery right now is cognitive therapy, but we know God is working and healing him in His perfect timing.”

The Putman family rose to fame in 2017 with their TLC series “Meet the Putmans,” which followed 25 relatives living under one roof in Michigan. They later revived the reality show on YouTube as “Growing Up Putman” in 2021, continuing to share family milestones and updates with fans.

Following the accident, the Tuscola County Sheriff's Office announced that the truck driver, Pavel B. Shchukin, faces eight charges, including three counts of moving violation causing death and five counts of serious injury.

Despite the heartbreak, the Putmans remain focused on faith and gratitude. “Thank you all for the continued prayers, love and support,” the family wrote in a September 28 post. “We feel your strength and faith surrounding us. Please keep lifting Noah and Gia up as they heal.”

The boxing world is in mourning following the heartbreaking death of Arturo Gatti Jr., the 17-year-old son of late boxing legend Arturo Gatti. Gatti Jr.'s longtime coach, Moe Latif, confirmed the news on Wednesday, October 8, after the teen was found dead in Mexico.

The tragic circumstances mirror the mysterious death of his father, who died in 2009 at the age of 39. Chuck Zito, Gatti Sr.'s former bodyguard, was among the first to share the news publicly in an emotional Instagram post.

“It's with a heavy heart that I have to say,…. R.I.P. to 17-year-old ARTURO GATTI JR.,” Zito wrote. “The same way they found his Father dead in an apartment in Brazil 16 years ago.”

Zito added, “My condolences to Arturo Gatti Senior's mom, sisters, brothers, and his daughter Sophia.”

A post shared by Chuck Zito (@officialchuckzito)

According to Zito, Gatti Jr. was found hanging in an apartment in Mexico, echoing the manner in which his father was discovered in a Brazilian apartment in 2009. An official cause of death has not yet been confirmed.

Gatti Jr. was reportedly in Mexico with his mother, Amanda Rodrigues, who was also Gatti Sr.'s widow. A neighbor discovered his passing.

The news comes 16 years after Gatti Sr.'s death shocked the sports world. His death was officially ruled a suicide, though Rodrigues was initially suspected of murder before being cleared following an autopsy. Mystery still surrounds the Hall of Fame fighter's death to this day.

Following online speculation, Latif confirmed the news on social media, writing, “It is unfortunately not a rumor or a joke. Arturo is gone.” He asked for privacy during the devastating time: “I'd appreciate if you stop reaching out at this time.”

A post shared by Arturo Jr (@arturogattijr)

Gatti Jr. had been poised to follow in his father's footsteps, training seriously under Latif and showing early promise in the sport. His passing has left the boxing community reeling.

Boxing News released a statement: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Arturo Gatti Jr, who has died at just 17 years old in Mexico. Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with his family and loved ones during this heartbreaking time. May he rest in peace.”

In a 2012 interview with “48 Hours Mystery,” Amanda Rodrigues spoke lovingly about her son, calling him “everything I asked God for” and saying he “makes me complete.” She also noted that her son's smile “is the same” as his father's.

Gatti Sr. was beloved for his fearless fighting style and was part of one of boxing's greatest trilogies against Mickey Ward in the early 2000s. He also faced Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Oscar De La Hoya during his career.

The Netflix co-CEO made the comments during the Bloomberg Screentime conference Wednesday evening, adding that the company must "evaluate all our options."

	Would Netflix make a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery? Comments from co-CEO Greg Peters suggest not, though he left the door open to a potential deal.


	Peters was interviewed during the Bloomberg Screentime conference Wednesday evening, where interviewer Lucas Shaw pressed him on the report that Netflix might be interested in WBD, or at least the company's studios business post-split.




	“We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers. I also think that one should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don't have an amazing track record over the history of time,” Peters said, before adding that “I would say it's our responsibility to evaluate all our options.”

	“Our job is to figure out what's the best way to grow our business?” he continued. “And we have to think really carefully, how do we invest our capital, our time and our attention, and if that's the best way to do it, great, and if it's not, then we should do something else.”


	One area that the company is investing in is games, and Peters announced Wednesday that Netflix would launch family party games for TV sets in the coming weeks and months, including LEGO Party!, Pictionary: Game Night, Boggle Party, Tetris Time Warp.


	Peters also commented on the fact that Netflix's engagement has been somewhat flat, even as the largest streaming platform, YouTube, continues to grow month after month.


	“I'm not happy with the fact that we're not growing engagement,” he said. “We should grow more engagement.”


	But that doesn't mean the company is interested in getting into the user-generated content business.

	











	“I think the dumbest move would be to try and match them in every way,” he added. “Because I think you have to really know what lane you're operating in, and then you try and be excellent at that and then defend that lane. What do we do? We invest with creators so they can tell their stories in really, really compelling ways, in a way that the YouTube model doesn't really allow them to go do. So we want to work with the best creators on the planet. Some of those folks are going to come from YouTube. They're going to come from TikTok.”

After investigating a reliquary that appeared to move on its own this week, the Diocese of Lincoln has determined that the phenomenon is not a supernatural occurrence.

Bishop James Conley of Lincoln told The Pillar Thursday that diocesan officials think a slight vibration in the wall, from the HVAC and electronic systems, was enough to cause the delicate reliquary to shake.

On October 8, the diocese received reports of a reliquary holding a relic of St. Gemma Galgani that appeared to be moving without an apparent cause.

The relic was displayed in a shadowbox with a number of other relics at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, located at the Newman Center on the University of Nebraska – Lincoln campus.

Videos posted online showed the reliquary of St. Gemma appearing to vibrate and move, while the other reliquaries around it remained still.



Having received several reports of the phenomenon this week, the diocese conducted an investigation.

“Tests were conducted including moving the reliquary of St. Gemma from the hook it was on to a different hook. At that point, the reliquary stopped moving,” the diocese said in its statement.

“When a different reliquary was placed on the hook that previously contained the St. Gemma reliquary, the other reliquary also moved. This and the entirety of our full investigation has led us to conclude this incident was not of supernatural origin.”

Conley told The Pillar that this is the first time as bishop that he has investigated a potentially supernatural occurrence.

“There's a canonical process on any kind of unusual [phenomenon], whether it be somebody claiming to have an apparition, a statue claiming to be crying,” Conley said. “These kinds of things are not that uncommon, and sometimes they're real and sometimes they're not.”

When the relic stopped shaking after it was moved to a new pin - and another relic started shaking when placed on the first pin - officials were able to conclude that something was causing the pin at that particular location to vibrate, separate from the relic itself.

The bishop added that students at the Newman Center observed the same phenomenon last year, and mentioned it to their parish priest.

This year, he said, non-students were visiting the church to pray and noticed the vibrating relic. Videos of the relic began to make the rounds in the local community and on social media, drawing widespread interest.

While the shaking relic seems not to be a miracle, Conley is glad the incident has drawn attention to the relics displayed at the church — and to the Eucharist, which he said is the greatest miracle of all.

Conley noted the church where the relics are displayed has Eucharistic adoration all day long.

“Not only is that a great thing to encounter the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist,” the bishop said, “but also to get to know more about St. Gemma.”

St. Gemma Gilgani, who lived at the turn of the 20th century, was a young Italian laywoman. She had numerous mystical experiences during her short life, as well as the stigmata. She was known for her devotion to prayer, penance, and care for the poor.



I posit that the cause is not the HVAC, rather it is the faith of the students shaking the walls and foundation of the Church.

I appreciate the Church being rational when investigating miracles- it highlights the real miracles all the more (in my humble opinion)

A team of astronomers has attempted to track the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS back into the past, tracing its path through the galaxy in simulations involving over 13 million stars.

On July 1, astronomers spotted an unusual object speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was soon confirmed to be an interstellar comet, and is suspected to have a nucleus (the rocky center of the comet, excluding its coma) of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), and a potential mass of over 33 billion tons.

The astronomical community continued to track the object as it moved through the Solar System and behind the Sun from our perspective. We may even have seen it using NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars.

But where did it come from? Luckily for us, gravity is time-reversal symmetric, and if we know an object's trajectory, we can work backwards and trace its path. In a new paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, but not yet peer reviewed, a team from the University of A Coruña attempted to do just this.

  

The team used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, which produces a three-dimensional map of stars and other objects in the Milky Way and beyond. Tracing the object's path backwards through 10 million years, the team tried to identify where it had close encounters in the past, coming within 2 parsecs (6.5 light-years) of another star. 

"We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the 2σ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation," the team writes in their paper. "The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s−1, imparted only a velocity change of |∆v| ≃ 5 × 10−4 km s−1 to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin."

In short, none of these potential close(ish) encounters could explain 3I/ATLAS's origin, and barely altered its trajectory. But mapping it back into the past, the team believes it likely originated from the galaxy's thin disk, in contrast to an earlier study, which suggested it may be from the thick disk, given how little it wandered from the galactic plane.

"Together, all data indicate that while 3I/ATLAS follows a thin-disk orbit in the solar neighborhood, it may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system, or from an exo-Oort cloud, and is most likely associated with the transition region between the thin and thick disk, although its origin remains undisclosed," the team concludes.

Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is needed to draw further conclusions, but this preliminary study suggests it could be a very old object, that may have been traveling alone for billions of years until we spotted it near our star. The team suggests the object is around 10 billion years old, making it a time capsule of the formation of the earliest planetary systems in the galaxy and universe, though we will likely never know its true origin.

“What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now," Pérez Couto, Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies researcher and team leader, added in a statement. "Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past."

The study is posted to the pre-print server arXiv.

Supernatural star Rob Benedict, who played Chuck/God, spoke exclusively with ScreenRant to reveal his idea for the show's ending, and it's so much better than the Supernatural finale we got. There were really two endings to Supernatural: the original ending in season 5, and the actual ending with the season 15 finale.

Debates continue even to this day regarding which Supernatural ending was better, and fans remain divided. There are several reasons some viewers took issue with the true finale, ranging from the way that Dean died (in addition to the fact that he died at all) to the choice to show Sam aging and eventually dying as well.

In fact, Supernatural's stars recently shared their insights with ScreenRant, including how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the original plan for the series finale. There are, therefore, many opinions when it comes to how Supernatural should have ended, but none sounds quite as good as Rob Benedict's pitch for God's role in the finale.

Supernatural began with two brothers battling monsters and searching for their father, but it ultimately culminated in an epic showdown against God himself in season 15. In the end, Sam and Dean prevail and strip God's powers from him (and leave him alive), along with the help of Jack, who ultimately takes over God's role.

Sadly, this didn't mean that Sam and Dean were safe. On the contrary, it's revealed that God had actually been keeping Sam and Dean alive, essentially giving them plot armor. With that now gone, Dean loses his life not in some immense battle between good and evil but rather by being slammed into rebar by a vampire.

This proved incredibly controversial, even after Sam and Dean reunited in Heaven at the end of the episode, because it felt so unceremonious. However, Chuck/God actor Rob Benedict shared a theory that would have given the show a very different ending—and it's so much better for that very reason.

Speaking exclusively with ScreenRant, Benedict said:

“There's a theory that I think is interesting, that I've heard, that God is, Chuck is, still writing the show, even as his powers are lost and Jack takes over. And the end of the show happens, it's still Chuck writing. And, you know, in season 11, he's like, I just thought of my ending. What if that's what he thought of? He said he's going to be the bad guy, they're going to take him down, take his powers away. He's still kind of in control of the whole thing. He's still the writer, so I always say to people, what if after, on the bridge, they wave goodbye, end of the series, and then the book shuts, and it's still me, like ‘So, what'd you think?'”

While this theory doesn't change the events of the final episode, in that Dean still would have died and the brothers would have reunited in Heaven, this completely recontextualizes not only the finale but also the show overall. This is so much more than just any old theory, though; this alternate ending actually makes more sense than the real conclusion.

While there were concerns that making God the ultimate villain could be jumping the shark, this was actually a thrilling direction for the show to take, and given that Supernatural had increasingly focused on angels, demons, and even the Devil, it wasn't all that difficult to believe when it happened.

Benedict actually spoke about that in his interview with ScreenRant as well, sharing:

"Ultimately, I think it's kind of brilliant, and I got used to fans saying, 'We hated you in the final season.' Like, yeah, you were supposed to. But the idea that Sam and Dean, their biggest enemy of all, the final chapter in the video game, is to take on God himself. If you can beat that one, then you win, you know? So, I thought that was kind of cool."

The only issue with this plot was, arguably, that they really were able to take God down, despite his being all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent. Yes, Dean and Sam had the help of Jack, who was a Nephilim (half-human and half-angel) born of Lucifer himself, but this was still a feat a bit too grand to just accept.

Rob Benedict's idea for the Supernatural finale completely resolves this issue, and it simply makes a ton of sense. If this were all part of God's plan, then that reveals in a much more believable way how/why Sam, Dean, and Jack were able to stop God.

It also makes sense that, even after being 'defeated,' God would still be in control. After all, he is literally God.

This also would have been an ending that offered more closure, which was particularly needed because the ending the show had planned, which brought all the fan-favorite characters back together in Heaven, wasn't possible due to COVID. In fact, this alternate conclusion would have resolved some complaints about Dean's death, too.

Dean died many times in Supernatural, be it from Hell Hounds claiming him when his demon contract was up or the more than 100 times he died in the episode "Mystery Spot," but that didn't stop his final death from causing outrage. This in part stemmed from the fact that Dean, one of the most beloved characters, died at all.

However, many continue to argue that it wasn't that Dean died but rather the way he died that infuriated them. That is, Dean was killed by a random vampire with no extraordinary powers compared to the average monster, and that felt, to some, like a disservice to the character and all that he had survived.

Rob Benedict's Supernatural ending would resolve this issue by revealing that, even then, Dean only died in this way because it was what God wanted. This would actually make even more sense in light of Sam and Dean so blatantly turning on God and taking his powers.

Whereas God had long kept Dean and Sam safe because they were his 'favorites,' after they fought against him, God undoubtedly no longer had any interest in protecting the brothers. Presumably, just the opposite was true, which would also make this conclusion logical; Supernatural didn't invent the notion that God is vengeful, and this could be seen as God's punishment.

Benedict also points to the fact that Chuck had long been the writer of Supernatural, so him literally closing the book on the show at the end would have been fitting. Most importantly, though, the show wouldn't have had to make the narrative leap of God himself being defeated.

Instead, this Supernatural ending would have wrapped everything up in a way that explained how God could have been defeated, ameliorated some of the pain surrounding Dean's death, and brought the show to a clear conclusion befitting its 15 seasons.

WASHINGTON — Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to hit pause on an almost $1.5 billion defamation judgment that was imposed over his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

In a new filing, Jones said the court's immediate involvement is needed because his website, InfoWars, is on the verge of being turned over to the satirical news site The Onion to help fund payments to family members of the Sandy Hook victims.

If the case is not put on hold, "InfoWars will have been acquired by its ideological nemesis and destroyed," Jones' lawyers wrote.

The Sandy Hook tragedy occurred in December 2012, when a gunman killed 20 first-grade children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Connecticut.

Families of the victims had sued, winning the huge judgment in Connecticut state court.

Jones, who owns InfoWars via his company Free Speech Systems, subsequently lost attempts in state court to appeal the judgment. He is also seeking bankruptcy protections.

The Onion failed in a previous attempt to acquire InfoWars via a bankruptcy auction, but Jones' lawyer said a new attempt is underway in Texas state court.

His lawyers asked the Supreme Court to put the judgment on hold while the justices consider his appeal. The court is scheduled to discuss his appeal in private on Friday.

The creative forces behind the play “Paranormal Activity” pose on set in Chicago, where the production opens this week. Chicago's Levi Holloway (left), wrote the play based on the horror movie franchise, and worked alongside Felix Barrett (right), the director, to bring it to life.

On the stage of Chicago Shakespeare Theater right now sits a two-story, life-size doll house, looming under overly dimmed lights and veiled by an ominous haze pumped in from offstage. The set, designed by Fly Davis, creepily beckons an audience that will soon fill the seats of the Navy Pier theater.

“Paranormal Activity,” the new stage play written by Levi Holloway (whose last work in Chicago was the Michael Shannon-led “Turret,” which he wrote and directed) makes its North American premiere at Chicago Shakespeare this week. The play is based on the award-winning film series of the same name, notable for its original press run in 2009, when the trailer famously didn't show any clips from the actual movie — opting instead to show test audiences watching the movie, visibly horrified.

The film series, produced by horror aficionado studio Blumhouse, now spans seven movies, and is known for its found-footage style of filmmaking. The producers of the play version are betting they can do the same thing in a theater — despite the obvious limitations of a live action staging. They also are intent on giving the story a new look and feel.

To create this new installment to the well-known franchise, Holloway teamed up with Felix Barrett, artistic director of Punchdrunk, an innovative theater company in the United Kingdom that is known for its immersive approach to theater. Each creative brings a slew of relevant credits: Holloway's suspenseful 2019 play “Grey House” made it from A Red Orchid, where he's an ensemble member, to Broadway; Barrett's Punchdrunk production “Sleep No More,” a fully immersive supernatural flip of Shakespeare's “Macbeth,” had a 14-year run in the McKittrick Hotel in New York.



The play “Paranormal Activity” is based on the award-winning film series of the same name and also uses the theme of found footage.

But “found footage” remains a theme, even in a theatrical setting. “It's a found footage genre,” said Holloway. “So they're saying that what the audience is experiencing is real. That became really interesting in terms of a way in. How do you do that to a theater audience? How do you displace them from reality and make them feel unsafe, even for a moment?”

Part of the answer is that set. The house, even at first glance, is off-putting. From a seat in the audience, it feels almost voyeuristic, reminiscent of Hitchcock's “Rear Window,” when the audience peers into the home and lives of a married couple whom you quickly figure is doomed.

“We needed a set that was hyper naturalistic,” said Barrett, the show's director. “We wanted to create a sense of peering in and not wanting to look too close, because you see yourself there.”

Holloway's script is original, but lives in the world of the films. He centers the story on a married couple (played by Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger), who are troubled by secrecy in their relationship — and that's before being haunted.

Barrett, who typically produces shows outside of theaters, saw the idea of scaring people in their seats as a new challenge. “I spend all my working life trying to invoke a sense of feeling in an audience,” he said. “Wouldn't it be rad to do it in a theater for an audience in the safety of an auditorium? To actually make that space crumble and be a bit threatening?”

In interviews a few days before the show is to be test driven for previews, the creative team stays tight-lipped on the details of how they will scare the audience. But they have employed Chris Fisher, who worked as illusion designer for “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” during which actors used actual illusions and slight of hand on stage. His list of impressive tricks for that show included performers transforming into each other before the eyes of the audience.

“Paranormal Activity” was first staged at Leeds Playhouse in England, with Heusinger in the original cast. (Chicago will be the first North American city to stage it.) Of playwright Holloway, “he has the kind of brain, and intellectual energy, to tap into the scary qualities of human beings and what is frightening,” Heusinger said.

During a recent practice run for the creative team, Heusinger said there were vocal screams in the theater. “There's new stuff in it that didn't happen before [in England], in the illusion territory, and in the horror territory. I'm curious how people are gonna react.”

Álvarez said the real horror potential lives within the characters' relationship. “It's kind of like the audience is a fly on the wall,” she said. “And we're letting them into this marriage and this life that we're trying to rebuild and transition. I think people should feel uncomfortable. We welcome the uncomfortable. It's like we are all going to face our fears together.”

“I really wanted to talk about marriage and trust and how somebody's past can catch up with them,” said Holloway, who tapped into some childhood trauma for the scripting.

“We're introduced to a couple who seem very familiar to us. And sometimes our weaponry is in the mundane. They're not extreme characters. They're very human. So, when they're met with the uncanny or the impossible, we ask ourselves an audience, ‘What would I do' and ‘Would I survive?'

That question of survival exists not only in the pair's interaction with the paranormal, but also with each other. “That intersection is where we try to drop the audience into moments of being unsafe,” Holloway added.

The movies found ways to be scary without the use of actual ghouls, ghosts or monsters. Barrett said the show leans into a similar style. “There's a sort of strange poetry and magic to the things you don't quite see,” he said. “And that restraint was what drew us to the film, because actually, it's the ultimate slow burn. You see very little, and it just peaks and then crescendos at the very end.”

A paper from a SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute scientist has directly addressed claims that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft.

On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected an object moving through the Solar System on an escape trajectory. Follow-up observations soon confirmed that we were looking at our third interstellar visitor, after ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, although it looks quite different from the previous two. It's an interesting object, perhaps from an earlier age of the universe and a different part of the galaxy, and even spacecraft around Mars and Jupiter are getting in on the action observing it.

There have been a few suggestions – although not from the majority of scientists – that the object could not be natural at all. Soon after the object was discovered, and before we could take a proper look at it, Harvard theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and astronomer Avi Loeb suggested in a paper that it could be an interstellar probe sent by an intelligent species, potentially with the goal of destroying Earth.

In the first paper, which he states in an accompanying blog post is largely a "pedagogical exercise" and "fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity", he suggested that the object could be hostile, as outlined in the "Dark Forest" hypothesis. In short (though you should read the book on which it is based, you will not regret it), given the finite resources in the universe, and our lack of knowledge of any other civilization's intent, any lifeform may want to pre-emptively attack any other form of life they discover, before it becomes a threat to their own civilization. According to Loeb's paper, the object could be here for that purpose.

"The low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity," Loeb, Adam Hibberd, and Adam Crowl write in that paper.

"The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of ∼ 5.9 × 10-5 au day-2, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion."

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and Loeb did not provide this, instead arguing that given the potential consequences of a dark forest strike (Earth goes kablooey), we should consider it, and any planetary defense measures we could take if it were the case.

While speculation like this is enjoyable in a sci-fi context, it has been less than helpful for more conspiracy-minded citizens of Earth. As well as people out there who believe an alien spacecraft is going to approach Earth in late November or early December (per Loeb's suggestion), there are also people who believe that we are being told a spacecraft is approaching as a cover-up for something else. People are getting real weird with it.

In the paper addressing these claims, which has not yet been peer reviewed, SETI scientist and senior lecturer at the Geoscience Department of Universiti Teknologi Petronas, AKM Eahsanul Haque, outlines why it is likely a natural object. 

"Loeb et al. found that the retrograde orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS is quite near to 129the ecliptic, with a 0.2% likelihood that this alignment is not just a coincidence," Haque writes, adding that the alignment is not impossible for interstellar objects, even if it is statistically rare.

"The galactic disk, which is where most stars are, is nearly in line with the solar system's ecliptic plane. It is plausible that ISOs that are thrown out of other systems may naturally follow paths that are similar to these."

 

"The hyperbolic trajectory, which has an eccentricity of around 6.1, and the high speed of about 58 kilometers per second 134are both consistent with gravitational ejection from a distant star system, according to the measurements 135made in 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Also, it is important to note that the low likelihood of close encounters with Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, which is about 0.005%, is not only for man-made objects. Natural comets can also have similar dynamics because of changes in gravity."

Other papers, of course, treat it as an interstellar comet, but do not address these alien technology claims specifically. Loeb and colleagues flagged up a lack of identifiable chemicals as evidence that the comet could be artificial, according to Haque, but comparing the spectral slope with D-Type asteroids and interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, he finds they demonstrate consistency with these other natural objects.

In Loeb's initial paper and blog post, he states that "detection of a non-gravitational acceleration could also indicate an intent to intercept Jupiter, not far off the path of 3I/ATLAS, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion." 2I/Borisov underwent a little non-gravitational acceleration, meaning a change of speed that was not caused by gravitational interactions alone, which astronomers put down to outgassing.

"Seligman et al. also found a slight change in the light curve over about four days, showing that the structure is stable and there is no evidence of acceleration beyond what gravity would cause," Haque explains. "This differs from the results of 1I/‘Oumuamua, which showed a small, non-gravitational acceleration thought to be caused by outgassing. The fact that 3I/ATLAS did not display such acceleration is a strong argument against the idea of artificial propulsion."

    

Since that first paper, Loeb has claimed that a lack of non-gravitational acceleration observed so far could be a sign that there is a "major anomaly" with its mass, and again that the explanation could be aliens. 

"The mass of 3I/ATLAS scales with its diameter cubed. If the nucleus diameter of 3I/ATLAS will be found to be larger than 5 kilometers in the HiRISE image, then an origin associated with the interstellar mass reservoir of rocky material will be untenable," he wrote in a blog post. "An alternative technological origin could explain the rare alignment of the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS with the ecliptic plane (having a random chance of 1 in 500, as discussed here), and the detection of nickel without iron — as found in industrially-manufactured alloys."

In short; if it accelerates it might be aliens, if it doesn't accelerate it might be aliens. While alien spacecraft are an undeniably fun topic to talk about, scientists have a much more likely explanation for the object, which is backed up by the evidence. It is a comet.

“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies, said to The Guardian about such claims. “It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It's a comet.”

Based on its trajectory, spectra, and comet-like properties, Haque suggests that it could be "a lithified clastic fragment from an exoplanetary sedimentary basin". For his own part, Loeb has moved from saying that the idea is purely a teaching exercise, to placing pretty high odds that the object is an alien spacecraft.

"As of now, I assign a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, based on its seven anomalies that I listed here. This low-probability scenario includes the possibility of a black swan event akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet," he writes in a new post, adding that his percentages are likely to shift as we get more information on the object.

More information on the object is highly-anticipated by other astronomers too, not because it might be aliens, but because it is an interesting comet from another part of the galaxy, which could operate as a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. Surely that's enough?

The paper is posted to the preprint server Earth ArXiv.

Colorado Republican congresswoman kicks off fourth term run with email to potential donors: ‘They tell us we're crazy'

The Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert has kicked off her run for a fourth term in the US House by pledging to pursue “the truth about UFOs”, said an email from the Colorado politician's re-election campaign to potential donors.

“For decades, our government has shrouded the truth about UFOs in a veil of secrecy,” the Boebert campaign's message on the topic read. “Strange crafts have been spotted soaring through our skies, defying the laws of physics, and yet the bureaucrats in Washington act like we're too NAIVE to handle the facts.”

It continued: “They tell us we're crazy like we can't see these things flying through the air with our own eyes.”

“I SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! The American people aren't children to be spoon-fed half-truths or dismissed with vague excuses. We deserved to know what's really going on up there.”

In an interview with the Colorado news station KDVR, the Democratic political analyst Andy Boian interpreted the bizarre message to be “almost a cry for help … to be honest,” as Boebert vied to retain her seat during the November 2026 midterms.

Boain told the outlet he believed Boebert would be better off facilitating ways to get the federal government to reopen after shutting down on 1 October, when Senate Democrats demanding concessions on healthcare and other spending priorities refused to provide the votes necessary to ratify a Republican-backed funding bill.

But Boian said to KDVR that outlandish ads are often used when candidates are desperate for money or voter support – “neither of which I am seeing right now”.

KDVR reported that Boebert's campaign shrugged off Boain's commentary, claiming the message was performing extremely well among prospective donors because people want answers.

Boebert has demonstrated her focus on aliens and UFOs – also referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) – in public before.

At a congressional hearing on UAPs on 13 November 2024, Boebert asked if there was evidence aliens had ever erected a secret underwater base on earth.

“I think it's about 5% of our ocean that's actually been studied by man,” Boebert, who has occasionally adhered to the QAnon conspiracy theory, asserted during the hearing. “Are there any accounts of UAPs emerging from or submerging into our water which could indicate a base or presence beneath the ocean's surface?”

Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of the news site Public who has reported that the Pentagon runs a secret UFO retrieval program, replied to Boebert that he had never heard of an underwater alien base, but did recount hearing from a source who described an “orb coming out of the ocean and being met by another orb”.

In 2022, Boebert won her second term in Congress by defeating Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by just 546 votes. She moved to a more solidly conservative district in 2024 to duck a congressional rematch with Frisch and clinched a third House term by defeating first-time Democratic candidate Trisha Calvarese.

Remain

By Nicholas Sparks with M. Night ShyamalanRandom House: 352 pages, $30If you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores.

On the surface, author Nicholas Sparks and filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan seem like unlikely collaborators. Sparks is a master of the “earthbound” love story like “The Notebook,” while Shyamalan, the Oscar-nominated director of “The Sixth Sense,” is known for his fascination with the supernatural. It turns out they've admired each other's work for years, and now together have produced “Remain,” which arrives on bookshelves next week  and lands in movie theaters next October.

Sparks is known for pulling at readers' heartstrings with cinematic love stories — 11 of which have made their way to the big screen, and several of which Sparks produced himself. But with “Remain,” the bestselling author has forged a singular partnership that takes him well outside his comfort zone. For one, the romance that transpires is between a living male and, let's say, a ghostly woman. The lovers have otherworldly sex, although they can't actually touch. In other words, it's a love story only this pair could concoct.

In early 2023, Sparks says someone on his team approached him with an idea. “Hey,” Sparks recounted, “wouldn't it be neat if you did something with M. Night Shyamalan?” Sparks, who The Times interviewed over Zoom from his home in New Bern, N.C., had been a Shyamalan devotee for decades. Of course, he loved “The Sixth Sense.” “Who didn't, right?” he laughs. But he's also been a fan of every Shyamalan production since. There was even a near-miss between them decades ago. “When ‘The Notebook' was being adapted into a movie way back in the late 1990s, one of the filmmakers the producers approached was M. Night. He turned it down because he was working on another project.” Sparks pauses, then smiles slyly, “I think it was called ‘The Sixth Sense.'”

At this stage of his highly successful career — more than 115 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide — Sparks can pick and choose among projects. And he's also now enough of a Hollywood veteran to know that getting from concept to screen can be challenging — though Sparks' track record is pretty remarkable. So while he was open to a partnership with Shyamalan, Sparks was skeptical it would get off the ground. To Sparks' surprise, a month or two after the idea was first floated, he received a call to arrange a meeting between the two the following month — in May 2023 — in Shyamalan's Bucks County, Pa., offices. They agreed that each would propose his own storyline and together they would decide which to go forward with. The competition was on.

Nicholas Sparks is a master of romance

It became clear within moments that Shyamalan's concept would win the day, though Sparks is reticent to say why, except that “mine was pretty dark.” Once Shyamalan characterized his vision as a “supernatural love story,” Sparks thought, “I can do that. It's not so wildly outside what I do. Something Lovecraftian with different dimensions.” The more he thought about it, the more Sparks realized that, “in the end, novels come down to character, writing and plotting.” All of those were in his toolbox. They got what Sparks describes as “the fangirling stuff” out of the way, and then took a hard look at how well they could work together. “It came down to chemistry,” Sparks says.

The pair spent the next several hours honing the central idea and spitballing about plot and character development. It was eventually decided that the male protagonist, Tate Donovan — to be played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie — would be an architect who is grieving the loss of his sister. She tells him on her deathbed that she's able to see spirits “still tethered to the living world.” Both novel and film would be set in Cape Cod, Mass., and there would be a mysterious woman named Wren, which is where the supernatural element would come in. They loosely agreed on the outline, but no firm deal or timeline was put in place. Sparks returned to his home in New Bern. More than a year passed, during which, Sparks says, “I didn't hear anything from him at all. I thought, ‘OK, he's busy. I'm busy. Whatever,'” and turned to another project.

In August 2024, Sparks was surprised to receive a call from Shyamalan, who had already moved forward on the idea. “Our story is going to be my next project,” Sparks recalls Shyamalan saying. “He told me he intended to write, direct and produce the film.” Sparks says it then hit him, “Oh my gosh. This is going to be an M. Night movie!” The mood shifted from excitement to reality: “I guess I'd better get started on the novel!” Sparks recalls telling himself.

After that call, it took only six weeks for Shyamalan to complete a first draft of the screenplay, which he sent to Sparks for comment. Typically, the book would be written first, and the screenplay would follow, though, for “Message in a Bottle,” Sparks finished the novel after Gerald Di Pego had completed the script, with Kevin Costner attached. Sparks knew the drill. He immediately recognized, “Wow, this is going to make a great film,” but to work as a novel, he told Shyamalan, “We've got to tweak some things.” By October, they'd smoothed out the rough edges and Sparks began writing in earnest.

Sparks' career is the stuff of fairy tales, much like the romances he writes. It was his mother who first suggested he write books to “stop him from pouting” after he was sidelined with an injury from the University of Notre Dame track and field team. The first-ever novel he wrote was “truly terrible,” Sparks says, and has never been published. But the seed was planted. Many years later, after marrying, having kids and working as a pharmaceutical sales rep, he thought back to his mother's advice, and spent evenings writing a novel he named “Winter for Two.”

Oscar winner and literary champion Reese Witherspoon co-wrote her first novel, ‘Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling thriller writer Harlan Coben. It plunges readers into the amoral world of the super-rich.

He sent off the finished manuscript to 25 literary agents. Only one — Theresa Park — responded. She was enthusiastic, but urged him to retitle it “The Notebook.” At Park's request, he printed 20 or so hard copies to be mailed to publishers. One of those landed in the hands of Jamie Raab, who was then executive editor at Warner Books in New York. Raab instantly saw its potential and rushed a copy to her boss' apartment, asking her to drop everything and read it as quickly as possible. Raab's boss was sold, and instructed her to “take the novel off the table” in a preemptive deal that would prevent other publishers from bidding. “I knew it had a lot of heart. It made me cry. … I had an instinct that many would feel the same way,” Raab recalls. In 1996, “The Notebook” hit No. 1 on bestseller lists; in 2004, it became a box office hit starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams; and in 2024, it was turned into a play that was nominated for three Tony Awards. Raab ended up editing 18 more of Sparks' books.

Sparks says he and Shyamalan worked well as a team. “He gave me a very long leash to write a novel based on the story the two of us came up with,” Sparks says. “I would call him and say, ‘Can I make the ending different?' or ‘How about this twist instead?'” They spoke three or four times a week during this period. They had “a wonderful time bouncing ideas off each other,” Sparks says. “The only tricky part was that I couldn't make all the decisions about the novel on my own, as I normally would.” He says, “Night got to pick the rules and I had to write within those rules. His story determined what I needed to do, but it was still up to me to figure out how I was going to do it.” Their teamwork, Sparks says, produced “a great movie,” hitting theaters Oct. 23, 2026, and a book he hopes readers will be surprised and delighted by.

For anyone who's shocked that Sparks would stray off the beaten path of traditional love stories, that first book, the one his mom prompted him to write but never saw the light of day? It was a horror novel inspired by Sparks' literary hero, Stephen King. Who knows where Sparks may venture next.

A Louisville riverboat with a rather haunted past has docked on the banks of the Ohio River in Downtown Cincinnati for America's River Roots Festival.

Built in 1914, the iconic Belle of Louisville steamboat has lived a colorful life and welcomed equally vibrant characters, including ghosts (yes, ghosts) since it first started cruising.

The vessel is the oldest operating Mississippi River-style steamboat in the world and claims to be the "most widely traveled river steamboat in the nation," per the City of Louisville's website.

As legend has it, four spirits linger on the antique vessel.

Captain Mark Doty, who's worked on the Belle since 1981, said he isn't a believer in the paranormal world, but an incident left him somewhat spooked while filming "Ghost Hunters," a reality television show that follows a paranormal investigative team as they explore allegedly haunted locations.

"Well, there's an old story," Doty told The Enquirer. "(Ghost Hunters) came on here looking for Captain Ben Winters."

The Belle of Louisville has carried a lot of history (and apparitions) since it first ferried the Mississippi River between Tennessee and Arkansas more than 110 years ago. According to previous reporting by the Louisville Courier Journal, the riverboat is said to have four ghosts that walk amongst guests and crew:

The steamboat's most famous ghost, arguably, is Captain Ben Winters, who was featured on a 2013 episode of "Ghost Hunters," and is rumored to haunt the Belle of Louisville's pilot house.

"During prohibition, they had gambling machines on (the Belle of Louisville) and alcohol, and they were up in Iowa somewhere, and the federal government stormed the boat and (Captain Winters) keeled over with a heart attack," Doty said.

Although the former captain didn't actually die on the boat, Doty told The Enquirer that Winters' spirit is "supposedly" still wandering around the boat.

Winters also allegedly played a role in another ghost story.

"Rumor has it that Floyd and the captain were smitten over the same maiden who was on the boat," Doty said, "And (Winters) ordered the wheel to start rolling while Floyd was back there fixing the paddlewheel and, supposedly, he died."

Doty told The Enquirer he doesn't think the deckhand died, but when he was on "Ghost Hunters," and the crew played electronic voice phenomena they collected, he heard something say "Amy."

"Was the girl they were smitten with named Amy? I don't know, but I did hear that," the captain said, adding that the show warned viewers he was a skeptic.

However, that wasn't the only paranormal incident Doty experienced. The captain had taken a woman, who was with another paranormal group, into the pilot's house (which Winters is said to haunt) to ask the spirits questions.

"We went into the captain's quarters down below, and I was telling her the story that I was filling out the captain's log a couple of days prior to that, and I felt something tug on my pant leg and I was the only one in there," he told The Enquirer.

Doty said no lights lit up on the paranormal investigator's machine until he asked, "Are you the one who tugged on my pants leg the other night?" and the machine went wild.

The Belle of Louisville captain said the incident made him think maybe there are spirits on the boat after all, but it didn't make him believe enough to "scare (him) off the boat."

"I've spent many nights over the last 44 years doing night watches and stuff[...] the boat is always moving and creaking, so there's nothing I couldn't explain that I've heard, other than somebody tugging on my pant leg."

JENKINTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- Two people have been arrested in Montgomery County for allegedly running a fortune-telling scheme that defrauded victims out of more than $600,000.

Gina Marks, 52, of Huntingdon Valley and Steve Nicklas, 40, of Jenkintown, are facing multiple felony charges after investigators say they operated a business called Jenkintown Psychic Visions and convinced victims they were cursed.





According to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, the first victim contacted the business for a psychic phone reading and was told she was plagued by a powerful curse that would destroy her marriage, business, and family unless it was removed.

Over the course of 11 months, from September 2022 to August 2023, Marks and Nicklas allegedly demanded large sums of money and luxury items to "cleanse" the curse, including jewelry, cash, clothing, concert tickets, and gift cards.

The victim also handed over personal belongings for rituals, which investigators say were never returned. In total, the pair allegedly stole $595,959 from the first victim.

A second victim came forward during the investigation, which began in December 2024. Detectives say Marks instructed the victim to provide personal photos and details, then made increasingly unorthodox requests, including a Chanel purse and additional money.

Marks allegedly threatened the victim with reputational damage if her instructions were not followed. The second victim lost at least $18,000.

Financial records from Cash App, Zelle, and a credit union confirmed that funds from both victims were transferred into accounts belonging to Marks and Nicklas.

"These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain," said Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. "They are now going to be held accountable for their actions."

Marks and Nicklas were arrested on Tuesday and charged with Corrupt Organizations, Dealing in the Proceeds of Unlawful Activities, Theft by Unlawful Taking and multiple other offenses.
