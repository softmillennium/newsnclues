                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson give their views on how the Singapore Grand Prix panned out for Racing Bulls. The Singapore Grand prix did not go to plan for Racing Bulls, who had both cars finish outside the points despite at times showing enough pace to mix with the top teams in practice and Qualifying. Isack Hadjar was forced to nurse an engine issue on his way to a P11 finish, while Liam Lawson finished down in 15th. We had an issue I think just before pitting. “I couldn't do anything, I was just hoping for the others not to catch up too quickly but they did and we got impacted a lot by the blue flags, we lost a lot there. And Carlos [Sainz] pitted before the blue flags so he benefited from that, but we should have done better.” I gave my all and even like this we finished P11 so not that bad.” It is first time Racing Bulls have failed to score with either car since the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, but Lawson believed more was possible from his race. He opted for a very long first stint in the hopes of a Safety Car but dived into the pits when it became apparent one was not likely to materialise. He was running ahead of Sainz when he pitted two laps before the Spaniard and yet finished five places lower than the Williams man – leaving him baffled as to how Sainz pulled off such a result. “For me, I came out behind the train [of cars], and he came out in front of the train so I need to have a look why. It's frustrating but the damage was mostly done yesterday from me. With two crashes marring his weekend, Lawson could be forgiven for being relieved to come out of the race with his car in one piece, especially after coming perilously close to Yuki Tsunoda through the first few corners at the start. “Had we started higher up the grid, we could've potentially ended up in the points with our pace, but a tough Quali meant it was going to be tricky from the outset,” he concluded.</p>
