                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, in a cabinet meeting, U.S. secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., claimed that there is a link between autism and circumcision. “There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It's highly likely because they are given Tylenol,” he stated, without citing the studies. Helen Tager-Flusberg, an autism researcher and a professor emerita at Boston University, calls the methods used in those studies “appalling.” Tager-Flusberg leads the Coalition of Autism Scientists, a group that advocates for high-quality autism research. Neither study shows a causal link between circumcision—or the pain relief medications that are often prescribed along with the procedure—and higher rates of autism. In the decade-plus since each was published, autism researchers have heavily criticized these studies. And after reviewing both studies, scientists last year found no evidence supporting the claim that circumcision leads to autism or any other adverse psychological effects.

There is also very little evidence that giving acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) to babies or children increases their risk of being diagnosed with autism. There is also very little evidence, as the secretary of health and human services recently suggested, that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy increases a baby's risk of developing autism. “They are looking at an association involving a sample size of eight countries,” an extremely small number for establishing such a link, “and they don't take into consideration any other factors about those countries,” Tager-Flusberg says. Awareness of autism and diagnostic practices also vary between countries. Experts say that circumcision rates are not a reliable stand-in for acetaminophen use in babies anyway. This means that relying on circumcision to estimate acetaminophen use in newborns is flawed, Tager-Flusberg says. Scientists who conducted the 2015 study examined rates of autism among 3,347 predominantly Jewish and Muslim boys who were ritually circumcised in the hospital or in doctor's clinics. That study showed a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with autism among that group than among those who hadn't been circumcised. “That study is riddled with flaws, which others have written about,” said psychologist David S. Mandell in a statement sent to Scientific American on behalf of the Coalition of Autism Scientists. It had a small sample size, limiting the power of its conclusions, and did not account for many Muslim circumcisions that are not done by doctors, which likely skewed the results. The association between circumcision and autism was only significant for those aged 0 to 4 years old, not those aged 5 to 9 years old, which suggests there may be an alternative explanation for the results. These kinds of observational studies are inherently limited—even if they show a link between two variables, they cannot explain what causes it. Relying on weak evidence like this to make claims about the causes of autism is “terribly alarming,” Tager-Flusberg continues, and is ultimately confusing and distressing to families.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although sleep is a universal trait among every living species, scientists have only begun to understand the immense intricacies of our brain's nighttime reset. “Our study showed that different aspects of sleep are related, but can also be separable domains with specific connections to biopsychosocial factors (lifestyle, mental and physical health and cognitive performances),” Aurore Perrault, a co-lead author of the study from Concordia University, said in a press statement. “This highlights the importance of considering the full picture of an individual's sleep to help clinicians make more accurate assessments and guide treatment.” To develop these five distinct profiles, Perrault—along with her fellow co-author Valeria Kebets from McGill University—relied on a treasure trove of data from the Human Connectome Project, which is an NIH-funded project to map macroscale connections across the human brain. The first profile discerns generally poor sleep, which in turn produced increased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. New Scientist reports that this group also showed signs of decreased connectivity in brain areas associated with self-reflection, meaning participants ruminated on their inner thoughts and feelings instead of taking in the external world. The second profile similarly showed signs of worse mental health, but none of the reported characteristics of bad sleep—this was known as “sleep resilience.” The remaining three groups focused on participants that used sleep aids, didn't achieve the minimum recommended seven hours of sleep per night, or woke up several times during the night, respectively. No two people are 100 percent the same, and now, science is showing us that this age-old maxim applies to our sleep as well.

Of the 202 Nobel laureates who have been awarded prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows'). Among the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents. Immigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that's the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.” In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain'. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. Meanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds'). It's a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of depature'), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?

If you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. But despite its outsized influence on the planet's geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer. On the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock's structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance. “We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. Andrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core's composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition. Future missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won't include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have uncovered a new way that brown fat, a type of fat that burns energy, can boost the body's metabolism. This process allows cells to consume more fuel and generate heat, improving overall metabolic health. Brown fat is unique because it turns energy (calories) from food into heat. Exposure to cold can increase the amount of brown fat, and scientists have long suggested that activating it could support weight loss by increasing calorie burning. "Boosting this kind of metabolic process could support weight loss or weight control in a way that is perhaps easier to maintain over time than traditional dieting and exercise. Until now, scientists understood brown fat's heat production mainly through mitochondria, the energy centers of cells. Mitochondria in brown fat can shift from making fuel to generating heat through a molecule called uncoupling protein 1. However, studies have shown that mice lacking this protein can still burn energy and produce heat, suggesting another system at work.The new research identifies peroxisomes, small structures within cells that process fats, as an alternative heat source in brown fat. This effect was even stronger in mice whose mitochondria lacked uncoupling protein 1, suggesting that peroxisomes can step in when mitochondria lose their ability to produce heat.Lodhi and his team discovered that peroxisomes burn fuel and release heat through a process involving a protein called acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). When fed high-fat diets, they also gained more weight than typical mice. In contrast, mice genetically engineered to make unusually high amounts of ACOX2 in brown fat showed increased heat production, better cold tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and weight control when fed the same high-fat diet. Using a fluorescent heat sensor they developed, the researchers found that when ACOX2 metabolized certain fatty acids, brown fat cells got hotter. They also used an infrared thermal imaging camera to show that mice lacking ACOX2 produced less heat in their brown fat. While human bodies can manufacture these fatty acids, the molecules also are found in dairy products and human breast milk and are made by certain gut microbes. Lodhi said this raises the possibility that a dietary intervention based on these fatty acids -- such as a food, probiotic or "nutraceutical" intervention -- could boost this heat-production pathway and the beneficial effects it appears to have. He and his colleagues also are investigating possible drug compounds that could activate ACOX2 directly. But since correlation is not causation, our long-term goal is to test whether dietary or other therapeutic interventions that increase levels of these fatty acids or that increase activity of ACOX2 could be helpful in dialing up this heat production pathway in peroxisomes and helping people lose weight and improve their metabolic health." Lodhi and Liu are named on a provisional patent application filed by Washington University related to targeting ACOX2 activation as a treatment for obesity and related metabolic diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry by Oxford University Press reports that many tree swallow populations across the United States are living in areas with high levels of exposure to “forever” chemicals. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as “forever chemicals,” are synthetic materials that have become a global environmental concern. These compounds enter ecosystems through industrial discharges, firefighting training sites, and wastewater treatment facilities. Such facilities can release residues from everyday consumer products that use these chemicals, including nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, and water-repellent coatings. Because of their strong chemical bonds, these substances do not easily degrade in the environment. They have been detected in soil, water, plants, animals, and even humans on every continent. Although previous studies have linked forever chemicals to serious human health issues, such as certain cancers and reproductive disorders, their broader ecological impacts remain uncertain. Most existing research comes from laboratory experiments on captive animals, while much less is known about how wild species are affected. Field studies that could answer these questions are uncommon because they require extensive time and funding. The research included fieldwork at multiple military installations and other locations with differing contamination histories. The investigators found that despite differences in exposure levels to these chemicals, there was no statistically significant association between chemical exposure and reproductive outcomes such as whether birds hatched or grew to the point where they could take flight.

Every year, hailstorms cause billions in damage to homes, businesses, and crops, yet how these ice balls of destruction form in the upper troposphere has remained somewhat of a mystery. The predominant theory was that hailstones went through a recycling motion, which explained why they often contained varying layers of a clear and opaque ice. Now, research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that this recycling motion is only a small part of the story. “This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Zhang said in a press statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.” Some 10 stones showed that they formed while steadily descending toward the atmosphere, and another 13 displayed evidence of only one single upward push. Surprisingly, three even showed signs of nearly horizontal movement. According to the researchers, hail typically forms in a temperature “sweet spot” of between roughly -30 and -10 degrees Celsius. Although this largely refutes the previous theory behind hailstone formation, larger hailstones do require extended time (at least one upward growth) in this zone for supercooled water to form more layers. This explains why stronger storms—with more powerful updrafts—often produce larger hailstones. Zhang hopes that understanding the inner workings of hailstorm formation will help improve weather forecasting and our ability to estimate the potential dangers of a passing hailstorm (this research is in collaboration with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research). Meteorologists at NWS have already reported degraded forecasting services due to curtailed weather balloon launches used to help gather data for accurate storm prediction. Although unlocking the secret of hailstone formation could help protect people in the path of dangerous storms, it helps to be able to identify that a storm is coming in the first place.

Scientific Reports volume 15, Article number: 32613 (2025) Cite this article Behavioural addictions, characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding activities despite adverse consequences in the long term, are more heterogeneous and less well-understood than substance addictions, and there is a relative lack of translational research. This study investigates “excessive toy motivation” in domestic dogs as a potential parallel to behavioural addictions in humans. Employing a combination of a behavioural test and an owner questionnaire, we examined whether a subset of highly play-motived dogs meet key behavioural addiction criteria, including craving, salience, lack of self-control, and mood modification. Data from 105 highly play-motivated dogs revealed that 33 subjects exhibited behaviours consistent with addictive-like tendencies, including an excessive fixation on toys, reduced responsiveness to alternative stimuli, and persistent efforts to access toys. Owner-reported behaviours not only corroborated these findings but also demonstrated significant associations with behavioural test scores. Our results highlight parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and human behavioural addictions, with dogs as the only non-human species so far that appears to develop addictive-like behaviours spontaneously without artificial induction. This exploratory study provides foundational insights and proposes future research directions that have the potential to significantly deepen our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying behavioural addictions across species. What is play? Why do many large-brained mammals engage in play throughout their lives? And what makes playing potentially addictive? Despite numerous publications on play and its possible functions, play has remained somewhat of a mystery1, being associated with no immediate adaptive function, although it has been suggested to allow animals to practice species-typical behaviours such as hunting, mating, or fighting with a competitor in a non-serious context1. Notwithstanding, play behaviour is ubiquitous among (at least young) mammals and some birds2,3, and in large-brained species in particular – from humans to dogs – it persists throughout life4,5. Still, no unified definition of play exists to date6, although there is some agreement that, at a proximate level, play makes us feel good7. Even in non-human animals, observers will often agree that playful activities look like fun7, with neurotransmitter systems mediating the rewarding aspects of play (opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine)8,9 appearing to be highly conserved across mammalian taxa10. Bateson (2014) proposed a set of characteristics that are generally accepted to define play: it is spontaneous, intrinsically rewarding and “fun”; it is separate from serious consequences; it often involves novel or exaggerated actions and role reversal; it is repetitive, but distinct from stereotypies; and it usually occurs only in healthy, stress-free animals, making it a marker of well-being7. However, regarding the latter point, it has been highlighted that play can also represent an attempt to cope with suboptimal conditions (e.g. in nonhuman animals, play may occur as displacement behaviour in stressful situations5 or may serve to reduce social tensions)11. Also, in humans, playing computer games or gambling represents a way of coping with stress. Moreover, in some instances, what started as a fun activity can become compulsive and develop into a behavioural addiction12,13,14. A behavioural addiction can be defined as “repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person (at least in the short-term), despite longer-term harm to the individual or others” (ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision))15. Unlike in compulsive disorders, where performance of the compulsive behaviour primarily serves to provide some relief from a negative affective state, i.e. via negative reinforcement, addictive behaviours originate because their performance generates positive affect, i.e. via positive reinforcement. However, as the addiction develops, the behaviour becomes compulsive and may even cease to be rewarding (reviewed by Freimuth et al.16. Behavioural addictions share underlying neurobiological processes17 and behavioural symptoms (such as craving, lack of self-control, tolerance, withdrawal and risk of relapse) with substance addictions17,18. Still, they are more heterogeneous and less well-understood19. While a wide range of behaviours have the potential to become addictive in people (e.g. exercise, sex, shopping, work, etc. )19,20,21,22,23,24,25, to date, only the two disorders related to playing – gambling and internet gaming – are officially recognised as behavioural addictions in the two psychiatric manuals of psychological disorders (DSM-5 and ICD-11). The ICD-1115 included both gambling and internet gaming as behavioural addictions. In the 5th edition of DSM-526, gambling, previously classified as an impulse control disorder, was included under “substance-related and addictive disorders”19,26, while internet gaming was listed separately as “internet gaming disorder”26. What would make behaviours related to playing so addictive? Play involves neurotransmitter systems (opioids, cannabinoids, and dopamine) that are also engaged in the rewarding aspects of food and drug rewards8,9. Thus, video games can provide players a hedonic experience and a high degree of relaxation27. Pathological gaming is an example of how seemingly normal and enjoyable behaviours can develop to disrupt regular social and environmental functioning28,29,30. Compared to substance addiction, there are only a few animal models of behavioural addictions. Moreover, these are restricted to controlled laboratory settings, and addictive-like behaviour has to be actively induced31. Rodent models have been used to investigate compulsive eating (e.g. reviewed in31, exercise addiction (wheel running32,33), gambling34, and responses to sexual reward35. Mice selectively bred for excessive wheel-running, sometimes referred to as an addiction-prone phenotype, develop physiological withdrawal symptoms similar to those found in drug addiction after abstinence36. As with excessive exercise in humans, wheel-running in rodents may become disruptive to everyday activities, leading to impaired nest-building and sheltering behaviour37,38. The animals may continue to wheel-run despite disrupted sleep39 or even in the face of injury40, thus fulfilling the behavioural addiction criterion “persistence of the behaviour despite adverse consequences”41. This suggests that behavioural addictions are not unique to the human species. There is, however, only one species that appears to display addictive-like behaviour spontaneously, without intentional experimental induction: the domestic dog (although inadvertent promotion of addictive-like behaviour by the caretakers cannot be ruled out). A small subset of dogs – colloquially referred to as “ball junkies” – appear to demonstrate an addictive-like desire for object play42. Like humans, domestic dogs frequently remain playful throughout their lives1, engaging in both social and object-related play, as well as combinations (e.g. tug-of-war9. Solitary object play appears to be related to predatory behaviour9; accordingly the development of social and object play may reflect different selective histories of dog breeds, which were selected for various purposes such as hunting, guarding, herding, and other functions6,7,8. Toy play is a potent reinforcer, especially in working dog training43,44,45. For instance, detection dogs working in public settings are typically not rewarded with food due to concerns about undesirable food-seeking behaviours in the field. Still, they will work persistently for their toy rewards. It has been argued that artificial selection has exaggerated play behaviour in adult dogs, especially in working breeds or working lines, where high toy motivation is often actively selected as a predictor of performance46. For example, in Labrador retrievers, working lines demonstrate higher playfulness than show lines, indicating a genetic basis for play motivation and potential for artificial selection47. Playing with toys allows dogs to express instinctive predatory sequences such as chasing, catching, possessing and “dissecting”, considered to be intrinsically rewarding to them based on their species and breed histories48. None of this is pathological, nor is gambling or computer gaming in people. However, such highly rewarding activities have the potential to become obsessive in humans49,50, and the same may be true for dogs. While addictive-like behaviour towards toys in dogs has not been studied to date, the phenomenon has been described in the lay literature (where affected dogs may be referred to as ‘ball junkies'), and it has been (rarely) alluded to in the scientific literature. Lazarowski et al.48 describe how some dogs show behavioural and physiological signs of high arousal in relation to toys, lack of self-control, and behaviours such as whining, barking, spinning, and other behavioural signs of stress when access to a toy is prevented (e.g. because the dog is restrained), suggested as an expression of their inability to manage the frustration of anticipation46. All these signs could be interpreted as indicative of craving (and frustration when the urge cannot be fulfilled). In humans, addictive behaviours are often associated with deficits in inhibitory control and heightened cue-reactivity and craving, which are likely key mechanisms in addiction, particularly when exposed to behaviour-specific cues51,52,53. In animal models of addictions, not only is an increased motivation to work for the rewarding substance notable, but the animals also continue seeking the reward even when it is signalled to be unavailable54. Similarly, excessively toy-motivated dogs may continue to try to gain access to a toy even when the caretaker has put it away (anecdotal evidence55. Dogs that appear obsessed with toys cannot be easily distracted from their fixation on the preferred object – demonstrating the high salience of the toy. Such dogs may even lose interest in other stimuli or social interactions as long as they have access to the toy, or sometimes even when it has been removed from reach55 – i.e., everyday functioning may be affected. Moreover, some dogs may continue playing (e.g., running tirelessly after balls thrown for them) despite adverse consequences, such as over-exertion or even injury in the short term and damage to joints and ligaments in the longer term56. Thus, we suggest that ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs may show parallels to behavioural addictions in humans. Domestic dogs share many complex behavioural traits with us57,and they are commonly used as model species to explore compulsive behaviours58,59; cognitive ageing60,61,62, ADHD63,64,65, neuroticism66 and autism67,68,69. Here, we aim to provide the first scientific evaluation of ‘excessive toy motivation' in dogs, develop methods to assess this phenomenon, and investigate whether ‘excessive toy motivation' in pet dogs meets the defining criteria of behavioural addictions. Due to the heterogeneity of behavioural addictions, the number and description of diagnostic criteria are inconsistent in the scientific literature, even in humans19. We decided to explore whether the most common behavioural addiction criteria can be adapted to dogs: (1) craving, (2) salience, (3) mood modification through carrying out the behaviour, (4) lack of self-control, (5) tolerance, (6) withdrawal symptoms, (7) external consequences (the addictive behaviour causes conflict with other activities, other individuals, or within the individual), and (8) relapse after abstinence from the activity (cf28,41,70,71. Two additional criteria are used for diagnosing behavioural addictions in humans: having problems at home or work and lying to/deceiving people close to them26,72. Since these criteria cannot be applied to animals, we focused only on the eight abovementioned criteria. We developed a behavioural test exposing pet dogs to various situations where behavioural addiction criteria in relation to toys can be expressed. Only the first four of the criteria mentioned above can be measured in a single behavioural assessment. The remaining criteria were included in an accompanying questionnaire, in which the dogs' owners were asked about their dogs' everyday behaviour. While this study is exploratory, given the lack of prior research in this area, we used convergent methodologies in an attempt to assess internal and external validity. We predicted that dogs classified as having a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour based on our continuous Addictive-like Behaviour Test score, would: Show higher scores for the individual behavioural addiction criteria: Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control in the behaviour test, Show higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an unavailable toy in the behaviour test, Receive higher scores on the owner questionnaire designed to measure dogs' addictive-like behaviour in everyday life, than dogs classified as having a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour. The study was assessed and approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland (Licence number BE115/17). All procedures were performed in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioral Research and Teaching” of the Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. All dog owners provided written informed consent for their participation. One hundred twenty-six dog-owner teams were recruited via advertisements on social media. In the first call, any play-motivated dog was welcome to participate. In a second call, we specifically sought dogs showing ‘excessive' motivation for toy play. Twenty-one of the 126 tested dogs were excluded from the analysis as they were (1) outside the target age range (< 1 year or > 10 years old; N = 9), (2) did not complete the test due to fatigue (N = 1), (3) did not play at all or were too fearful for pulse measurements (N = 7), or (4) due to disturbances during the test (e.g. owners bringing young children along, N = 4). The final sample (N = 105) included 56 males (34 neutered or chemically castrated, 20 intact and 2 cryptorchids) and 49 females (34 neutered and 15 intact), ranging in age from 12 months to 10 years (mean age = 5.09 years, SD = 2.6). The dogs belonged to various breeds (for demographics, see Supplementary Table 1). Eighty-two owners (72 women and 10 men) participated in the study. Behaviour tests took place in an experimental room (Fig. 1), measuring 5.22 m x 3.36 m. A wooden partition wall divided the room into two parts so that the effective testing space was 3.60 m x 3.36 m. The room was furnished with two chairs and several shelves on the walls. One of the chairs was placed in front of the wooden partition wall (facing the entrance door), and the other was placed at a 90° angle against the wall to the left. In front of both chairs, a taped line marked a one-meter distance from the chairs. During the habituation phase, the opaque box in which a toy or food was enclosed during several subtests (hereafter, unsolvable task box) was placed next to the experimenter's chair. Four video cameras (IB8377-H; 4 MP, 30 fps, H.264, WDR Pro, IR, PoE, IP66, 2.8–12 mm) were placed in the room, and recordings were made using the recorder system (ND9441P NVR, 16-CH, 4HDD, H.265, HDMI/VGA, 16x PoE). Experimental room with the experimenter and owner in the starting position. The test battery consisted of 14 subtests assessing various aspects of toy motivation in dogs. Play behaviour per se cannot be used to infer addictive-like behaviour, which is characterised primarily by reactions when the reward is unavailable; therefore, only subtests relevant to exploring behavioural addiction criteria are described in detail hereafter. The complete description of the play motivation test is available under: https://figshare.com/s/dfd6d12d922f7543b96c. After the owner and the dog had entered the test room, the dog was unleashed, and a 3-minute habituation phase commenced (Fig. Meanwhile, the owner and the experimenter were seated on their allocated chairs, and the experimenter explained the test procedure. The owner signed the consent form. The owners were instructed to interact with the dog only when asked to perform one of the subtests and not to use food during testing unless absolutely necessary (such as exchanging food for a toy if the dog was unwilling to relinquish it). After the habituation phase, the experimenter retrieved a box containing various commercial dog toys of different sizes and textures, with and without squeakers, etc., from the adjacent storage room. Only toys that might be associated with food enrichment were excluded. The owner was asked to select three toys (one ball, one tug toy and one plush toy) which they thought the dog would like the most. If the owner had brought the dog's favourite toy from home, this toy was used in the subsequent preference test along with two other toys. After removing the toy box from the room, the experimenter returned to the test room. The owner recalled the dog and sat down on their chair, holding the dog behind the Line marking the 1 m distance from the chair. Opposite the dog at the front of the room, the experimenter placed the three toys on the floor in a row, 40 cm apart. After the experimenter had returned to her chair, the owner released the dog, who could now explore and play with the toys for 30 s. The two people present did not interact with the dog during this time. The toy the dog spent the most time interacting with was used for subsequent testing. Forty-five dogs selected a ball, nine selected a tug toy, 39 selected a plush toy, and 12 selected a hybrid toy (plush ball: N = 3; tug with a ball: N = 6; plush tug: N = 3). On rare occasions, the dog did not show interest in any of the toys. In this case, the owner was asked to choose the type of toy the dog was usually most interested in at home. The chosen toy was used throughout the experiment, and the remaining two toys were placed on the shelf out of reach and sight of the dog. If the preferred toy was not a tug toy, the tug toy was used in subtests where the owner or experimenter played tug-of-war with the dog. A description of the subtests and, when applicable, their relevance for addiction criteria coding is given in Table 1. Videos were coded using Solomon Coder (Solomon Coder beta 19.08.02, Copyright 2006–2019 by Andràs Péter). For most subtests, the starting point for coding was when the experimenter and the owner were sitting on their chairs, and the dog was behind the Line, which marked a 1 m distance from the owner's chair (Fig. Qualitative and quantitative coding was performed by coders who were not involved in the experiments. Three different coding approaches were employed: Scoring of individual variables that may be indicative of addictive behaviour each minute, which were later summed up as Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (Table 2); coder: KS. Coding of presence/absence of the four addiction criteria in each minute of each subtest; coder: KS. Scoring and point sampling of behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” (Table 4); coder: FL. Coding of absolute durations of behaviours in subtests where the toy was rendered inaccessible (unsolvable task box and toy on a shelf, see Table 4); coders: DZ and AH. A second coder (AM) performed reliability coding of addictive-like behaviours and behavioural addiction criteria and point sampling for 15 dogs. Reliability between the two coders who coded the durations was also analysed for 15 dogs. Reliability was good or excellent for all included variables (ICC, absolute agreement, single measures, two-way mixed-effects model, computed in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) (see Supplementary Table 3 for full results). To quantify dogs' propensity for addictive-like behaviour as objectively as possible, we introduced the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (AB-T score). Applicable sub-criteria were rated for each minute of the test, and for analysis, each sub-criterion was assigned a score between 0 and 2 points, as detailed in Table 2. The points from all the subtests, including the cool-down period, were added to yield the AB-T score. The maximum possible value of the AB-T score was 120 points. A cut-off point for addictive-like behaviour was defined by a data range split divided into two halves. Dogs scoring equal to or above the mid-point (44.2 points) are referred to as dogs showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour or high-AB dogs. Dogs scoring less than 44.2 points are referred to as low-AB dogs (dogs with a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour). The sub-criteria included in the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (as detailed in Table 2) were selected as they were assumed to be relatively independent of the level of obedience and training. Dogs might have been trained to drop a toy on a cue and to exert impulse control and refrain from jumping towards the toy in the experimenter's hand; therefore, these variables were not included in the AB-T score. However, behaviours such as staring at the toy or pacing are believed to be less subject to training and were included. Separately from the AB-T variables, in each subtest, the addiction criteria Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control were rated each minute as present or absent based on the occurrence of pre-defined behaviours. For instance, Salience was inferred from searching for a toy although there was an »attractive alternative« (food, owner inviting the dog to play). Craving was based on the dog focusing mainly on the toy (> 50%) and medium to high arousal directed at the inaccessible toy (inferred from behaviours such as panting, restlessness, and high muscle tension). We further coded behaviours that are usually characteristic of high arousal in some dogs, e.g., pacing, jumping towards the toy, and vocalising (see Table 3). If at least one of the pre-defined behaviours was expressed, the respective addiction criterion was coded as present. Tolerance, Withdrawal symptoms and Risk of relapse after abstinence could not be tested in the setting of the play motivation test since they develop over time. For each subtest, a summary score for each of the four addiction criteria was computed by summing up the points for each minute of the subtest. Selected behaviours during the subtests “Social play” and “Dog alone” were coded by point sampling at 3-second intervals and then extrapolated to proportions of time (Table 4). Based on a subsample of dogs coded using both point sampling and absolute durations of behaviour, we determined sufficient agreement between the two measurement methods, justifying the use of point sampling. During subtests where a reward was inaccessible in the unsolvable task box, the absolute duration of interacting with the box (with low or high effort) was coded (Table 4). For detailed definitions of quantitatively coded variables, see Supplementary Table 2. A questionnaire was developed (available in English and German) (for inter- and intra-rater reliability based on over 1500 dogs recruited via an online survey; see Supplementary Table 6). The questions relating to behavioural addiction criteria relevant to the present manuscript are shown in Table 5. They were rated on a 5-point Likert scale indicating the extent of agreement with the statement (1 – strongly disagree; 2 – partly disagree; 3 – neither agree nor disagree; 4 – partly agree; 5 – strongly agree). The dog owners were asked to complete this questionnaire during the cool-down period of the behavioural test. SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM Corporation and its Licensors 1989, 2015) was used to compute a Categorical Principal Component Analysis and Mann-Whitney U tests. R version 4.1.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021) was used to create boxplots and to calculate linear models. We calculated summary scores for the four addiction criteria for each subtest by summing up the points for each minute. Using Mann-Whitney U tests, we tested whether there was a difference in the addiction criteria Craving, Lack of self-control, Mood modification and Salience between dogs classified as high-AB dogs (AB-T score ≥ 44.2 points) and low-AB dogs (AB-T score < 44.2 points). Note that although components of Salience and craving were used to calculate the AB-T score, these are not identical to the 1 − 0 variables of Salience and craving here. While the addiction criteria were coded as 1/0 for each minute, the variables included in the AB-T score were more detailed, and individual elements potentially indicative of addictive-like behaviour were differentiated. Mood modification and Lack of self-control were not used in the designation of the AB-T score. 1.6 and Table 3 for more details. We performed Mann-Whitney U tests to assess whether high-AB and low-AB dogs differed in quantitatively coded variables such as time engaging with the toy during different subtests, attempting to attain an unavailable toy, etc. (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Linear models were used to assess associations between the addictive-like behaviour score and the 19 questionnaire questions targeting addictive-like behaviour. Model requirements were checked by visually assessing normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals. If applicable, the dependent variable was transformed. Additionally, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test whether the 19 questionnaire scores differed between high-AB and low-AB dogs. This was the case for fifteen questions; therefore, these were summed up to generate an Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score). Cohen's R was used as a measure of effect size. Both intra-rater reliability (available for 274 dogs, including dogs from the online survey) and inter-rater reliability (available for 24 dogs) of the AB-Q score were very good (see Supplementary Table 6). Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no correction for multiple testing was performed (as recommended by73. The mid-point of the data range of the AB-T score was 44.2 (range 6.6–95). Therefore, dogs scoring 44.2 or higher were classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour (high-AB dogs). This was the case for thirty-three of the 105 highly play-motivated dogs tested, with a mean score of 59.7 points and a median of 58.6. The mean AB-T score for low-AB dogs (< 44.2 points) was 23.1, and the median was 22.8. For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 7. Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that high-AB dogs scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on craving (U = 217, p < 0.0001), salience (U = 208, p < 0.0001), and lack of self-control (U = 756.5, p = 0.002), but not mood modification (U = 1022, p = 0.157), in the behaviour test (see Supplementary Table 4, Figs. For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 8. Behavioural addiction criteria and toy-directed behaviors: Multiple sub-figures (a–g) illustrate differences between high-AB and low-AB dogs across various metrics. (a) Craving summary score (b) Salience summary score (c) Lack of self-control summary score (d) Mood modification summary (e) Interaction with the box while the toy is enclosed – total interaction time (s) (f) Toy on the shelf– duration of looking at the toy (s). High-AB dogs interacted significantly longer with the box than low-AB dogs in the ‘toy in the box' subtest (U = 675.5, p < 0.0001). They also spent more time looking at the toy on the shelf during the ‘toy on shelf' subtest (U = 414.5, p < 0.0001) and the ‘social play without toys' subtest (U = 942.5, p = 0.021), while focusing less on the owner in the latter (U = 819.5, p = 0.011) compared to low-AB dogs (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. However, time spent interacting with the toy while the owner and experimenter were out of the room did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs (U = 994, p = 0.135; Supplementary Table 5). For descriptive statistics, see Supplementary Table 9. Linear models demonstrated significant associations between the AB-T score and 18 out of 19 individual questions (Table 6). However, according to Mann-Whitney U tests, only fifteen questions differed significantly between dogs classified as showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour in the behaviour test (AB-T score ≥ 44.2) and those that did not. These fifteen questions (Cohen's R > 0.2 – see Table 6) were summed up into the Addictive-like Behaviour Questionnaire score (AB-Q score) (see Table 6). This study represents the beginning of the exploration of addictive-like behaviour in domestic dogs. Convergent behavioural measures support the existence of an addictive-like behavioural phenotype in 33 of the 105 tested highly play-motivated dogs. Note that we specifically sought dogs exhibiting extreme behaviour; thus, this proportion is not a reflection of the general population. Perhaps not surprising, working breeds – many of which are known to have been artificially selected for high toy or predatory motivation74,75,76 – were overrepresented in the sample. As predicted, dogs classified as high-AB dogs based on the detailed AB-T score (Addictive-like Behaviour Test score) scored significantly higher than low-AB dogs on the individual criteria craving, salience, and lack of self-control in the behaviour test. Contrary to the prediction, mood modification (when given access to a toy) did not differ between high and low-AB dogs. In retrospect, however, this lack of difference between the two groups strengthens our argument that we were measuring a phenotype beyond mere enjoyment of play. Still, despite the significant differences between high- and low-AB dogs in the other investigated addiction criteria, Salience, Craving and Loss of Self Control, there was generally high variation between individuals. In line with the predictions, high-AB dogs showed higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an inaccessible toy than low-AB dogs, often prioritising attempting to access the toy over eating or interacting with the owner. Thus, there was general agreement between the three alternative methods of coding the data (detailed behaviour score, addiction criteria, and quantitative coding), indicating internal consistency. The external validity of the behaviour test was demonstrated by significant associations of the AB-T score with 18 out of 19 questions from the addictive-like behaviour questionnaire filled in by the dogs' owners, intended to measure addictive-like behaviour in everyday life. Nonetheless, although significant, the effect sizes were relatively low, indicating that no single question would have predictive value for assessing a tendency for addictive-like behaviour in dogs. In studies using animal models of substance addiction, one way to differentiate an addiction from drug use that occurs due to lack of choice is to present the subject with a choice between the addictive substance and other highly desirable stimuli. If an individual continues to take the drug at the expense of these other options (such as consumption of a food reward), this points to the possibility of addictive-like behaviour77,78. Consistent with this, high-AB dogs showed a loss of interest in other relevant stimuli, focusing on the inaccessible toy and foregoing the opportunity to consume food or to engage with their owner. The latter is also reminiscent of behavioural addictions in humans, leading to a decline in social interactions79. The intense toy-seeking and loss of interest in other stimuli, despite the availability of food or social interaction – considered as indicators for salience and persistence – might resemble “hyperfocus,” a trait associated with ADHD and autism in humans80,81. However, unlike typical hyperfocus, which often emerges in the absence of competing stimuli, dogs in our study were presented with alternative salient rewards (e.g., the toy was placed on a shelf while the owner actively invited the dog to engage in social play; in another subtest, food was available in a puzzle toy while the preferred toy was inaccessible in a closed container), and they still showed a preference for the inaccessible toy. Like dogs with ADHD, dogs in the current study with high AB-T scores in general exhibited high impulsivity (labelled as “loss of self-control”), and some individuals displayed heightened activity (which could be interpreted as the hyperactivity component of ADHD64,65 in particular during the cool-down period. Thus, further research is needed to explore commonalities and differences between addictive-like behaviour and ADHD-like behaviour in dogs. While dogs with a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour might exhibit many characteristics of dogs with ADHD, the converse is not necessarily true – dogs might show ADHD-like behaviour without displaying any hyperfixation on toys. Another characteristic of addicted individuals is that they are willing to pursue their addiction even if it has adverse consequences82. In the current study, “adversity” was elicited by the owner and the experimenter leaving the room in order to assess the effect of social isolation on the behavioural addiction criteria. Isolation in an unfamiliar place is well-established as a stressful experience for dogs83,84,85,86. However, this subtest was not a good measure of addictive-like behaviour: Time spent interacting with the toy while the dog was alone did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs. For welfare reasons, we decided against exposing the dogs to more severe stressors; however, it cannot be ruled out that this subtest was not “aversive” enough. The dog was left alone for only 30 seconds, and the subtest took place in the middle of the test when the dogs were already habituated to the test room. It is also possible that individual differences in subjects' separation distress, independent of play motivation, affected the results. Additionally, there was no clear contingency between interacting with the toy and the ‘adverse' outcome (owner leaving). Future studies could potentially enhance the design by providing the dog with an explicit choice, such as by placing the toy in a separate room, away from the owner and the experimenter. This could help determine whether the dog is willing to risk being alone in an unusual or new environment when it normally prefers the safety of being near its owner. Such a design would better reflect the conflict between competing motivations (social security vs. reward seeking) and could offer a more valid test of the criterion of persistence under adversity. Still, the importance of continued efforts to engage in the behaviour despite adverse consequences was demonstrated in the questionnaire, where one of the highest associations with the AB-T score was found with the question, “My dog will continue to play with a ball/toy despite adverse consequences”. This suggests that some dogs may fulfil the criterion of continuing the addictive-like behaviour despite adverse consequences in real life, even if this could not be demonstrated in the behaviour test. A critical factor in addiction is the propensity to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards87,88. In humans, cues associated with addictive behaviours, such as specific locations or objects, can induce craving and drug administration88,89. In dogs, a toy such as a ball could represent such as a conditioned cue. It may achieve its value, for example, by the experience of chasing and catching. For many domestic dogs, balls or other toys possess incentive salience, according to the three criteria by Robinson and Berridge49: they (1) “elicit approach” (i.e. they become “wanted” and act as “motivational magnets”); (2) “they can energise ongoing actions by eliciting cue-triggered wanting”; (3) “they can act as reinforcers in their own right, reinforcing the acquisition of a new instrumental response (measurable by conditioned reinforcement)” (cf49, p. The perceived value of the toy was demonstrated in our study by many dogs having difficulty relinquishing the toy. It can be speculated that balls become ‘motivational magnets' by being associated with species-typical predatory behaviour (cf48. The high salience of the toy was especially apparent in subtests where dogs were foregoing available alternatives such as freely available food or social play with the owner, at the expense of trying to regain their inaccessible toy. In both rodents and humans90,91, individuals with a higher tendency to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards (sign trackers) are more vulnerable to addiction than goal trackers, who focus primarily on the (location of the) reward itself88,92, see the meta-analysis by93. Tendency to sign-track vs. goal-track is associated with the risk of addiction and is also related to variations in the dopaminergic system and stress physiology88. While it was not explicitly measured in the current study, in dogs, a tendency to sign track might be advantageous in a training context – i.e., maintaining motivation would be easier in dogs that are not only sensitive to rewards but also attribute value to the cues predicting these rewards, even if not always followed by a primary reinforcer. Sensitivity to reward – and propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward-predictive cues – would thus be highly relevant traits in relation to trainability and might be selected for especially in working dog breeds. Several publications state the importance of ‘obsessive' play motivation for working dog success42,94,95,96,97,98,99. Dogs with extreme toy motivation are believed to show better focus, reduced distractibility and greater trainability97,99. However, if such motivation becomes addictive-like, it needs to be questioned whether the well-being of these dogs may be compromised. If dogs prioritise toy interactions over other essential aspects of their daily lives this may have maladaptive effects, as is the case in humans with behavioural addictions100,101. Certainly, adverse health consequences may arise from repetitive ball chasing, like straining ligaments and joints56. Moreover, welfare would be compromised when dogs experience a high level of frustration when access to their reward is prevented (cf102. Anecdotally, when play motivation becomes excessive, irritability, high arousal levels, and frustration may negatively affect dogs' trainability and work103. Indeed, as stated by Mathews96, the high ‘drive' of search dogs often makes them unsuitable as family pets, which is also supported by owner reports that pet dogs with extreme motivation for toys are often problematic to control102. Thus, it needs to be questioned when play becomes maladaptive. Do high-AB dogs still ‘like' to play, or have they progressed to primarily ‘wanting' and the compulsive need to continue104?. Similar to the escalating engagement seen in human behavioural addictions105, some dogs would repeatedly spin, jump, focus or bark towards the unavailable toy on the shelf for the duration of the subtest. Two dogs even managed to destroy the box enclosing their favourite toy. These behaviours might be likened to the repetitive actions observed in individuals with behavioural addictions41. Nonetheless, such behaviours may also occur in other behavioural phenotypes such as canine compulsive disorder or autism spectrum-like behaviours106. Further research is needed to elucidate commonalities and differences between such phenotypes in dogs. Behavioural addictions in humans often involve emotional dependency on specific activities107. Whether dogs similarly seek comfort, stimulation, or stress relief through persistent engagement with the toy could not be determined in the context of the behaviour test. In the questionnaire, “Is attached to the favourite toy” was the only question not significantly associated with the AB-T score. Thus, further research is required to determine whether dogs develop an emotional dependency on their toys (as described anecdotally). To better understand the origin and possible functional underpinnings of excessive toy-directed behaviour in dogs, future research should examine whether similar patterns of excessive object play occur in non-domesticated canids. While data are limited, recent studies have shown that both hand-reared and wild wolf pups engage in object play108. For instance, wolf pups have been observed developing a preference for toys and spending increasing amounts of time with them over time108. Hand-reared wolf pups will even retrieve objects to humans109. In the wild, wolves have also been seen interacting with human-made objects110. These findings suggest that object play is not unique to dogs but rather could represent a broader trait shared by canids. Comparative studies are needed to assess how common and functionally relevant such behaviours are in wolves, which would help clarify the biological basis of the addictive-like behaviours observed in some dogs. Being the first of its kind, this study has its limitations. As no gold standard exists, the study is exploratory, and our categorisation of dogs into high and low addictive-like behaviour groups, determined by a data range split, was somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, the assignment of high- and low-AB categories corresponded well to the first author's personal assessment of addictive-like tendencies in the participant dogs. In interpreting the questionnaire results, it is important to acknowledge the potential biases associated with using owner-reported questionnaires. Owners may unintentionally project their perceptions or expectations onto their dogs' behaviours, potentially leading to discrepancies between reported and observed behaviours in behavioural test. This is particularly relevant in cases where owners have multiple dogs, as they are likely to compare their pets to one another, influencing their assessment, such as by underestimating or overestimating certain behaviours. For instance, an owner with a highly active dog may rate their less active dog as overly calm. Integrating owner reports and objective testing allows for a more comprehensive and accurate canine behaviour evaluation. To conclude, there appear to be parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and behavioural addictions in humans. Interestingly, also in humans, the first officially recognised behavioural addictions (gambling and internet gaming) originate in play28,29,30,111. Generally, play is an activity that induces a pleasurable emotional state6. In humans, much evidence suggests that video games can affect people's lives positively. They make players feel better about themselves, help raise their self-esteem and assist people in dealing with everyday stress111. Some people are excessive gamers, but only a minority would be classified as addicts111,112,113. Similarly, many dogs may greatly enjoy toy play without developing harmful compulsions (cf. Despite the observed parallels between high-AB dogs and humans affected by behavioural addictions, we refrain from conclusively characterising high-AB dogs as exhibiting addictive behaviour, given the absence of established benchmarks or standardised criteria. It is important to be cautious when pathologising behaviour, especially given that even in humans, addictive behaviours are still difficult to define and measure114. To further understand possible parallels in the processes underlying behavioural addictions in humans and excessive toy motivation in dogs, subsequent research endeavours should seek to correlate individual differences in addictive-like behaviour in dogs with characteristics associated with addictive behaviours in humans, such as high impulsivity, impaired reversal learning, heightened perseveration, and delayed extinction of previously rewarded responses115,116.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Pavlova and local guide Adrián Beltrán Dimas reached the bottom of the cave, having already explored all that was mapped, they opted to head into an unknown passage through a submerged entrance. The passage led to a previously unseen room in which two engraved shell bracelets sat atop stalagmites, likely as an offering, according to a translated statement from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). The explorers also found another bracelet, a giant snail shell, and pieces of black stone discs similar to pyrite mirrors—all of it dated to more than 500 years ago. Archaeologists then descended on the cave, uncovering 14 total objects—three shell bracelets, a bracelet fragment, the giant snail shell, a piece of burnt wood, and pieces of eight stone discs (two of which were complete). The bracelets feature S-shaped symbols known as xonecuilli, zigzagging lines,a and circles to create human faces in profile. These designs could be meant to signify deities. The archaeologists determined that the stalagmites were manipulated in pre-Hispanic times to give them a more spherical finish, likely to better fit with ritual needs. “Possibly the symbols and representations of characters on the bracelets are related to pre-Hispanic cosmogony regarding creation and fertility,” Cuauhtemoc Reyes Alvarez, INAH archaeologist, said in a statement. The black stone discs resemble others from nearby archaeological regions, such as El Infiernillo, along with ones from distant cultures like Huasteca. Historical reports say extreme cold forced people groups living in the Sierra de Guerrero (located over 7,850 feet above sea level and filled by dense pine and oak forests) to lower altitudes. Little is known about the Tlacotepheuas, other than 16th century historical mentions of their presence. The snail-shell bracelets could help tell their story.

Scientists have developed a blood test that analyses epigenetic changes in immune cells. They say it could be used to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome may have a new weapon in their armoury. A debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding. “I think it's really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.” Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge Many studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere, it still experiences powerful winds that play a major role in shaping the planet's climate and in distributing its ever-present dust. These winds stir up dust into swirling columns called dust devils—rotating plumes of air and fine particles that sweep across the Martian surface. Because they trace the flow of moving air, scientists use them as natural markers to study wind behavior that would otherwise remain unseen.A new study led by Dr. Valentin Bickel from the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern reveals that both dust devils and the winds driving them are much faster than scientists previously believed. "Using a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, we were able to identify dust devils in over 50,000 satellite images," explains first author Valentin Bickel. "Our study is therefore based exclusively on data from European Mars exploration," Bickel continues. These images can therefore be used to measure the movement of dust devils." He continues: "Our data show where and when the winds on Mars seem to be strong enough to lift dust from the surface. This is the first time that such findings are available on a global scale for a period of around two decades." Future Mars missions can benefit from the research results The results obtained are also particularly important for future Mars missions. These models are essential to better assess risks for future missions and adapt technical systems accordingly. "In the long term, our research should help to make the planning of Mars missions more efficient," concludes Bickel. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers exploited a weakness in current energy technology to create more electricity. It sounds counterintuitive, but there is such a thing as too much sun for solar panels. This is a longtime problem, and it might be one that's preventing greater adoption of solar panels, which emerged as a viable energy source for Americans in the 1970s. As global energy requirements continue to rise and much of the world moves away from fossil fuels, efficiency has become a vital factor in sustainable energy generation. It could be especially important as heat waves become more common due to climate change. Now, scientists in the UK might have a fix that takes advantage of excess thermal energy, turning it into chemical energy that can then provide the missing power. Each traditional photovoltaic cell within a solar panel array has a silicon semiconductor layer specially designed to absorb the sun's photons, or particles of light, and convert it into electricity. This motion creates an electric current in the cell. Such solar panels have a typical operating temperature range between 60 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can absorb too much heat, thanks to their superior sun-absorbing properties. That's when electrons within the circuit of each photovoltaic cell begin bouncing around. The new research looks beyond photovoltaics and relies instead on silicon-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) flow cells. The system is similar to traditional solar panel technology, but it has a key difference: a chemical reaction takes place at the cell's surface, driving its electricity transfer, study co-author Dowon Bae, PhD, of Loughborough University said in an email. PEC flow cells operate primarily through a two-step process. “Simply put, there is a temperature range where heat can be used efficiently without overheating.” The sweet spot for this increased energy conversion is at around 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Beyond that point, rising temperatures will cause PECs to reduce their effectiveness, too. Although this threshold can change based on the materials used, Bae says that as it gets hotter, more material adheres to the surface of the cells, and at a certain point, it's too much. Though PEC flow cells promise to drink up more sunlight than traditional solar panel technology, they do have to overcome their own Achilles' heel: they require what Bae calls a “toll-fee” payment to kickstart the necessary chemical reactions. While these limitations have kept the technology from widespread adoption, some industries do use it for other applications, particularly in green hydrogen production or carbon capture. Standard photovoltaics may remain the foundational engine of the green energy revolution, but Bae is still confident that PEC flow cells offer myriad benefits. In fact, some researchers refer to the PEC cell as an “artificial leaf.” Bae is very skeptical of using PEC technology for hydrogen generation or carbon dioxide-reduction, because of the current efficiency and corrosion issues. However, he notes that redox batteries, which rely on an oxidation-reduction (redox) chemical reaction to produce electricity, could be a better option for PECs. “Unlike other chemical conversion processes, redox batteries require low overpotential and do not require any gas or product filtering processes,” he says.These kinds of creative solutions will become necessary in the near future, he says. The cost of photovoltaic electricity has fallen by 85 percent since 2010, and enabling solar panels to soak up more of the sun's power could further reduce the cost, making solar panel technology more universally appealing. Though solar engineers have treated heat as an enemy to be circumvented for decades, this new work showcases that, ironically, even heat waves could power the green energy revolution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists Turned 300,000 Litter Box Visits into an AI-Powered Cat Health Monitor Cat bathroom data from an AI-powered litter box could offer useful pet health insights The scientists built a painstaking dictionary of these gestures—a full “ethogram,” or catalog, of species-specific behaviors—and then identified the distinct moves in feline bathroom habits: grooming, digging, sniffing litter. “We landed on 39 different behaviors that cats do in a litter box, with the understanding that depending on their satisfaction with the litter box, the environment and the dynamics around them, those behaviors will shift,” says Ragen McGowan, director of digital and AI product development at Purina and one of the authors of a paper published recently in Applied Animal Behaviour Science on the development of Purina's AI-powered litter box monitor. “We realized this ethogram could be a window into their health.” Cats commonly suffer from diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, urinary tract infections and many more conditions. The researchers hoped to predict and stave off these ailments by training an artificial intelligence system on everything a cat can do in a litter box. They believed that AI could warn cat owners of feline health concerns long before the cats—ever stoic and aloof—showed signs.

The researchers placed scales with a sensor at each corner that could detect tiny changes in weight and movement under litter boxes. If you've ever watched a cat rotate exactly three and a half times before committing to a square inch of litter, you begin to understand the research process—multiplied hundreds of thousands of times. “We would work closely with our behaviorists to discuss what they're looking at in the videos, and then we had to develop mathematical equations,” says Natalie Langenfeld-McCoy, manager of AI product development at Purina. The analysis of these recordings would become the foundation for Purina's Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitor, which, released in 2022, is already in more than 10,000 homes. “Not only can we use their weight as a way to tell them apart but also their patterns in the litter box, the time of day they go and their normal habits to create what we call a ‘paw print,' or signature, for that cat,” McGowan says. The team intends for the tool to communicate problems cats are having or offer reassurance to owners when all is well. Feline kidney disease, for example, a progressive illness that often goes unnoticed in early stages, can be treated if caught early. “By the time most pet owners would notice a behavioral change, the loss of renal function will be over 80 percent, and there's no turning back,” McGowan says. According to Purina's website, although “information provided by Petivity Smart Litter Box Monitors is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease,” the monitors can alert owners to “key changes that may indicate a health issue requiring a veterinary diagnosis.” Jessica Quimby, a small animal internal medicine specialist and professor at the Ohio State University, uses the Petivity monitor in her own research on feline kidney disease and recently published a paper showing clinically relevant results based on the monitor's measurements. (Quimby is a Nestlé Purina PetCare advisory board member.) “One of the very first things you might see with the onset of disease, even before we know the cat has kidney disease, is that they're losing weight and urinating more,” Quimby says. “We can see those trends appearing on the Petivity data.” Cats, she explains, are good at hiding health problems from their caregivers. The smart litter box does, however, have its limitations. “If [cats] are close in weight and they have a similar pattern of elimination, that's a struggle for the system,” says Langenfeld-McCoy. She recommends that five or fewer cats use one system. But improvements in AI capabilities should help distinguish between similar cats soon. “The deep-learning models can pick out subtle differences in behavior that maybe we don't even know exist, so we're moving towards that for those cats that are close in weight,” she says. Household antagonists—nudgy robot vacuums, percussive washing machines—can also cause confusion, so the team coached cat owners on placement during its research. But often when problems arise, the fix is less engineering than sociology. With a baby gate installed, the AI recovered its composure. The new study is a way for the team at Purina to pull back the curtain for users and skeptics alike and let cat owners determine whether “smart” gets to take off its quotation marks.

(2025)Cite this article In drug discovery processes, changing the core structures of lead compounds to a variety of other ring systems is often needed, which typically requires laborious de novo syntheses of individual analogues. Here we report a conceptually different approach that allows rapid access to diverse core structures from a common intermediate using 1,2-oxaborines as a versatile molecular platform. A soft enolization/6π-electrocyclization strategy has been developed to efficiently synthesize 1,2-oxaborines from readily available enones or enals. Taking advantage of their multifaceted reactivities, 1,2-oxaborines can undergo further C−H functionalization and be transformed into a diverse range of arenes, heteroarenes and non-aromatic heterocycles. Finally, late-stage preparations of a suite of analogues that contain Lipitor substituents but with different aromatic cores are demonstrated using the 1,2-oxaborine-based core diversification strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Skoltech have developed a mathematical model that explores how memory functions. When they analyzed this model, they discovered intriguing results that could help improve robotic systems, artificial intelligence, and our understanding of how the human mind stores information. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, suggest there might be an ideal number of senses—and if that's true, our five senses might not be enough! "Our conclusion is of course highly speculative in application to human senses, although you never know: It could be that humans of the future would evolve a sense of radiation or magnetic field. Following a research tradition that began in the early 20th century, the team focused on modeling the basic units of memory known as “engrams.” An engram can be thought of as a sparse collection of neurons in different brain regions that fire together. For humans, these features correspond to sensory experiences—for example, the concept of a banana includes its appearance, smell, taste, and other sensory qualities. Engrams evolve over time, becoming sharper or more diffuse depending on how often they are triggered by sensory input from the outside world. "We have mathematically demonstrated that the engrams in the conceptual space tend to evolve toward a steady state, which means that after some transient period, a 'mature' distribution of engrams emerges, which then persists in time," Brilliantov commented. The number seven appears to be a robust and persistent feature of memory engrams as such. One caveat is that multiple engrams of differing sizes existing around a common center are deemed to represent similar concepts and are therefore treated as one when calculating memory capacity. The memory of humans and other living beings is an enigmatic phenomenon tied to the property of consciousness, among other things. Advancing the theoretical models of memory will be instrumental to gaining new insights into the human mind and recreating humanlike memory in AI agents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists from the University of Bath, working together with researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, have created a molecule that stops a key protein linked to Parkinson's disease and certain dementias from clumping together. Alpha-synuclein is a protein found mainly inside brain cells (neurons), where it helps control the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the chemical that allows neurons to communicate with each other. In Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein begins to stick together, forming toxic clusters that kill nerve cells. This cell loss leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulty with movement. Although existing therapies can ease these symptoms, none currently stop or reverse the underlying damage. This shape is crucial for its role in carrying and delivering dopamine within the brain. Lab experiments revealed that the peptide remains stable, can enter brain-like cells, and reduces the buildup of toxic protein deposits while improving movement in a worm model of Parkinson's disease. The findings mark a significant step towards developing new peptide-based treatments for currently untreatable neurodegenerative conditions. Professor Jody Mason, from the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Bath, said: "Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems. "This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited." "Dementia isn't an inevitable part of ageing; it's caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases. "By stabilizing alpha-synuclein in its healthy form, this could open the door to a new class of treatments that could slow progression in diseases like Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies.
