                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RANCAGUA, Chile (October 9, 2025) – The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team utilized a 15th minute goal from captain Benjamin Cremaschi, a 79th minute free kick from Niko Tsakris and another goal from Cremaschi in the third minute of second half stoppage time to claim a well-earned 3-0 win against Italy in the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Round of 16 match at Estadio El Teniente. With the result, the USA has beaten both France and Italy by 3-0 scores in this tournament and advanced to its fifth-straight FIFA U-20 World Cup Quarterfinal where it will face the winner of Thursday's other match between Morocco-Korea Republic at Estadio Teniente in Rancagua on Sunday, Oct. 12 at 4 p.m. Attacker Mattia Mosconi earned some space on the right flank and swung in a cross that swerved with the wind before it clanged off the left post and was cleared away for a corner kick. On the ensuing take, the ball found its way to Christian Corradi whose snap header was well-saved by U.S. ‘keeper Adam Beaudry. His first-time cross was nodded up in the air, before falling for Jamal Iddrissou whose effort from the ground was well-held by Beaudry. Tsakiris possessed the ball in the center circle and sent Cole Campbell in one-on-one with an Italy defender. The first 15 minutes of the second half was mostly devoid of opportunities, but Italy provided the first danger on the hour mark as Mannini picked up a loose ball from 25 yards out and fired a bouncing effort that Beaudry gobbled up. Italy continued to threaten and in the 73rd minute Javison Idele drove in a dangerous cross from the right that Beaudry stretched out at full extension to claim at the back post. An Italy defender deflected it out of the area, but it eventually fell for Tsakiris who unleashed a knuckling blast that forced Seghetti to make a diving save to his right and push the ball out for a corner kick. After threatening just moments before, Tsakiris bagged the USA's second. Both he and Cremaschi stood over the ball and the U.S. captain looked like he would take it, but instead Tsakiris stepped up and hit a curling left-footed effort that bent around the left side of Italy wall and tucked inside the left post to make it 2-0. Italy pushed hard to get back in the game and requested not one but two plays to be reviewed by the Video Support System for penalty kicks, but both were correctly denied by the center ref.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AUSTIN, Texas – U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said Christian Pulisic did not train on Thursday and is a question mark for Friday's game against Ecuador. “I need to communicate that we have some issues in some players, like Christian [Pulisic], who didn't train today,” Pochettino said, not offering any other further specifics but also indicating that Alejandro Zendejas and Antonee Robinson sat out Thursday as well. “We need to assess tomorrow [if] they can be available or not.” Pulisic had spoken to the media earlier in the day but did not mention any issues, injury or otherwise. Instead, he focused on the importance for the U.S. team to come out of this international window with not just good performances, but also good results. After meeting La Tri, the U.S. will host Australia, another World Cup-bound opponent, next Tuesday in Colorado. “We want to kind of understand and know where our team is at and have a good feeling going forward as we get closer to the summer.” 10 was named Serie A player of the month and has six goals and two assists for Milan across all competitions. Pulisic missed a penalty kick in Sunday's draw with Juventus, but he remains one of the most important players for both club and country. The run of form has been validation for Pulisic, who asked to take the Gold Cup off so that he could let his body heal ahead of preseason with Milan. On Thursday, he made sure to point out that he didn't just spend his summer on the beach. “I worked really hard this summer,” Pulisic said. “It's not like I just took a break. I wanted to make sure that my body was in the perfect spot coming into the season, and I wanted to start really strong, and I worked really hard. “I think I can do well in a lot of the attacking positions, but I've always felt comfortable coming off the left side, but also being in sort of pockets in behind the striker,” he said. “I've always been pretty comfortable in that position. “I think we're settling in well,” Pulisic said. “Now it's about building good performances one after the other. After last camp feeling good, now it's a great opportunity.” Paul Tenorio  is a senior writer for The Athletic who covers soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States rolled to a 3-0 victory over Italy at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup on Thursday, booking a quarterfinal spot with their Round of 16 triumph in Rancagua, Chile. Inter Miami CF midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi, who's on loan at Italian Serie A side Parma, scored twice to take the Golden Boot lead. San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Niko Tsakiris also scored his second goal of the tournament, while Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Adam Beaudry posted a shutout. Cremaschi found a 15th-minute opener, stabbing a close-range finish past Italian goalkeeper Jacopo Seghetti after FC Dallas left back Nolan Norris' header was saved off the line. He then added an exclamation point in the 93rd minute, chipping over Seghetti following a powerful run out of midfield. Niko Tsakiris bends it around the wall to give @USYNT a two-goal advantage!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team is back in action to kick off the penultimate international window of 2025, as they take on Ecuador at Austin FC's Q2 Stadium before looking ahead to a matchup with Australia. While Pochettino's first year with the USMNT saw some less-than-ideal outcomes, the Argentine manager may have found a new lease on success with his adjustment to a 3-4-3 formation, which led to a 2–0 win over Japan. It would be easy to stick the Stars and Stripes into its usual 4-3-3, but that has not garnered results, leaving Pochettino with a major decision to make for Friday's clash. Here's what the USMNT's XI could look like against Ecuador. GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper has been the de facto No. CB: Tim Ream—The Charlotte FC veteran shifts to right center back, allowing him to link up with Alex Freeman on the right side. CB: Cameron Carter-Vickers—Vancouver Whitecaps FC defender Tristan Blackmon started against Japan in the back three, but is not on the roster for October, so Celtic FC mainstay Carter-Vickers comes back in. RWB: Alex Freeman—It's been a breakout year with the USMNT and Orlando City SC for Alex Freeman, and he appears as much of a lock to start for Pochettino as anyone. CM: Weston McKennie—The Juventus midfielder has been in middling form in Serie A, but will look to prove himself as a true starter with the American squad after sporadic minutes under Pochettino. RW: Alejandro Zendejas—After scoring against Japan, Zendejas endeared himself to USMNT fans and, with five goals and three assists in 12 games with Club América in Liga MX, should earn another start ST: Folarin Balogun—With a goal and an assist in five Ligue 1 games with AS Monaco, Balogun remains the best option up top for Pochettino. LW: Christian Pulisic—Leading the Serie A Golden Boot race with four goals and two assists with AC Milan, Christian Pulisic comes into this USMNT camp in the best form of his life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top spot is at stake in Scotland's 2026 World Cup qualifying group as it plays host to Greece on Thursday. Steve Clarke & Co sit level on points with Group C leader Denmark and is yet to taste defeat after two games, only just missing out on first place due to goal difference. This clash presents a matchup between two teams who have already met twice thus far in 2025. And despite an away win in Athens during the UEFA Nations League play-offs back in March, Scotland missed out on promotion to the competition's top rung after a 3-0 home defeat to Greece in the return leg. The ghosts of that game will still be haunting some of the players in Clarke's squad, though Thursday also hands them a shot at redemption. That decisive result seven months ago marked Scotland's first home loss to the Piratiko, and a second in succession could prove all too costly to their chances of World Cup qualification. Torino striker Che Adams is the only Scottish player to have scored for the team through two games, with their only other finish coming courtesy of a Belarus own-goal. Greece, on the other hand, produced five different scorers against the same opponent, though Benfica frontman Vangelis Pavlidis is the team's biggest threat up top.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested that the international calendar “should be changed to allow World Cups to be played regularly in the winter,” according to Martyn Ziegler of the London TIMES. For that reason, the Qatar World Cup three years ago was moved to November and December, which meant most European club campaigns had to start earlier and finish later to accommodate it. Infantino, speaking at the European Football Clubs annual assembly, said that talks were “under way on changing the calendar.” He raised the idea of “more club football being played during June in the future.” Infantino said, “The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe. We just have to have an open mind.” He continued, “If you want to play at the same time everywhere, you can play in March or in October, most likely. Because in December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part of the world.” Infantino also said that he was “confident there would not be visa problems for countries at next year's World Cup” in the U.S., Mexico and Canada (London TIMES, 10/9). MONEY TREE: BBC.com's Nick Mashiter notes Infantino also confirmed FIFA's desire to further grow the Club World Cup when speaking at the assembly. Infantino: “This has created revenues for the clubs. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better” (BBC.com, 10/9).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel will resume its qualification campaign for the FIFA World Cup 2026 this coming weekend amid widespread public protests and growing demands for football's governing body to sanction the country over its genocide in Gaza. Despite the widespread opposition, Israel's upcoming World Cup qualifiers – against Norway on Saturday and Italy on Tuesday – will go ahead as scheduled after FIFA sidestepped the issue by saying it cannot “solve geopolitical problems”. Football fans and several experts have accused FIFA and UEFA of double standards over their failure to act against Israel in the two years of its war on Gaza, while swiftly sanctioning Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. More than 30 legal experts have called on UEFA to bar Israel and its clubs from competitions over the atrocities in Gaza. The letter highlighted the damage that Israel has inflicted on the sport in Gaza – at least 421 Palestinian footballers have been killed since Israel began its military offensive in October 2023 – and said Israel's bombing campaign was “systematically destroying Gaza's football infrastructure”. While a ceasefire deal was agreed between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Thursday, the war on Gaza has killed at least 67,183 people and wounded 169,841 in more than two years. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Last month, Spanish Sports Minister Pilar Alegria said Israeli teams should be banned from sport in the same way that Russian ones were in 2022. “[Israeli forces] have killed more than 60,000 people; children, babies [are] starving to death, hospitals destroyed,” Alegria told Spanish radio station Cadena SER. Former France and Manchester United captain Eric Cantona questioned the inaction from football officials while speaking at a fundraising event for Palestine in London on September 17. French footballer Eric Cantona called out FIFA and UEFA for their double standards against Israel. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has brushed aside the calls by indirectly addressing it as a “geopolitical issue” at the FIFA Council on October 2. “Sporting bodies often mirror the broader power politics that are at play [in the world] and so they're only doing what we've seen happen across all walks of political life, in which Israel has not been held to account,” Al-Arian told Al Jazeera. “FIFA has been under pressure for two years, but it [the demand for Israel's suspension] escalated after the latest UN finding [on Israel's genocide in Gaza] and led to a real mobilisation. “But there was a swift reaction from the United States to intervene on behalf of Israel and, basically, issue all kinds of threats against these bodies should they proceed [with sanctions against Israel].” In 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) presented arguments accusing the Israel Football Association (IFA) of violating FIFA statutes with its war on Gaza and the inclusion of clubs located in illegal settlements on Palestinian territory in its domestic football league. The PFA wanted FIFA to adopt “appropriate sanctions” against Israel's national side and club teams, including an international ban. It called on FIFA to ban Israel, but the world body postponed its decision by delegating the matter to its disciplinary committee for review. Al-Arian termed that “a move to keep the bureaucratic machinery moving without making any real progress”. Al-Arian believes the PFA is under “immense pressure” from Israel. “Being under the thumb of an occupying power, the PFA is under tremendous internal constraints, and its decision to advance this issue has often been met with very severe consequences,” he explained. Those consequences, he suggested, have included Israel preventing Palestinian athletes from travelling, and the “Palestinian team from meeting collectively in one place for training”. “International matches have not been held in Palestine for years,” he pointed out. “And this is before we even get into the violence to which Palestinian footballers have been exposed. Many people have referred to it as a kind of occupation subcontractor.” Yet, this isn't the first time that Israel has faced calls for expulsion from football bodies. Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954 and played under its umbrella for 20 years. Israel is placed in Group I of UEFA's qualifiers for the World Cup alongside Italy and Norway. While the Italian government has largely been supportive of Israel during the war on Gaza, the country has witnessed increasingly huge protests calling for a ceasefire and criticising Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government for its refusal to condemn Israel. Norway has pledged to donate money earned from ticket sales at its match against Israel to the humanitarian work of Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF) in Gaza. Both matches are expected to attract protesters outside the stadiums and pro-Palestine messaging inside. “It's not going to be a calm environment,” Gattuso acknowledged on Tuesday, after Italy's training session was also targeted by protesters. According to Al-Arian, while sport has been an avenue for advancing popular causes and protest movements, its “commodification” has put heavy constraints on achieving the objectives of these protests. “The changing relationship of global football over the last couple of decades has been one in which financial and political interests often play a very big role and put a severe limitation on football as a site of mobilisation,” he said. The 1974 expulsion of Israel from the AFC is often cited as an example of Arab and Muslim unity against Israeli atrocities in Palestine. “This also comes after a wave of normalisation efforts where some Arab and Muslim states have normalised their ties with Israel and have maintained diplomatic relations with it throughout the Gaza genocide.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey carried the flag through the 2014 World Cup and slightly beyond, although it's worth noting that Dempsey spent a significant chunk of his international career in a midfield role. Since then, the search for a starting central striker has taken on holy grail-like qualities. Jesús Ferreira, Jordan Pefok, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent and Gyasi Zardes were all given starts during World Cup qualifying. For a time, it looked like Pepi would emerge, but he faded toward the latter part of the cycle -- mostly due to a lack of playing time at club level -- and was beaten to the roster selection tape by Haji Wright. An injury to Sargent at the World Cup, combined with ineffectiveness by Ferreira and Wright, meant that the U.S. didn't get as much out of the position in Qatar as they would have hoped. And while Balogun has gained a bit of daylight between himself and the other potentials thanks to an impressive performance in a recent friendly against Japan, he hasn't secured the spot just yet. 9 for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT at next summer's World Cup, and a statistical comparable player for the five in contention to start up top come June. Initially there was a payoff: he scored in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League final against Canada, and was one of the few players to come out of the 2024 Copa América with any credit. But injuries, including a recurring shoulder ailment that required surgery in December 2024, prevented him from getting a vice-like grip on the position. Balogun's mobility allows him to get behind opposition defenses. The problem has been that the U.S. attack hasn't always proved itself adept at finding him in those positions. The Japan game in September showcased the full repertoire of his skills, and he even demonstrated he can play with his back to goal and hold the ball up if asked. The only doubts surround his durability, as well as getting consistent playing time at Monaco, where the competition for places has been fierce. In the past three years, he has averaged 0.50 goals from 3.69 shots per 90 minutes. Unfortunately, like Jackson, he has also proved to be a pretty poor finisher -- those 0.50 goals per 90 come from shots worth 0.70 xG per 90. Wright is the only U.S. center forward with a World Cup goal to his name. His 6-foot-3 frame allows him to be a force in the air, but he's also quick enough to play on the wing, which he has done on occasion for Coventry and the USMNT. His ability to sniff out chances is impressive as well. His tally from less than 2 yards in last weekend's 5-0 demolition of Sheffield Wednesday showed his ability to be in the right place at the right time. While that was almost three years ago, it's an image that will stick in the memory until he delivers on a bigger stage. Wright isn't quite the passer that Kolo Muani can be, but he scores (0.56 goals per 90 minutes), and he really pushes the ball. That creates a rare profile and makes Kolo Muani the best comp. During last week's conference call in which he announced the U.S. roster for the October window, Pochettino said that Agyemang offers a different profile to Balogun and Wright, one derived from his physical presence -- he's 6-foot-4 -- and his aerial ability. Those traits were on display in Derby County's 1-1 draw with Southampton last weekend, when Agyemang towered over a Saints defender to head home the Rams' only goal of the day. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. But he seems perfectly suited to score an ugly goal late in a match, if necessary, and his passing has seen him earn two assists already in 307 minutes in the EFL Championship. Agyemang's chances of securing a World Cup roster spot are, like so many players, down to health and the numbers game Pochettino will have to play. If Pochettino only opts to bring three forwards, and a player like Pepi is healthy, Agyemang may be one of the final cuts. But his "different profile" may be what gets him in, especially if Pochettino opts for four strikers. Agyemang is excellent in the air (47.5% aerial success rate), and he's happy to draw lots of contact (2.05 fouls per 90 suffered, 0.92 in the attacking third). That makes him awfully Giroud-like, as does quality finishing -- he averages 0.51 goals from shots worth 0.40 xG, and 90% of his shots have come from inside the box -- although his shooting totals aren't huge, and he's not involved elsewhere on the pitch. The 2025 calendar year has seen Pepi struggle with his fitness. He sustained a knee injury in the UEFA Champions League game against Liverpool last January that later required surgery, forcing him to miss last summer's Gold Cup. Pepi's recovery since then has been stop-start; he was brought along slowly by PSV, and looked to be back after scoring twice against NEC Nijmegen last month, but a recent muscle injury has him back on the shelf. While Pepi has several impressive attributes, his movement allows him to sniff out opportunities and get on the end of passes that other forwards might miss. Combine this with his link-up play and you have a forward capable of contributing plenty to the U.S. team. But time is running out for Pepi to make a bigger impression. More than any other forward from this list, Pepi gets himself involved, just as Martínez does. His offensive numbers are inflated by playing in the Eredivisie, but they're still excellent (0.74 goals and 1.36 chances created per 90 minutes), and he's proving to be a reliable finisher (those goals came from shots worth 0.52 xG). He also shows up in defense, averaging a stellar-for-a-forward 5.53 defensive interventions per 90. Rarely has the difference between a player's club form and his international form been as stark as it is with Sargent. The O'Fallon, Missouri, native has hit double-digit goals in each of his past three full seasons with the Canaries in the Championship, and he's well on his way this year with five goals in nine league matches. He does have World Cup experience, and that counts for something, but it may not be enough. Sargent is the most statistically nondescript of the American forwards on this list, but like Kean, he's a willing presser (4.09 defensive interventions per 90 minutes since the start of 2024-25) and above-average finisher (0.56 goals per 90 from shots worth 0.48 xG). His shot totals are always lower than you would prefer, though (2.43 shots per 90), and he doesn't stand out as a passer. Balogun, Pepi, Wright and Agyemang look to be in position to make the World Cup squad, in that order. Four forwards might seem like one too many, but these four all have different profiles that can help the USMNT at various times. Flexibility is vital in a tournament like the World Cup. In terms of who starts, Balogun has the inside track at the moment, but that situation can change quickly. At this stage, it looks like the only way Sargent makes it back to the World Cup is if others get injured or suffer a significant drop in form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's United States men's national team will get a good challenge from fellow World Cup entrants Ecuador at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas on Friday. This Ecuador team hasn't lost in over a year, a September 2024 away loss to Brazil in World Cup qualifying. La Tricolor have since gone 11 games without a loss, all CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with a win over Argentina the latest triumph. Former Elche manager Sebastián Beccacece, a Jorge Sampaoli disciple, is at the wheel of a strong ship, even if Ecuador will be without Moises Caicedo for the window. They'll face Mexico in Zapopan on Oct. 14, and play North American-based matches in November against Canada (Toronto) and New Zealand (New Jersey). Kick off time: 8:30pm ET Friday (October 10)Venue: Q2 Stadium — Austin, TexasTV Channel: NBC Universo (en Español), TNT (in English)Streaming: Stream live en Español on Peacock This team can do some damage even without Tyler Adams, Sergino Dest, Yunus Musah, and Ricardo Pepi. RELATED — How will USMNT line up vs Ecuador? Antonee Robinson is back in the fold despite a surprisingly-limited number of minutes at Fulham, while red-hot Tanner Tessmann of Lyon rejoins the midfield unit. Malik Tillman is also doing so well after a move to Bayer Leverkusen. Christian Pulisic has had a sensational early run at AC MIlan this season even accounting a missed penalty in recent weeks. In-form Haji Wright and Timothy Weah will also be in the discussion to start. The Yanks will not have to deal with several big names besides Chelsea star Caicedo, as Arsenal's Piere Hincapie, Flamengo's Gonzalo Plata, Quito's Carlos Gruezo, and Cremonese's Jeremy Sarmiento are not in the squad. But new centurion Enner Valencia is joined by Strasbourg hotshot Kendry Paez (a Chelsea loanee), PSG's Willian Pacho, and AC Milan's Pervis Estupinan in the squad.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants football to keep an "open mind" about when World Cups are played. "We have summer and winter and in the world if you want to play at the same time everywhere you can play in March or in October," said Infantino, who runs the sport's world governing body. "Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar. The international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with the United States, Canada and Mexico hosting next year's men's World Cup in June and July. Meanwhile, Infantino also confirmed Fifa's desire to further grow the Club World Cup. This drew criticism from footballers and players' unions, who raised issues over player welfare and the number of games adding to a packed calendar. Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango said in July the competition was devaluing football. Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain in New York to claim the title. Now we work together to see how we can make it better, bigger and more impactful in collaboration with the clubs and stakeholders because it will benefit everyone. "I'm biased but it was a huge success from every possible angle. We had an average [attendance] of 40,000 and only the Premier League is doing better. Rabiot should respect employer, says Serie A boss after criticism of overseas games Infantino also warned that football is taking a gamble playing domestic league games overseas. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin doubled down on his body's opposition on Wednesday, saying Europe's top clubs risk "breaking" football if league games are moved overseas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison soccer fans are frustrated at FIFA's new dynamic pricing system for next summer's World Cup. “The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. It's about growing globally, but especially growing the game in its host nations,” Conor Caloia, president and COO of professional club Forward Madison FC, said. That means tickets for a knockout stage match between the United States and Brazil, for example, will cost much more than a group stage match between Jordan and Paraguay. Students — already burdened by tuition, rent and other expenses — will face a deficit to attend the tournament. With ticket prices being so subject to change with dynamic pricing, students' opportunities to attend a once in a lifetime event seem limited. FIFA said “fans will be able to secure group-stage tickets for just $60, while the most exclusive seats will reach up to $6,730 for the final,” in a press release explaining their ticketing system. I have to balance paying for school,” Thiel said. Freshman Eduardo Righetto shared a similar sentiment, adding that “soccer's not about making money, soccer is about being inclusive.” In an age where soccer accessibility in the U.S. is becoming increasingly difficult, the sport faces a challenge in staying inclusive. FIFA said their system deters scalpers and gives fans safer access to tickets. They also announced they are launching their own resale platform, which will allow tickets to be exchanged without “invalid or unauthorised resale.” By adjusting prices in real time based on demand, FIFA is essentially taking the role of scalpers and doing it under the guise of claiming to be “fan-oriented.” He noted that “The World Cup is more important than just making business decisions. As an event that is expected to bring in 6.5 million visitors, Caloia said “there should be a lower barrier for entry for some fans who traveled a long way and have never been to a World Cup match before.” The hope is it connects with a younger generation and gets more kids out playing soccer in the state of Wisconsin,” Caloia said For students that have grown up playing and watching soccer, having the sport's most decorated tournament in their cities should be the culmination of a lifelong passion. Tournament matches will take place from June 11-19th, with the final held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p>
