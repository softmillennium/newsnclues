                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Report reveals Maricopa county spent huge sums on items not connected to court-ordered overhaul of agency The sheriff's office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert's report. It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8m for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court's orders; $1.5m in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3m to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location. For over a decade, Maricopa county taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then sheriff Arpaio's traffic patrols targeting immigrants. The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency's traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit. Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were “inappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.” Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff's office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote. Sheriff Jerry Sheridan's office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. “You will have to double-check now whenever the agency talks about statistics,” Piña said. Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. “The board has confidence in MCSO's budgeting team and will respond accordingly,” Galvin said. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency's also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn't yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data shows a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US's major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns. Warner's office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau's mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities. The senator's office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents' total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS. “When you pull a quarter of the FBI's top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement. Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI's mandate. FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said. German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau's intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don't have capacity to tackle: “That's where the real harm will come.” “The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.” Gray, however, said he was not concerned about a temporary shift while DHS engages in rapid recruitment of new Ice officers. FBI agents, she said, were working daily with DHS on “keeping Americans safe and getting illegal aliens out of our country”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump bragged about his administration seeking to ban flag burning, which is protected speech. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. President Donald Trump bragged that his administration “took the freedom of speech away” from protesters who burn the American flag during a rant against anti-fascists on Wednesday. While speaking about “antifa-inspired terror” in a meeting on the anti-fascist movement, Trump touted his recent executive order instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi to find ways to prosecute people who burn the American flag. “We've made it a one year penalty for inciting riots,” he said. “But what has happened is when they burn a flag, it agitates and irritates crowds — I've never seen anything like it on both sides — and you end up with riots. The order claims that the Court didn't say flag burning was protected if it was “conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action.” In essence, the administration is seeking to redefine an act of constitutionally protected free speech as “incitement to violence,” which does not traditionally enjoy First Amendment cover. Experts have said that this argument is baseless and an extremist effort to undermine First Amendment rights. Despite Trump's remarks on Wednesday, the executive order doesn't include anything about imprisoning people who burn American flags. Indeed, Trump has spent his second term rapidly accelerating the erosion of free speech rights. Trump has imprisoned numerous activists for Palestinian rights and is still trying to deport one of them, Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil. His administration has levied an all-encompassing effort to defund, deplatform, or realign his critics in the media — an effort that many outlets and owners have eagerly complied with. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official who has been involved in previous negotiations between the terror group and the US, said that no Palestinian faction would accept such a plan. But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, unveiled on Sept 29, also called for post-war Gaza to be governed by a transitional authority headed by himself alongside Sir Tony. Mr Trump did not address the Hamas spokesman's concerns during his live-streamed cabinet meeting on Thursday. Instead, he said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons. “There will be disarming,” Mr Trump said, adding that Israeli forces would also conduct “pullbacks”. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.” He also said Hamas had received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza had permanently ended. Details of the hostage and prisoner releases also emerged on Thursday. Israel outlined a multi-step process beginning with the IDF pulling its forces back, once its cabinet had formally approved the plan. After it withdraws to an agreed line – leaving Israel in control of about 53 per cent of the Gaza Strip – Hamas will be required to release the 48 hostages it is holding within 72 hours. Those needing urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation. The release of Palestinian prisoners will take place only after the initial 72-hour period, during which Hamas is to release all Israeli hostages. If any of the dead hostages remain in Gaza, a different, “classified” response will take effect, according to a draft of the deal seen by Channel 12. Israel is already anticipating that Hamas may be unable to locate all of the remains. Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt announced on Thursday that they would take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations were unknown. Thank you for following our live coverage of negotiations over peace in Gaza, and of Trump declaring peace in the Middle East. Palestinian media, citing the Hamas-run Gaza Civil Defence agency, has reported that an Israeli strike in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood has trapped some 40 people under rubble. Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir warned on Thursday that his Jewish Power party would push to topple prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government unless Hamas is ultimately dismantled. “If the Hamas government is not dismantled, or if they only tell us that it is dismantled while in reality it continues to exist under a different guise – Jewish Power will dismantle the government,” Mr Ben-Gvir said. He said that Israel and Hamas had “reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people” and that he had received confirmation that the initial ceasefire would lead to a sustained ceasefire. We will scale up the provision of food across Gaza to reach 2.1 million people who need food aid and around 500,000 people who need nutrition,” said Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. The draft ceasefire deal being reviewed by Israel's security cabinet includes the names of 20 living hostages and 28 bodies to be released from Gaza, Channel 12 reports. Israel had previously expressed “grave concern” over the health of three hostages through to be alive, said to be Israeli hostage Tamir Nimrodi, Nepali hostage Bipin Joshi and Thai hostage Pinta Nattapong, according to The Times of Israel. Donald Trump has said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We're going to create something where people can live ... We're going to create better conditions for people.” Donald Trump said that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons. “I'm not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But... there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces. Donald Trump has said he has agreed to speak to the Israeli Knesset and will do so if requested by officials there. “They asked me to speak at the Knesset and ... I've agreed to if they would like me to,” Mr Trump told reporters as he met his Cabinet at the White House. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby that Hamas rejects Donald Trump's proposal for an interim “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza's administration, headed by the US president himself. But Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan, on which the indirect negotiations were based, also calls for post-war Gaza to be ruled by a transitional authority governed by a board headed by Mr Trump. Donald Trump said he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. “I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there, and we're working on the timing, the exact timing,” Mr Trump said. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told his US counterpart Donald Trump in a phone call that he “deserves the Nobel Peace Prize” for bringing about a deal to end the war in Gaza. Donald Trump says the US will work with Iran so it can “rebuild” its country. Donald Trump has said the Hamas-held hostages should be returned on Monday or Tuesday “I'm going to try make a trip over,” he said. Israel has released details of its hostage handover plan, outlining a multi-step process under the new Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Hostages requiring urgent care will be flown directly to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. The remains of the dead hostages will be received by troops inside Gaza, where a brief ceremony led by a military rabbi will be held before repatriation. Israel's security cabinet meeting – which is being held ahead of the full cabinet meeting to vote on the peace deal – has started after an unexplained delay of an hour and a half. Israel's Channel 12 has reported that the delay was in part caused by ongoing discussions regarding the list of Palestinian security prisoners to be released. Donald Trump was due to hold a cabinet meeting at 4pm UK time following the signing of a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but it is currently delayed. The bodies of Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammad, which were reportedly requested by Hamas as part of a hostage release agreement, will not be included in the deal, an Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN on Thursday. Benjamin Netanyahu's three core goals have been achieved, his spokesperson has said. “We have hit a critical point in this war,” said Shosh Bedrosian, the prime minister's office spokesperson. “From day one in this war, the prime minister laid out three objectives – the return of all of our hostages, the defeat and dismantling of Hamas and ensuring Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.” “All of the prime minister's objectives have now been achieved,” she said. Give @realDonaldTrump the Nobel Peace Prize - he deserves it! Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu held an “emotional” phone call after the first stage of a peace deal was announced between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli prime minister thanked the US president “for his global leadership to make all this possible” in a call this morning, said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian. “It was a very emotional and a warm conversation as both leaders congratulated each other on this historic achievement,” she added. Mr Netanyahu called the deal “a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel”. Gideon S'aar, Israel's foreign minister, said Israel has an interest in “expanding the circle of peace” and normalisation in the Middle East. Iran called on the international community to prevent Israel from violating its obligations in Gaza, its foreign ministry said in a statement, after Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed an agreement to cease fire. “All of our hostages, the living and deceased, will be released 72 hours later, which will bring us to Monday,” said Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian. The Foreign Secretary will hold meetings with counterparts from France and Germany alongside ministers from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and Spain to discuss building consensus on governance of Gaza after the conflict. The high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti will not be exchanged as part of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, Israel has announced. Asked about rumours of his possible release, a government spokeswoman said: “I can tell you at this point in time that he will not be part of this release.” Imprisoned since 2002, Barghouti, 66, has been nicknamed the “Palestinian Mandela”, his popularity amongst Palestinians has not wavered and he he is widely considered the only man capable of uniting disparate political factions. Israel considers him as one of the masterminds behind a wave of bombings in Israel between 2000-2002 during the second Intifada – which he has always denied. He was convicted of multiple murders and given five life sentences. The first phase of a Gaza peace plan “would not have happened without President Trump's leadership”, Sir Keir Starmer said on a visit to India. Asked whether the US president deserves the Nobel Peace Prize at a press conference in Mumbai, the Prime Minister said: “This is a very significant step forward and it would not have happened without President Trump's leadership on this. “What matters now is to press on and implement this.” Earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the ceasefire would come into effect this evening after the deal is ratified in a meeting at 3pm BST. Turkey will take part in efforts to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire in Gaza agreed by Israel and Hamas, president Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday. More than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah – including two months of open war – saw Israel batter the group's arsenal and kill a slew of senior commanders, and it has kept up strikes since a November truce. Requesting anonymity, the official said that “at least 32 people have been arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, six of them before the ceasefire”. A senior Hamas official has said that disagreements over what Palestinian prisoners Israel will release are threatening to derail the deal. “It seems Netanyahu is trying to sabotage the ceasefire agreement before its implementation, by reneging on prisoner release lists in an attempt to derail the understandings,” wrote Mahmoud Mardawi on X. Jack Rankin, a Tory frontbencher who was twinned with hostage Avinatan Or as part of a campaigning push last year, said: “The news that Avinatan and the rest of the hostages will be returning home after two years in Hamas captivity brings long-awaited relief. Until every last one is safely home, we remain firmly committed to advocating for their release.” Luke Akehurst, a Labour MP, added: “I'm overwhelmed with relief that the remaining Israeli hostages, including Evyatar David whose family I have met, are finally coming home two years after the horrors of 7 October 2023. It's interesting to read the latest social media post from Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister. His lengthy message carries a tone of finality – that the war which started on October 7th is at an end. Mr Saar praises Benjamin Netanyahu for showing “steadfastness in achieving all the war's objectives.” Hamas is only likely to fulfil the demands placed on it if it believes Israel will not simply return to battle once the first phase is over. Around a dozen pro-Palestine gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday morning, writes Emily Smith. The Court of Appeal will hear a legal challenge today, brought by Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO, arguing that it is illegal for the UK to continue licensing F-35 parts that can be accessed by Israel. Banging drums and waving flags they chanted, “David Lammy shame on you your hands are bloody too”, “Keir Starmer be afraid, Tony Blair go to hell”, and “UK Government you can't hide, UK Government pick a side”. In September last year, the Government suspended export licences for weapons and military equipment over the risk that UK arms could be used in serious violations of humanitarian law. Israel, the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt will take part in a joint task force to locate the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza whose locations are unknown. Adam Ma'anit, whose cousin Tsachi was kidnapped on Oct 7 and later killed by Hamas, added: “The news that a deal has finally been reached to bring home the remaining 48 hostages is what we have been hoping and fighting for throughout these painful two years. “It's impossible to describe the mix of relief and heartbreak we feel – relief that they may at last come home, and heartbreak that for some, it will be for burial [...] We couldn't bring my cousin Tsachi home alive, so this is a bittersweet day for our family. Ada Sagi, a peace activist held by Hamas for more than 50 days, and Noam Sagi, her son, said: “This is an extraordinary day and our hearts are racing to welcome them home. Trump has shown that the impossible can be made possible”. At last a breakthrough – though as even Donald Trump conceded, these are but “the first steps”. Barring any unforeseen complications, there will be no Israeli hostages left in Gaza by early next week. Aid will be allowed into the shattered territory in meaningful quantities. No wonder they were dancing in the dead of night along Gaza's rubble-strewn streets and on Tel Aviv's Hostages Square. After two years and two days of appalling carnage, first in Israel's kibbutzim and later across the length of Gaza, there is at last cause for genuine hope. Once the hostages are released, it will have lost its final leverage over Israel. A movement that has brought terror to Israel and misery to its own people for decades really now faces only two options: it can declare its own extinction as a meaningful fighting force – preserving an element of dignity and the hope of reinventing itself as a solely political entity – or it can have extinction thrust upon it. “We will celebrate the return of those living and praying for their swift recovery and care, and  we will mourn the returning dead, thinking of their loved ones in their time of grief. Thousands of jubilant Israelis gathered in what has become known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where for two years, families of the hostages have gathered, hoped and prayed for the return of their loved ones. We have been waiting to be rescued by someone. She continued: “So we are really praising this day. I have full faith in Trump and the deal he made which is incredibly wise. I have some doubt about whether all the 48 hostages will come out, that's what scares me most. Not necessarily because Hamas will make it harder but maybe because it will be impossible to find them all. The office of Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that an agreement to secure the release of hostages in Gaza will take effect only after receiving cabinet approval. Once approved, the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners is then set to occur within 72 hours. Israeli hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released by Monday as part of the first stage of a peace deal. An Israeli official told Reuters that 20 hostages are expected to be released Sunday or Monday.Mr Trump, who signalled he planned to fly to the region as soon as this weekend, hailed the “historic and unprecedented event” as the first step towards peace in the Middle East.Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday expressed his “profound relief” for the hostages and for the population of Gaza who have “endured unimaginable suffering” and called on both sides to keep their promises. The first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas has been signed, paving the way for nearly two years of war to end. Nigel Farage hailed Donald Trump's “great achievement” in the Middle East. The Reform UK leader, who has been a personal friend of Mr Trump for almost a decade, said: “Huge congratulations to President Trump and his team. “Real progress between Israel and Hamas is a great achievement.” Mr Farage opposed British recognition of Palestinian statehood last month and refused to rule out “de-recognising” Palestine. Britain will help realise not just the initial phase of the plan to end fighting in Gaza, she said, “but also on the crucial work going forward now on phase two as well”. Speaking to reporters at Hillsborough Castle, she said: “Because that work will continue as nations across the world come together to support a just and lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis alike. With Donald Trump's hostage deal announcement comes hope of a permanent end to the bloodshed in Gaza and agony in Israel. There are still ways this deal could fall through. Israeli negotiators are still working through the list of prisoners Hamas want released, which could include major terrorists with lots of Israeli blood on their hands. And yet, at this moment, battle-hardened Israeli troops are preparing to relinquish territory their colleagues died to capture only a few days ago. Most ordinary Gazans and a majority of Israelis have craved peace for some time. Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, called for all hostages to be released “in a dignified manner” and for a permanent ceasefire to be secured. “The fighting must stop once and for all,” he said. Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, said he hoped that the deal “would be a prelude to reaching a permanent political solution”, leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor, said the developments were “encouraging” and he was “confident” of a solution this week. Pedro Sanchez, Spain's prime minister and one of Europe's most vocal critics of Israel's offensive in Gaza, said the civilian population should now be supported and “the atrocities experienced... never repeated.” Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, called the deal “extraordinary news” and urged “all parties ot respect the measures already agreed upon”. Beijing hopes for a “permanent and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, its foreign ministry said, adding that China's position is that Palestinians should govern the territory in the future. Israel's ultranationalist finance minister said he opposed the Gaza ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas and insisted he would vote against it. Mr Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist party, has opposed previous deals and insisted the war must continue until Hamas is annihilated. He told Sky News: “Israel will be clear that Hamas can't run Gaza in the future but it shouldn't be a permanent Israeli-run area either. “So it has to be in the long term run by Palestinians. Israeli strikes on Gaza continued overnight and into the morning. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, expressed satisfaction Thursday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire in Gaza and thanked Donald Trump's efforts to end the war. It was the sort of dramatic moment on which Donald Trump thrives. The US president was presiding over a meeting about Antifa violence in Left-wing cities, cameras trained on his every move, when Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, passed him a note. “I was just given a note by the secretary of state,” announced the president, hushing his audience, “saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly”. “Very close,” read the scrawl, those first two words underlined. Not with a press conference or an Oval Office address, but with a post on the president's own social media platform. The Israeli military said Thursday it was preparing to pull back troops in Gaza after Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal to free the remaining hostages. As part of this process, preparations and a combat protocol are underway to transition to adjusted deployment lines soon,” the military said in a statement. If phase one of the deal is approved by the Israeli government today, a ceasefire would immediately take effect and Israeli troops would withdraw to an agreed upon line – what the IDF referred to as “adjusted deployment lines”. A senior Cabinet minister said the British Government had “more hope this morning than we've had for a long time”.Pat McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told Times Radio: “We're very hopeful and I think that's a good word to use. If this holds and if this lasts it will be an enormous moment for the world.“It would mean in the short term that the hostages, those alive and those dead would be released, it would also hopefully mean much more aid getting into Gaza to help the people there and in the longer term and this is probably the greatest prize of all a more stable future for Israel for Palestine and for the whole region.“So of course people are tentative, people want to see exactly what will happen, but I think we've got more hope this morning than we've had for a long time.”Asked if Donald Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr McFadden replied: “Well he will deserve credit. Israel's minister for diaspora affairs has expressed cautious optimism towards the deal. Israel's security cabinet and government meetings to approve the first stage of the Gaza deal have been pushed back by two hours. Israel's military will then finish its partial withdrawal from Gaza within the first 24 hours. “All of the Gaza Strip is happy,” Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo told Reuters. Another resident, Wael Radwan, credited Donald Trump and thanked “anyone who contributed even if verbally to stop the war and to stop the bloodshed”. Khaled Shaa told Reuters it was an “historic” and “long-awaited” moment after years of bloodshed. Sir Keir Starmer said it was “a moment of profound relief” that would be “felt all around the world” and particularly by “hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years”. “I am grateful for the tireless diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and the United States, supported by our regional partners, in securing this crucial first step,” Sir Keir said. “This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. Avichay Adraee, the force's Arab spokesman, wrote on X: “For your own safety, refrain from returning north or approaching areas where IDF forces are deployed and operating throughout the Gaza Strip, including in the south and east, until official instructions are issued.” Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, welcomed the peace deal announcement and called on all parties to “abide fully” by its terms. “All hostages must be released in a dignified manner,” Mr Guterres said. The White House has just posted this photograph of Donald Trump: The war in Gaza finally looks as if it is coming to an end. Some of the relatives of the hostages held by Hamas in besieged Gaza are celebrating news that their loved ones could be returning home this week. Maccabit Meir, whose nephews Gali and Ziv Berman have been in captivity since the Oct 7 2023 attacks on Israel, said “there is no happiness like this”. “We were so afraid, and now I'm crying tears of happiness, not tears of fear,” she said in an interview with Israeli television. “That's what I wish for all of us,” she told Israeli media. It is believed that 20 of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza are alive. The White House posted on X: “ALL hostages to be released very soon!” Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had a “very warm and emotional” conversation with Donald Trump, his office said. “The prime minister thanked President Trump for all his efforts and global leadership, and President Trump congratulated the Prime Minister on his determined leadership and the actions he led,” Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement. Donald Trump is reportedly planning to visit Israel on Sunday. Under Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, Hamas would have to disarm, relinquish power and release its remaining hostages. You can read the full details, and the potential sticking points before a final peace deal can be struck, here. Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed a “national and moral victory” for Israel after striking the “first phase” of a peace deal with Hamas. “From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals are achieved,” Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement. This is a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel.From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals… “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point. With Benjamin Netanyahu convening his government on Thursday, it suggests the first hostage handover will not take place until Sunday at the earliest. Donald Trump reportedly reviewed his Truth Social post announcing the agreement between Hamas and Israeli with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, before publishing it. When it came, the announcement could not have been a better illustration of how this White House works. It was done with a post on the president's own Truth Social media platform. It was a post that had been trailed on live television. Hamas has called on Donald Trump to ensure Israel enacts their agreement without delay. Benjamin Netanyahu, hailing a “great deal for Israel”, has said he will summon his government to approve the deal with Hamas on Thursday. He also praised “from the depths of my heart” Donald Trump and his team for embarking on “this sacred mission of releasing our hostages”. “With the help of the Almighty, together we will continue to achieve all our goals and expand peace with our neighbours,” he continued. Some issues still appear to be unresolved following the US president's announcement that Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his 20-point peace plan. Hamas has previously said it won't disarm until a Palestinian state is recognised, and the terror group will be reluctant to disarm until a clearer picture of an independent Gaza emerges, if at all. Mr Trump's plan said an independent Palestinian police force would oversee the region, helped by the president's International Stabilisation Force (ISF). Israeli hostages will be released on either Saturday or Sunday, a source has told CNN. Details about the agreement struck between Hamas and Israel will be revealed later, a senior Qatari official has said. In his statement announcing Israel and Hamas' “first steps” towards peace, Donald Trump did not clarify potential sticking points in his proposed peace plan, which include Hamas disarming and leaving power. Negotiators have been meeting in Egypt for days to hash out Donald Trump's peace plan. Wednesday began with leaks that Hamas was making difficult demands, including the return of the bodies of symbolic figures such as Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed, both former leaders of the terror group. But by nightfall, the Times of Israel reported Arab sources as saying that mediators were planning an agreement that would entail an “immediate” release of hostages. Wednesday's announcement by President Donald Trump marks a major step towards peace in Gaza. It represents a breakthrough on the path towards Mr Trump's ambitious but deliberately vague 20-point plan to end decades of unrest. It will bring home the hostages in exchange for prisoner releases. But in so doing it uncouples one of the key elements of the plan, linking together an immediate ceasefire with a plan for stabilising and rebuilding Gaza, and creating conditions that could open a path towards a Palestinian state. Donald Trump has hailed the “first step” towards peace in the Middle East following negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week. Saying Hamas would release all of its Israeli hostages, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform: The first withdrawal, along with a hostage release, is depicted in purple. It would mean the IDF withdrawing from Gaza City and other key strongholds, where Hamas is under heavy assault. “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce the deal first,” the note read. Mr Trump said: “I think I'll probably go maybe before the hostages are released, or shortly thereafter, pretty much, shortly thereafter.” We're bringing you the latest updates after Donald Trump announced Hamas and Israel have signed off on the “first phase” of a deal for peace in Gaza.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Israel's security cabinet is meeting to vote on the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire plan, to be followed by a full cabinet vote. • A ceasefire will take effect immediately following the Israeli government's approval, according to officials. A senior Hamas official said a “formal declaration” ending the war in Gaza must be made before hostages are released. Potential sticking points remain, including Hamas disarmament and the governance of Gaza. President Donald Trump projected optimism that outstanding issues not covered by phase one of his Gaza ceasefire agreement will be sorted out, even as he declined to take a position on an eventual Palestinian state and acknowledged Hamas may not be able to produce all the bodies of deceased hostages. “There will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there will be a lot of things happening,” he said, referring to arrangements that would force Hamas to give up its weapons and Israel's military to pull back further inside Gaza. “I think it will take place, and I think you can end up with peace in the Middle East, but we have to get our hostages back. And we weren't going to do it at the end. Trump stopped short of saying Palestinians would be allowed to remain inside Gaza, suggesting instead his plans included rebuilding the enclave into a livable area. “We're going to create something where people can live. You can't live right now in Gaza,” he said. And he said he would go along with whatever is agreed to on a Palestinian state, declining to endorse an eventual two-state solution. US President Donald Trump's presentation to Arab leaders at the United Nations General Assembly last month was a key turning point in efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. “You convened a historic meeting, not simply of Arab countries, but of Muslim-majority countries from around the world — including Indonesia was there, Pakistan was there — and created this coalition behind this plan,” Rubio said in highly laudatory remarks at a Cabinet meeting today. And then, of course, our great negotiating team followed up on it,” he said. Rubio also commended Special Envoy Steve Wiktoff and Jared Kushner. “They're an incredible team working together, facing some substantial impediments to even being there this weekend and doing it,” he said. “We call for the immediate release of all hostages, including Nepali national Bipin Joshi, who has been held by Hamas since 7 October 2023,” Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday. Joshi was a student working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped on October 7. Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs voiced appreciation for mediators in negotiating a plan to release the hostages and called for its implementation. We are hearing more from Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who congratulated President Donald Trump on his “tireless efforts” to bring an end to the war in Gaza, after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire plan drafted by US officials. The Egyptian president expressed “deep appreciation” for his US counterpart in a statement today, complimenting Trump's “keenness, endeavors, and sincere efforts towards peace.” El-Sisi hosted three days of talks between Israel and Hamas — brokered by US, Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish officials — in a diplomatic squeeze that saw all parties make a promising step toward a permanent end to two years of hostilities. Substantive discussions have not yet begun over what comes next for the war-torn Gaza Strip, with all eyes on the implementation of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, an Israeli official and another regional source told CNN. Remember: The 20-point proposal for a comprehensive end to the Gaza conflict, which President Donald Trump laid out in recent weeks, includes a specific reference to a Palestinian committee, overseen by an international body and dubbed the “Board of Peace.” It will run Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is ready to take over, according to the plan. The proposal recognizes the aspiration for a Palestinian state and tries to present a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza. “Netanyahu is simply maneuvering and he's just waiting for another opportunity for a loophole somewhere to come back to this. I don't see him taking a decision to end the entire war and to withdraw his forces,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot told CNN's Becky Anderson. Zomlot is a senior member of Fatah, the main Palestinian political movement rivalling Hamas, and a strategic adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Pressed repeatedly on whether he believes Hamas will fully disarm and have no role in Gaza, a key stipulation of Trump's 20-point plan for a comprehensive peace, Zomlot signaled Hamas accepted those terms. Zomlot voiced support for reforming the Palestinian Authority, as laid out in Trump's plan, describing it as a grassroots Palestinian demand. Palestinians in Gaza were pictured celebrating a potential ceasefire in the enclave on Thursday, while others spoke to CNN about the bittersweet prospect of peace after two y﻿ears of brutal war. A small group of Palestinians in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp danced and sang on Thursday, while waving Palestinian flags. One man held aloft a cardboard key, a common symbol for Palestinian refugees, many of whom still hold the keys to the homes their ancestors left behind when Israel expelled them in 1948. “I feel joy,” Nour al-Din Toutah told CNN. Now, I am happy that the war will stop.” “True, there are no houses left,” Toutah continued. “but we will put up new tents and continue our lives.” President Donald Trump pointed to the importance of strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as he praised how countries came together to work on a ceasefire deal in Gaza. “I think the attack was very important on Iran, because let's say that didn't happen, they'd probably, by now, have a nuclear weapon, numerous nuclear weapons, and therefore, even if we signed a deal, there'd be a big dark cloud over it, and it wouldn't be the same thing,” Trump said, during his Cabinet meeting on Thursday. Israel first struck Iran's nuclear facilities on June 13. That same month, the US attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, leaving them “severely damaged.” He added that he'd like to see Iran rebuild its country, but that it can't have nuclear power. Cooper was abducted with his wife Nurit from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. His son Rotem Cooper said today that he is appreciative of the “tremendous effort” to release the hostages who remain in Gaza, including his father's body. “I felt that the Israeli government failed to bring about his release when it was still relevant for him,” Rotem Cooper said. “But we try to put that aside today because really it was even hard to imagine this day, just a week or two ago.” “We're going to get all our loved ones, and we got our soldiers back, and we're looking forward for a better future,” he said in a video released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. US President Donald Trump has indicated that the hostages still held in Gaza are likely to be released Monday or Tuesday. A detailed plan of how the deal should unfold has not been released, but as things stand, here is what we know about the timing: This window is mandated by Israeli law — although it was shortened during the last ceasefire in January. Under the plan, all the living hostages — believed to number at least 20 — are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period. US President Donald Trump said the remaining hostages held by Hamas will be released from Gaza on Monday or Tuesday next week, and that he is still aiming to travel to the region to mark the occasion. “We secured the release of all of the remaining hostages, and they should be released on Monday or Tuesday,” he added. There are places you don't want to be. Trump said he would “try and make a trip over” to mark the moment, including a stop in Egypt for an “official signing” to mark the agreement. Murmurs of cautious celebration permeated through Gaza and Israel overnight. Dark gray smoke cascaded over parts of the enclave and Israeli tanks opened fire earlier today, according to Palestinian officials, despite Trump's demands for an end to the bombing. As Palestinians begin to imagine life after war, the reality of the destruction left in its wake is difficult to shake. We heard from displaced residents in Gaza who told us what they anticipate for the coming days and weeks: “My son was nine years old sitting in the street when a shard struck his eye and he lost his eye.” We will sit in a tent and lament our homes that were destroyed. I will go to my home and put up a tent.” It does not matter whether the war stops.” This girl is an orphan; her father died. She is now like a daughter to me.” Tareq al-Helou, Eyad Kourdi and Abeer Salman contributed to this report. President Donald Trump's negotiating delegation of special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have arrived in Israel after participating in negotiations Wednesday in Egypt, two sources familiar with the matter said. Earlier Thursday they met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The longstanding enmity between Iran and Israel deepened following Hamas' attacks of October 7, 2023, and Israel's subsequent war on Gaza. Earlier this year, the two countries fought in a 12-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire announced by US President Donald Trump. Hamas and Israeli delegates were positioned in two different rooms during the ceasefire talks in Sharm El-Sheikh yesterday, a senior Hamas official said. United States special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo today after an agreement was reached for the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire. El-Sisi called for a ceasefire to begin immediately in Gaza, according to a statement by the spokesperson for the Egyptian presidency. “There are certainly guarantees for Hamas that the war will not return after the exchange process is completed, and we also heard the American president speak directly, publicly, and clearly on this matter,” Hazem Qassem told CNN today. Qassem said Hamas appreciated the efforts of the US administration and President Donald Trump, “and Hamas will implement all that is included in the agreement to ensure a full and lasting ceasefire.” “We as Hamas expressed our thanks to President Trump for helping reach this agreement. It's unclear whether Israel has accepted those adjustments. “Pressure is needed to ensure full implementation of the agreement so that a comprehensive exchange process can be achieved,” he added. An Israeli security cabinet meeting has begun to vote on the first phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, an Israeli official told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to chair a full government meeting to approve the plan later, CNN has reported. An AP photographer zoomed in on the note Secretary of State Marco Rubio handed President Donald Trump mid-meeting, which revealed  a message asking the president to rush the announcement of Gaza deal. At the top of the note it says, “very close,” and then has written that officials need Trump to approve a Truth Social Post.

Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal to bring about a temporary pause to Israel's genocidal slaughter in Gaza and the release of Israeli and Palestinian captives, officials have announced. The deal was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social Wednesday evening, after he first unveiled a heavily criticized 20-point plan to “end the Gaza Conflict” last week. Videos posted online showed Palestinians celebrating in the streets and children dancing in reaction, celebrating a rare moment of relief amid two years of genocide. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Since morning, children have been running through the streets, smiling and celebrating. We heard fireworks bursting across the neighborhood in joy,” Ghada Eyad told Truthout. “Prices are starting to drop, and everyone hopes the deal will succeed. Our only fear is that Israel will not honor the agreement, as happened before. We deserve security, hope, health, education, and the simple right to live with dignity,” Eyad said. However, it is slated to include the release of all 20 living Israeli captives, in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Hamas and associated factions would release Israeli captives within 72 hours of the agreement beginning. After that, Israel would still control 53 percent of the Strip, according to Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian. This operation would be overseen by international aid organizations, not the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a Hamas official has said. That vote is supposed to take place Thursday evening. Video footage captured by Al Jazeera showed Israeli tanks firing at Palestinians trying to return to Gaza City, where Israel has been conducting a ground invasion. Many were skeptical that Israel would adhere to the deal, given Israel's history of breaking ceasefire agreements — including its unilateral ending of the ceasefire deal earlier this year, after its first phase was complete. Indeed, despite Trump's plan giving huge leeway to Israel, certain Israeli demands like disarming Hamas were omitted. “Ceasefire might not retain Gaza to what it was once; [a] flourishing city, nor could it retain the loved ones we lost, not erase our bloodcurdling memories, nor mitigate our unspoken grief, but it will at least stop the carnage, it will pause the horrors and terrors, it will give us a chance to breathe amid endless tragedies, it will give us a chance to grieve properly,” writer and medical student Hend Salama Abo Helow told Truthout. “I wish it will lead to a permanent peace for Gaza,” she said. “After two years of genocide, relentless bombardment, and a life stripped down to survival, this moment feels unreal — like breathing for the first time after being underwater for too long,” Taqwa Ahmed Al-Wawi, writer and student at the Islamic University of Gaza, told Truthout. “Still, beneath the relief, there's fear — fear that this fragile calm could break again, that the sky could once more turn against us.

Bolstered by 12,000 North Korean troops, Russia counterattacked this spring, regaining most of the lost territory and advancing into border areas of Sumy Oblast. According to Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russia has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and injured during the Kursk operation as of July 2025. Belgrade has yet to comment on the statement. In May, Russian intelligence accused Serbia of supplying weapons to Ukraine — a claim the Balkan country has denied. A 2024 Financial Times investigation found that Serbian ammunition had reached Ukraine via third-party intermediaries, albeit on both sides of the war. While Belgrade has maintained humanitarian assistance to Kyiv and pledged support for post-war reconstruction, it has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, despite being a formal EU candidate since 2012.

Serbia's largest Russian-owned oil company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), announced on Oct. 9 that it had not received an extension of its U.S. sanctions waiver, Reuters reported. While Moscow framed the assistance as "centuries-old brotherhood" and praised "the close ties between our countries and peoples," the move underscores Serbia's ongoing balancing act between its EU aspirations and longstanding ties with Russia. Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said three drones were shot down in the Matveyev-Kurgan district by air defense systems. The Kyiv Independent team has introduced a long-requested feature — members can now pay for monthly or annual memberships using PayPal.

"There is a significant risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will actually go to a world war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) denied on Oct. 9 media reporting suggesting it was investigating a possible involvement of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko in a criminal case.

            A French court on Thursday rejected the appeal of a former construction worker found guilty last year of the aggravated rape of Gisele Pelicot, and increased his prison sentence by a year to 10 years, France Info reported.
    


            A lawyer for Husamettin Dogan did not respond to a request for comment on her client's failed appeal.
    


            Pelicot returned to court this week to face the only man, out of 51, who appealed his guilty verdict.
    


            Her husband, Dominique Pelicot, drugged her over nearly a decade, recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious.
    


            Gisele Pelicot, 72, emerged as a prominent feminist figure in France and abroad after waiving her right to anonymity and testifying against her alleged abusers in court — a move that turned the trial into a broader reckoning over the prevalence of sexual violence.

So far, the hundreds of investigations have only resulted in several disciplinary actions. Mr Hegseth has presided over a department in turmoil since taking the reins as US defence secretary 10 months ago, clearing out members of the top brass while senior aides depart en masse. Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, told The Washington Post: “Those in our ranks who rejoice at an act of domestic terrorism are unfit to serve the military people.” Mr Parnell previously said mocking Kirk's death was a “violation of the oath” and “dangerously incompatible with military service”. Following the 31-year-old's assassination in September, Donald Trump announced a crackdown on “radical” Left-wing terrorists, who he accused of fanning the flames of political violence. Critics, including prominent conservatives, warned the policy could be exploited to clamp down on free speech under the guise of “hate speech”. There is an emerging “culture of fear; there's a culture of intimidation and retaliation,” a senior defence official told Politico. “It's better just to keep your head down and not necessarily try to do anything to the advantage of the organisation, because it's very much run from the top down.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president's warning comes as Russia steps up provocations against NATO countries, including a surge of mysterious drone sightings across Europe that have raised fears of hybrid warfare. According to the Ukrainian president, the danger stems from Putin's political need to demonstrate "success" after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. "Mobilization means a definite loss of popularity for the Russian leader. "If there is mobilization, it will be a challenge to Europe. Russia's mobilization in 2022 — the first since World War II — followed military setbacks on the front lines and triggered mass protests and emigration, with more than 261,000 Russians fleeing. While the Kremlin later declared mobilization "completed," no presidential decree officially ended it. Instead of launching another draft campaign, Moscow has depended on financial incentives and recruitment campaigns, offering lucrative contracts to volunteers willing to serve in the army. "Believe me, they definitely didn't want to pay big money for contracts. Such big money as they have been paying all these years. Imagine the price of protecting his personal rating," Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president has repeatedly warned that unchecked Russian aggression in Ukraine could eventually spill beyond Ukraine's borders and into NATO territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest chose not to engage. Three Russian MiG-31 fighters also entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes on Sept. 19, prompting the Baltic country to invoke consultations under NATO's Article 4. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned in July that Russia could be ready for a military confrontation with Europe within the next two years. Tensions between Russia and NATO have escalated since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with growing fears among Western officials that the Kremlin may be preparing for a broader confrontation.

My son has been a political prisoner of Vladimir Putin's system for more than four years now. He is not being held in Russia, however, but in the very country he once led: the Republic of Georgia. He has been silenced and cut off from his people by a regime aligned with Moscow. For nearly a decade, Mikheil stood at the centre of Georgia's transformation. He sought to rebuild the state on foundations of accountability, and like Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, he has championed sovereignty and democracy. My home, Georgia, will not become the next Ukraine. Opinion: Canada should support Russian dissidents in their time of need But Mikheil's sham trial and his detention is not about justice – it's about silencing Georgia's most visible opposition leader. Like Alexei Navalny, Mikheil has been marked for elimination. My son's condition, his imprisonment, and his treatment are not just about one man: They are a measure of what kind of country Georgia will choose to become, and whether its allies still believe in its democratic promise. This persecution is part of a wider authoritarian collapse. Under the leadership of oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream party has hollowed out institutions, silenced civil society, and rigged elections. But for 310 days, Georgians have filled the streets of the capital city of Tbilisi in protest – and last week, during sham local elections, their calls for freedom were met with batons, water cannons, and mass arrests. Mr. Saakashvili, centre, surrounded by bodyguards as he tries to leave a terminal upon his arrival at Boryspil Airport, outside Kyiv, May 29, 2019.Efrem Lukatsky/The Associated Press As a mother, I cannot watch this brutality crush my son and an entire country's hopes. A country once hailed internationally as a democratic success story has fallen into the grips of the world's autocrats; sanctions against Moscow are being ignored; strategic projects are being handed to Beijing, and in the South Caucasus, this alignment has threatened both European and transatlantic security. Analysis: Truth will likely be the last casualty of war in Ukraine The European Parliament has adopted resolutions that condemn Georgia's fraudulent elections and demand accountability. Passing the Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence (MEGOBARI) Act, a package of sanctions and democracy-deepening measures introduced by bipartisan members of Congress and passed the House of Representatives in May, would send an unmistakable message that America stands with Georgians who believe in democracy. International sanctions must extend not only to Moscow, but to those in Tbilisi who carry out the Kremlin's agenda. And most urgently, political prisoners, including my son, must be freed. I do not write as a politician or strategist. I write as a mother who has seen her son give everything but his life for his country. The world must choose: stand with Georgia now and free Mikheil – or watch another democracy fall.

It is announcing the venture as Canada becomes a focus for decarbonization with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration canceling billions of dollars in incentives for green technology. It is focusing on the Pipestone and Two Borders areas southwest of Brandon, Man. “We've looked at a number of sites in that area and what is really going to drive our decision is the geology underneath all of those sites that we're considering, as well as securing the power,” Alex Petre, the company's chief executive officer, said in an interview. Canada could lead in CO2 removal if Ottawa supports market, coalition says Deep Sky expects to finalize the site this autumn so it can drill a CO2 storage well by the end of this year, it said. There is interest among prospective buyers for offsets, Ms. Petre said. “There is a lot of space in the market for any project developer or company that actually takes execution seriously and is able to deliver credits quickly. This summer, Deep Sky started up its Alpha facility in Innisfail, Alta., where it is testing technology deployed by several vendors to examine energy use, overall efficiency, durability and scalability as they remove climate-warming gas from the air. When fully operational, the plant will remove 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Ms. Petre declined to divulge which vendor will supply the gear for the Manitoba project, only that Deep Sky is “working with some exciting front-runners” on next-generation carbon-removal technology.

Council chairman Raymond Brown, Chief of the Canupawakpa Dakota Nation, said in a statement that Deep Sky's project aligns with the Dakota economic development strategy and its vision of a sustainable future. As Deep Sky unveils its investment, the U.S. government has announced it is cancelling billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs and is considering more cuts. Projects on the list include two major direct air capture hubs that received billion-dollar awards from former president Joe Biden's administration. “I would say we had already been working with a number of U.S.-based companies that saw the writing on the wall and now we definitely have an influx,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Lin Fei-fan is Deputy Secretary-General of Taiwan's National Security Council. Tanks moved through urban streets, more than 20,000 reservists were mobilized, soldiers transported weapons via underground metro systems, and simulated strikes targeted critical infrastructure, including the river crossings that link Taipei's urban core. The exercise, in other words, extended far beyond the armed forces and reflected Taiwan's deepening belief that effective deterrence against China relies not only on military modernization but also on societal resilience—the ability of Taiwan's people to withstand the most extreme scenarios or to resist an invasion. Since 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his ambitions to annex Taiwan, by force if necessary, and to seek Indo-Pacific dominance. In response, Taiwan is undertaking a systemic effort to build its “whole-of-society defense resilience,” a comprehensive strategy that combines military preparedness with democratic cohesion, infrastructure hardening, and societal strength. Now is the time for democracies to help preserve peace by investing in Taiwan's resilience. By breaking public morale, degrading infrastructure, and paralyzing decision-making, an aggressor can cripple a state's ability to function before war is even declared. Prior to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for instance, Moscow targeted the country with a steady campaign of hybrid aggression: cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, disinformation aimed at sowing internal discord, economic coercion leveraging Ukraine's reliance on Russia's energy supplies, and political interference exploiting pro-Kremlin forces. These actions were not tactical diversions but rehearsals for a full-scale invasion, designed to soften the target and test its ability to endure systemic shocks. When hostilities began in earnest, Moscow followed a similar script: attacking infrastructure, communications systems, and power plants to create widespread disruption and psychological fatigue. What Moscow expected to be a lightning campaign became a grinding conflict that drained its military strength, triggered unprecedented sanctions, and heightened domestic political risks. Ukraine's resistance has shown that modern deterrence hinges on a society's capacity to absorb shocks and continue resisting under fire. Ukraine, of course, is not the only country with a formidable civil defense. Civilian defense training programs, medical networks, and civic protection rapid-response units are underpinned by a deeper societal conviction that surrender is never an option. Public communication strategies and psychological support structures seek to ensure that civilian morale can withstand prolonged crises, and continuity-of-government planning helps prevent societal breakdown even under extreme pressure. But it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine that served as the wake-up call for Taiwan. The war made clear that peace cannot be secured through appeasement. It also showed how quickly coercion can escalate into full-scale assault and how the survival of a small democracy up against a powerful authoritarian adversary depends on preparations made long before the first shot is fired. Kyiv's resistance against overwhelming odds was a clear lesson for Taipei, which is why, three years ago, then President Tsai Ing-wen's administration quietly initiated preparations across government agencies to integrate civil defense planning into daily life, fortify critical infrastructure, and foster a society prepared mentally and materially for any contingency. The Tsai administration started its national resilience campaign by auditing living necessities and essential supplies, including combat medication. It pledged $18.5 billion over ten years to harden and decentralize the power grid, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. It also started investing in low-orbit satellites to maintain communications if undersea Internet cables are severed. These efforts laid the foundation for a much more structured whole-of-society resilience campaign when President Lai Ching-te took office in 2024. President Lai has made resilience building one of his administration's top priorities. For instance, he has established a national-level committee on whole-of-society defense resilience, which meets quarterly with representatives from the business community, religious groups, academia, and nongovernmental organizations to review the progress of government plans and coordinate across sectors. These efforts have underscored that defending Taiwan is a shared responsibility, one that does not rest solely with the military but must also be upheld by all civilian agencies. To that end, Lai has also tasked the National Security Council with closely monitoring each government agency's progress across five major lines of efforts: civil manpower training and utilization, emergency supplies, energy security, medical capacity, and cyber and communication redundancy. This strategy of whole-of-society defense is far from complete, but these efforts over the past three years demonstrate how decisively Taiwan has progressed from pure military defense to broader societal survivability. The objective is not only to resist armed aggression but also to maintain democratic governance, economic stability, and institutional continuity under pressure, thereby blunting Beijing's use of “gray-zone” and hybrid tactics that fall short of war. Taipei is not merely investing in conventional systems; it is also directing substantial resources toward asymmetric capabilities, including coastal missile systems, mobile air defense platforms, and a growing array of unmanned technologies such as drones and counterdrone systems. In parallel, the Lai administration has also proposed an $18.1 billion special budget package, with $4.9 billion for national resilience supporting the coast guard's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; disaster relief equipment; and the hardening of shelter facilities. This fund, when combined with regular resilience spending and the core military budget, will elevate Taiwan's total security-related spending to meet NATO's defense benchmarks by the end of 2026. Still, resilience cannot be built through procurement alone: it also requires unwavering public support and societal consensus. Many of Taiwan's international partners, including the United States, are also engaging across Taipei's political lines to illustrate the importance and urgency of such preparations. As Taipei's leaders have repeatedly warned partners and allies, Beijing's ambitions extend well beyond Taiwan. China and its allies seek to reshape the global order. Taiwan's ability to resist, therefore, has repercussions far beyond its shores. Strategically, China would gain a forward operating base in the western Pacific, threatening several vital sea-lanes and undermining the United States' ability to meet security commitments to its Indo-Pacific partners and allies. The global economic consequences, meanwhile, would be immediate and severe. As part of a highly specialized global supply chain, Taiwan manufactures cutting-edge components that power today's economy, including the majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Taiwan is also a critical hub for global trade: in 2024, its ports handled a record $690 million revenue tons in cargo, and analysts estimate that roughly half of the world's container ships pass through the Taiwan Strait each year. Any disruption to either this maritime lifeline or Taiwan's high-tech manufacturing would reverberate across global markets, crippling industries from consumer electronics to automotive manufacturing and even defense systems. Taiwan, especially the current Lai administration, understands this reality and has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to building credible deterrence through both defense capacity and societal resilience. Yet as authoritarian powers coordinate more closely—combining cyber-operations, economic coercion, and military pressure across the region—the preservation of Indo-Pacific peace cannot rest on Taiwan alone. Although the Taiwanese people deeply appreciate statements of solidarity, further action is needed. More of the world's democratic leaders should take immediate, tangible steps to enhance security cooperation with Taiwan, including improving the ability of security forces to work together across domains. Taiwan is doing its part with urgency and resolve and is committed to achieving peace through strength by going beyond military readiness to strengthen whole-of-society resilience.

Attorneys general from 20 states have stepped into the dispute between Oregon officials and the Trump administration over the use of National Guard troops to defend Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who have come under assault from protesters in Portland.

Led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, Brenna Bird of Iowa, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, and South Carolina's Alan Wilson, the attorneys general filed an emergency appeal amicus brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 8, charging that Portland police failed to protect ICE agents from “violent rioters,” and that “President [Donald] Trump's deployment of a small number of National Guard members to defend against this lawlessness is responsible, constitutional and authorized by statute.”</p>
