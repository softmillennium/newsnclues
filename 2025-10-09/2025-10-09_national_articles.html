Osama El Khatib, 26, was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail after prosecutors allege he assaulted police officers to help fellow agitators escape arrest. Pro-Palestinian agitators accused of being behind a riot Tuesday are now being charged with "promotion of anarchy" after the melee left several officers injured. The Boston Herald reported that the Suffolk District Attorney's Office on Thursday upgraded charges for all 13 suspects, who are now accused of violating a state law that makes "promotion of anarchy" illegal and is a felony charge, according to court documents. On Tuesday night, between 200 and 300 people participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston that quickly descended into a riot. Thirteen people were arrested after police allege they became violent toward law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers detain a pro-Palestinian agitator Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Boston. "Peace be upon your souls that will one day soar in the skies of your liberated Al Quid's and Al Aqsa, purified from the defilement of your killers," the poster read, according to police. Because of that, police determined there was probable cause that the group "intended to conduct their rally and march in such a way that it induced fear, caused destruction and disruption, caused injury and promoted anarchy." Four police officers were injured during the riot. "This organizing material promoted violence against police and presented an immediate threat to public safety which, combined with the actions of the individuals arrested, provided clear justification for the enhanced charges." Police officers detain a pro-Palestinian agitator Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Boston. Boston police said the group "surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts," adding that "several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face. "As violence escalated," police said, more officers were sent to the area while the agitators "continued to resist dispersal." Officers reported that the rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment. "During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear," the agency said. Police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and obstruction of emergency response efforts, along with a slew of other charges including assault. Osama El Khatib, 26, Roder Atwood, 21, Atalanta Carrig-Braun, 20, Haley MacIntyre, 24, Madeline Weikel, 27, Jacob Pettigrew, 22, Amun Prophet, 25, Laith Hintzman, 19, Benjamin Choucroun, 20, Owen Woodcock, 26, Prahlad Iyengar, 25, Styx Hatch, 19, and Gabrielle Smith, 28, were arrested on Tuesday night. Bail was set on Wednesday and Thursday for those arrested, ranging from $500 to $10,000. Notably, bail for Atwood, El Khatib and Hatch was set at $10,000. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office alleges that Khatib punched police officers to help fellow suspects escape without being arrested. The Boston Herald reported that Atwood allegedly broke a police officer's nose during an assault, according to prosecutors. Suffolk County DA Kevin Hayden sent a message to future protesters in a statement on Wednesday: Remain peaceful or face prosecution. "Peaceful protests happen all the time in this city," he said. But these individuals chose against protesting peacefully, and they are now facing the consequences of those choices." The protest was intended to "flood downtown for Palestine." According to the report, people yelled "F--- you, Nazis" and "BPD is KKK" as they refused to leave the area. Adam Sabes is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General Letitia James decries mortgage fraud indictment pushed by the Trump administration as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.” WASHINGTON (AP) — New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday on mortgage fraud charges in a case that President Donald Trump urged his Justice Department to bring after he vowed retribution on his biggest political enemies. In a lengthy statement, James decried the indictment as “nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.” “These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties,” she added. Both the Comey and James cases followed a strikingly unconventional path toward indictment. The Trump administration last month pushed out Erik Siebert, the veteran prosecutor who had overseen both investigations for months and had resisted pressure to file charges, and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who has worked as lawyer for Trump but has never previously served as a federal prosecutor. James called the decision to fire Siebert and replace him with a prosecutor who is “blindly loyal” to the president as “antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country,” and she said she stood by her investigation of Trump and his company as having been “based on the facts and evidence — not politics.” “We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,” Lowell said in a statement. “When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone — when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted -- it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. She cruised to reelection in 2022 after abandoning a short-lived run for governor. The indictment pertains to James' purchase of a modest house in Norfolk, where she has family. During the sale, she signed a standard document called a “second home rider” in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her “personal use and enjoyment for at least one year,” unless the lender agreed otherwise. In a post on X shortly after the indictment was handed up, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “One tier of justice for all Americans.” Trump has been advocating charging James for months, posting on social media without citing any evidence that she's “guilty as hell” and telling reporters at the White House, “It looks to me like she's really guilty of something, but I really don't know.” The Justice Department has also been investigating mortgage-related allegations against Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, using the probe to demand her ouster, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., whose lawyer called the allegations against him “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.” As attorney general, she sued the Republican president and his administration dozens of times. Last year, she won a staggering judgment against Trump and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. The indictment comes a day after Comey made his first court appearance in his case, accusing him of lying to Congress in 2020.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli tanks are positioned on the coastal road leading to Gaza City as displaced Palestinians gather near Wadi Gaza in the central Gaza Strip, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. President Donald Trump looks on as Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war. After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory. The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza. A second official said the troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center. Two other senior U.S. officials who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations offered more details about forces from other countries and what U.S. troops would be doing. Members of the armed forces of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are expected to be embedded with the team of 200 U.S. troops, according to one of the officials. The exact location of where U.S. troops will be positioned is something they will be working to determine Friday, the other official said. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, highlighted Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command, during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday, saying he had worked alongside special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Cooper — I hear he's been fantastic,” Trump said. In a show of readiness, Cooper told them he could have a command post up and running in the next two and a half weeks. A breakthrough deal to pause the war in Gaza was reached Wednesday after the United States and mediators in the region pressured both Israel and Hamas to end the fighting that has devastated the Gaza Strip, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, sparked other conflicts and isolated Israel. That push sealed an agreement on a first phase that would free the remaining living Israeli hostages within days in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.</p>

A former Minnesota high school girls softball player opened up about losing to a transgender pitcher in a state tournament and how the declining safety of the state has caused her and her family fear. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison responded to dozens of school board members who are urging the state to keep biological males out of girls sports by saying the issue "doesn't harm anyone." A letter penned by more than 40 school board members expressing support for policy revisions to enforce Title IX and protect girls sports prompted the response from Ellison this week. "Letting the very small number of transgender students in Minnesota play on their school sports teams doesn't harm anyone, but segregating them does," part of Ellison's statement read. Ellison said this despite the fact that multiple girls high school athletes in his state have spoken out about how the experience of facing trans athletes has impacted them, and some have even filed a lawsuit over the issue. Three anonymous Minnesota high school girls filed a lawsuit against the state's education agencies in the spring after having to compete against a transgender softball pitcher. One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans pitcher. "This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. Boys should not be able to take girls' spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. Another anonymous player directly called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females. Champlin Park and Eagan players shake hands after the quarterfinals round of the Minnesota Girls Softball State Tournament. "It's really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn't taking rights of girls and women seriously. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong," one anonymous player previously told Fox News Digital. Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears. How do you process those events that happened? Minnesota's education agencies face a deadline Friday from the U.S. Department of Education to change their trans athlete policies. President Donald Trump signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order in February, but Minnesota was one of the first states to openly defy the order. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP) "Exclusion is a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which has protected the rights of trans kids to participate in all extracurricular activities for decades," Ellison's statement continued. "I too am concerned about the Trump Administration's threats to cut education funding for kids across Minnesota, but this matter is before the court right now. I'm fighting to prevent these harmful cuts, stop the Administration's bullying of transgender kids who just want to live their lives in peace, and protect the rights and freedoms of all our students in Minnesota."

In this photo provided by Ann Walter, Ann Walter stands in front of a piece of NASA research equipment attached to a parachute that fell from the sky near her home in Edmonson, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025. In this photo provided by Ann Walter, labels are seen on a piece of NASA research equipment that Ann Walter says fell from the sky near her home in Edmonson, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025. When Ann Walter looked outside her rural West Texas home, she didn't know what to make of the bulky object slowly drifting across the sky. She was even more surprised to see what actually landed in her neighbor's wheat field: a boxy piece of scientific equipment about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, attached to a massive parachute, adorned with NASA stickers. She called the local sheriff's office and learned that NASA, indeed, was looking for a piece of equipment that had gone lost. “It's crazy, because when you're standing on the ground and see something in the air, you don't realize how big it is,” she said. Walter said she soon got a call from NASA's Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, which launches large unmanned, high altitude research balloons more than 20 miles into the atmosphere to conduct scientific experiments. Officials at NASA, which is impacted by the ongoing government shutdown, did not return messages Thursday. A message left with the balloon facility also was not immediately returned. A launch schedule on the balloon facility's website shows a series of launches from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of where the equipment landed. Hale County Sheriff David Cochran confirmed that NASA officials called his office last week in search of the equipment. Walter said she ultimately spoke with someone at the balloon facility who told her it had been launched a day earlier from Fort Sumner, and uses telescopes to gather information about stars, galaxies and black holes. “The researchers came out with a truck and trailer they used to pick it up,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war. This after Trump announced Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready to be moved in to Gaza when they are given a green light. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet late Thursday to approve a pause in the devastating two-year war with Hamas, ahead of a government meeting to approve the release of Palestinian prisoners. Both the ceasefire deal and the release of prisoners are expected to pass with wide margins, even if far right ministers vote against it. US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war. Families of hostages and their supporters rejoiced as news spread that a deal had been struck to free Israeli captives held in Gaza. The families of hostages held in Gaza welcomed US President Donald Trump's peace plan after Israel and Hamas agreed to the “first Phase”. Einav Zangauker, center, mother of Matan Zangauker, who is being held hostage by Hamas, reacts as she and others celebrate following the announcement that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan to pause the fighting, at a plaza known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025, in Washington. Celebrations remain limited, as relief is mixed with mourning and concern for what comes next. WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of gridlock, the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza came together in a matter of days after a deft maneuver — or perhaps a misunderstanding — by President Donald Trump that boxed in the two adversaries. Either way, efforts to wind down the devastating war unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel have seen a breakthrough, and the last 48 hostages — about 20 of them believed to be alive — are set to be returned under the agreement announced Wednesday. Hamas saw hostages more as a liability than asset over time, providing an opening for the deal, according to two senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. One of the officials added that negotiators, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had detected that “Hamas had enough.” Major questions remain, including over governance and reconstruction of a territory that largely has been destroyed as well as whether Hamas will disarm — a key Israeli demand that the militants have not yet publicly accepted. But it appears for now as though the fighting will pause, because at a critical moment last week, Trump took Hamas' very conditional response to his proposal as a yes. In early September, long-running ceasefire talks mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar were at a standstill. Trump's Mideast envoy had walked away weeks earlier, blaming Hamas. The militant group then accepted a proposal that mediators said was almost identical to one approved by Israel, but there was no public response from Israel or the U.S. Hamas stuck to its position that it would only release the remaining hostages in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel had carried out an airstrike on Hamas leaders and negotiators as they had gathered to consider the latest ceasefire proposal in Qatar, a close U.S. ally and mediator. The strike killed five lower-ranking Hamas members and a Qatari security forces member. It infuriated Gulf Arab leaders and angered the White House. Trump quickly went into damage control, seeking to reassure Qatar. The strike united Gulf Cooperation Council countries in a way not seen since the bloc's 1981 inception as a counterweight to post-revolutionary Iran. It caused the seven GCC members, which include Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to rethink what had been relatively moderate stances on Israel and led some to believe Israel was now a bigger threat to regional security and stability than Iran, according to Arab diplomats familiar with conversations at the bloc's last summit in Doha. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Such a shift could have had profound implications for the Trump administration's anti-Iran push, which relies heavily on being able to respond from two major U.S. military bases in Bahrain and Qatar. The president said it was his “most important meeting.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that efforts “took a turn” at that meeting, with the U.S. building a coalition behind Trump's plan. Trump unveiled his 20-point peace plan less than a week later — during Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House this year. Trump also made a show of trying to soothe angry Qatari officials. Trump dialed up Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and spoke to him before handing the phone to Netanyahu. Rubio said Trump's negotiators then stepped up their efforts through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt to get Hamas on board, while Trump held phone calls and meetings with world leaders. The U.S. plan calls for Hamas to release all the remaining hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, to give up power in Gaza and to disarm. Trump said the militant group had days to think it over and issued a stark warning. “If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote on social media last week. Hours later, and ahead of schedule, Hamas submitted its response. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025, in Washington. But it said other elements of Trump's plan required more negotiation and offered nothing about disarming, a key Israeli demand. Israel could have vowed to press ahead with its invasion of Gaza City or even expand it. But when the Hamas response landed late Friday, Israel was largely shut down for the Sabbath, and Trump was first to respond. “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!” he wrote on his Truth Social site. If he misread Hamas' response, no one was in any mood to correct him — neither Hamas, which had sidestepped his ultimatum, nor Netanyahu, who would not want to be seen as spoiling the president's deal. It made no mention of the fact that Hamas had not accepted some key demands. There was room to negotiate, and a desperation on the part of the international community, key Arab players — and likely Trump himself — to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and destabilized the region. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Thursday that he and many other Israeli officials were skeptical about Hamas' heavily qualified acceptance. Trump “not only seized an opportunity but created an opportunity by saying, ‘Well, it's positive, and let's move from there.' In an interview with Fox News host and ally Sean Hannity after announcing the agreement, the president said he hoped it would help repair Israel's international standing. “I spoke to Bibi Netanyahu just a little while ago,” Trump told Hannity, using the Israeli prime minister's nickname. “I said, ‘Israel cannot fight the world, Bibi.'</p>

Fox News host Laura Ingraham discusses Illinois suing the Trump administration over its deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on 'The Story.' Lawyers for President Donald Trump and the state of Oregon clashed Thursday before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals over Trump's push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, a high-stakes showdown marked by sharp accusations that the president's actions were unlawful and unnecessary. A three-judge panel, composed of two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee, seemed deeply skeptical of the case made by Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin, including her assertion that Trump's descriptions of the violence in Portland were hyperbolic and "untethered from reality." Many of them focused on specifics, including dates of protests and number of arrests, in asking why — in the state's view — these conditions failed to meet the standard needed to justify Trump's deployment of the National Guard. "I'm not sure even President Lincoln would have been able to authorize the use of force right now" if his actions were to be scrutinized under the "much more stringent reviewability standard" implied by Oregon here, Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee, interjected loudly, one of several times he cut off Chaffin as she attempted to answer the court's questions. Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington Tuesday. Chaffin argued that the protests in Portland are a far cry from a definition of a "rebellion," one of two conditions Trump needs to satisfy to meet the legal pretext for National Guard deployment. Rebellions "are unusual and extreme emergencies," Chaffin said, noting that the bulk of agents' complaints on record are focused instead on them being short-staffed. Administrative difficulties "are not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other U.S. city," Chaffin added. Still, the court's two Trump appointees took a much more critical view of the state's case during oral arguments, which lasted roughly 90 minutes. A Federal Protective Service officer stands guard in front of demonstrators as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement draw hundreds to the ICE headquarters in South Portland, Ore., Sept. 28, 2025. Justice Department attorney Eric D. McArthur, meanwhile, spent the bulk of time reiterating the two tenets of the Trump administration's core arguments in deploying National Guard troops. McArthur argued that Portland meets the criteria of an "active threat," regardless of the weeks that passed between Trump's June memo authorizing the federalization of National Guard troops and his September attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. Asked by the Clinton-appointed Judge Susan Graber whether Trump could hypothetically rely on any violent event that "post-dates" the administration's National Guard mobilization to justify its deployment, McArthur said yes. "I think we can rely on later evidence to show there was a colorable factual basis for the president's determination," he told judges for the 9th Circuit. "It demonstrates the very kind of risk that can materialize at any time with this sort of violent crowd." The court did not specify when it planned to issue a ruling. In the meantime, dozens of National Guard troops — roughly 200, as lawyers testified Thursday — remain just outside the city's limits, pending possible deployment.

Taylor Swift was not exactly subtle in one of her latest songs. The song included lyrics that just about everybody could assume were about fiancé Travis Kelce's anatomy that "opened [her] thighs." Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce during the 2024 U.S. Open Sept. 8, 2024, in New York City. Swift also sings that the "redwood tree … ain't hard to see" and said her beau had "new heights of manhood," a play on the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's podcast title with his brother, Jason. Jason's wife, Kylie, just like about everyone else, gave a listen to her future sister-in-law's album, and she said she is a fan. She even put "Wood" in her top three favorite songs on the album. But she was understandably a little bit uncomfortable. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce pose together, touching the brims of their hats. Do I need that much detail, specifically about my brother-in-law? Probably not," she said on the latest edition of her podcast. Travis discussed the album on the newest "New Heights" episode, and Jason pitched the idea of hosting a live listening party for their father. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August. The album has been a massive hit even before it was released. It had over 6 million pre-saves, the most ever on Spotify. Its lead single, "The Fate of Ophelia," also broke the record for most streams in one day. Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court judge on Thursday cast doubt on Oregon's challenge to President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Portland, saying there was no evidence the deployment was unlawful despite state concerns about presidential overreach. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now,” said Nelson, a Trump appointee. That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.” The panel, comprised of two Trump appointees and one appointee of former President Bill Clinton, heard oral arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a lower-court order blocking the Guard's deployment to protect a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that had been shuttered amid months of protests and sporadic violence. Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur told the panel that the president has broad constitutional authority to safeguard federal property when local authorities fail to maintain order. Chaffin's arguments drew sharp questioning from both Trump-appointed judges on the panel. Nelson called her description of the protests as “largely sedate and generally peaceful” “clearly erroneous,” noting that demonstrations had repeatedly disrupted federal operations. Chaffin replied that those conditions no longer existed and urged the court not to treat events from three months earlier as justification for a standing military order. The three-judge panel did not indicate when it would rule, though they indicated they would attempt a decision as soon as possible. Even if the Trump administration prevails, a separate district court order remains in place blocking any National Guard deployment in Portland until at least Oct. 19. That order pertains to a secondary lawsuit joined by the state of California after Trump reassigned federalized guard troops in Los Angeles to Portland. U.S. District Judge April Perry, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not indicate when she would make a decision but said she would be back at the bench at 4:30 p.m. local time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia has handed down an indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James, bringing one charge of bank fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter. The investigation into James follows allegations that she misrepresented a Virginia residence as her “principal residence” in 2023 in order to secure favorable mortgage terms while serving as New York's top law enforcement official. The investigation was prompted, in part, by a referral from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who alleged James “falsified records” to obtain preferential financing. The indictment of James, a Democrat who has clashed with President Donald Trump in high-profile legal battles, follows months of speculation about whether prosecutors would be willing to bring a charge in response to Pulte's allegations. The single count of bank fraud stems from the same allegations first raised in April, when federal housing regulators accused James of making false statements on mortgage loan applications for a Norfolk, Virginia, property. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Jamar K. Walker, an appointee of former President Joe Biden. At the time, prosecutors expressed skepticism that they had sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. “The scheme involved falsely representing the [Virginia] Property as a secondary residence to obtain favorable mortgage terms, while using it as an investment property with no intended or actual personal occupancy or use by her,” the five-page indictment, signed by Halligan, reads. In August, a New York appeals court found the nearly $500 million penalty imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron in the civil fraud case was “excessive” and threw it out, though Engoron's underlying verdict that Trump was liable for fraud was allowed to stand. In response to targeted acts against him, like the civil fraud case, Trump has repeatedly called for the prosecution of political adversaries, including James Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). “We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote on Truth Social less than a week before Comey's indictment. Democrats swiftly denounced the indictment as an act of political retaliation. “For years, Letitia James has illegally weaponized her office to conduct a political witchhunt against Democrats' political opponents most notably President Donald J. Trump,” she added, saying James “now faces allegations of committing the very type of financial misrepresentation she baselessly pursued against President Trump.”</p>

While this doesn't quite mean the war is completely finished just yet, it appears to be an earnest attempt by Israel and Hamas to begin ending two years of bloody conflict, destruction, and despair. Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. The fate of the hostages has also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, and Portugal to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's UN General Assembly. Now we'll find out if the peace can hold, and if so, what the “day after” actually looks like. Wednesday's deal means, the parties say, that all Israeli hostages who are still being held in Gaza will be returned, beginning with those still living, estimated to be around 20 people, as soon as Monday; the remains of the dead Israeli hostages (approximately 30) will reportedly be returned in phases afterward. In exchange Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, approximately 1,700 of whom were captured during the current conflict. Israel also says its army will retreat to an agreed upon line in Gaza as the first part of its withdrawal from the territory. But most importantly, much is still unknown about the terms of the agreement that Israel and Hamas have reached. We don't know whether Hamas has agreed to completely disarm. We also don't know the extent to which Israeli troops are withdrawing from Gaza, or the timing of that withdrawal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is meeting Thursday to vote on accepting the deal, and the ceasefire has not yet begun; Israeli strikes on the Strip were reported even as celebrations unfolded across both Gaza and Israel. This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future. It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024 that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. The true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by the Biden administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq. Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments. In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year. But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. The answer isn't just about parties dividing on policies. A lot of animal abuse is falling through the cracks. Many of his newest supporters are having doubts.</p>

The control tower at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport will have fewer than normal controllers from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET along with Bradley International Airport in Connecticut from 4:25 p.m to 8:45 p.m. The Washington center, located in Virginia will not have a normal number of staff from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and the Indianapolis center will be short staffed 12:30 a.m. These areas usually deal with planes flying at higher altitudes. Newark Approach control, which handles flights approaching or departing the airport, will be short staffed from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. And Orlando International Airport Approach will be understaffed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Earlier Thursday, a facility in Fort Worth, Texas was also short-staffed for about an hour. The cause of the staffing problems was not immediately apparent, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said early Thursday on Fox Business a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work. Every staffing problem reported does not always cause delays since controllers can take other actions, like routing flights to airspace with a normal complement of controllers. Wednesday six FAA facilities had staffing shortages, including the control towers at Denver International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where about a quarter of the flights were delayed. “It's a small fraction of people who don't come to work that can create this massive disruption, and that's what you're seeing rippling through our skies today,” Duffy said. He said normally about 5% of delays are caused by short staffing, but now it's more than half of the delays. “I think what's happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,” Duffy said, blaming Democrats in Washington for the shutdown. Monday night, the Hollywood Burbank Airport control tower closed when too many controllers there called out sick. Tuesday, flights in Nashville were delayed and part of the air traffic control operations had to be shifted to another facility across the state when workers took unscheduled time off. If controllers keep not showing up, Duffy will fire them, he said. “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don't show up to work… they're the problem children,” he said. Controllers are considered essential employees and have to work during the government shutdown, despite not being paid. “There are processes and procedures in place to deal with the inappropriate use of sick leave,” the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said responding to Duffy's threats. The government shutdown has not had a “significant impact” on Delta Air Lines' operations, CEO Ed Bastian told Brad Smith in an interview on “CNN Headline Express.” There were barely any flight cancellations the first week of October, with Delta completing nearly 100% of its flight schedule, Bastian said. Delays were also infrequent, with the airline running on time for 90% of flights. “As everyone's well aware, the air traffic control system is already understaffed, so I think it's difficult to speculate at this point in time, ‘is it more understaffed than normal? “We'll keep our customers posted as always, but I do not anticipate any meaningful issues here.” Southwest Airlines, which has a large operation in Nashville, Burbank and several of the other cities hard hit by recent staffing problems, said it is monitoring the situation. Southwest must remain “vigilant in ensuring operational reliability” as air traffic controller staffing is “dynamic and could change rapidly at any ATC facility,” airline leaders wrote Wednesday in a company-wide memo obtained by CNN. “When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation's aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, in Chicago, a judge is hearing arguments as the city and state contend that President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the city. • The courtroom showdowns: The hearings could determine the fate of Trump's National Guard deployments in two major American cities, potentially setting a precedent for future federal intervention in local law enforcement and civil liberties. • Portland: National Guard troops remain blocked by several court orders from deploying in Oregon. State officials and the Trump administration argued in a California court today over whether troops from other states should be allowed to deploy in Oregon. • Anti-ICE protests continue: Rallies outside ICE facilities in Broadview, a Chicago suburb, and in Portland go on despite large perimeters and heavy security. The Trump administration is tying planned deployments in Chicago and Portland to the increasingly tense protests after weeks of pushing an effort to fight crime in what the president has described as violence-ridden Democratic-led cities. An appeals court hearing on whether the Trump administration should be blocked from federalizing the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland has concluded. President Donald Trump should first consider more law enforcement options to deal with protests in Portland, Oregon, before sending a military presence, the state said in arguments before an appellate court Thursday. Federal law enforcement has plenty of officers who could respond to any perceived threat before the need for the National Guard, said Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin. ”We have a ton of law enforcement agencies under the President's control,” Chaffin said, adding that responding to threats “is their job. ”The problem that I have with this argument, that I'm just trying to struggle with is, the President gets to direct his resources as he deems fit,” Nelson said. ”It just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say, ‘No, you need to do it differently. An appeals court judge who strongly challenged concerns from the state of Oregon about the legality of National Guard deployment to a Portland ICE facility also acknowledged worries about a dangerous precedent being set. Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said he was not “trying to diminish” concerns to arguments that the National Guard's deployment is a “slippery slope” when pushing back on several arguments from Oregon's attorney. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don't have any evidence of that right now.” “All we have is a document that says, ‘We have a federal facility under attack or that violence has forced to close down, and we want to protect it,'” Nelson added. “That doesn't strike me as a glaring overuse on its face.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused local and state law enforcement officials she met with in Portland of being “dishonest” and “disingenuous” in remarks during Thursday's Cabinet meeting at the White House. Noem visited Portland Tuesday, meeting with local officials and touring an ICE facility just days after a Trump-appointed judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon. The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers. National Guard troops remain blocked by court orders from deploying in Oregon as state officials and the Trump administration argue in a California court today over whether troops from any state should be allowed. In attempting to focus on the legal definition of rebellion used to justify the National Guard's deployment, Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin said rebellions “are unusual and extreme emergencies.” “If we're comparing it to an invasion from a foreign power, that's something that goes to the heart of the safety of our country,” Chaffin said. A situation should be considered a rebellion when circumstances arise “which may be vital to the existence of the Union,” she added. Chaffin argued that any difficulties federal agents have experienced carrying out the laws are due to a lack of personnel more than violence. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said there doesn't need to be an “actual rebellion” for President Donald Trump to federalize the National Guard, and their deployment is lawful. As the state of Oregon began its argument in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals over whether President Donald Trump can federalize the Oregon National Guard to deploy to Portland, an attorney almost immediately got into a dispute over the severity of protests at an ICE processing facility that has been the site of protests for months. Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee to the appellate court – shot back when Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin cited the lower court's finding that protests at the Portland ICE facility were small and peaceful, calling it “clearly erroneous.” Chaffin said the judge who put deployments on hold found “that the Portland ICE facility protests were small, less than 30 people, largely sedate and generally peaceful.” Unless you're trying to limit it to certain time periods, we have evidence in the record that there were protests as much as 200.” The Trump administration says protests at an ICE building in Portland justify a military response because they have “significantly impeded” federal officers. DOJ attorney Eric McArthur said the Trump administration believes the National Guard can be mobilized in response to violence and threats against federal agents. Justice Department attorney Eric McArthur argued that deploying troops in Portland is legally justified, saying 115 federal officers have been sent to protect the city's ICE facility. Those officers, part of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service — which specializes in protecting federal buildings — have been stretched too thin in guarding the facility, McArthur said, and “are not equipped to deal with this kind of ongoing, sustained unrest.” An appeals court panel quickly got into legal details of when a president can take control of the National Guard during Thursday's hearing over efforts to deploy troops to Portland, Oregon, asking a Trump administration attorney what he thinks the word “rebellion” means in the law. Leaders in Oregon and Portland have said the unrest outside an ICE building in Portland does not constitute a riot that could give President Donald Trump power to federalize the Oregon National Guard. “The statute doesn't actually require any rioting, contemporaneous or otherwise, in order for the president to be able to invoke this statute,” said McArthur. An attorney for the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago rejected White House arguments for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago as “audacious.” He went on to say, “There is no rebellion in Illinois,” an attorney for the state said. “That is such an audacious claim,” the attorney said. A military presence is necessary at an ICE facility in Portland in order to “contain the violence,” according to Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur. “For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,” McArthur said. A federal judge in Chicago is hearing from both sides as the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois argue President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority and should be blocked from deploying troops in the Windy City. Unlike Portland, the judge in the Chicago case declined to issue a temporary restraining order immediately, noting she didn't have time to go through hundreds of pages of legal filings. “At no point did I, nor did the Building Security Committee authorize or request the National Guard's assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall said in a statement to CNN. Remember: Members of the Texas National Guard have already deployed in the greater Chicago area, an official said Wednesday night, as lawyers prepare for critical court hearings on federalized troops. With its history of protest and progressive politics, Portland, Oregon, has been a target of President Donald Trump since his first term. Trump said he would be watching Portland closely since 2018, when demonstrators set up outside an ICE facility in the city. As protests have continued in the city this year over the administration's immigration actions, Trump escalated his response by calling in National Guard troops. National Guardsmen were seen Thursday morning patrolling the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois. Overnight, Texas National Guard troops were seen entering the building. Some wheeled luggage while others carried riot shields as they arrived at the facility. Troops from the Texas National Guard were seen entering the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, near Chicago, overnight, as a federal judge is preparing to hear arguments on whether a military callup is legal. Video taken by a freelance journalist showed men in fatigues with a Texas National Guard patch and carrying riot shields and luggage entering the facility, which has been a flashpoint for clashes between protesters and federal law enforcement. The Texas Guardsmen are now deployed on their official mission of protecting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel in the Chicago area, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday night. Texas troops were seen earlier this week staging at an Army training facility in Elwood, about 40 miles from the ICE building. Greg Abbott earlier this week showed guardsmen carrying riot shields as they prepared to board a transport plane. Judge April Perry declined earlier this week to issue an order that would block the National Guard deployment in Chicago, saying she first wanted to hear arguments from both sides at a hearing Thursday. As major courtroom decisions loom today to determine whether National Guard deployments will go forward, the key question is: Who gets to make that decision? “We've seen reasonable people disagree about whether the situations … on the ground in Portland, in Chicago, constitute an emergency or not,” Honig said. For context: Texas Guardsmen have started their mission in the Chicago area, according to US Northern Command. Meanwhile, National Guard troops are still blocked through court orders in Oregon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All the hostages still held in Gaza are set to be released as soon as Monday under the first phase of a ceasefire plan agreed by Hamas and Israel, US President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday. More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014, when he was killed and his body taken to the strip. The government previously expressed “grave concern” over their fates. Women, children and men over the age of 50 were released under previous ceasefire agreements. One woman, Inbar Hayman, is among the 26 in Gaza who have been declared dead. Of those still believed to be living or whose status is unknown, 11 were taken from the Nova music festival. Eight were kidnapped from several kibbutzim, or small communities, in southern Israel, including two foreigners who worked on Israeli farms. Twin brothers Ziv and Gali Berman were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Kfar-Aza during the October 7 terror attack. Speaking to CNN in February, their mother Liran Berman said other hostages who had been released had told the family the brothers were alive and separated from each other. Sharon, Yuli and Emma were released under a ceasefire agreement in November 2023, while Yehoud was freed earlier this year. Eitan Horn was visiting his brother Iair when they were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz. A propaganda video showing him saying goodbye to Eitan was released by Hamas in March. “Since Iair returned to us, he hasn't stopped thinking about and working for Eitan and all the other hostages he met in captivity who are still there,” the family said in a statement. Gritzewsky, a Mexican national, was released on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal, while Zangauker was left behind. Omri Miran, then 46, was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family's home in kibbutz Nahal Oz. In April 2024, Hamas put out a video showing Miran, alongside American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who has since been released. Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David are childhood best friends who were kidnapped together from the Nova Music Festival. In February 2025, Hamas filmed Gilboa-Dalal and David watching other hostages being released, posting the video to Telegram. Gilboa-Dalal's brother Gal told CNN this amounted to psychological torment. She revealed that they had been separated during the abduction. Alon Ohel, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, Elkana Bohbot, Segev Kalfon, Maxim Herkin, Eitan Abraham Mor, Bar Kupershtein and Rom Braslavski were also kidnapped from the Nova festival. Ohel, Ohana, Bohbot, Braslavski and Mor were all seen helping wounded victims at the site before their abduction. Cohen appeared in a Hamas propaganda video posted online on March 1 this year. Otherwise, I wouldn't recognize him because you couldn't hear his voice or see his face,” she told CNN. Bipin Joshi, a Nepali student, was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. His family said earlier this week that a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity was recently recovered by the Israeli military in Gaza. The video is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi's kidnapping. Israeli officials had previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi. Besides Joshi, four other foreign nationals are still held in Gaza, three of them from Thailand and one from Tanzania. Three of the four – Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania – have been declared dead by the Israeli government. An unnamed Thai citizen is believed to be alive. According to one source, that is thought to be the case for between seven and nine of the deceased hostages, while another source put the figure at between 10 and 15. Inbar Hayman was kidnapped from the Nova festival. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced in December 2023 that she had been killed by Hamas while in captivity. She remains the only female hostage still in Gaza. They include several Israeli soldiers, including two who were dual US and Israeli citizens – Omer Maxim Neutra from Long Island, New York, and Itay Chen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine will nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he provides long-range Tomahawk missiles and helps secure a ceasefire with Russia. “During our most recent meeting, I didn't hear a ‘no.' What I did hear was that work will continue at the technical level and that this possibility will be considered,” Zelensky said of his meeting with Trump at the United Nations General Assembly late last month. “We will nominate him on behalf of Ukraine.” Trump has boasted about his role in ending seven wars around the world. That's now tentatively up to eight after his administration helped broker the first stage of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday. We're close to settling an eighth, and I think we'll end up settling the Russia situation, which is horrible.” “So I don't think anybody in history has settled that many,” he added. However, he may win one in the coming years. Zelensky, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, believes Trump deserves it if he can help the Russia-Ukraine war come to a peaceful close. Earlier this week, Trump said he had “sort of” decided on whether to send the requested Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, but first wants to know how the weapons will be used.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Political strategists are raising questions about California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter's campaign to succeed Gov. Porter's odds of winning the primary tanked by 20 percentage points, according to some betting markets, and analysts widely agreed it was a “bad night” for the candidate, as critics accused her of partisan, entitled, and generally unlikable behavior. But Elizabeth Ashford, a Los Angeles-based strategist who was chief of staff to former Vice President Kamala Harris during her during her time as California attorney general, suggested that while she doesn't see the interview as “a deal breaker moment at all,” campaigns will jump at the opportunity to leverage such incidents “anytime you have, you know, a human moment.” She added that it could send Porter's campaign spinning. All five of Porter's Democratic rivals, as well as Republican challenger Steve Hilton, used the incident as an opportunity to dig into Porter's lead, issuing statements attacking her for “being afraid to answer simple questions,” “hiding from the press,” and “excluding any votes.” Lingering doubts about Porter's candidacy could aid liberal momentum to push Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) into the race, spelling danger for her in the crowded primary battle to win voters. “Katie Porter is clearly running far left of center,” he said. “So I think Padilla could come in, and he's got a carpet niche that would be left of center.” He also made headlines in June when he was detained during a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, garnering him support from liberals frustrated by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Challenges from Padilla and other rumored Democratic contenders, such as businessman Rick Caruso, might not be a problem if it weren't for California's open primary system. Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff suggested that if controversy over Porter's likeability and media style persists, he believes “it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary,” giving rivals such as former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra a boost. “I do see [the CBS interview] perhaps not being a big deal,” he said. “At the same time, now, if there's  several other more current examples of this, where she continues to have moments like that, I do think it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary, especially because it is a competitive primary.” The gubernatorial candidate is seen yelling, “Get out of my f***ing shot!” at a staff member who wandered into the background of an interview video she was recording, in resurfaced clips obtained by Politico. For Democrats disillusioned by Porter, “there are other options here, and there's still time,” Shroff said of alternatives, arguing that the race remains wide open as the primary election remains eight months away. Clink suggested that the open primary system spells warning signs for Porter's belief that she can pull off a win without the help of any Republican voters. Exclusive from @melmason on Katie Porter, who berates a staffer and tells her to “get out of my fucking shot!” while recording a video with the Biden administration.The video + story — scooped by @politico👇🏼https://t.co/WENFsRlkwC pic.twitter.com/47dQ3n6nWJ With the state leaning majority-Democrat, Porter believes she can pull off a win. When asked what she would do if the race ended up between her and another Democrat, in which case the winning candidates would need to secure support of some moderates and Republicans, Porter replied, “I don't intend that to be the case. Shroff warned the CBS kerfuffle was “not really a one-off,” pointing to other public incidents in which Porter has struggled to manage her public image, including when she lost the Senate primary last year to Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and accused him of rigging the election. “I remember she kind of left on such a sour note in her race against Adam Schiff,” he said. “And definitely interesting to … make the point that if she's willing to do that on camera with a journalist from CBS … what is she like behind the scenes? “Porter's next few interviews are going to be heavily scrutinized, and I think that she would be wise to do the opposite of what Kamala Harris did. She should get out and do as many interviews as possible so that she buries the bad CBS interview with decent interviews with other reporters,” Clink said. Former California state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa attacked his rival for trying to exit the tough interview. You can't just throw up your hands and refuse to answer as Katie Porter did,” he told the Washington Examiner. “California faces a lot of big problems, and voters deserve a leader who will answer the questions and speak the truth about how to solve them.” As governor, I'll serve every citizen of this state — whether they voted for the President or not, whether they vote for me or not. It's not about what the politicians ‘need,' California needs a governor focused on improving people's lives, not another career politician looking out for political insiders and allies. “For Katie Porter, I think it just highlights the fact that she has very thin skin,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The agency said in an updated shutdown contingency plan that it was furloughing more than 34,400 of its 74,300 employees on Wednesday. A prolonged shutdown could cause bigger problems as the October 15 tax filing extension deadline approaches, said Maria Ramos, the National Treasury Employees Union chapter president in Austin, Texas, where she works in paper tax return processing. An emergency notification system, typically used for weather alerts or building emergencies, sent out a recorded message telling staff that “as of October 8th, you are considered furloughed” unless you receive notification from your manager, Ellis told CNN. Well into the late afternoon, some people still didn't know their status, she said. At the IRS and other agencies, some employees must continue working without pay during the shutdown, while other workers are furloughed without pay and stay home. But a third category, “exempt,” has added to the confusion. Employees classified as exempt will continue to work and receive pay, though union leaders say no one has explained where those funds are coming from. The IRA originally gave the agency roughly $80 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funds, to use over 10 years to improve customer service, expand enforcement, update technology and hire more staff. Ellis said some employees who had been considered essential in previous shutdowns were furloughed this time around, including employees responsible for opening and scanning mailed tax returns and payments, critical paper-processing work. “To my knowledge, all of those people were furloughed,” Ellis said, adding that this was not the case in past shutdowns. “We were already short-staffed after months of resignations and layoffs,” she added. Also, some revenue agents and tax examiners in the small business division, as well as some local taxpayer advocates, will remain on the job, among other staffers. Among the significant activities that will cease are taxpayer services, such as responding to taxpayer questions outside of the filing season, and non-automated collections. In Memphis, where roughly 4,500 IRS employees make up the agency's third-largest union chapter, Gibson Jones, the local NTEU union chapter president and IRS employee, told CNN that the “vast majority” of workers were furloughed Wednesday, leaving only “very limited skeleton crews” across IRS business units. “Customer service staff weren't furloughed on the IRS Memphis campus in previous shutdowns,” he said. “This time, the vast majority of them have been sent home.” According to Jones, about 150 revenue agents and tax collection officers have also been furloughed. “We're in a government shutdown over money,” Jones said, “and the people who could be out there collecting more money for the federal government have been furloughed. Jones said he expects taxpayers to start feeling the impact immediately: longer hold times on phone lines, more dropped calls, and delays in refunds or processing as the October 15 extension filing deadline approaches. Normally, Treasury's human resources officials coordinate with the union to explain which employees are considered essential. The unions have been completely cut out of this.” He added that it's unclear what criteria are being used. In Atlanta, NTEU union chapter president, Denise Wells-Gomez said employees received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off.” Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used, and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave). One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren't present the day they decide to do an audit. However, during a staff meeting, the director of the Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave, if approved by their manager. She said she drove an hour and a half in a carpool to the IRS office, waited around for four hours, and then was told to go home. “At a time when we're not going to be getting paid, people could've used that gas money,” Ramos told CNN. “That was time wasted and money spent that didn't need to be spent just to sit around for four hours and find out you were furloughed.</p>
