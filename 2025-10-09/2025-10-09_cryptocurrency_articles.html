                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, recent legislative proposals such as Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could significantly impact the landscape of crypto payroll regulations across the world. This article examines how tax breaks for modest Bitcoin transactions may not only boost adoption in the U.S. but also prompt similar changes in Europe and Asia. Let's dive into the potential global ripple effects of this legislation and what it could mean for businesses in the shifting digital assets landscape. Bitcoin, in particular, has paved the way for a rapidly growing digital asset market that has piqued the interest of both individual and institutional investors. As businesses increasingly adopt cryptocurrency payments, understanding the regulatory environment is key to successful integration. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has grown from an obscure digital currency into a widely recognized financial asset. Its decentralized structure and promise of high returns have made it a popular choice. However, the intricacies surrounding its use, especially regarding taxation, have impeded broader acceptance. Central to cryptocurrency is blockchain technology—a decentralized ledger documenting all transactions across a network of computers. This technology fosters transparency and security, making it an ideal foundation for digital currencies. For businesses exploring crypto payroll solutions, a solid grasp of blockchain's function will help navigate the complexities inherent in cryptocurrency transactions. Easing the tax burden on everyday transactions may lead to heightened Bitcoin adoption among U.S. businesses. This U.S. tax exemption could prompt similar reforms in Europe and Asia. As American companies start using Bitcoin for payroll and other payments, European regulators may feel compelled to consider comparable measures to maintain competitiveness. This could create a more favorable environment for crypto payroll, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that often grapple with regulatory hurdles. The proposed exemption could simplify compliance for SMEs utilizing crypto payroll. This clarity may promote wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments, particularly in tech-savvy industries and among remote teams. While the proposed tax exemption offers many advantages, it also presents regulatory hurdles. If some jurisdictions adopt exemptions while others do not, compliance could become a major issue. Defining Scope and Limits: Clearly establishing thresholds for "small transactions" and differentiating personal from investment activities will require careful legislative design to prevent loopholes. Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could transform crypto payroll regulations not just in the U.S. but globally. By simplifying tax compliance for small transactions, this legislation could drive increased cryptocurrency payment adoption among businesses. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform. The BNB Chain memecoin market faces turmoil with sell-offs, allegations of manipulation, and liquidity issues. Senator Lummis's Bitcoin tax exemption could reshape global crypto payroll regulations, easing compliance for SMEs and boosting adoption across markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proposal — a detailed outline describing an approach to DeFi, first reported by Politico — suggests that a firm or individuals that handle customer needs on the front end of a DeFi operation should have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and be regulated as a broker. The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include "everyone in crypto," according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant. "Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable," he argued. "The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas," Mersinger said in a statement. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto. This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as "anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end." However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as "sufficiently decentralized" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter. The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin, have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over. However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. Roger Ver is reportedly close to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over criminal fraud and tax charges filed last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK government has announced plans to appoint a “digital markets champion” as part of its drive to modernize the way financial transactions are conducted by adopting blockchain-based shared ledgers. News of the new role was announced by Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby, in a speech on Wednesday at the Digital Assets Week conference in London. It's not yet clear who might be in line for the job, but the individual will need to be an industry figure with enough knowledge and connections to get competing agencies – the Bank of England, the UK Treasury, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – to agree to a common framework. The government is also setting up a new group, the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce (DEMAT), to co-ordinate the UK's move away from paper-based share certificates. In July, the government set out the arguments for change in its Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy policy paper, saying today's financial processes are slow, costly, and rely on manual systems, which together stifle financial innovation. Adopting blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) would, the paper argued, allow financial assets to exist as tokens on shared ledgers, overhauling markets by lowering costs, dramatically speeding up transactions, and increasing transparency. “The ‘tokenisation' of assets could deliver a step change in market efficiency, for instance by enabling real-time data sharing which could improve transparency and lower operational costs,” the paper said. “More broadly, it could enable a fundamental reimagining of the way financial markets operate, creating infrastructures that support both existing and new forms of asset issuance, transfer, and ownership.” Despite this, the UK is at risk of falling behind its international peers in ways that will soon hinder London's preeminence as a financial hub. Additionally, Swift, the global financial messaging network, recently announced that it would introduce blockchain-based ledger as part of its platform, an initiative it has been testing for several years. The organization is developing a prototype shared digital ledger to accelerate cross-border payments in conjunction with 30 global financial institutions and blockchain company Consensys. This will eventually extend the Swift platform to validate transactions and enforce rules governing smart contracts, the organization said. “You may think, ‘Wow, aren't those opposites? And they're asking us to play a bigger role,” said Swift CEO Javier Perez-Tasso at the Sibos 2025 conference. We need a champion in this space to reduce some of the frictions that exist,” Demidova told Computerworld. “We haven't been moving fast enough in comparison to other markets such as the EU, which has a consensus on what MiCA is.” The UK needs to develop a clear set of priorities as soon as possible, especially over how it plans to support asset classes such as stablecoins, she said. Right now, there is a lack of clarity over whether these can be used for payments. The UK government has recognized this need. Lurking in the background to all this is the security of technologies that are still unproven under real-world conditions. “These are new, emerging technologies, and this brings some potential cyber security issues that we may not know about. Legacy ERPs weren't built for immutable, token-based workflows,” commented Dan Silverman, co-CEO at data intelligence company, Balcony. “Tokenization isn't just financial, it's foundational for secure, verifiable data exchange across public and private systems,” he added. The risk is that the effect of uncertainty on businesses is ignored in favor of institutional interests, not least because countries are adopting these technologies at different rates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of BTC fell by around $4,000 as on-chain activity spiked, even though institutions kept buying. When Bitcoin hit two successive all-time highs earlier this week, it caused a little consternation in the community. This took place despite a lack of retail activity, with institutional investors powering the growth. Crucially, these corporations continued making huge purchases while BTC's value was inflated. In other words, there have been fears that these inflows could profoundly alter market cycles. Bitcoin fell around $4,000 in the last 24 hours, spawning a frenzy of crypto liquidations. A few key factors suggest that retail Bitcoin traders caused all these liquidations. For one thing, ETF issuers continued buying BTC at elevated rates, and the products are seeing huge inflows. Analysts have already identified some of the most likely causes for Bitcoin's retreat to $120,000, which triggered these liquidations. They seem like pretty standard price actions; long-term traders are taking profits, holder accumulation rates sparked low confidence, etc. Furthermore, there are even signs that BTC could rebound in the near future. What new narratives can help explain this behavior and enable accurate predictions? Whether Bitcoin keeps going up or down, these questions should be at the forefront of traders' minds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital Currency Group subsidiary Yuma, focused on scaling the decentralized AI network Bittensor, is launching an asset management division, according to an announcement on Thursday. According to the announcement, the asset manager will kick off with two flagship strategies that invest in Bittensor subnet tokens: the Yuma Subnet Composite Fund, designed for market-cap weighted exposure across all active subnets, and the Yuma Large Cap Subnet Fund, focused on larger subnets. The Bittensor network is a decentralized, blockchain-based network that enables collaborative machine learning and AI model development across specialized subnets. The network rewards validators and miners in its native TAO token for contributing computational resources. Yuma, founded in November 2024, said earlier this week it is "actively validating" over 120 subnets and mining on others. It has also "provided capital to 15 subnet operators" and has onboarded firms like BitGo, Copper, and Crypto.com as validator partners. On Tuesday, TradeBlock's co-founders Greg and Jeff Schvey, brothers, joined Yuma as chief operating officer and chief technology officer, respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. Uganda has launched one of Africa's most ambitious blockchain initiatives to date, a $5.5 billion real-world asset tokenization project paired with the country's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot. The tokenized portfolio will span sectors such as food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade. The move comes as neighboring Kenya advances its Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, marking a significant moment for digital finance regulation and infrastructure development across East Africa. According to GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley, the initiative represents a major step toward linking blockchain technology with tangible development outcomes. “We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,” he said. BREAKING: MPs have passed a Bill granting investigators the power to shut down social media accounts spreading what they term is Harmful Content before it circulates. It will be accessible through smartphones and USSD technology, allowing over 40 million Ugandans to transact using a secure, mobile-first digital currency for the first time. The Karamoja Green Industrial and Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), managed by Diacente, is at the core of this rollout and has been designated a national flagship under Uganda's Karamoja Regional Development Plan (2025–2035). The project is expected to create over one million jobs and could generate up to $10 billion in annual exports, reinforcing Uganda's position as a regional digital and industrial hub. Diacente Group Chairman Edgar Agaba added that the partnership “goes beyond infrastructure,” emphasizing that integrating tokenization and CBDCs into Uganda's economic roadmap will help attract new capital, empower local industries, and drive sustainable growth. Meanwhile, Kenya is making progress on its own crypto regulation efforts. If approved, the bill will move to President William Ruto for signature. Local industry group VACC noted that the legislation places Kenya among Africa's top five nations advancing comprehensive crypto regulations, opening doors for innovation and investment in the region's growing digital economy. Sub-Saharan Africa has emerged as one of the fastest-growing regions for digital asset adoption, according to a September report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Ghana and South Africa have completed pilots, while Egypt plans a rollout by 2030. Statista projects that Africa's crypto user base could surpass 75 million by 2026, generating an estimated $5.1 billion in revenue. Ripple recently expanded its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, across the continent through partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card. Kenya's proposed Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill is viewed as a potential model for regional frameworks, while Mauritius, Botswana, and several Central African nations have already passed formal crypto laws. Despite rapid growth, over 80% of intra-African payments still rely on foreign banks, showing the demand for local digital payment infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DappRadar noted BTC took the spotlight, but app building and activity continued. NFT are also taking on new roles, linked to tokenization and DeFi. DappRadar noted apps were highly active in Q3, despite BTC taking the spotlight. In the latest quarterly report, DappRadar noted new trends emerging, especially tokenization, a return of NFT, and DeFi making new records of value locked. However, DappRadar warned only a few decentralized games are purely about play, and most have some form of DeFi mechanics. More specific use cases, such as SocialFi and AI, lost momentum, resulting in only a small increase in overall activity. Virtuals Protocol changed its relevance from Q2, when it attracted 10K active wallets daily and rapid AI agent minting. The new wave of SocialFi apps like The Arena, Layer3 and OnchainGm  lost 50% of their activity, down to 1.57M in daily active wallets. Some of the NFT activity is niche, and has not brought back mass adoption. Additionally, the items bought and sold go at much lower prices, as a fun activity rather than a life-changing investment. Still, 2.14M wallets interacted with NFT, each holding on average over 8 items. The type of NFT traded also changed, as game-based items were less active. Some of the activity with NFT is linked to OpenSea incentives for an eventual native token airdrop. Older blue-chip avatar collections also changed hands, with a special focus on the Pudgy Penguins collection. OpenSea increased its activity by 88% in Q3, while Blur grew its activity by 178% against the previous quarter. Moonbirds turned into one of the hottest collections after Yuga Labs divested some of its assets and sold them to the Orange Cap Games team. Moonbirds may soon have its native Solana token, BIRB, as the team announced plans in early October. The Moonbirds shift to a tokenized collection follows the general trend of integrating NFT into DeFi protocols. The CryptoPunks collection is also used for its underlying value in minting and burning PUNKSTR tokens. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story was originally published by the Daily Montanan. The bill, Senate Bill 265, carried by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, defines a number of buzzwords in the digital asset space — such as network token, blockchain, and decentralized network — in state law. It also provides the framework for uses of network tokens and what boxes businesses must check off to do business in Montana. Under the new Innovation Act in Montana, companies that issue digital tokens — used to power decentralized services like computing, data storage and media streaming, among other things — can register with the Commissioner's office as non-securities assets, making Montana among the first states to do so. States have been ‘at the forefront' of efforts to regulate cryptocurrency, experts say Cryptocurrency tax revenue negligible since launch of Colorado program Legislators propose bills to back data centers, legislate blockchain technology Zolnikov said network tokens have the ability to decentralize so many parts of industry, essentially cutting out middle man companies, which he said fits a Montanan ethos. In a press release, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Jim Brown said the new law charts the course for “responsible innovation.” “This law gives entrepreneurs the certainty they need while ensuring Montanans are protected. SB 265 strengthens both our business climate and our national reputation as a state that embraces innovation while striking the right balance,” Brown said. Speaking to the Daily Montanan this week, Brown said that one of his office's main roles is to protect Montana consumers from “fraudsters and bad actors.” “Not only in the insurance area, but in financial institutions, which includes digital currencies and anything related to the blockchain,” Brown said. On the consumer protection front, Brown has been advocating on a national level to strengthen laws in the digital space. In a letter sent last month, Brown and his counterparts with the North American Securities Administrators Association asked for changes to a proposed federal market structure legislation that he said “is a gift to fraudsters,” by limited actions states can take to investigate and charge crypto scammers. The Association is also behind legislation called the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act which would cement state authority to prosecute fraud involving digital assets. … and we don't want to create a system where smaller bad actors fall through the cracks.” Brown said with the explosion of digital assets in recent years, his office has seen a parallel increase in fraudulent claims within the digital space. Last year, his office received nine complaints of digital asset fraud, totaling more than a million dollars. On Tuesday, Brown's office issued a press release about an individual charged in Missoula County for defrauding investors, including several elderly Montanans, through a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. According to the release, an Idaho resident and two uncharged co-conspirators set up a “fund” of more than one million dollars from investors purportedly invested in cryptocurrency. “By the end of the century, (blockchain technology and digital assets) are going to be so integrated in our economy and our way of life that people won't even recognize how we operated financially in 2025,” Brown told the Daily Montanan. We can't have it be the wild west out here.” Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force holds first meeting Co-chair Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, said he envisions the task force as “a big brainstorming operation.” “So many people think about crypto when they think about blockchain, but it's so much more than that, so much more than the financial end of it,” Lammers told the task force. “But, it has implications in agriculture, fraud, chain of custody, record keeping — all kinds of things we could apply this baby to.” One area of discussion on Monday revolved around Wyoming's approach to digital assets, which has included launching their own state-backed cryptocurrency. “We might not be looking at having Montana be the issuer of a stablecoin, but we will look at a model of what's made Wyoming a leader in blockchain technology … we'll look at how Montana can be an innovator like Wyoming is, maybe even going beyond what they've done.” Arizona cracks down on crypto ATM scams that cost residents $177 million When you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Filings and enforcement actions remain on hold, leaving investors waiting. Current market odds, such as those from Polymarket, say the shutdown may only conclude after October 15. This delay temporarily slows institutional entry into crypto markets, particularly through ETFs, but it does not diminish long-term momentum. Experts are now looking for altcoins positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity returns. Sei is gaining attention from institutional players, including BlackRock and Brevan Howard, who have launched tokenized funds on its network. Price still lags behind network growth, offering potential upside as market attention shifts back to altcoins. Solana is positioned to benefit from upcoming ETF approvals and growing adoption. Solana's strong infrastructure and ETF catalysts make it a top choice for near-term accumulation. Market sentiment shows oversold conditions, setting XRP up for gains toward $4 once regulatory clarity returns. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Afghanistan's recent nationwide internet outage underscored a critical weakness in the world's leading decentralized blockchains: their dependence on centralized internet providers that remain vulnerable to government intervention and technical failures. The country suffered a near-total internet shutdown that lasted about 48 hours before connectivity was restored on Oct. 1, Reuters reported. While blockchains aim to provide people with a public, censorship-resistant network for value transfers, their reliance on centralized internet providers makes these use cases challenging during outages. “The Afghanistan blackout is not just a regional connectivity crisis: It is a wake-up call,” according to Michail Angelov, co-founder of decentralized WiFi platform Roam Network. The nationwide internet and mobile data services outage affected about 13 million citizens, according to a September report from ABC News. Iran has also been facing internet censorship issues since the start of its conflict with Israel. The Afghanistan blackout adds momentum to calls for decentralized connectivity solutions that remove single points of control. Along with the project's incoming eSIM implementation, this enables devices to automatically select the best available internet options, including public carriers, a private mesh or a peer-powered local network. “Roam users can see in real time what works where: No guesswork during outages,” which ensures a connection even when “centralized backbones fail,” said Angelov World Mobile is the largest decentralized network with 2.3 million daily active users, spanning over 20 countries, according to data from worldmobile.io Helium is the second-largest decentralized wireless network, with over 190 countries and 112,000 total hotspots worldwide. It claims to have over 1.3 million daily users on its decentralized network. Users are incentivized to host a hotspot for internet coverage through Helium (HNT) token rewards. Advocates say blockchain technology's promise of financial freedom and censorship resistance cannot be fully realized until the underlying internet itself becomes more distributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK General Regulatory Chamber's Upper Tribunal (UT) has ruled in favor of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which appealed against a 2023 decision that it could not fine Clearview AI over GDPR violations. The case relates to an ICO fine issued in May 2022 after the regulator accused Clearview of scraping Brits' images uploaded to social media before adding them to a database used to train its AI algorithms. It also ruled that the FTT incorrectly applied the law when deciding that Clearview's data processing fell out of scope based on the fact that it was doing so as a competent authority for the purposes of assisting law enforcement clients. In its appeal of the ICO's decision to fine it £7.5 million ($10 million, or $9.43 million at the time) in 2022, Clearview heavily leaned on Article 2(2)(a) of the UK GDPR to clear its data processing activities. This is the provision that precludes foreign data processing for law enforcement purposes from regulatory penalties. Clearview said when appealing against the fine that its service is an internet search engine offered only to non-UK/EU law enforcement and national security agencies, whose uses are out of scope of the regulations per Article 2(2)(a). The Information Commissioner accepted this was valid. Under the principles of international law, one state cannot seek to compel another to meet a legal demand, i.e. a foreign power investigating a Brit for a crime committed on its own soil should not attract interference from the UK, or penalties under the UK GDPR. It ruled that Clearview's processing was related to behavior monitoring of UK residents, per Article 3(2)(b), and was still bound by UK GDPR regulation despite being carried out on behalf of its foreign law enforcement clients. The UT, citing case law and previous statements from the EU's Advocate General, said that this exclusion only applies to the UK state itself, and not a commercial entity such as Clearview selling services to foreign governments. John Edwards, the UK's Information Commissioner, said: "The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge. "The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK." Jack Mulcaire, chief legal officer at Clearview AI, told The Register: "Clearview AI is disappointed by this ruling which misapplied the law to improperly seek to regulate how American companies serve the US government. We do not offer any product or do any business in the United Kingdom. We intend to file an appeal." On that point, Jon Baines, Senior Data Protection Specialist at Mishcon de Reya LLP, commented: "It's worth noting that it was a very strong, three-judge bench (with President of the Chamber Mrs Justice Heather Williams DBE as lead judge) and the judgment very much has the feel of one the bench has tried to make as 'appeal-proof' as possible."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former Israeli intelligence official is asking a court to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to turn over records of foreign bank accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and overseas property as part of his defense against a $150,000 defamation lawsuit filed by the prime minister. But is it really possible to access such information, especially in the supposedly anonymous cryptocurrency market? In his court filing, Levi said he's received reports of witnesses who claim to have seen cash deliveries to the Netanyahu family, both inside Israel and abroad. The demands arrive at a moment when tracking crypto has become far more realistic than most people assume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, and projects that connect real-world value with blockchain utility are catching investors' attention. Among these innovations, Avalon X (AVLX) stands out as one of the best RWA crypto projects to emerge in 2025. The idea of real estate tokenization has transformed how people view property investment. By converting tangible assets into blockchain-based tokens, Avalon X simplifies access to one of the world's largest markets. All smart contracts within the ecosystem are independently audited by top-tier security firms such as CertiK, ensuring trust, transparency, and protection from vulnerabilities. What sets Avalon X apart from many presale coins is its deep connection to tangible assets through Grupo Avalon, a property developer with over $1 billion in ongoing projects. The AVLX token follows a deflationary model, creating scarcity while offering passive income opportunities through staking. Holders can also enjoy property-related rewards and exclusive access to partner developments. This thoughtful combination of tokenization and blockchain infrastructure showcases why Avalon X is being recognized among the top RWA crypto contenders, offering a more structured approach to decentralized real estate participation. Mark your calendars for Friday, October 10th, when a live AMA featuring an Avalon X representative will take place. You can share your questions early through the Google Form for a chance to get featured. Its blockchain-powered model introduces fractional ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in projects that were once reserved for high-net-worth individuals. By partnering with Grupo Avalon, with a development portfolio valued near $1 billion, Avalon X moves beyond promises—it delivers infrastructure that supports real-world integration. In addition, the $1M giveaway offers ten winners a chance to claim $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens. For those exploring where to buy presale crypto, Avalon X has made the process seamless. AVLX tokens grant access to rewards from real-world projects, discounts on partner properties, and staking opportunities that promote long-term ecosystem growth. However, it is essential to note that AVLX tokens are not shares or ownership instruments, but rather a utility component within the platform's blockchain architecture. This integration of blockchain technology and real estate tokenization reflects a growing trend among top RWA crypto projects, where decentralized systems meet tangible investment assets to build sustainable financial ecosystems. Projects like Avalon X are redefining how blockchain connects with physical assets, making real-world investing simpler, safer, and more transparent. As one of the best crypto presales 2025, Avalon X bridges two massive industries—crypto and real estate—by enabling everyday investors to participate in institutional-grade projects. Its combination of verified audits, tangible backing, and community engagement reflects the broader movement toward 100x RWA crypto innovations that prioritize trust and accessibility. With blockchain unlocking new layers of efficiency and inclusion, Avalon X demonstrates how tokenization could reshape the global financial landscape—one property at a time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This resurgence comes as Web3 projects gain traction and investor interest in crypto grows. Recent trends suggest an increasing focus on ICO compliance, market risks, and new opportunities. This marks a significant shift from the subdued environment of past years. The momentum is largely driven by projects focusing on decentralized technologies, which promise efficient and transparent investment opportunities. As major tech firms and startups embrace Web3, ICOs are once again becoming a favored method for raising capital. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been proactive in refining rules to ensure investor protection and market stability. ICO projects must now adhere to tighter compliance requirements, including thorough financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks. This regulatory framework helps foster trust and transparency, encouraging more investors to participate in the ICO market. The UK's regulatory stance is crucial as it balances encouraging digital innovation and maintaining stringent oversight. Web3 is at the forefront of this ICO revival, with significant funding directed toward decentralized applications. This shift is reshaping how fundraising trends are developing, allowing smaller projects equipped with cutting-edge technology to compete on a global scale. This alignment with modern tech trends ensures that the ICO sector remains dynamic and forward-looking. For instance, a piece on Bloomberg provides insights into how these activities are structured. The current ICO climate presents diverse opportunities for those willing to engage with new technologies and digital strategies. The focus on regulatory compliance alongside innovative funding strategies marks a promising future for ICOs. Moving forward, staying abreast of regulatory changes and investment trends will be crucial for success in the dynamic ICO landscape. The UK is refining its regulations with a focus on investor protection and market transparency. The FCA enforces measures like financial disclosures and anti-money laundering checks to ensure a safe investment environment. Key trends include a focus on decentralized Web3 technologies that integrate AI and blockchain. These trends are making ICOs a preferred method of funding due to their transparency and innovative potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BISMARCK — The Bank of North Dakota and its core banking services provider, Fiserv, announced a partnership Wednesday, Oct. 8, to develop the state's own stablecoin, which will be called the Roughrider coin. On paper, they aim to offer the benefits of cryptocurrency — high-speed, low-cost and decentralized transactions — with the stability of traditional assets." Fiserv COO Takis Georgakopoulos said stablecoins allow for essentially instantaneous transactions as compared to existing options like wire transfers and ACH transfers. Wire transfers can typically be accomplished in the same day. ACH transfers can take 1-3 business days to complete. Making the announcement during an event held at Bismarck State College, Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the Roughrider coin will be developed in the new financial environment created with the passage of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a framework for payment stablecoins by requiring they be backed with high-quality assets, as opposed to more volatile cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Initially, Morgan said, the Roughrider coin will be used for things like bank-to-bank movement of money using Fiserv's digital assets platform. Eventually, he added, the Roughrider coin could be used for other types of transactions, though he did not go into details. When the Bank of North Dakota takes future steps, Morgan said, it will do so "diligently, thoughtfully, step by step. Georgakopoulos said that by developing its own stablecoin, North Dakota will have greater say in how it may be used compared to going with an established stablecoin. You are intermingled with all of their other clients," Georgakopoulos said. "You want to be able to set your own rules, and there is a whole host of capabilities you can bring to the table that you wouldn't be able to do if you went with an established provider." He said one area of flexibility relates to the custody of real assets that are moved to stablecoins and how those deposits might be shared between banks "in ways you guys decide make sense." The Industrial Commission consists of North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Attorney General Drew Wrigley and  Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring. In announcing the new coin, officials stressed that in addition to requiring that stablecoins be backed with high-quality assets, the GENIUS Act also requires things like mandated disclosures and audits, ensured reserve transparency and rules for permitted users.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) are sitting on their final technical supports, with traders warning that one decisive move lower could trigger a cascade of liquidations across the altcoin market. Solana trades around $222, struggling to hold its rising trendline support near $219 after a sharp rejection from $225. Broader structure on the 4-hour chart forms a large symmetrical triangle. A breakout above $240 would shift the technical narrative toward $253 and signal renewed strength. Marcantonio of GalaxyHQ compared Solana to a "digital Panama Canal," predicting it could dominate tokenized securities trading by 2030. XRP trades near $2.81, testing its ascending trendline support that has held since mid-July. Deeper loss of momentum could send XRP toward $1.89, which served as the base for its summer rally. For bulls, recovery depends on reclaiming $2.92 and then $3.10, where descending trendline resistance caps upside attempts. Only a daily close above that level would restore short-term bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward $3.50. Supports like $219 on Solana and $2.80 on XRP are not just chart levels — they are the fault lines of altcoin leverage. Billions in open interest sit tethered to these ranges, meaning a single breach could unleash cascading liquidations across exchanges. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)  is battling resistance near $4,500 and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is trying to regain $122,000, creating a backdrop where majors may dictate whether altcoin floors survive. The convergence of major-cap stability and fragile altcoin supports makes this inflection point unusually decisive for market structure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans in 2024 lost nearly $250 million to scams that used Bitcoin ATMs In June 2024, when Fran Bates entered a Fort Worth-area gas station, she thought the voice on the other end of the phone was from her bank, and she thought a machine where she was in the process of feeding more than $23,000 would keep her money safe. And on that summer day in Texas, the 85-year-old Bates became one of the tens of thousands of Americans who fall victim each year to scams perpetrated using bitcoin ATMs. The scammer convinced Bates that she was in danger of losing her savings, she recalled, and over the course of two days encouraged her to withdraw more than $40,000 in cash and deposit it into a special machine, where she was told it would be safe. The scammer even ordered her a car that delivered her to an area gas station, she told ABC News, where she began feeding $100 bills into the cash kiosk -- his voice instructing her every step of the way. "That seems so hard to believe," O'Brien told Bates about the scam. Doesn't she realize what they're doing to her?' And AARP is warning its 38 million members that bitcoin ATMs are increasingly scammers' preferred means to dupe Americans. Bitcoin ATMs allow users to insert cash and send it to a digital wallet anywhere in the world. It takes only a few minutes, and once the transaction is executed, experts say, the money can be nearly impossible to recover -- making it an attractive method for prospective fraudsters. "Have you seen an increase in how popular using crypto -- and using these ATMs specifically -- has become for a scam like this?" O'Brien asked Amy Nofziger, AARP's director of fraud victim support. "Yes, requesting crypto is now the No. Athena forcefully denied those allegations in a statement to ABC News, asserting in part that it maintains "strong safeguards against fraud including transparent instructions, prominent warnings and consumer education." "Just as a bank isn't held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users' decisions," the statement said. AARP has advocated for more stringent regulations to protect Americans from scams on bitcoin ATMs, like capping the amount of money a user can deposit in one day. At least 17 states have passed legislation in recent years regulating the machines, and some municipalities have moved to ban them outright. But critics say some bitcoin ATM firms have been reluctant to embrace regulation, as it could conceivably hurt their bottom line. "Do you think these companies know that, in large part, their ATMs are being used for scams?" O'Brien asked Adam Zarazinski, the CEO of Inca Digital, a cryptocurrency forensics firm. Brenna Bird, the attorney general in Iowa, filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year against two major players in the space, Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip, which she accused of being "a silent partner to many scammers' preying on Iowans, taking a cut of each scam with its excessive and deceptive [bitcoin ATM] fees." Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip have both denied those claims in court and in statements to ABC News. Bitcoin Depot told ABC News that the "vast majority" of their transactions are "legitimate," that they "are one of a few operators in the bitcoin ATM space to proactively require an ID for even the smallest transactions," and that "customers receive up to four scam warnings before completing a purchase." A spokesperson for CoinFlip told ABC News that the company "never wants to profit when honest people are duped by bad actors, which is why we refund transaction fees to victims in instances of fraud." While most victims never manage to recoup their money, Fran Bates' story has a rare happy ending. She owes it to Myndi Jordan, another customer at the gas station, who noticed Bates hunched over the bitcoin ATM machine, shoving thousands of dollars into it -- and called the police. Jordan, who had herself been the victim of identity fraud, said she immediately recognized it as a scam. The two women sat down with O'Brien for a joint interview earlier this month, reuniting for the first time since that day in June 2024. "I hate when somebody tries to take advantage of somebody that's not able to protect themselves, or defend themselves," Jordan told O'Brien. "And I feel like they were taking advantage of you. And I was like, 'No, we're not doing this today.'" She was just one click from losing it all. "No, don't click 'I'm done,'" Stewart told Bates on the bodycam recording. "It felt amazing, being able to see it to the end and see the happy ending," Stewart told ABC News. "She gives amazing hugs," Stewart said of Bates. "You know, that was the best part of it, I think."
