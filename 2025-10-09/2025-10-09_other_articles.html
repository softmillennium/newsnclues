                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After investigating a reliquary that appeared to move on its own this week, the Diocese of Lincoln has determined that the phenomenon is not a supernatural occurrence. Bishop James Conley of Lincoln told The Pillar Thursday that diocesan officials think a slight vibration in the wall, from the HVAC and electronic systems, was enough to cause the delicate reliquary to shake. On October 8, the diocese received reports of a reliquary holding a relic of St. Gemma Galgani that appeared to be moving without an apparent cause. The relic was displayed in a shadowbox with a number of other relics at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, located at the Newman Center on the University of Nebraska – Lincoln campus. Videos posted online showed the reliquary of St. Gemma appearing to vibrate and move, while the other reliquaries around it remained still. “Tests were conducted including moving the reliquary of St. Gemma from the hook it was on to a different hook. This and the entirety of our full investigation has led us to conclude this incident was not of supernatural origin.” Conley told The Pillar that this is the first time as bishop that he has investigated a potentially supernatural occurrence. “There's a canonical process on any kind of unusual [phenomenon], whether it be somebody claiming to have an apparition, a statue claiming to be crying,” Conley said. “These kinds of things are not that uncommon, and sometimes they're real and sometimes they're not.” When the relic stopped shaking after it was moved to a new pin - and another relic started shaking when placed on the first pin - officials were able to conclude that something was causing the pin at that particular location to vibrate, separate from the relic itself. This year, he said, non-students were visiting the church to pray and noticed the vibrating relic. “Not only is that a great thing to encounter the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist,” the bishop said, “but also to get to know more about St. Gemma.”</p>

Maddy has a degree in biochemistry from the University of York and specializes in reporting on health, medicine, and genetics. On July 1, astronomers spotted an unusual object speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was soon confirmed to be an interstellar comet, and is suspected to have a nucleus (the rocky center of the comet, excluding its coma) of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), and a potential mass of over 33 billion tons. We may even have seen it using NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars. Luckily for us, gravity is time-reversal symmetric, and if we know an object's trajectory, we can work backwards and trace its path. "We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the 2σ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation," the team writes in their paper. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin." In short, none of these potential close(ish) encounters could explain 3I/ATLAS's origin, and barely altered its trajectory. "Together, all data indicate that while 3I/ATLAS follows a thin-disk orbit in the solar neighborhood, it may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system, or from an exo-Oort cloud, and is most likely associated with the transition region between the thin and thick disk, although its origin remains undisclosed," the team concludes. Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is needed to draw further conclusions, but this preliminary study suggests it could be a very old object, that may have been traveling alone for billions of years until we spotted it near our star. “What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now," Pérez Couto, Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies researcher and team leader, added in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural star Rob Benedict, who played Chuck/God, spoke exclusively with ScreenRant to reveal his idea for the show's ending, and it's so much better than the Supernatural finale we got. Debates continue even to this day regarding which Supernatural ending was better, and fans remain divided. There are, therefore, many opinions when it comes to how Supernatural should have ended, but none sounds quite as good as Rob Benedict's pitch for God's role in the finale. Supernatural began with two brothers battling monsters and searching for their father, but it ultimately culminated in an epic showdown against God himself in season 15. Sadly, this didn't mean that Sam and Dean were safe. On the contrary, it's revealed that God had actually been keeping Sam and Dean alive, essentially giving them plot armor. With that now gone, Dean loses his life not in some immense battle between good and evil but rather by being slammed into rebar by a vampire. This proved incredibly controversial, even after Sam and Dean reunited in Heaven at the end of the episode, because it felt so unceremonious. However, Chuck/God actor Rob Benedict shared a theory that would have given the show a very different ending—and it's so much better for that very reason. And, you know, in season 11, he's like, I just thought of my ending. He said he's going to be the bad guy, they're going to take him down, take his powers away. This is so much more than just any old theory, though; this alternate ending actually makes more sense than the real conclusion. While there were concerns that making God the ultimate villain could be jumping the shark, this was actually a thrilling direction for the show to take, and given that Supernatural had increasingly focused on angels, demons, and even the Devil, it wasn't all that difficult to believe when it happened. Benedict actually spoke about that in his interview with ScreenRant as well, sharing: "Ultimately, I think it's kind of brilliant, and I got used to fans saying, 'We hated you in the final season.' So, I thought that was kind of cool." The only issue with this plot was, arguably, that they really were able to take God down, despite his being all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent. Yes, Dean and Sam had the help of Jack, who was a Nephilim (half-human and half-angel) born of Lucifer himself, but this was still a feat a bit too grand to just accept. Rob Benedict's idea for the Supernatural finale completely resolves this issue, and it simply makes a ton of sense. If this were all part of God's plan, then that reveals in a much more believable way how/why Sam, Dean, and Jack were able to stop God. It also makes sense that, even after being 'defeated,' God would still be in control. This also would have been an ending that offered more closure, which was particularly needed because the ending the show had planned, which brought all the fan-favorite characters back together in Heaven, wasn't possible due to COVID. In fact, this alternate conclusion would have resolved some complaints about Dean's death, too. Dean died many times in Supernatural, be it from Hell Hounds claiming him when his demon contract was up or the more than 100 times he died in the episode "Mystery Spot," but that didn't stop his final death from causing outrage. That is, Dean was killed by a random vampire with no extraordinary powers compared to the average monster, and that felt, to some, like a disservice to the character and all that he had survived. Rob Benedict's Supernatural ending would resolve this issue by revealing that, even then, Dean only died in this way because it was what God wanted. This would actually make even more sense in light of Sam and Dean so blatantly turning on God and taking his powers. Whereas God had long kept Dean and Sam safe because they were his 'favorites,' after they fought against him, God undoubtedly no longer had any interest in protecting the brothers. Presumably, just the opposite was true, which would also make this conclusion logical; Supernatural didn't invent the notion that God is vengeful, and this could be seen as God's punishment. Instead, this Supernatural ending would have wrapped everything up in a way that explained how God could have been defeated, ameliorated some of the pain surrounding Dean's death, and brought the show to a clear conclusion befitting its 15 seasons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to hit pause on an almost $1.5 billion defamation judgment that was imposed over his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. In a new filing, Jones said the court's immediate involvement is needed because his website, InfoWars, is on the verge of being turned over to the satirical news site The Onion to help fund payments to family members of the Sandy Hook victims. If the case is not put on hold, "InfoWars will have been acquired by its ideological nemesis and destroyed," Jones' lawyers wrote. The Sandy Hook tragedy occurred in December 2012, when a gunman killed 20 first-grade children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones, who owns InfoWars via his company Free Speech Systems, subsequently lost attempts in state court to appeal the judgment. He is also seeking bankruptcy protections. The Onion failed in a previous attempt to acquire InfoWars via a bankruptcy auction, but Jones' lawyer said a new attempt is underway in Texas state court. The court is scheduled to discuss his appeal in private on Friday. Lawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the stage of Chicago Shakespeare Theater right now sits a two-story, life-size doll house, looming under overly dimmed lights and veiled by an ominous haze pumped in from offstage. “Paranormal Activity,” the new stage play written by Levi Holloway (whose last work in Chicago was the Michael Shannon-led “Turret,” which he wrote and directed) makes its North American premiere at Chicago Shakespeare this week. The film series, produced by horror aficionado studio Blumhouse, now spans seven movies, and is known for its found-footage style of filmmaking. They also are intent on giving the story a new look and feel. To create this new installment to the well-known franchise, Holloway teamed up with Felix Barrett, artistic director of Punchdrunk, an innovative theater company in the United Kingdom that is known for its immersive approach to theater. Each creative brings a slew of relevant credits: Holloway's suspenseful 2019 play “Grey House” made it from A Red Orchid, where he's an ensemble member, to Broadway; Barrett's Punchdrunk production “Sleep No More,” a fully immersive supernatural flip of Shakespeare's “Macbeth,” had a 14-year run in the McKittrick Hotel in New York. “It's a found footage genre,” said Holloway. Part of the answer is that set. The house, even at first glance, is off-putting. From a seat in the audience, it feels almost voyeuristic, reminiscent of Hitchcock's “Rear Window,” when the audience peers into the home and lives of a married couple whom you quickly figure is doomed. “We needed a set that was hyper naturalistic,” said Barrett, the show's director. “We wanted to create a sense of peering in and not wanting to look too close, because you see yourself there.” Sorry, there was an error registering your email. By subscribing, you agree with WBEZ's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy He centers the story on a married couple (played by Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger), who are troubled by secrecy in their relationship — and that's before being haunted. Barrett, who typically produces shows outside of theaters, saw the idea of scaring people in their seats as a new challenge. “I spend all my working life trying to invoke a sense of feeling in an audience,” he said. “Wouldn't it be rad to do it in a theater for an audience in the safety of an auditorium? To actually make that space crumble and be a bit threatening?” He centers the story on a married couple, played by Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger, who are troubled by secrecy in their relationship — and that's before being haunted. But they have employed Chris Fisher, who worked as illusion designer for “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” during which actors used actual illusions and slight of hand on stage. His list of impressive tricks for that show included performers transforming into each other before the eyes of the audience. (Chicago will be the first North American city to stage it.) During a recent practice run for the creative team, Heusinger said there were vocal screams in the theater. I'm curious how people are gonna react.” It's like we are all going to face our fears together.” “I really wanted to talk about marriage and trust and how somebody's past can catch up with them,” said Holloway, who tapped into some childhood trauma for the scripting. And sometimes our weaponry is in the mundane. So, when they're met with the uncanny or the impossible, we ask ourselves an audience, ‘What would I do' and ‘Would I survive?' That question of survival exists not only in the pair's interaction with the paranormal, but also with each other. “That intersection is where we try to drop the audience into moments of being unsafe,” Holloway added. Barrett said the show leans into a similar style. “There's a sort of strange poetry and magic to the things you don't quite see,” he said. © 2025 Chicago Public Media Inc. | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use | FCC Public Filing Info | Notice of FCC Applications</p>

Her scientific interests include genomics, personalized medicine, and bioethics. On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected an object moving through the Solar System on an escape trajectory. Follow-up observations soon confirmed that we were looking at our third interstellar visitor, after ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, although it looks quite different from the previous two. It's an interesting object, perhaps from an earlier age of the universe and a different part of the galaxy, and even spacecraft around Mars and Jupiter are getting in on the action observing it. There have been a few suggestions – although not from the majority of scientists – that the object could not be natural at all. Soon after the object was discovered, and before we could take a proper look at it, Harvard theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and astronomer Avi Loeb suggested in a paper that it could be an interstellar probe sent by an intelligent species, potentially with the goal of destroying Earth. In the first paper, which he states in an accompanying blog post is largely a "pedagogical exercise" and "fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity", he suggested that the object could be hostile, as outlined in the "Dark Forest" hypothesis. In short (though you should read the book on which it is based, you will not regret it), given the finite resources in the universe, and our lack of knowledge of any other civilization's intent, any lifeform may want to pre-emptively attack any other form of life they discover, before it becomes a threat to their own civilization. According to Loeb's paper, the object could be here for that purpose. "The low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity," Loeb, Adam Hibberd, and Adam Crowl write in that paper. "The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of ∼ 5.9 × 10-5 au day-2, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion." Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and Loeb did not provide this, instead arguing that given the potential consequences of a dark forest strike (Earth goes kablooey), we should consider it, and any planetary defense measures we could take if it were the case. ⓘ IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites. While speculation like this is enjoyable in a sci-fi context, it has been less than helpful for more conspiracy-minded citizens of Earth. As well as people out there who believe an alien spacecraft is going to approach Earth in late November or early December (per Loeb's suggestion), there are also people who believe that we are being told a spacecraft is approaching as a cover-up for something else. In the paper addressing these claims, which has not yet been peer reviewed, SETI scientist and senior lecturer at the Geoscience Department of Universiti Teknologi Petronas, AKM Eahsanul Haque, outlines why it is likely a natural object. Natural comets can also have similar dynamics because of changes in gravity." Other papers, of course, treat it as an interstellar comet, but do not address these alien technology claims specifically. Loeb and colleagues flagged up a lack of identifiable chemicals as evidence that the comet could be artificial, according to Haque, but comparing the spectral slope with D-Type asteroids and interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, he finds they demonstrate consistency with these other natural objects. In Loeb's initial paper and blog post, he states that "detection of a non-gravitational acceleration could also indicate an intent to intercept Jupiter, not far off the path of 3I/ATLAS, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion." 2I/Borisov underwent a little non-gravitational acceleration, meaning a change of speed that was not caused by gravitational interactions alone, which astronomers put down to outgassing. "Seligman et al. also found a slight change in the light curve over about four days, showing that the structure is stable and there is no evidence of acceleration beyond what gravity would cause," Haque explains. "This differs from the results of 1I/‘Oumuamua, which showed a small, non-gravitational acceleration thought to be caused by outgassing. If the nucleus diameter of 3I/ATLAS will be found to be larger than 5 kilometers in the HiRISE image, then an origin associated with the interstellar mass reservoir of rocky material will be untenable," he wrote in a blog post. While alien spacecraft are an undeniably fun topic to talk about, scientists have a much more likely explanation for the object, which is backed up by the evidence. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” Tom Statler, NASA's lead scientist for Solar System small bodies, said to The Guardian about such claims. “It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. Based on its trajectory, spectra, and comet-like properties, Haque suggests that it could be "a lithified clastic fragment from an exoplanetary sedimentary basin". For his own part, Loeb has moved from saying that the idea is purely a teaching exercise, to placing pretty high odds that the object is an alien spacecraft. "As of now, I assign a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, based on its seven anomalies that I listed here. More information on the object is highly-anticipated by other astronomers too, not because it might be aliens, but because it is an interesting comet from another part of the galaxy, which could operate as a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe.</p>

We deserved to know what's really going on up there.” But Boian said to KDVR that outlandish ads are often used when candidates are desperate for money or voter support – “neither of which I am seeing right now”. KDVR reported that Boebert's campaign shrugged off Boain's commentary, claiming the message was performing extremely well among prospective donors because people want answers. Boebert has demonstrated her focus on aliens and UFOs – also referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) – in public before. “I think it's about 5% of our ocean that's actually been studied by man,” Boebert, who has occasionally adhered to the QAnon conspiracy theory, asserted during the hearing. “Are there any accounts of UAPs emerging from or submerging into our water which could indicate a base or presence beneath the ocean's surface?” Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of the news site Public who has reported that the Pentagon runs a secret UFO retrieval program, replied to Boebert that he had never heard of an underwater alien base, but did recount hearing from a source who described an “orb coming out of the ocean and being met by another orb”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By Nicholas Sparks with M. Night ShyamalanRandom House: 352 pages, $30If you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores. On the surface, author Nicholas Sparks and filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan seem like unlikely collaborators. It turns out they've admired each other's work for years, and now together have produced “Remain,” which arrives on bookshelves next week  and lands in movie theaters next October. Sparks is known for pulling at readers' heartstrings with cinematic love stories — 11 of which have made their way to the big screen, and several of which Sparks produced himself. But with “Remain,” the bestselling author has forged a singular partnership that takes him well outside his comfort zone. The lovers have otherworldly sex, although they can't actually touch. In other words, it's a love story only this pair could concoct. In early 2023, Sparks says someone on his team approached him with an idea. “Hey,” Sparks recounted, “wouldn't it be neat if you did something with M. Night Shyamalan?” Sparks, who The Times interviewed over Zoom from his home in New Bern, N.C., had been a Shyamalan devotee for decades. But he's also been a fan of every Shyamalan production since. There was even a near-miss between them decades ago. He turned it down because he was working on another project.” Sparks pauses, then smiles slyly, “I think it was called ‘The Sixth Sense. At this stage of his highly successful career — more than 115 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide — Sparks can pick and choose among projects. And he's also now enough of a Hollywood veteran to know that getting from concept to screen can be challenging — though Sparks' track record is pretty remarkable. To Sparks' surprise, a month or two after the idea was first floated, he received a call to arrange a meeting between the two the following month — in May 2023 — in Shyamalan's Bucks County, Pa., offices. It became clear within moments that Shyamalan's concept would win the day, though Sparks is reticent to say why, except that “mine was pretty dark.” Once Shyamalan characterized his vision as a “supernatural love story,” Sparks thought, “I can do that. It's not so wildly outside what I do. Something Lovecraftian with different dimensions.” The more he thought about it, the more Sparks realized that, “in the end, novels come down to character, writing and plotting.” All of those were in his toolbox. They got what Sparks describes as “the fangirling stuff” out of the way, and then took a hard look at how well they could work together. She tells him on her deathbed that she's able to see spirits “still tethered to the living world.” Both novel and film would be set in Cape Cod, Mass., and there would be a mysterious woman named Wren, which is where the supernatural element would come in. They loosely agreed on the outline, but no firm deal or timeline was put in place. More than a year passed, during which, Sparks says, “I didn't hear anything from him at all. In August 2024, Sparks was surprised to receive a call from Shyamalan, who had already moved forward on the idea. “Our story is going to be my next project,” Sparks recalls Shyamalan saying. “He told me he intended to write, direct and produce the film.” Sparks says it then hit him, “Oh my gosh. This is going to be an M. Night movie!” The mood shifted from excitement to reality: “I guess I'd better get started on the novel!” Sparks recalls telling himself. After that call, it took only six weeks for Shyamalan to complete a first draft of the screenplay, which he sent to Sparks for comment. He immediately recognized, “Wow, this is going to make a great film,” but to work as a novel, he told Shyamalan, “We've got to tweak some things.” By October, they'd smoothed out the rough edges and Sparks began writing in earnest. It was his mother who first suggested he write books to “stop him from pouting” after he was sidelined with an injury from the University of Notre Dame track and field team. The first-ever novel he wrote was “truly terrible,” Sparks says, and has never been published. Many years later, after marrying, having kids and working as a pharmaceutical sales rep, he thought back to his mother's advice, and spent evenings writing a novel he named “Winter for Two.” Oscar winner and literary champion Reese Witherspoon co-wrote her first novel, ‘Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling thriller writer Harlan Coben. He sent off the finished manuscript to 25 literary agents. One of those landed in the hands of Jamie Raab, who was then executive editor at Warner Books in New York. Raab instantly saw its potential and rushed a copy to her boss' apartment, asking her to drop everything and read it as quickly as possible. Raab's boss was sold, and instructed her to “take the novel off the table” in a preemptive deal that would prevent other publishers from bidding. “I knew it had a lot of heart. … I had an instinct that many would feel the same way,” Raab recalls. 1 on bestseller lists; in 2004, it became a box office hit starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams; and in 2024, it was turned into a play that was nominated for three Tony Awards. Raab ended up editing 18 more of Sparks' books. Sparks says he and Shyamalan worked well as a team. “He gave me a very long leash to write a novel based on the story the two of us came up with,” Sparks says. '” They spoke three or four times a week during this period. They had “a wonderful time bouncing ideas off each other,” Sparks says. His story determined what I needed to do, but it was still up to me to figure out how I was going to do it.” Their teamwork, Sparks says, produced “a great movie,” hitting theaters Oct. 23, 2026, and a book he hopes readers will be surprised and delighted by. For anyone who's shocked that Sparks would stray off the beaten path of traditional love stories, that first book, the one his mom prompted him to write but never saw the light of day? It was a horror novel inspired by Sparks' literary hero, Stephen King.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Louisville riverboat with a rather haunted past has docked on the banks of the Ohio River in Downtown Cincinnati for America's River Roots Festival. Built in 1914, the iconic Belle of Louisville steamboat has lived a colorful life and welcomed equally vibrant characters, including ghosts (yes, ghosts) since it first started cruising. As legend has it, four spirits linger on the antique vessel. Captain Mark Doty, who's worked on the Belle since 1981, said he isn't a believer in the paranormal world, but an incident left him somewhat spooked while filming "Ghost Hunters," a reality television show that follows a paranormal investigative team as they explore allegedly haunted locations. "(Ghost Hunters) came on here looking for Captain Ben Winters." The Belle of Louisville has carried a lot of history (and apparitions) since it first ferried the Mississippi River between Tennessee and Arkansas more than 110 years ago. According to previous reporting by the Louisville Courier Journal, the riverboat is said to have four ghosts that walk amongst guests and crew: The steamboat's most famous ghost, arguably, is Captain Ben Winters, who was featured on a 2013 episode of "Ghost Hunters," and is rumored to haunt the Belle of Louisville's pilot house. Winters also allegedly played a role in another ghost story. "Was the girl they were smitten with named Amy? I don't know, but I did hear that," the captain said, adding that the show warned viewers he was a skeptic. However, that wasn't the only paranormal incident Doty experienced. "I've spent many nights over the last 44 years doing night watches and stuff[...] the boat is always moving and creaking, so there's nothing I couldn't explain that I've heard, other than somebody tugging on my pant leg." Louisville Courier Journal reporter Maggie Menderski contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JENKINTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- Two people have been arrested in Montgomery County for allegedly running a fortune-telling scheme that defrauded victims out of more than $600,000. Gina Marks, 52, of Huntingdon Valley and Steve Nicklas, 40, of Jenkintown, are facing multiple felony charges after investigators say they operated a business called Jenkintown Psychic Visions and convinced victims they were cursed. According to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, the first victim contacted the business for a psychic phone reading and was told she was plagued by a powerful curse that would destroy her marriage, business, and family unless it was removed. The victim also handed over personal belongings for rituals, which investigators say were never returned. A second victim came forward during the investigation, which began in December 2024. Detectives say Marks instructed the victim to provide personal photos and details, then made increasingly unorthodox requests, including a Chanel purse and additional money. Marks allegedly threatened the victim with reputational damage if her instructions were not followed. Financial records from Cash App, Zelle, and a credit union confirmed that funds from both victims were transferred into accounts belonging to Marks and Nicklas. "These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain," said Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. "They are now going to be held accountable for their actions."</p>
