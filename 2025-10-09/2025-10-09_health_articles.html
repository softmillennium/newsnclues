                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even though electronic cigarettes do not contain any illicit substances, the liquid can cause serious health problems. Often, the nicotine concentration in these products is several times higher than in conventional cigarettes, promoting rapid addiction. Furthermore, in countries like Brazil, which have banned electronic cigarettes, it Is observed that the products offered to users do not undergo any quality control. A resolution by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, distribution, storage, transportation, and advertising of electronic smoking devices. Some of these liquids contain up to 100 times more nicotine than a regular cigarette, whose legal maximum limit is 1 milligram of nicotine per cigarette. These substances are created in laboratories to mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component found in Cannabis sativa, or marijuana. However, synthetic cannabinoids are much more potent and can trigger neurological effects such as seizures, psychotic episodes, and even death from overdose. Clandestine groups are producing drugs with increasingly potent structures, requiring minimal doses to achieve the desired effect. As there's no labeling or warning, users consume without knowing what they're ingesting," Arantes warns. To address the problem, Brazilian researchers, in partnership with international colleagues, have developed a portable sensor that can accurately detect synthetic cannabinoids in e-cigarette liquids and biological fluids, such as saliva. "We developed an electrochemical method that identifies different synthetic cannabinoid molecules with high selectivity and sensitivity. The device uses a boron-doped diamond electrode manufactured in collaboration with a group from the University of Technology in Bratislava, Slovakia. The response is a current-voltage graph, with specific peaks that identify and quantify the substances present," Melo explains. "This sensor represents a major innovation in the field of portable devices, as it combines the portability of printed sensors with the high stability of boron-doped diamond materials, which can be reused countless times," emphasizes Wallans Torres Pio dos Santos, a professor at the Federal University of Vale do Jequitinhonha and Mucuri, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and coordinator of the study. It demonstrated the ability to detect concentrations as low as 0.2 µM, even in the presence of high levels of nicotine and other interferences. In chemistry, µM (micromolar) is a unit of measurement for the concentration of a substance in solution. "The great advantage of our device is its selectivity. It's like entering a dark room and illuminating only the spot we want to observe," Santos compares. In addition to its use as a screening tool by forensic police, the device can be used in public health to provide emergency care to individuals experiencing overdoses or other complications, as well as for preventive harm reduction initiatives. To this end, the research group partners with the "BACO Project: Toxicology and Toxicological Analysis as Sources of Information for Drug Policy". "The goal of this project is to evaluate the use of new psychoactive substances at parties and festivals by analyzing oral fluid samples. Our partnership with BACO researchers aims to extend the initial objective of the project to allow not only saliva analysis, but also the immediate screening of substances that partygoers intend to consume," Arantes explains. Our goal is to develop technologies that can be put into practice. This can prevent serious poisoning and even save lives," Melo points out. "Our surveys show that 63% of users don't know what they're consuming. Many think they're using a known drug, but in fact, they may be using a much more potent substance. This alone reduces risks and saves lives," Santos points out. "We've already developed sensors for other classes of substances, such as LSD and its synthetic analogues, cathinones, and phenylethylamines. We're also working on incorporating colorimetric reagents into the sensors to facilitate visual interpretation of the results," Arantes explains. Part of the analysis was done in collaboration with his laboratory, using real saliva samples collected in environments where the products are used. This project, in turn, is an offshoot of the research 'The Toxicology of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS): Epidemiology of Consumption through the Analysis of Hair and Oral Fluid Samples', also supported by FAPESP, in which we conducted the first epidemiological survey in Brazil on NPS at parties and festivals. "The goal is to take science where it can have a direct impact. Experts, doctors, and health professionals need accessible, fast, and reliable tools to face the challenges posed by new drugs. What we propose is a practical, portable, and scalable solution," Arantes summarizes. Discover how Discovery Life Sciences enhances genomics research with cloud-based platforms like DNAnexus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ochsner Health announces the launch of its Genetic Wellness Assessment, an innovative screening tool to help identify individuals at risk for hereditary cancers. The Genetic Wellness Assessment is now available for adults interested in learning more about their cancer risk at Ochsner.org/GeneticWellnessSurvey. The Genetic Wellness Assessment allows individuals to determine whether they may have a higher genetic risk of developing cancer by answering a few simple questions that evaluate individual risk factors. Those identified as having a high risk, or anyone interested in further evaluation, can schedule an appointment to discuss genetic testing. The results of genetic testing are used by healthcare providers to offer personalized recommendations for cancer screening, prevention and further evaluation for patients and family members. The Genetic Wellness Assessment is a pivotal step in advancing precision medicine and preventive care. Once patients are identified, we can offer a tailored plan to prevent a cancer from developing or detecting it early when it's most treatable." Marc Matrana, MD, system medical director of precision medicine, Ochsner Health The assessment evaluates a patient's personal and family history of cancer to identify their risk of having a genetic cancer syndrome. If a patient is identified as high risk, they are offered genetic counseling, testing, and a personalized cancer screening and prevention plan. These conditions increase the risk of developing cancer at a younger age or in multiple family members. By identifying these risks early, Ochsner can help patients take preventive actions, such as specialized screenings or treatments, which can improve outcomes. "This program empowers patients with knowledge about their risk of developing cancer and connects them with a multidisciplinary team of experts to ensure they and their families receive the best in cancer prevention, early detection and treatment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Compounding this concerning issue, younger patients are being diagnosed at more advanced stages, according to doctors at NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center, and this points to a greater need for screening, prevention, and breast cancer education. While this is a concerning trend, the quality of life for those diagnosed—even at stage 4, when it has spread to other parts of the body—is improving. Perlmutter Cancer Center is adapting to the landscape with the recent launch of the Early Onset Cancer Program, one of several programs aimed at targeting and tailoring treatment for people living with cancer. Dr. Gemignani: While the median age at the time of diagnosis is 62, we're seeing early onset at a much younger age than that. Around 10 percent of the patients that we see today are 45 and younger. We're also seeing more aggressive molecular profiles among our younger patients, which poses a greater risk for prognosis and outcomes. Triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive subtype without many targeted treatment options, is also more common in younger women. The American Cancer Society reported that women under 50 are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to men of the same ages. This is primarily attributed to increasing rates of breast cancer. Dr. Comen: Education about risk assessment and family history is crucial in addressing the increasing number of breast cancer diagnoses among young people. Understanding your personal risk helps guide and tailor your care, regardless of whether you have a family history of the disease. However, those at higher risk may need to start screening earlier. Additionally, women with dense breasts may benefit from supplemental imaging—such as ultrasound or breast MRI—in addition to standard mammograms. Dr. Gemignani: Health literacy and self-advocacy are also extremely important. A breast cancer diagnosis can be extremely overwhelming because there's so much terminology and medical language that people may not understand. Building a trusting relationship between the care team and the patient creates a safe space for questions and conversations, which empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care. Every individual's journey is unique, and young women in particular may face distinct challenges related to their stage of life, including concerns about fertility, parenting young children, career demands, and family responsibilities. Our approach is focused not only on treatment, but also on preserving quality of life and helping patients maintain their roles and identities outside of their diagnosis. This includes addressing important issues such as nutrition, exercise, emotional wellbeing, sexual health, and overall functioning in daily life. Dr. Gemignani: When we established the Early Onset Cancer Program, we were thinking about these types of lifestyle changes and priorities like family planning. In your 30s to 40s, your friends could be going on a night out, and you are buying a cold cap and getting ready for chemo. The Early Onset Cancer Program was designed with these moments in mind. Dr. Comen: There are several innovative programs we have invested in and now offer to oncology patients. One is the Oncofertility Program, which helps any cancer patient at NYU Langone understand and pursue their fertility options as part of their cancer treatment. Any provider in the health system—including nurses and physician assistants—can refer patients to a team of dedicated fertility nurse navigators. Dr. Gemignani: We also launched the Cardio-Oncology Program in October 2024, enabling patients and their oncologists to create personalized care plans to protect and treat the heart for newly diagnosed patients, those actively receiving treatment, or cancer survivors. We also offer services for psychosocial distress, sexual health, rehabilitation, and sickness from hormone therapy, as well as exercise and physical therapy, yoga, and access to social workers as part of our Survivorship Program. We are committed to providing younger cancer patients personalized care that meets their individual needs and gives them the best quality of life possible. There are more people living with cancer now than ever before, and the oncology field has come a long way in how we think about survivorship and treat the specific needs of younger cancer patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on August 22, 2025, titled, "The impact of long-term social housing on biconditional association task performance and neuron ensembles in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampal CA3 region of aged rats." The research team led by Anne M. Dankert from Providence College and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, showed that aged rats who lived in socially enriched environments throughout life retained better memory and cognitive flexibility than those housed alone. Cognitive decline, such as memory loss and reduced problem-solving ability, affects many people over the age of 65. While many factors contribute to age-related cognitive decline, this study suggests that one key factor may be surprisingly simple: long-term social connection. To explore how social interaction might influence memory performance and brain activity, the researchers designed a study using rats as a model for aging in humans. "Cognitive decline and changes in neuronal activity are hallmarks of aging." All groups had access to the same physical enrichment, such as exercise and stimulating objects, but only some experienced lifelong social companionship. The team tested these animals on a complex memory challenge known as the biconditional association task, which requires animals to make context-based decisions-an ability that typically declines with age. The results showed that aged rats living in social groups performed just as well as young adults on the memory task, while those housed alone showed significant impairments. Socially housed rats also made fewer working memory errors and required less effort to complete cognitive tasks, suggesting not only better performance but more efficient brain function. These benefits were not observed in aged rats who received only environmental enrichment without social interaction. Interestingly, socially housed rats also showed reduced overactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex-a brain area involved in attention and decision-making-suggesting a more balanced and efficient neural response. This research provides new insight into how lifelong social experiences shape brain health during aging. While earlier studies have shown that physical activity and cognitive stimulation help preserve cognitive function, this study identifies social interaction as an independent and powerful protective factor. The findings are consistent with human studies showing that older adults who remain socially active tend to experience slower cognitive decline and stronger brain function. Overall, these results emphasize that brain aging is not inevitable but may be influenced by our social environments. This research suggests that fostering lifelong social connections could be a critical, low-cost strategy to protect memory and mental flexibility in older adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poor blood sugar control in adolescence increases the risk of painful future complications for people with type 1 diabetes, research co-led by University of Michigan suggests. The study, which followed participants for over 30 years, highlights how children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age have trouble controlling their blood sugar as teens. Investigators found that children who had poor glycemic control - meaning, higher-than-average blood sugar levels - during adolescence were more likely to develop neuropathy in adulthood. Neuropathy is nerve damage that can cause pain, numbness and tingling in the extremities. Of nearly 40 million Americans with diabetes, up to 50% may receive a neuropathy diagnosis. Results are published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. Eva Feldman, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author, director of the ALS Center of Excellence at U-M Health and James W. Albers Distinguished University Professor at U-M Participants with the greatest increase in HbA1c levels from childhood to adolescence not only retained higher blood sugar levels in adulthood, but they also had a greater risk for neuropathy. "Our findings suggest that difficulties maintaining blood sugar in adolescence may lead to greater difficulties in achieving future glycemic control," Feldman said. "Although the mechanisms behind that association are unclear, hyperglycemia leads to impairments in cell metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose regulation, all of which could cause long-term challenges in optimal glycemic control." Adolescent hyperglycemia is likely not the only contributor to risk of future complications, such as neuropathy, says Kara Mizokami-Stout, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at U-M Medical School, who was not involved in the study. "While clear links between glycemia and neuropathy have been found in type 1 diabetes, we know there are also vascular risk factors that play a key role in the development of neuropathy," Mizokami-Stout said. "However, this study does underscore the need to maximize our support for younger individuals with diabetes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers from Keio University School of Medicine, the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, and the National Center for Child Health and Development has reported the first cross-disease, cross-stakeholder survey on PPIE in Japan. The study compared allergy research with cancer and rare diseases, fields where PPIE has already advanced. The survey revealed that:•100% of allergy-related PAGs considered PPIE essential, and 50% had formal rules for engagement. •By contrast, only 9.4% of allergy researchers reported established rules, and just 50% recognized PPIE as necessary-lower than in cancer and rare disease research (64.7%). •PAGs widely used digital tools for communication (100%), while adoption among researchers was minimal (6.3–15.6%). These findings show that allergy patient advocacy groups in Japan are ready and willing to engage, but researchers have yet to catch up. Closing this gap is critical, especially since allergy management depends heavily on daily-life factors such as environment and lifestyle. Patient perspectives are essential to shaping meaningful research." Dr. Takeya ADACHI, corresponding author and dermatologist at Keio University The study also emphasized that these results align with the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) initiatives to promote PPIE as part of national health policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stress granules are droplet-like protein hubs that temporarily shield fragile RNA from cellular stresses such as toxins. VCP is a protein essential for breaking up stress granules and has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital discovered that ASPL regulates stress granule disassembly by facilitating VCP phosphorylation. Stress granules are carefully regulated, forming only during stresses, such as heat or infection, and disassembling once the stress is resolved. Mutations in proteins such as VCP can derail this cycle, leading to the abnormal accumulation of proteins, which causes a condition called multisystem proteinopathy. "VCP mutations are found in patients with multisystem proteinopathy, which includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Paget's disease of bone," said corresponding author Mondira Kundu, MD, PhD, St. Jude Department of Cell & Molecular Biology. "While VCP has multiple functions, its ability to disassemble RNA-protein assemblies, such as stress granules, is impaired by disease-causing mutations." After discovering that VCP and ASPL interact with ULK, another protein involved in regulating stress granule disassembly, Kundu and her team decided to dig into the relationship. "ULK regulates stress granule dynamics, so we wondered whether ASPL was also involved through its interaction with either ULK or VCP," Kundu said. The team found that ASPL was required for ULK to carry out its function, which is VCP's phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group). These findings are consistent with what occurs during multisystem proteinopathy. Certain disease-causing VCP mutants don't interact as well with ASPL and ULK, and also have stress granule disassembly defects. Mondira Kundu, Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital In a surprising turn, the researchers also observed that ASPL overexpression sharply increased stress granule formation. Removing ASPL resulted in smaller and slower-forming stress granules. This suggested that ASPL plays a role in stress granule assembly. But this function of ASPL did not involve VCP, so the researchers set out to tease apart how ASPL could promote the formation of stress granules on its own, independent of VCP. "We created cell lines that express a version of ASPL that cannot bind VCP and found that these cells had no problems with granule assembly but did a poor job with disassembly," Kundu said. These findings add nuance to scientists' understanding of stress granule regulation, expanding on the checks and balances that govern the process and highlighting potential pathways to disease. "A key question is whether disrupting the ASPL-VCP interaction, specifically through ASPL, can mimic multisystem proteinopathy," Kundu said. "That's the biggest missing link currently, and one we are exploring." Pareek, G., et al. (2025) ASPL couples the assembly of stress granules with their VCP-mediated disassembly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keloids are raised, overgrown scars that can develop after skin injuries or surgery, often extending beyond the original wound boundaries. For many people, keloids are more than just a cosmetic concern; they often cause distressing symptoms such as chronic pain, itching, and restricted movement. Even after decades of study, it is still unclear why keloids grow uncontrollably, unlike hypertrophic scars. The current understanding is that an overproduction of extracellular matrix collagen by fibroblasts-cells that produce elements of connective tissue-is involved and that repeated mechanical tension on the skin contributes to keloid formation. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms driving this uncontrolled scarring are unclear. More specifically, we don't know how or which cells sense the mechanical pressure and ultimately translate it into abnormal tissue growth. Now, a study made available online on July 31, 2025, and published in Volume 267, Issue 1 of The Journal of Pathology on September 01, 2025, provides a new piece to this puzzle. While analyzing fibrotic tissue from lymphedema in collaboration with plastic surgeons, I conceived the idea that comparing it with keloid tissue might help identify pathological alterations specific to keloid fibroblasts. Although both conditions involve fibrosis, their underlying physiological contexts and etiologies differ substantially." The study involved a comprehensive analysis of human tissue samples. The team compared keloid tissues with those from lymphedema, a condition characterized by fibrous overgrowth but not primarily driven by mechanical tension, along with healthy skin samples. They employed several advanced techniques, including global gene expression analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing; these methods allowed them to examine gene activity in individual cells and precisely characterize the cell types involved. A key discovery was that keloid tissues exhibited significantly higher expression levels of a mechanosensitive ion channel called PIEZO2, compared to lymphedema tissues. The team also observed that these FBPZ2+ cells clustered around blood and lymphatic vessels in keloid tissue, particularly in actively growing areas. "Connective tissue is not composed merely of fibroblasts-it also contains immune cells, blood vessels, and nerves, all of which work together to maintain the proper homeostasis, a critical factor in supporting organ-specific functions," explains Prof. Ikehara. "Therefore, just as studies of immune and neural cell components have advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative and allergic diseases, investigating fibroblasts may help uncover the mechanisms underlying keloid formation." Indeed, this study represents a significant step in that direction by highlighting the unique role of FBPZ2+cells. The study findings reveal that keloid formation is not merely a generalized overgrowth but a unique process driven by specific tension-sensing cells. "Our work offers new insights into the pathogenesis of keloids and opens the door to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies," says Prof. Ikehara. "For example, PIEZO2 inhibitors, which are a type of calcium ion channel blocker, may help alleviate pain and itching associated with keloids. If such targeted therapies become clinically available, they could greatly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from keloid-related discomfort." Taken together, this study contributes to the development of therapeutic strategies to restore healthy connective tissue, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PlasmidFactory GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to combine expertise in cell therapy process development and GMP manufacturing, aiming to accelerate non-viral cell and gene therapies for the benefit of patients. PlasmidFactory GmbH, a leading European CDMO for plasmid and Minicircle DNA, brings more than 25 years of experience and over 3,500 DNA constructs delivered worldwide. The Fraunhofer IZI contributes extensive translational capabilities in immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine, and advanced cell manufacturing. Together, they are accelerating the development of next-generation, virus-free genetic engineering platforms while maintaining the highest quality and regulatory standards. In the past, the two partners have already successfully established new manufacturing processes for CAR-T cells at Fraunhofer IZI and conducted joint research projects on virus-free gene transfer, which served as the foundation for the production of clinical cell products. By building on our long-standing collaboration, this partnership allows us to translate scientific innovation into tangible therapeutic advances. Together, we can streamline non-viral manufacturing workflows and bring promising therapies to patients more efficiently.” Prof. Dr. Michael Hudecek, Fraunhofer IZI, adds: “PlasmidFactory's expertise in high-quality DNA manufacturing perfectly complements our translational capabilities. By joining forces, we can further advance non-viral engineering platforms and help shape the future of cell and gene therapies.” Viral vectors remain the standard in many therapies, but they are associated with high costs, complex production, and safety concerns such as insertional mutagenesis. Minicircle DNA overcomes the limitations of conventional plasmids with higher transfection efficiency, stronger and more stable expression, and lower DNA toxicity – making it a real alternative to viral vectors and a key enabler of virus-free engineering approaches for CAR-T, TCR-T, NK, and other immune cell therapies. The collaboration underscores a shared commitment to advancing virus-free technologies such as minicircles and transposon systems, which have the potential to overcome bottlenecks in viral vector production. By aligning innovation with patient needs, PlasmidFactory and Fraunhofer IZI are creating a platform that strengthens Europe's position in the global race for advanced therapies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 54,600 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely malnourished, including over 12,800 severely so, with few therapeutic options available to them. With measurements up to the middle of August 2025, the study comprehensively tracks wasting among children during the war, estimates population prevalence, and highlights unprecedented increases in child malnutrition following periods of blockades and severe aid restrictions. Between January 2024 and mid-August 2025, UNRWA staff screened 219,783 children aged 6-59 months, measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) at 16 functioning health centres and 78 medical points in shelters and tented encampments across five governorates in the Gaza Strip. Wasting, or acute malnutrition, is defined as a child being too thin for their height, indicating rapid weight loss and severe lack of energy, protein and other nutrients. It is a life-threatening condition, and children require regular treatment with therapeutic food over several weeks, or in extreme cases and when possible, hospitalisation. The end of 2024 saw severe aid restrictions, with UN sources reporting daily averages of 42 to 92 aid trucks per day crossing into Gaza, compared to 300 to 600 per day pre-war. In early 2025, a six-week ceasefire allowed for increased aid to enter the Gaza Strip, and wasting declined to 5.5% by March 2025 (831 out of 15,165 children). A subsequent 11-week blockade followed, with severe restrictions on the entry of food, water, fuel, medicines and other essentials, was in place until late May 2025. The latest measurements, taken through mid-August 2025, found that 15.8% (1,213/7,668) of screened children were wasted, 3.7% (280/7,668) severely so. Extrapolated to the estimated total population of the Gaza Strip, this is equivalent to over 54,600 children aged 6-59 months in need of urgent therapeutic nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children with little chance of rehabilitation given the inadequate amounts of food crossing the borders, and the cripped health and nutrition services. Since October 7, 2023, an unprecedented war has unfolded across the Gaza Strip. Given the long failure to stop the war and prevent encroaching famine despite a global capacity to do so, unless there is a lasting cessation of the conflict coupled with unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services, a further deterioration in early childhood nutrition with increased mortality are inevitable in the Gaza Strip." Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist, UNRWA and lead scientist for the study, adds: "Evidence prior to Oct 2023 indicated that children in Palestine refugee families in the Gaza Strip were food insecure and had poor dietary diversity. This paradox was likely explained by these families' regular access to food aid. Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of pre-school aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality." The authors note that data collected was limited to available, functioning UNRWA facilities. Two-thirds of screenings were conducted in Khan Younis and Middle areas, due to challenges of operating health centres in other areas. A total of 265,974 screenings were done for 219,783 children, indicating some children were screened more than once over time. Researchers faced considerable challenges including lack of identity information, and unsafe locations making data collection challenging. In a linked Comment, Zulfiqar A Bhutta (Aga Khan University, Pakistan & Hospital for Sick Children, Canada), Jessica Fanzo (Columbia University, USA) and Paul H Wise (Stanford University School of Medicine, USA), who were not involved in the study, write: "These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations... Although immediate attention has been paid to the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be serious concern for the well documented long-term effects, such as intergenerational consequences of starvation and food restriction in children, including inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases and reduced life expectancy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Scripps Research recently discovered a new kind of cell that helps protect insulin production, paving the way to understanding how researchers could prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes. This discovery helps explain several puzzling features of type 1 diabetes, including why the disease often has such a long preclinical phase-the symptom-free, early stage of the disease where the immune system is beginning to destroy insulin-producing cells, but blood sugar levels are still normal-and suggests that early intervention could be feasible in the future. This finding unlocks a new understanding of autoimmunity and could help us design better therapeutics for type 1 diabetes and inform how we prevent or reverse the disease." Luc Teyton, professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and senior author of the study In addition to multiple daily insulin injections, blood sugar monitoring and a carefully regulated diet, type 1 diabetics face serious, life-threatening risks if their blood sugar levels aren't within healthy ranges or well controlled. To identify VAFs, Teyton and his lab took an unconventional approach that focused on the physiology and pathology of the pancreas. The team zeroed in on a site often responsible for inflammation-the post-capillary venules-and then used a combination of imaging, cell-labeling and single-cell analysis to examine how a healthy pancreas kept inflammation at bay. They used a cell-labeling technique, called FucoID, which was developed by Scripps Research professor Peng Wu and allowed the team to quickly identify and isolate cells of interest. As immune cells travel around the body to detect danger or damage, they depend on antigen presentation-a process in which other cells display protein fragments to help determine whether an immune response is needed. VAFs participate in this process by presenting pieces of the pancreas, while also sending signals that placate the immune system and induce a tolerant state called anergy-thereby halting an autoimmune response. Teyton and his lab identified that persistent inflammation of the pancreas-whether from infection, environmental toxins or other triggers-causes VAFs to become overwhelmed, forcing the immune system to activate and induce type 1 diabetes. "This discovery reframes how we think about type 1 diabetes," says former Scripps Research postdoctoral researcher and first author, Don Clarke. "Rather than just asking why the immune system attacks, we can now ask: what disrupts the pancreas' natural ability to maintain tolerance? The protective nature of VAFs offers a new path for researchers to explore, shifting their focus to understanding how they can enhance the body's natural tolerance mechanisms. Looking ahead, the team envisions developing therapies that strengthen VAFs' specialized functions, such as increasing states of anergy and exploring anti-inflammatory treatments that could protect these cellular peacekeepers from being overwhelmed by inflammation. The work also has broader implications for understanding other autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation, where similar tolerance mechanisms may be at play. As researchers advance these findings from laboratory discoveries to clinical applications, they aspire to develop personalized treatments that work with the body's own protective systems rather than against them and potentially improve the outlook for millions at risk for type 1 diabetes. In collaboration with Scripps Research Assistant Professor Joseph Jardine, the team aims to more deeply study and understand the role of VAFs as pancreatic cell peacekeepers. They also hope to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance or restore VAFs' protective functions when overwhelmed by inflammation. This way, treatment options could prevent type 1 diabetes by strengthening the body's own tolerance mechanisms, rather than broadly suppressing immunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When older adults living in nursing homes are prescribed the pain medicine tramadol alongside certain antidepressants, their risk of seizures may go up, according to a study published October 8, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. While this study found a link between using the medications together and an increased risk of seizures, it does not prove one causes the other. We found a modest but measurable increase in the risk of seizures when tramadol was taken with antidepressants that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme. Yu-Jung Jenny Wei, PhD, study author, The Ohio State University, Columbus Researchers analyzed 10 years of Medicare data to identify 70,156 nursing home residents age 65 and older who had been prescribed both tramadol and an antidepressant. Of participants, 11,162 people took tramadol first and then an antidepressant with it, while 58,994 people took an antidepressant first and then added tramadol. Seizure rates for people who took tramadol first were 16 seizures per 100 person-years, and for people who took antidepressants first, the rate was 20 seizures per 100 person-years. This means for every 100 people who used both tramadol and an antidepressant followed for one year, about 16 or 20 received a seizure diagnosis. In both groups, researchers then compared seizure rates between those who took tramadol with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants and those who took tramadol with antidepressants that do not inhibit the enzyme. In those who took tramadol first and added an antidepressant, the rate was 18 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 16 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants. In those who took antidepressants first and added tramadol, the rate was 22 seizures per 100 person-years for those taking CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants compared to 20 seizures per 100 person-years in people taking other antidepressants. To help ensure the differences were not due to other health issues, the researchers adjusted for factors such as pain levels, depression symptoms, physical function and cognitive ability. After adjustments, for people who took tramadol first, seizure risk was 9% higher when taking it with a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to with an antidepressant that did not inhibit this enzyme. For those who took an antidepressant first and added tramadol, the risk was about 6% higher for people who took a CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressant compared to people who took an antidepressant that did not inhibit the enzyme. To test whether this interaction was specific to tramadol, the researchers repeated the analysis using hydrocodone, another opioid pain reliever that is unlikely to cause seizure risk when used with antidepressants. No increased seizure risk was observed with hydrocodone and CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants. "Doctors should be aware of potential seizure risks when prescribing tramadol with antidepressants, particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Given how commonly both are prescribed to older adults, these interactions may be more important than previously thought." A limitation of the study was that medication data came from prescription records, which did not confirm whether patients took the drugs as directed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How can we explain the erratic, reckless, or even aggressive behavior of certain people in the public spotlight? An international research team consisting of members from Freie Universität Berlin, Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, and University Psychiatric Clinics Basel has investigated the specific psychodynamic mechanisms constituting the distinguishing features of personality disorders. Its findings could help to explain the factors underlying erratic, narcissistic, or even aggressive behavior. The research team demonstrated that particular difficulties, such as problems establishing closeness and mutually satisfying relationships, a fragile or unstable self-image, struggles in understanding the experiences and motives of others, and primitive defense mechanisms (for example, attacking others when experiencing negative emotions or blaming uninvolved parties, a mechanism called projection), are central features of personality disorders. These psychological mechanisms may offer short-term protection from distressing emotions, but significantly impair relationships and social life in the long run. Such patterns are often rooted in adverse childhood experiences. It not only provides new scientific insights into the development and nature of personality disorders, but could also inform potential approaches in therapy and prevention. A better understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed, especially in a time when political and societal crises are so often characterized by escalating conflicts, splitting, projection, a fear of vulnerability and intimacy, and a lack of empathy."
