Alexander Zverev heaped fuel on the ensuing fire soon thereafter, revealing how he “hated” how uniform surfaces had become, and he endorsed Federer's theory of favoritism.

We try to adapt ourselves in every situation. It was partly due to those serving duels hosted by Wimbledon in the pre-2001 years, before it switched the surface to a rougher (slower) ryegrass.

Changes continued: In 2008, the ITF put pace limitations on courts that could be used by host nations in Davis Cup ties. Unfortunately, there is no commonly embraced or understood yardstick for court speed, and the entire business can become very confusing if you venture down the data rabbit hole.The ITF does a sophisticated Court Pace Rating (CPR) based on laboratory and actual on-site testing with various scientific instruments. It groups those ratings in five categories, just like hurricanes: The five categories range from slow to fast, with 10-point gradations within each, topping out at 50.Thus, a French Open rating of, say, 23, falls into category 2 (slow, but not extremely so) while a typical Australian Open rating of 42 puts it in the medium-fast category 4. By CPR metrics, most hard-court Masters events in 2024 fell into the "medium" or "medium-fast" categories of 3 to 5, Paris leading the way with a CPR of 45.5 (category 5). The Indian Wells Masters nestled in alongside Roland Garros in category 2.The other way to establish a quantifiable court speed is “predictive,” based on data-driven, match-play metrics including aces, unreturned serve, rally length. Broadcasters rely on researchers and entities like Hawkeye to create a more dynamic Court Pace Index (CPI), showing the real-world result of surface speed. These ratings generally align with CPR values.The Tennis Abstract website has its own surface speed rating, also created by match-play metrics and statistics. It uses the number “1” to represent average court speed. By TA metrics, the 15 fastest tournaments (led by Basel, with a rating of 1.54) include only two Masters events (Paris Indoor, No. The ITF does a sophisticated Court Pace Rating (CPR) based on laboratory and actual on-site testing with various scientific instruments.

Their opinions on a specific court often end up all over the board, heavily influenced by considerations ranging from ambient conditions to how well—or badly—an individual happens to be playing. The US Open was a toss-up, as far as opinions went.John Isner, the godfather of servebots, logged some of his best Grand Slam results in Paris—and not indoors, but at Roland Garros. He can explain how slow courts counter-intuitively help big and tall players who serve better than they move. It just seems to me that some get faster and maybe some are slower.”Note to Roger: perhaps it's time to speed up those Laver Cup courts, even if the days of lightning fast indoor and outdoor courts are a thing of the past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the years, it has constantly attracted the game's biggest names and produced some of its most memorable battles. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings have triumphed in Shanghai: Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner. Two from that illustrious quintet are in the midst of deep runs at this year's event: Medvedev, who will face Alex de Minaur Friday in the quarter-finals, and Djokovic, who will meet surprise package World No. 1s who have lifted the trophy in Shanghai. Murray's Triple Spark Murray made Shanghai his playground with back-to-back titles in 2010-11, before returning in 2016 for one of the most important victories of his career. 2, Murray had already built momentum with titles in Rome, Queen's Club, Wimbledon and Beijing. But the Briton didn't stop there: He stormed through the field without dropping a set to complete his Shanghai hat-trick and later extended his winning streak to 24 matches to earn his lone ATP Year-End No. Djokovic's 2012 Breakthrough & Record Trophy Haul Djokovic denied Murray's bid for a Shanghai three-peat in unforgettable fashion in 2012. After semi-final runs in 2009-10, Djokovic stormed through the field upon return to Shanghai two years later to set a clash with Murray in the final. Across three hours, 21 minutes of battle, Djokovic clawed back from a set and a break down — saving five championship points en route — to seize his first Shanghai crown. With his victory, he also avenged his recent US Open final defeat to Murray one month prior and took a 9-7 lead in their rapidly growing Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry. Djokovic successfully defended his title in 2013 and won a further two trophies in 2015 and 2018, making him the tournament's most decorated champion. Novak Djokovic defeats Andy Murray in the 2012 Shanghai final. In his opening match against Leonardo Mayer, the Swiss star saved five match points before surviving a tense third-set tie-break. “I feel unbelievable prestige to win this event. Especially putting my hands on the trophy for the first time is a good feeling, I must say,” said Federer, who returned three years later to capture his second Shanghai title, and 27th ATP Masters 1000 crown. Roger Federer in action during the 2014 Shanghai final. Medvedev's Masterclass Medvedev had already hinted at his potential in Shanghai when he pushed Federer to three sets in 2018, but it was the following year when he fully delivered on that promise. 4, and a completely different player, Medvedev dominated the field with a near-flawless display of power and consistency to clinch his first title in Shanghai. He capped his run with consecutive wins over two of his greatest rivals, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev, in the semi-final and final, respectively. He dropped just one set en route to a championship-match clash with record champion Djokovic. Yet with fearless execution and unwavering focus, Sinner toppled the Serbian 7-6(4), 6-3 and snapped his perfect 4-0 streak in Shanghai finals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It all adds up for Felix Auger-Aliassime, who has been one of the game's most popular players since making his ATP Tour main-draw debut in 2018 in Rotterdam — the same event where he won his first tour-level title in 2022. Every season and every match is part of a memorable story that the 25-year-old continues to write, with his current quarter-final run at the Rolex Shanghai Masters the latest chapter. ATPTour.com caught up with the Canadian earlier in the year to discuss his successes, challenges, rivals, idols and more. What is the biggest success of your career? At the end of 2022, I had this win streak — it was 16 matches. That whole stretch was probably what I am most proud of. I could have a great tournament, then I could lose early in the next tournament. To top it off with the Davis Cup was a moment I am definitely really proud of. What is the biggest difficulty you've had to overcome in your career? You can go to work and you can play, but the most difficult part is not the physical part, it's figuring it out with yourself and your team. “What do I actually need to improve? Who would you say your greatest rival is? I would say Stefanos Tsitsipas because it's two-sided. There are guys that I have struggled to get a win over for a long time, like Medvedev. With Tsitsipas, we have gone back and forth over the years, even since we were juniors. I liked Novak and Andy growing up. It was interesting because they both have a counter-punching game. I felt like they were really trying to find ways to outsmart the other guy, and they had a lot of rallies so it was always interesting to watch. You could see how physically demanding it was. Those were fun to watch in Slams. What is your favourite tournament to play and why? It's just a beautiful place to play tennis. It's the only tournament we have in New Zealand, and I feel like it's such a unique part of the world. Sometimes you play these tournaments in common countries for tennis, but New Zealand is out there. What's been the coolest experience of being a tennis player? Meeting my idols from when I was growing up, that's the coolest thing. You can travel to places, but meeting people who I saw growing up — the likes of Roger, Rafa, Novak and Andy — that's pretty unique. What is the biggest goal you have been chasing? They are the biggest categories of tournament and the toughest to win, so if you do capture one in your career, that's huge. I think capturing a medal goes beyond your sport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek beat Belinda Bencic 7-6 (2), 6-4 to reach the Wuhan quarterfinals, and Coco Gauff booked her spot in the final eight with a routine 6-3, 6-2 win over Zhang Shuai. Gauff was a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Chinese wild card Zhang Shuai, while Swiatek defeated No. 7 Jasmine Paolini, who came back to defeat No. Gauff has an unexpected match against unseeded Laura Siegemund, who advanced with a 6-4, 7-6 (2) win over Magdalena Frech. Playing Wuhan for the first time, Swiatek has looked a lot like a six-time Grand Slam champion. The win over Bencic was the 125th WTA 1000 victory of her young career, and Friday will be her 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal. Swiatek finished with eight aces and converted four of six break-point opportunities in a match that clocked in at 2 hours and 8 minutes. “For sure I wanted to play with confidence and make great decisions and not let her dictate,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview after the match. I'm happy that I was there in the deciding moments to be solid and play one more shot.” This was Swiatek's fifth win in six matches against Bencic, but it did not come easily. Since giving birth to daughter Bella in the spring of 2024, the Swiss player has steadily returned to her championship form. She was the winner in Abu Dhabi back in February and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Swiatek. After dropping the first three games to Swiatek, Bencic came back to win five of six games and found herself serving for the first set at 5-4. Two loose forehands, however, gave Swiatek the equalizing break. Bencic has made a career of taking the ball early, playing fast and aggressively. But in this instance, Swiatek was sharper. With Bencic serving at 2-4, Swiatek was standing inside the baseline when she sent a first serve back with an eye-opening forehand winner. A snappy forehand winner, followed by another faulty forehand from Bencic, gave her the decisive break. At 21, some 15 years younger than Shuai, Gauff scored a break in the sixth game of the opening set and was never seriously threatened. Through two matches, Gauff has dropped only six games. Into her second consecutive quarterfinal in Wuhan, Gauff has now won all four matches against Shuai; over the past three years, no woman has won more times (19) in China. “It was a little bit up and down,” Gauff acknowledged in her on-court interview. “But happy to be into the next round.” Swiatek, 24, is looking for her 12th career WTA 1000 title. Swiatek has won all six previous matches against Paolini, five of them in straight sets. It's customary for players to thank fans at the championship trophy ceremony, but after her opening win Swiatek felt compelled to express her appreciation to the crowd. “I think it's always nice to get support during the match,” Swiatek explained. And now, she'll live to experience that support for at least another day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina. We're down to the final eight at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, a shorter-than-usual WTA 1000 tournament (didn't it just start?) There's plenty on the line as we enter the weekend: the final three spots in the WTA Finals are still up for grabs, and it's one last opportunity to take home a signature title (Finals aside) and snag 1,000 ranking points. There are plenty of familiar faces in the quarterfinals, including six players who have won WTA 1000 titles already. Might as well call her the queen of Wuhan. It was a fitting tournament for the World No. 1 to return to the Hologic WTA Tour post-US Open, as she's been dominant here in ways we've rarely ever seen. She's improved to 19-0 here with wins over Rebecca Sramkova -- she did need three sets to win that one -- and 16th seed Liudmila Samsonova, and appears to be in form after some much-needed R&R in Greece. Needing to pick up wins to quality for the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Rybakina has has a productive week thus far following an earlier-than-expected exit in Beijing. After beating Jaqueline Cristian in her opening match, the World No. 9 had a rather easy time with Linda Noskova, who was coming off a run to the final at the China Open. 8 on the WTA Finals leaderboard, by a slim margin. Siniakova, on the other hand, has already gotten five. After defeating American Caty McNally and China's Wang Yafan to get into the main draw, the 29-year-old upset 15th-seeded Diana Shnaider before taking out Maya Joint and Iva Jovic. As for her last straight setter, we can help: It was on Sept. 27, a 6-0, 6-3 win over Ajla Tomljanovic in Beijing. Since then, the American has played a ridiculous six three setters, winning five of them. She narrowly escaped her first match against countrywoman Hailey Baptiste, saving six match points and eking out the deciding tiebreaker 8-6. Her second match wasn't quite as excruciating, but certainly no walk in the park. She came back from 5-2 down in the opening set to take it, then dropped the next one before winning yet another third set. She came back from 4-1 down in both the first and second sets to win 6-4, 7-6 (2). Siegemund is also into the doubles quarterfinal, partnering with Fanny Stollar. The American is into her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal in as many weeks, and has gotten to the final eight in Wuhan with ease. She dropped just one game in her dominant effort against Moyuka Uchijima, and then followed it up with a routine win over the ageless wonder Zhang Shuai. Already qualified for the WTA Finals, and admittedly feeling less pressure post-Slam season, the 21-year-old should be loose and rested for her quarterfinal match. 8 spot on the WTA Finals leaderboard, the Italian has taken care of business this week with three-set wins over Yuan Yue and 10th-seeded Clara Tauson, who retired trailing 3-1 in the third set. (Kudos to Paolini, always empathetic and caring, for being a great sport after the match.) A year after making two Grand Slam finals, the 29-year-old has matched her career-high win total (40) from last year. She'll need a few more to secure her spot in Riyadh. (It is worth nothing that she's already punched her ticket in the WTA Finals doubles field, alongside partner and countrywoman Sara Errani.) Swiatek just won her 125th match at a WTA 1000 tournament. But alas, it's true, a testament to how incredibly dominant she's been over her relatively young career. But back to Wuhan ... the six-time Grand Slam champion, playing here for the first time, dropped just two games in her opening-round win over Marie Bouzkova, and though she won Thursday's match in straights as well, it wasn't easy. She needed a tiebreak to win the first set over Belinda Bencic, who served for it at 5-4, before ultimately prevailing 7-6 (2), 6-4 in 2 hours and 8 minutes. She's now into the 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career. It's round 13 for the Grand Slam champions and perennial Top 10 players. Rybakina won the most previous matchup, a 6-1, 6-4 upset this summer in Cincinnati. Can she pull off another upset against the greatest player in this tournament's history? Siniakova came through qualifying to get here, and Pegula has played what feels like 50 straight grueling three setters. 6 in the PIF WTA Rankings, is the obvious favorite, especially considering she's won four of their five previous matchups. They played once this year, a 6-2, 6-3 Pegula win on grass in Bad Homburg. Gauff defeated Shuai, some 15 years her senior in the third round. Now she'll play an even older player in 37-year-old Siegemund. It's an interesting observation -- and it speaks to the incredible longevity that we see on tour now -- but it doesn't say a whole lot about this particular match, especially considering Siegemund came from behind to beat 18-year-old Andreeva earlier this week. What is relevant, though, is the fact that Gauff hasn't spent much time on court this week, dropping just six games in two matches, and no woman has won more matches in China over the past three years. They've split their two career meetings, the most recent of which was at the US Open two years ago. Gauff won that first-round match in three sets. Swiatek has utterly dominated the Italian in her career, winning all six of their matchups and dropping just one set in the process. Two of those wins have come this year, the most recent of which was a 7-5, 6-4 victory for Swiatek in the Cincinnati final this summer. We're down to the final 8 at the Wuhan Open, led by Top 10 players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The emotions set in for Valentin Vacherot moments after he completed his fifth comeback win from a set down at the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters to become the first player born in Monaco to reach an ATP Tour semi-final. It was his third main-draw win from a set down and fifth overall including two qualifying matches. He will next face four-time champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.

It was just an unreal moment for me. Still feels like there are still a few people with me here, and also ready to tomorrow to cheer on Arthur." 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Friday, knew his cousin would one day join him in the Top 100. "I wasn't doubting at all, but I was waiting for this moment for a long time," said Frenchman Rinderknech. "I can't wait to have a full year with him on the Tour and the following years." 110 in the PIF ATP Rankings on June 24, 2024. But a right shoulder injury forced him to be sidelined for most of the final seven months of the season, during which he played in just two tournaments, and none after retiring in the second round of qualifying at the US Open. "I had a really tough one last year when I got hurt after Roland Garros in May, being 30 points away from the Top 100, just sitting on the couch, seeing myself not moving in the rankings, and then after going down," said Vacherot, who finished last season at No. "I knew it wasn't going to be easy this year to get back at the ranking. Even before this tournament I was ranked at 204, so it's still really far from the Top 100." On the original qualifying cutoff list in Shanghai, Vacherot was 22 spots from getting into the draw. And when he arrived in the city on the Thursday night before qualifying began on Monday, he was still nine spots out. He learned less than 36 hours before qualifying began that he would make it into the draw. "I knew there was a big chance because Shanghai is one of the last Masters 1000s [of the year] and a few guys, if you're hurt at the end of the season, you are not taking risks. "I said, worst of all, I was going to be here one week earlier, because I was going to play five more Challengers after," he said. "Now I'm just going to go home after this tournament, so it's another funny story. I said to myself, if I don't get in, I just train in the conditions of China for just one week and just be ready for after." His half-brother Benjamin Balleret has been coaching him since 2022 and knows what the Top 100 milestone means. "There was the injury last year and we were so close from the Top 100," said Balleret. "You have to start all over again and so it was very difficult for him to accept. It's a bit emotional because he's my brother and I see him grow and I know that he wants it so much. “Sometimes I feel he wants it too much. He came back from college and had zero points. He believed in my experience to help him. Rinderknech was in the player guest box on Thursday and was proud of his cousin's resilience. "He was really fighting throughout the match today and he found a way, a little bit like his previous round. “It's a single sport, so a lot of variables, and if any of them is not at 100 percent, nowadays everybody is just so close level-wise that it showed." Rinderknech and Vacherot played two and a-half seasons at Texas A&M University and their coach from those days, former ATP pro Steve Denton, was watching the final two sets at home around 3 a.m. "He is quite a fighter and the thing I always admired about Val is he never gave up and he went for it in the big moments," said Denton. "It was great to see his resilience and he went for it late in the tie-breaker and that was ultimately the difference. I couldn't be prouder of him and his brother Ben. They have been through a lot together and Val has learned his lessons well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini also bolstered their bids to reach the WTA Finals Riyadh. It'll be Aryna Sabalenka vs. Elena Rybakina XIII in the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals. 1 seed Sabalenka needed just 1 hour and 15 minutes to defeat No. 8 seed Rybakina followed with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Beijing finalist Linda Noskova. Three-time Wuhan champion Sabalenka extended her unbeaten record at the tournament to 19-0, and her active winning streak to eight matches. Neither even faced a break point -- despite landing just 49% of first serves, in Rybakina's case. She conceded just 10 points behind her delivery in total; Samsonova could only once muster multiple points on return in a single game. Rybakina was pushed harder, but won all four deuce points (across three separate games) that she played in the match. The 20-year-old Czech, bidding to reach back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals, managed to save the first six break points she faced with clutch aggressive play, and overall fended off 10 out of 12. But at 4-3 in the first set, it was lucky number seven for Rybakina as Noskova double faulted to drop serve for the first time. How has the Sabalenka vs. Rybakina rivalry broken down so far? Their quarterfinal on Friday will be something of a full-circle moment: Sabalenka and Rybakina first faced each other (at pro level) at the same stage of the same tournament back in 2019. Sabalenka won that match 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, the first of four three-set wins in a row to start their rivalry -- including a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph in the 2023 Australian Open final, the only major title match they have contested so far. However, once Rybakina got on the board with a 7-6(11), 6-4 win in the 2023 Indian Wells final, she has begun turning it in her favour. The Kazakhstani player has won five of their last eight meetings, and in fact leads the head-to-head on outdoor hard courts 5-4 overall -- Sabalenka has not defeated Rybakina on hard courts since the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun. The last time they played, Rybakina needed just 75 minutes to wrap up a 6-1, 6-4 win in the Cincinnati quarterfinals in August. Match length is another factor to keep an eye on. Four of Rybakina's five wins in the series have come in straight sets; the only time she has won a decider against Sabalenka was at the 2024 WTA Finals Riyadh, where she came through 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. By contrast, all seven of Sabalenka's wins have been three-setters, including a 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(6) escape from quadruple match point down in this year's Berlin quarterfinals. How is Rybakina's bid to make the WTA Finals Riyadh faring? As well as Rybakina, Jessica Pegula came through 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 over Ekaterina Alexandrova and Jasmine Paolini advanced after a right thigh injury forced Clara Tauson to retire trailing 3-6, 6-1, 3-1. The exits of both 11th-placed Tauson and 15th-placed Noskova have also helped. Pegula's win also means that neither Paolini nor Rybakina can overtake her this week. However, seventh-placed Mirra Andreeva -- who lost her Wuhan opener to Laura Siegemund on Tuesday -- is in their sights. Rybakina needs to advance further than Paolini to overtake the Italian this week; if they lose in the same round, Paolini will remain ahead. Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini also bolstered their bids to reach the WTA Finals Riyadh.</p>

The 38-year-old edged through back-to-back three-setters against Yannick Hanfmann and Jaume Munar to reach only his second Masters 1000 quarterfinal of the season, having largely sat out the Masters for the last several seasons.Djokovic was inspired to expand his calendar following a US Open semifinal defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, betting on his mental strength to better hold up over the Masters' best-of-three format. So far, that gamble has paid off in Shanghai, where he gained the mental ascendency over an inspired but erratic Bergs.A 26-year-old from Lommel, Bergs has enjoyed a career-best season, reaching his first two ATP finals and earning a career-high ranking of No. 44 following a third-round finish at the US Open. He reached his first Masters quarterfinal with impressive upsets of No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo, surviving the latter in a third-set tiebreaker.Djokovic naturally proved a steeper challenge as the Serb eased through the opening set and appeared to have the match wrapped up when he scored a crucial break in the ninth game of the second.Bergs pulled off a Houdiniesque comeback to level the set at five games apiece, but Djokovic battled right back, winning a lung-busting rally to earn a break point in the following game. Serving for the match a second time, Djokovic earned a pair of match points only for Bergs to save both and turn the tables once again with a break point opportunity.

So far, that gamble has paid off in Shanghai, where he gained the mental ascendency over an inspired but erratic Bergs.A 26-year-old from Lommel, Bergs has enjoyed a career-best season, reaching his first two ATP finals and earning a career-high ranking of No. 44 following a third-round finish at the US Open. He reached his first Masters quarterfinal with impressive upsets of No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo, surviving the latter in a third-set tiebreaker.Djokovic naturally proved a steeper challenge as the Serb eased through the opening set and appeared to have the match wrapped up when he scored a crucial break in the ninth game of the second.Bergs pulled off a Houdiniesque comeback to level the set at five games apiece, but Djokovic battled right back, winning a lung-busting rally to earn a break point in the following game.

Djokovic saved it with a strong serve and quickly earned a third match point, a final miss from Bergs sealing the deal for the 24-time Grand Slam champion in just under two hours.Up next for Djokovic is the 204th-ranked Vacherot, one half of the ATP tour's newly minted dynamic cousin duo alongside France's Arthur Rinderknech. "I've known him for last couple of years," Djokovic said. He's playing for Monaco, which is a really great success, the biggest historical success for Monaco. We know we have one of the nicest and biggest tournaments in our sport there in Monaco. He kind of plays quite similar to Rinderknech, you know. And I see that they're quite close. The serve particularly reminds me of Arthur as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula has made a habit of winning three-set matches lately and continued the trend Thursday, defeating No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just over two hours to advance to the quarterfinals in Wuhan for the first time. “But I've been competing really hard and I've been playing a lot of really good players. It was different conditions today with the roof closed and I think it took us a little while to get adjusted, but then I felt like it was a really high level there for the rest of the match. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in 2 hours and 6 minutes, advancing to the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open quarterfinals for the first time in her career. Pegula improved to 3-3 in the head-to-head against Alexandrova, earning her first win over the Russian on a surface other than clay. Here are some takeaways following another Pegula three-set victory: With Alexandrova serving at 5-5, 15-30 in the first set, Pegula capped off a 12-shot rally with a blistering backhand winner to earn a break point, she converted, securing a 6-5 lead to allow her to serve for the set. It was the fourth of five straight games won by Pegula in her opening-set comeback. What followed was a defensive masterclass by Pegula. She chased down multiple would-be winners -- including a smash -- and ended an 18-shot rally with a forehand winner to earn another break point. 🎾@JPegula comes out on top against Alexandrova winning 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 💪#WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/BLw0gEFp2d Three is key: Winning three-setters has become a habit for Pegula, albeit an unintentional one. Thursday's match marked her sixth consecutive three-setter, dating back to her third-round clash with Emma Raducanu last week in Beijing. Only Madison Keys (15) has won more three-setters than Pegula this year. Quarterfinal staple: With Thursday's win, Pegula has now reached the quarterfinals of a WTA event 10 times this season. Only Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka (13 each) have more. She is 7-2 in quarterfinal matches thus far this season, coincidentally with both losses coming against Alexandrova.
