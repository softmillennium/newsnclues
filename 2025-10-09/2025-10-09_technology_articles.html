All of the examples you mentioned are derivatives of the Phoenician alphabet, which have around 20 to 30 characters each. Even with case sensitiveness and diacritics, I think they still add up to under a hundred characters.Cuneiform character sets are in the order of magnitude of the several hundreds or even thousands, depending on the language[1], so I imagine that the experience is closer to learning to read Chinese or Japanese and less like Hebrew and Greek.That being said, I've never tried to learn neither cuneiform or hanzi, so I'm just guessing based on the number of characters.

Writing has only been invented independently a few times in history, so it seems reasonable that cuneiform could be the first. Why do we not see more writing in the archeological record? Or perhaps it was written on media that's subject to decay? If some society developed writing on tree bark 100,000 years ago, none of that is going to survive and we'd never know.

You might want a superfast M.2 SSD for gaming or booting Windows on your PC, but what if you just want the most economical storage solution possible? Seagate's BarraCuda range is synonymous with massive storage at low cost, and right now you can score its 24TB version for just $249 at Newegg, the cheapest this drive has ever been, and $10 less than the last time we highlighted it. While we have previously reviewed the Seagate Barracuda 8TB HDD, the 24TB version, which is faster and doesn't use SMR tech, isn't a fair comparison. While not our favorite HDD by any stretch, you'll struggle to find this much storage for $249 anywhere else. To give you an idea, this is six times the capacity of a similarly priced 4TB M.2 SSD, and should be considered an economy-of-scale purchase accordingly. This is an excellent option for anyone looking to expand their storage capacity without incurring significant costs. It operates at 7200 RPMs and can achieve transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s. As noted, a 7200 RPM HDD isn't a drive for those who want speed and performance, but the transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s — and SATA 6GB/s connectivity — are respectable enough given the capacity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reflection AI, a startup founded just last year by two former Google DeepMind researchers, has raised $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation, a whopping 15x leap from its $545 million valuation just seven months ago. The company, which originally focused on autonomous coding agents, is now positioning itself as both an open source alternative to closed frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, and a Western equivalent to Chinese AI firms like DeepSeek. Their background developing these very advanced AI systems is central to their pitch, which is that the right AI talent can build frontier models outside established tech giants. Along with its new round, Reflection AI announced that it has recruited a team of top talent from DeepMind and OpenAI, and built an advanced AI training stack that it promises will be open for all. Perhaps most importantly, Reflection AI says it has “identified a scalable commercial model that aligns with our open intelligence strategy.” Reflection AI has secured a compute cluster and hopes to release a frontier language model next year that's trained on “tens of trillions of tokens,” he told TechCrunch. “We built something once thought possible only inside the world's top labs: a large-scale LLM and reinforcement learning platform capable of training massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models at frontier scale,” Reflection AI wrote in a post on X. With this milestone unlocked, we're now bringing these methods to general agentic reasoning.” DeepSeek had a breakthrough moment when it figured out how to train these models at scale in an open way, followed by Qwen, Kimi, and other models in China. “DeepSeek and Qwen and all these models are our wake-up call because if we don't do anything about it, then effectively, the global standard of intelligence will be built by someone else,” Laskin said. Laskin added that this puts the U.S. and its allies at a disadvantage because enterprises and sovereign states often won't use Chinese models due to potential legal repercussions. Clem Delangue, co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face, an open and collaborative platform for AI builders, told TechCrunch of the round, “This is indeed great news for American open-source AI.” Added Delangue, “Now the challenge will be to show high velocity of sharing of open AI models and datasets (similar to what we're seeing from the labs dominating in open-source AI).” Laskin said Reflection AI would release model weights — the core parameters that determine how an AI system works — for public use while largely keeping datasets and full training pipelines proprietary. “The infrastructure stack, only a select handful of companies can actually use that.” Reflection AI hasn't yet released its first model, which will be largely text-based, with multimodal capabilities in the future, according to Laskin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law new legislation that will give Californians the ability to easily opt out of digital data collection with a simple portal that should apply to all websites in their browser. The move promises to make the state's digital privacy protections that much easier to take advantage of, and could set a new precedent for future privacy regulations. In a press release shared this week, Newsom's office announced the passage of two new laws, SB 361 and AB 566, that will strengthen the state's landmark California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA, created in 2018, notably gave state residents the ability to request that companies share with them—but also delete—information that had been collected about them as part of their business practices. While the CCPA did, indeed, force companies—for the first time—to give web users a certain amount of control over their data, the mechanisms by which that control can be exerted have always been quite imperfect. In other words, loopholes in the law have created a situation in which every single time a web user visits a website, they are forced to go through the annoying process of selecting their privacy preferences. In some cases, companies have capitalized on this process by making it confusing or difficult to navigate, thus tilting the scales in their favor. Now, however, due to the passage of AB 566, Californians should—theoretically—be able to opt out of all data collection via a simple portal made available through their web browser. The legislation “helps consumers exercise their opt-out rights” under the CCPA by “requiring browsers to include a setting to send websites an opt-out preference signal to enable Californians to opt out of third-party sales of their data at one time instead of on each individual website,” Newsom's press release states. This is a great step towards giving web users more control over their data, although—given that the bill was just passed into law—it's not yet clear how the regulation will manifest for consumers. In recent years, the state has also taken strides towards improving its ability to police and punish companies for infringing upon this law. Currently, enforcement is operated through the state Attorney General's office. Also signed into law this week was SB 361, which is designed to strengthen California's already existing data broker registry. The law will give consumers “more information about the personal information collected by data brokers and who may have access to consumers' data,” Newsom's office said. He shot down the last major AI safety framework. The move is the latest to underscore how Silicon Valley's deep-pocketed executives are increasingly wielding influence in California politics and beyond. The tech company said it would launch a legal probe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's a new element of the East Coast vs. West Coast beef: The City of New York is reaching across the country to sue tech giants headquartered in California over allegations that their platforms have created a youth mental health crisis. The city, along with its school districts and health department, alleges that “gross negligence” on the part of Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance has gotten kids hooked on social media, which has created a “public nuisance” that is placing a strain on the city's resources. In a 327-page complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the city alleges that tech companies have designed their platforms in a way that seeks to “maximize the number of children” using them, and have built “algorithms that wield user data as a weapon against children and fuel the addiction machine.” The city also alleges that these companies “know children and adolescents are in a developmental stage that leaves them particularly vulnerable to the addictive effects of these features,” but “target them anyway, in pursuit of additional profit.” The claims that social media is addictive to underage users aren't necessarily new. New York state, in fact, is part of a coalition of states that have sued social media companies for allegedly exploiting young users. But the New York City suit does bring some unique and jurisdiction-specific information. It cites data from the New York City Police Department, for instance, that show at least 16 teens have died while “subway surfing”—riding outside of a moving train—a dangerous behavior which the lawsuit claims has been encouraged by social media trends. Two girls, ages 12 and 13, died earlier this month while subway surfing. It also cited survey data collected from New York high school students, which shows that 77.3% of the city's teens spend three or more hours per day on screens, which it claims has contributed to lost sleep and, in turn, absences from school—corroborated by the city's school districts, which provided data to show that 36.2% of all public school students are considered chronically absent, missing at least 10% of the school year. According to Reuters, this lawsuit from New York City is part of a larger effort by other governments to hold social media firms accountable. The city withdrew a previous lawsuit, announced by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024, to join this wider effort in federal court. “These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works, and the allegations are simply not true. “We've also developed dedicated tools like Supervised Experiences for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.” Gizmodo reached out to Meta, Snap, and ByteDance for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA employees are bracing for layoffs and budget cuts as the congressional dispute over government funding drags on, threatening several crucial space missions—including some that are already in space. Earlier this week, hundreds of space advocates met with Congress to try and salvage NASA's funding, according to The Planetary Society. The White House's proposed budget for 2026, released in May, would reduce NASA's funding by $6 billion compared to 2025. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed that layoffs were imminent this month, although it is unclear how many workers might be affected, according the Los Angeles Times. The federally funded research center in La Cañada Flintridge, California has already endured two rounds of layoffs that impacted 855 of its employees. “NASA would continue to support Artemis operations during any funding lapse,” the agency wrote in a statement prior to the shutdown. NASA's ground teams will also continue to operate its current science missions. But not all its spacecraft are accounted for. NASA's Juno mission, launched in 2011 to study Jupiter and its moons, surpassed its latest extension deadline during the shutdown and it's not clear whether the spacecraft is still operational. It remains unclear whether Juno will survive this. NASA's OSIRIS-APEX mission, on the other hand, has been saved, Ars Technica reported. OSIRIS-APEX was one of 19 operational missions threatened to be shut down under Trump's proposed budget. We still don't know exactly how much funding NASA will have available for each of its science missions going forward. Earlier in September, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee expressed support for several NASA missions under threat by the proposed budget cuts. The House's commerce, justice, and science budget bill, which allocates funding to federal agencies like NASA, secured more than $24.8 billion for NASA. The report did not, however, allocate a specific amount of funds to go toward these missions, but it did indicate the committee's overall support. The last government shutdown in 2018 lasted for 35 days. It's still not clear how long the ongoing shutdown will last. That means it could be days or weeks until the fate of many of NASA's most critical space-faring missions becomes known. "If you have a fetus in your placenta then something has gone quite wrong," one Bluesky user noted. The work of a public media icon will go towards helping public media stations in their hour of need. More than 50 years after the Apollo 17 Moon rocks returned to Earth, researchers are still uncovered surprising new details about their composition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The developer behind Eyes Up, one of the many Immigration and Customs Enforcement-related apps removed by Apple in recent days, was busy on Wednesday evening at a local planning session for the nationwide “No Kings” protest, scheduled for later this month. Mark's app, a platform built to serve as a repository for videos and other materials documenting ICE activity, is not alone in getting kicked off Apple's App Store. Earlier in October, ICEBlock was among the first ICE-related apps Apple removed. The decision followed claims from US attorney general Pam Bondi that such tools endanger ICE officers. Apple has also removed other tracking apps—including Red Dot and DEICER—as well as Eyes Up. Like Mark, ICEBlock's developer, Joshua Aaron, is determined to reverse the app store bans. Regarding Eyes Up, Mark says he has already appealed Apple's decision to delist the app, twice.“I will appeal every single time they reject me, until it's back in the App Store,” he says. I'm not gonna let off the gas with Apple.” Rafael Concepcion, who was previously a professor at Syracuse University, first designed DEICER to be a “rights app,” with the ICE-location map added on as an accountability tool. Concepcion was heavily inspired by musician Peter Gabriel and his WITNESS organization, started in the 1990s, that documented human rights violations. While gone from Apple's App Store, DEICER is also still available via Google Play and a website. While Apple has not yet commented on its decisions to remove ICE monitoring apps from the App Store, Migrant Insider reported this week that in the case of the DEICER iOS app, the company justified removal under a developer guideline that prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content” toward “religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups.” Google, which has also removed ICE monitoring apps in recent days, told 404 Media last week that it also considers ICE officers to be a vulnerable group. Tools that include a law enforcement monitoring or transparency mechanism are not unprecedented in mobile apps, though. In fact, Apple and Google both develop apps with these features. “I am not in favor of Apple removing ICE-tracking apps from the App Store, nor the app that simply let users archive videos of ICE,” says Riana Pfefferkorn, a policy researcher at Stanford University. “This seems like more needless kowtowing by Tim Cook.” The Apple CEO has appeared at several events with President Donald Trump and reportedly donated $1 million to attend his inauguration. Legal experts WIRED spoke with say that the ICE monitoring and documentation apps that Apple has removed from its App Store are clear examples of protected speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment. They're publishing truthful information about matters of public interest that people obtained just by witnessing public events,” says David Greene, a civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. When ICEBlock first rose to a top spot in Apple's App Store in April, the Trump administration responded by threatening to prosecute the developer. “We are looking at him,” Bondi said on Fox News of ICEBlock's Aaron. Neither the White House nor ICE immediately responded to requests for comment. Digital rights researchers say that the situation illustrates the dangers when key platforms and communication channels are centrally controlled—whether directly by governments or by other powerful entities like big tech companies. But Apple's ecosystem has always been a walled garden, an approach that the company has long touted for its security advantages, including the ability to screen more heavily for malicious apps. For years, a group of researchers and enthusiasts have tried to create “jailbreaks” for iPhones to essentially hack their own devices as a way around Apple's closed ecosystem. "The closed ecosystem motivation sort of dwindled as Apple added capabilities that previously required a jailbreak—like wallpapers, tethering, better notifications, and private mode in Safari," says longtime iOS security and jailbreak researcher Will Strafach. Stanford's Pfefferkorn warns that while US tech companies are not state-controlled, they have in her view become “happy handmaidens” when it comes to “repressing free speech and dissent.” “It's especially disappointing,” Pfefferkorn says, “coming from the company that brought us the Think Different ad campaign, which invoked MLK, Gandhi, and Muhammad Ali—none of whom would likely be big fans of ICE today.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Web Services is launching a new artificial intelligence platform for everyday business users, moving further beyond core cloud infrastructure to compete more directly against Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and AI startups. The platform, Amazon Quick Suite, was announced Thursday morning. For example, Amazon says the tools can recap emails, send messages, update project tickets, automate content creation, and build customer strategies, using a company's own data securely and privately. The company said Quick Suite has already been deployed to tens of thousands of Amazon employees — reporting that the tool has reduced complex data analysis tasks from months to minutes, for example, based on internal use. This means it must convince users to adopt its platform as an overlay on top of the tools they already use. AWS marketing chief Julia White told Bloomberg that existing customers of the Amazon Q Business AI software, which launched 18 months ago, will be encouraged to migrate to the new platform. Amazon says Quick Suite will be available in two tiers: a Professional plan starting at $20 per user per month, and an Enterprise plan at $40 with advanced features. AWS says it has rolled out the platform to hundreds of corporate beta customers, citing examples of significant cost savings and efficiency improvements.

Bambu's excellent budget 3D printer, the A1 mini, is a tiny 3D printer with great features and a Tom's Hardware Editor's Choice award. Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini. Here's a look at some of the A1 mini's specs, with standout features including automatic bed leveling. If you want an excellent, head-turning flash drive with storage aplenty, then you'll struggle to do better than the SK hynix Tube T31. Holder of our best flash drive award currently, it's essentially an M.2 SSD with a USB plug that gets you very speedy data transfers. Still on offer even though Prime Big Deal Days has finished, get one for just $118 instead of the usual $159. The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage. As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. If you've been looking for a new wireless gaming keyboard, SteelSeries' Apex Pro TKL Wireless is one of our favorites — it packs plenty of power in a compact form factor, with dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 Hall Effect switches, bright, per-key RGB lighting, and a customizable OLED display in the upper right corner. And it's currently on sale for just $124.99 at Amazon — 50% off its MSRP of $249.99, and the lowest price we've seen it at. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack. The  Apex Pro TKL Wireless's linear optical switches feature adjustable actuation (37 levels per key) — which can be adjusted individually across all keys. It sports the ever-popular TKL layout, which means it has all function keys and navigation keys — but no ten-key numberpad, so you'll have plenty of room on your desk for big mouse swipes without having to give up too much keyboard functionality. It's not Razer's absolute latest iteration, but the Basilisk V3 Pro is still a solid all-purpose gaming mouse, with Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, 11 programmable buttons, a customizable tilt wheel, and 13 zones of bright RGB lighting. Razer's flagship wireless Basilisk V3 Pro features Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, Gen-3 optical mouse switches, and 13 zones of bright RGB underglow lighting. It gets up to 110 hours of battery life and is compatible with Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle and Mouse Dock Pro. The Basilisk V3 Pro has been one of our favorite wireless gaming mice since it debuted in April 2023, and for good reason — it's got a great, comfortable, ergonomically-contoured shape that's perfect for hours-long gaming marathons. It has two thumb buttons and a trigger button on the thumb rest, as well as a tilt wheel that can switch between regular notched and free-scrolling mode. These booming speakers bring 5.1 surround to your PC in a big way. They have wireless connectivity for the rear speakers, a lifesaver, and built-in lighting that spruces up your room. You can definitely pick up on the gaming vibes with the two front speakers, each of which has four-zone RGB lighting that supports Reactive PrismSync. The two rear speakers connect wirelessly, providing you with more flexibility in their placement. There's also a wired control pod that lets you adjust RGB lighting effects, as well as Bluetooth connectivity, along with the usual audio controls like volume and mute. As for connectivity, you can choose from Bluetooth, auxiliary, optical, or USB. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller and more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor. This 49" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals that you can still get 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts. There's no better way to instantly up your audio game than by switching from a headset mic to a standalone USB gaming microphone, and now's the perfect time to do it: the HyperX QuadCast S, one of our long-time favorite gaming mics, is currently still on sale at Amazon for $79.99 — a 50% discount off MSRP, and the lowest price we've ever seen it at. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. The QuadCast S features bright, customizable RGB lighting and records sound at 48 kHz / 16-bits. It features four selectable polar patterns — cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, and omnidirectional — so it's great for capturing one person's voice but can also be used to capture multiple voices and/or ambient noise, in a pinch (though you'll still want multiple mics if you're regularly capturing multiple voices). It features on-mic controls, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct, zero-latency monitoring, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute implementation. I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is still going, which is great because this is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF. This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports. We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company first launched this feature in August with support for English and Spanish after teasing it at its Meta Connect conference last year. With Hindi and Portuguese support, Meta aims to tap into creators from its biggest markets, like India and Brazil, to have a global reach. “We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don't necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram in August. Meta said that this feature will be available for creators posting on Instagram soon. Apart from voice translations, the company is also building a way to translate text or caption stickers posted with Reels in supported languages. The company will also give an option to opt for a new version of lip-syncing that better matches the movement of your mouth. Meta's rival YouTube has been working on translation features for a few years now. Last month, the company rolled out lip-sync improvements to its auto-dubbing feature with support for 20 languages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two weeks after detailing why the Seattle economy could face ongoing troubles because of layoffs at tech giants Microsoft and Amazon, The Wall Street Journal is back this week with a look at why heading east might be the more attractive option for tech companies and their workers. “Tech Companies Can't Get Enough of This Picturesque Seattle Suburb,” WSJ headlined a mostly glowing piece about Bellevue's cleaner streets, better schools, lower crime rate, and rise in new office space that's luring companies such as TikTok, OpenAI, Snowflake and others. “Our little chunk of techy paradise, it seems as though the rest of the nation is finally catching on to what we all already know: Bellevue frickin' rocks.” “You can look out the window of our building and see the mountains,” said Warrick Taylor, a Snowflake vice president based in California, who is perhaps unaware that those same views exist in Seattle. “Like the airlines say, ‘We know you could have chosen another city, we're glad you chose us,'” Bellevue Mayor Lynn Robinson said while helping to cut the ribbon at Snowflake. The mostly friendly beef between the two municipalities has been going on for decades, and up until about seven years ago, it was largely lopsided in Seattle's favor. But in 2018, a rift opened up between Amazon and elected officials in Seattle when the City Council sought to impose a $275-per-employee “head tax” on the tech giant. While Amazon is promoting a more regional footprint for its headquarters, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell made it clear last month that he thinks Seattle still holds the edge over Bellevue, citing his city's diversity, arts, music, restaurants, and innovative history. But as Seattle's downtown core has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, with high office vacancy rates and some major retailers exiting, some in Bellevue see an opening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers who specializes in Spanish history and radicalism, has been a far-right target ever since he published Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook in 2017. But after president Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to designate antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization,” social media posts from far-right figures and a petition promoted by conservative student activists demonized Bray as an “antifa member” who was “supporting terrorist behavior." The threats, emailed from anonymous accounts and reviewed by WIRED, included a message that read: “I'll kill you in front of your students.” Another message, with the subject line “your violent rhetoric is under investigation,” listed Bray's home address where he lives with his wife and two young children. “We made the decision on Saturday [to leave the US] when our home address became known by people who want to do us harm,” says Bray. "For 20 minutes [United Airlines] couldn't even figure out what had happened,” says Bray. Bray says that he has been rebooked on flights to Spain. “We're going to try it one more time,” says Bray. “If it doesn't work, then we'll do something else.” United Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We got this from the White House and are trying to get ground truth but are not tracking anything like this from TSA or CBP,” says Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS. The list, which showcases academics that TPUSA claims are pushing leftist propaganda, has been criticized as a threat to academic freedom. Antifa is viewed by the Trump administration and many on the right as a dangerous network of violent left-wing activist groups intent on destroying US conservative values. In reality, antifa is not an organization at all, but a broad ideology embraced by antifascist activists around the world. At the time his book was published, Bray says he did receive some death threats. But it soon blew over: “The difference was that I was renting so no one found my home address, and so it just didn't reach this fever pitch,” says Bray. “But also now I have a family and so that's relevant as well.” Bray received attention in 2020, as well, when some conservative commentators blamed the protests held over the police killing of George Floyd on antifa. “Trump is trying to look for a boogeyman and using this kind of nebulous term that is misunderstood in the public eye, a convenient way for him to demonize the left and anyone who opposes his administration.” In the wake of Trump's executive order, far-right influencers once again jumped on Bray after he spoke to media outlets about Trump's order. Jack Posobiec, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist who was recently invited by the Republican National Committee to train some poll workers, called Bray a “domestic terrorist professor.” “The day after the Posobiec tweet, I received a very direct death threat saying that someone was going to kill me in front of my students,” says Bray. When asked for comment, Posobiec simply repeated the claim he made in his X post. During the event, which was also attended by secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, influencers were invited to share stories about their interactions with antifa. One speaker, far-right influencer Andy Ngo, has spent years targeting Bray online. “Bray is a financier of antifa and advocates for their violence,” Ngo wrote on X last weekend. Doyle also suggested that Bray's public comments were similar to “the kind of rhetoric that resulted in Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month.” In an update three days after she first posted the petition, Doyle said: "I do not endorse death threats, doxxing, or harassment and would not wish them on anyone, especially Mark Bray." Two days after the petition launched, Fox News ran a story about it on their website and quoted Doyle. “Fox News was trying to generate a story that would get clicks [and] when the Fox News story came out on Saturday, within a few hours I received another death threat and another threatening email that had my full address in it which very much disturbed me.” Doyle, TPUSA, and FOX News did not respond to a request for comment. Scores of Bray's former students have jumped to his defense. Bray says the Rutgers administration has been supportive, and says that he met with a dean at the university last week to discuss moving his classes to a different room on campus and taking down the public listing of his classes. “The University is aware of the Change.org petition regarding Professor Mark Bray and Dr. Bray's message to his students,” says Patti Zielinski, a spokesperson for Rutgers. While Bray says he's aware that most people who make threats online never take action, there have been enough recent instances of political violence that he thought it was “better to be safe than sorry” to temporarily relocate to Spain. Bray, who says he plans to stay in Spain until the end of academic year, made his situation public to fight back against what he sees as a concerted effort to silence anyone who speaks out about the current administration. “I don't see this as an aberration,” says Bray. “I don't think this is the end, and that's partly why I wanted to [make it public] so people can make more of an effort to plan, take collective action and protect academic freedom and the right to dissent in this country.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

It's a fairly safe bet that on any given day, at least a good dozen IT departments are trying to convince their bosses and/or users about the vital importance of backups. The event happened on September 26 and was caused by a battery fire at the National Information Resources Service datacenter in Daejeon, burning up 384 battery packs, the majority of one floor, and taking down 96 government systems. While 95 of those had backups, the G-Drive system (no relation to Google Drive), used primarily but not only by the Ministry of Personnel Management, did not. In total, it's estimated that roughly 17% of central government officials are affected, and roughly eight years' worth of data was lost. The fire promptly brought down government email, online post office, websites, complaints and petition services, and even the national 119 emergency service. A full recovery should take about a month, as reportedly the affected teams are having trouble even figuring out which specific data was lost. While a datacenter fire is an event that can happen anywhere at any time, it's more than a little puzzling to find that the G-Drive data was lost because, according to an unnamed source, "[it] couldn't have a backup due to its large capacity." 858 terabytes is a big number for a household, but barely registers in the scale of datacenter storage, where entire petabytes are doled out like candy. G-Drive is a document sharing platform, similar to Google Drive. Each employee's default quota on the system was 30 GB, and users were instructed to keep their data there instead of in the office computers, as should be the policy everywhere... when there are backups. Four people have been arrested in connection with the fire, reportedly under suspicion of criminal negligence. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Can the same ever be true of an electric car's seemingly soulless motors, batteries, and inverters? Although nameless for now, the four-door car will use a new electric platform called Elettrica. The platform is a familiar skateboard EV chassis setup, as used by almost everyone else, but with four motors instead of the more common one or two. Ferrari is claiming a range of over 323 miles, suggesting an efficiency of around 2.65 miles per kWh, excluding any mileage gained through regenerative braking. Ferrari's 122 kWh battery is one of the largest fitted to any production EV and can charge at up to 350 kW with a claimed range of over 323 miles. Today's reveal is focused on the Elettrica platform. You can't blame Ferrari for taking its time. Investors seem unfazed by the lack of an ultra-powerful EV to rival Porsche, Rimac or Lotus—and so Ferrari's share price is up 900 percent since going public a decade ago. Its customers are equally happy, frequently shelling out six-figure sums on optional upgrades alone, while understanding that limited-run specials like the F80 are sold by invitation-only, regardless of bank balance. Although looming regulation change means Ferrari cannot stick to the same winning formula forever, its first attempt at an EV arrives precisely as once-bullish rivals are reconsidering their position. Lamborghini has delayed its first EV from 2027 to 2029. Bentley has pushed back its goal of exclusively selling fully electric cars from 2030 to 2035. And only recently Porsche killed plans for an electric flagship SUV, and said how some top-end models would continue to favor engines over batteries. Ferrari's Modena neighbor Maserati also recently cancelled plans for an electric version of its MC20 supercar, citing a lack of customer interest. Even the company itself was unsure, albeit now almost a decade ago, when late boss Sergio Marchionne said a battery-powered Ferrari was “almost an obscene concept.” Then again, he was similarly robust about the idea of a Ferrari SUV, only for the high-riding Purosangue to be greeted with critical acclaim and bulging order books from day one. The front motors produce a combined 210 kW (280 horsepower) and 140 Nm of torque, while the rear pair send 620 kW (830 hp) and 355 Nm to their respective axle. Ferrari says the motors and battery were developed and built entirely in-house, using the company's new “e-building” at its Maranello, Italy campus, although the cells come from SK, a South Korean battery manufacturer. The battery pack comprises 211 pouch cells arranged in 15 modules which are designed to be accessed, removed, and replaced if future maintenance requires it. Ferrari's setup, including this inverter, sees the carmaker opt for four electric motors instead of just one or two, which results in prodigious power: more than 1,000 hp, 0-62 in 2.5 secs and a top speed of 192 mph. Although the cabin hasn't been revealed, the EV's steering will have a pair of dials for switching between three energy modes (Range, Tour and Performance) and five drive modes: Ice, Wet, Dry, Sport, and ESC-Off. Behind the wheel are a pair of paddles, but instead of operating a transmission, the left-hand paddle cycles through different strengths of regenerative braking, and the right lets the driver access five levels of power and torque, using a new system called Torque Shift Engagement. With regard to sound, Ferrari says it quickly dismissed the two approaches taken by most other EVs; namely, copying the sound of an engine, and producing something entirely synthesized. Palermo says the sound can be reduced when cruising, then amplified during more dynamic driving. Allegedly, it's even possible to sense when a rear wheel breaks traction, since the rise in revs of that motor would be detected by the accelerometer. But, for now, Ferrari refuses to comment on exactly how motor sound is broadcast in the cabin—be it through the car's sound system, or some other means—and how external sound will be created. Remarkably, for a company whose cars are synonymous with theatrical histrionics, Ferrari says during normal driving “silence is preferred to maximize acoustic comfort.” To that end, it has worked hard to illuminate noise, vibration, and harshness (known in the industry as NVH), since there's no longer a loud engine to drown it all out. The Elettrica's suspension is an evolution of the active system used by Ferrari's Purosangue SUV and F80 hypercar, which employs 48-volt motors to apply torque to each shock absorber, actively working to eliminate pitch and roll. As with other electric cars, a heavy battery pack in the floor helps to lower the center of gravity; in this case, by 80 mm compared to an equivalent non-EV. Although it can't defy physics, Ferrari claims its suspension trickery and quad-motor setup makes the Elettrica handle as if it were almost 1,000 lbs lighter. The result is a car where each wheel has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other, by up to 2.15 degrees in either direction. That's more than half the braking force experienced during an emergency stop in a regular car. Each of the electric Ferrrari's four wheels has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other. Ferrari has said repeatedly that its first EV is not a supercar. It's a confident first reveal from Ferrari, and one that manages to suggest there's more to its debut EV than yet another skateboard chassis. Its use of four motors, trick active suspension, a clever way of producing sound, and, yes, Apple's former design chief gives the Elettrica serious intrigue at a time when rivals are floundering. Despite its technical know-how and massive brand power, convincing buyers to part with what's likely to be the far side of $500,000 for an EV that is not a supercar will be no walk in the park.
