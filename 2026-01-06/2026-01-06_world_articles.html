Since Donald Trump marched back into the White House in January 2025, his administration has waged an all-out war on disabled people. Trump has issued executive orders rolling back civil rights protections, slashed funding for vital services and support, and advocated for legislation that would ramp up institutionalization. The administration's actions reflect the cruel and dehumanizing language it uses to speak about disabled people, who comprise more than a quarter of the nation's population: One February 2025 executive order characterized children being diagnosed with autism or ADD/ADHD as “a dire threat to the American people and our way of life,” while, according to a memoir by Trump's nephew, the president thinks some disabled people “should just die.” Truthout asked several disability justice advocates and organizers from across the U.S. to explain what's at stake for disabled people in Trump's attacks on voting rights, education, the climate and Indigenous land stewardship, health care, and trans rights. They also shared where they're finding hope and how you can join the struggle for disability rights and justice as it continues into the second year of Trump 2.0. The responses below have been edited and condensed for clarity. Sarah Blahovec, disability civic engagement expert and author of The Accessible Voting Booth: Attacks on voting rights are undeniably escalating under this administration. We also need to mobilize to support those working outside of an electoral system and a government that is failing us — disabled people's lives are on the line. We need to focus on supporting those who have never been properly supported (and have often been actively targeted by our government) who are facing extreme threats — including disabled immigrants, queer and trans people, incarcerated people, and people of color. I'm motivated and inspired by community members who come together to take care of each other, from local mutual aid to efforts like ICE Out of Alexandria, where I live, which is organizing against our sheriff's voluntary collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I hope that we can someday shift from defending our rights and our existence to dreaming up new systems that create lasting change and liberation for all of us. It has been a fight to emerge from more than a century of simply sending disabled kids into massive institutional state schools that resembled concentration camps and finally provide them with the education that they have a right to enjoy. It's not hyperbole to say that disabled kids will be abused, and some disabled kids will die in a system built that way. For folks who care about disabled kids and want to support their equal education in schools, look around your neighborhood and your local community, find disabled people who are leading efforts, and start advocating like hell. It's not going to do everything, but this is a moment that calls for humanity and rejects the model that we've seen fail in recent years of bureaucratizing the lives of disabled people. Trump's second term has intensified the same patterns that created a crisis that is not simply climate change, but the combined impact of colonialism, environmental racism, and ableism. When Indigenous governance is pushed aside, ecosystems lose the caretakers who kept them healthy for generations. These patterns have always been with us, but they are now unfolding in a moment when the planet cannot absorb any more harm. This moment calls for us to change how we think about preparation and prevention. We can't rely on the government, but we can invest in local and Tribal responses, accessible communication networks, and practices that restore the land instead of exploiting it. When we strengthen Indigenous stewardship and disability-centered care simultaneously, we create communities that are resilient in ways the federal government has never been. Dom Kelly, co-founder, president, and CEO of New Disabled South: We have organizations doing advocacy, trying to stop bad policy or make bad policy less bad, but that can only go so far, given the makeup of Congress and the fact that this administration doesn't care whether what they're doing is right or wrong or who it will hurt. My hope heading into the new year is that we can build more solidarity across movements as we show up, organize, and care for each other in our communities. We're seeing an escalation of similar policies that we've seen over the past hundred years, and I think the big thing that undergirds attacks on both trans people and disabled people is eugenics in a broad sense of not just scientific policies, but socio-economic, cultural influences removing both disabled and trans people from public life and putting us in harm's way. Countering these policies, I think, looks like continuing to educate our communities about trans and disabled lives. It looks like civil disobedience, in the sense of teachers, doctors, et cetera, being willing to push back vocally against policies that are negatively impacting trans students or removing care for trans people, even if that means a personal risk. Adults defending trans kids and taking on those personal risks is going to be critical. We can expect the government's attacks on vulnerable communities to continue this year, including a continued stripping away of what little support systems have historically existed to protect disabled and aging Americans. Meanwhile, grief over the loss of that support and the resulting increasing violence and number of premature deaths in marginalized communities threaten to become overwhelming. Faced with this overwhelm, disability justice advocates told Truthout that it is becoming more important than ever for individuals to organize in their communities, develop relationships with neighbors, and find ways to support one another. Wherever you decide to plug in this year, these advocates hope you will do so with this lesson in mind: The struggle for disability justice intersects with the fights for racial and climate justice, safety for our immigrant neighbors and trans siblings, and a dignified life for all people. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

In 2013, before the Affordable Care Act helped millions get health insurance, California's Placer County provided limited health care to some 3,400 uninsured residents who couldn't afford to see a doctor. For several years, that number has been zero in the predominantly white, largely rural county stretching from Sacramento's eastern suburbs to the shores of Lake Tahoe. The act, which President Donald Trump signed into law this past summer, is also expected to reduce Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over that period. “This is the moment where a lot of hard decisions have to be made about who gets care and who doesn't,” said Nadereh Pourat, director of the Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program at UCLA. It's an especially thorny challenge for states like California and New Mexico where counties are legally required to help their poorest residents through what are known as indigent care programs. Placer County, which estimates that 16,000 residents could lose health care coverage by 2028, quit operating its own clinics nearly a decade ago. “Most of the infrastructure that we had to meet those needs is gone,” said Rob Oldham, Placer County's director of health and human services. In December, county officials asked to join a statewide association that provides care to mostly small, rural counties, citing an expected rise in the number of uninsured residents. New Mexico's second-most-populous county, Doña Ana, added dental care for seniors and behavioral health benefits after many of its poorest residents qualified for Medicaid. Now, federal cuts could force the county to reconsider, said Jamie Michael, Doña Ana's health and human services director. Some states, such as Idaho and Colorado, abandoned laws that required counties to be providers of last resort for their residents. Those clinics are often supported by a mix of federal, state, and local funds, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. “As we have more growth, more people coming in, it's harder and harder to fund things that are required by the state legislature, and this isn't one we can decrease,” said Windy Johnson, program manager with the Texas Indigent Health Care Association. Gavin Newsom, who has acknowledged he is mulling a White House run, has rebuffed several efforts to significantly raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Finance, said that the Newsom administration is still refining its fiscal projections and that it would be “premature” to discuss potential budget solutions. Newsom will unveil his initial budget proposal in January. State officials have said California could lose $30 billion a year in federal funding for Medi-Cal under the new law, as much as 15% of the state program's entire budget. “Local governments don't really have much capacity to raise revenue,” said Scott Graves, a director at the independent California Budget & Policy Center with a focus on state budgets. It's not clear how many people are currently enrolled in California's county indigent programs, because the state doesn't track enrollment and utilization. But enrollment in county health safety net programs dropped dramatically in the first full year of ACA implementation, going from about 858,000 people statewide in 2013 to roughly 176,000 by the end of 2014, according to a survey at the time by Health Access California. “After the Affordable Care Act and as folks got coverage, we didn't imagine a moment like this where potentially that progress would be unwound and folks would be falling back into indigent care.” Health advocates fear that, absent major state investments, Californians could see a return to the previous patchwork of county-run programs, with local governments choosing whom and what they cover and for how long. Counties can also exclude people based on immigration status or income. Before the ACA, many uninsured people who needed care didn't get it, which could lead to them winding up in ERs with untreated health conditions or even dying, said Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network. Rachel Linn Gish, interim deputy director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group, said that “it created a very unequal, maldistributed program throughout the state.” This article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal jail with a documented history of power outages, staffing shortages and detainee complaints just got two more high-profile detainees. Former president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were moved into the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on Saturday following their US military capture in Caracas just days ago. The building has housed several notable figures like hip-hop mogul, Sean “Diddy” Combs, singer R. Kelly, “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, socialite and Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, one-time cryptocurrency whiz kid Sam Bankman-Fried, drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, rappers Fetty Wap and Tekashi 6ix9ine – even former Honduras president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges before he was pardoned last year by President Donald Trump. Suspected cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada Garcia and Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to the shooting death of a UnitedHealth Group executive, are current inmates at the facility. Here's a look at what life inside MDC Brooklyn looks like through the eyes of inmates, attorneys and judges: Detainees include a mix of suspects and defendants, including people accused of serious crimes, high-profile cases, and others awaiting sentencing or transfer. The Federal Bureau of Prisons operated two centers – one in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan – until 2021, when the doors to the Manhattan facility closed after it drew criticism for its management of multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's death there by suicide in 2019. Before his capture, Maduro lived mostly at Miraflores Palace, a sprawling presidential residence known for its neoclassical architecture, large windows, grand halls and manicured courtyards – a stark contrast to the living quarters inside the Metropolitan Detention Center. For its more than 1,300 inmates, daily life at the federal jail can be grueling. It's dark, overcrowded and loud, according to CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, who has been inside the building many times. While all prisons are miserable places to be, he said, “the MDC is maybe the most miserable” of all that he's visited. Inmates in the facility's Special Housing Unit, known as the SHU, where it's likely Maduro is being housed for safety and security, are kept in solitary confinement under restrictive conditions, Daniel McGuinnes, a criminal defense and civil rights litigation attorney who represents several clients housed at MDC, told CNN. Inmates are waking up “staring at cinder block painted white walls” while locked in a cell with steel beds and a thin mattress, often for 23 hours at a time with no pillow and hardly any room to move around, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former fixer, previously told CNN of the living quarters. Cohen was held at FCI Otisville, a federal prison 70 miles northwest of New York City. Hell on Earth: Inside the jail where Maduro is being held The jail has also struggled with chronic understaffing, complaints about mold, fungus and poor food quality, McGuinnes said. “At some point I'll have to step in and request it on their behalf,” he said, “because it's just not getting done.” CNN has reached out to the Bureau of Prisons for comment. A lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates alleged they were confined to their cells for days with nonfunctioning toilets and other unsanitary conditions. Michael Horowitz, Inspector General for the US Department of Justice at the time, said it was determined “that heating issues had been a longstanding problem at the jail that existed before, during, and after the fire and power outage and were unrelated to these events.” In early 2024, the Bureau of Prisons appointed an Urgent Action Team “to take a holistic look at the challenges at MDC Brooklyn,” spokesperson Emery Nelson told CNN. In June 2024, Uriel Whyte, an inmate awaiting trial on gun charges, was stabbed to death by another inmate, according to a DOJ news release. Cordero's lawyer told The New York Times his client was “another victim of M.D.C. Brooklyn, an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.” Later in September, the DOJ announced five inmates were charged in those murders and a sixth was charged with attempted murder for allegedly stabbing another inmate 44 times with a makeshift weapon. Meanwhile, another inmate was sent to the hospital with an ice pick stuck in his back, according to the release. Bottom line: “It's a very difficult place to be an inmate,” Diddy's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said of the facility in 2024 and argued in court.</p>

They will stop at nothing to rig the system for themselves. I've been fighting Trump for years and nothing will stop me.” Early in Trump's first term, Conway had been considered as a possible solicitor general; his wife at the time, Kellyanne, was a senior White house adviser. But he grew increasingly critical of Trump and his administration, eventually becoming one of the most vocal and prominent anti-Trump critics in the Republican party, even as Kellyanne remained a key adviser to the president. But in August 2020, Conway announced that he was stepping away from his role there “to devote more time to family matters”. Around the same time, the couple's teenage daughter, Claudia Conway, had been making headlines with outspoken online statements against her parents' political views. Kellyanne also announced that she would be leaving her role within the Trump administration. In March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced their divorce. She remains an ally of Trump and spoke at the 2024 Republican national convention. In his campaign announcement video on Tuesday, George said that as “a former Republican, now a Democrat, I fought Trump publicly in every way I could and I paid a price. “And now I'm running for Congress to take the fight directly back to him on your behalf, on the behalf of New Yorkers to whom I owe so much – to protect the fundamental rights and basic economic needs of all New Yorkers, to make our nation better than it was before, to write new laws that will safeguard our democracy so that we don't end up facing autocracy ever again.</p>

Many in Venezuela and abroad had expected Machado to take charge of the country after Maduro's detention on Saturday, but Trump sidelined her and gave his backing to Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez. We won an election [in 2024] by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.” “But I do want to say today, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the actions – historical actions – he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime, to start dismantling this structure and bringing Maduro to justice,” she said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had decided to back Rodríguez after CIA analysts briefed him that Machado and her electoral candidate, the retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia, “would struggle to gain legitimacy as leaders while facing resistance from pro-regime security services, drug-trafficking networks and political opponents”. Trump has said he wants to work with Rodríguez and the rest of Maduro's former team provided that they submit to US demands on oil. On Monday the Venezuelan government made public a decree dated Saturday and signed by Maduro – who was arrested at 2.01am – declaring a “state of external commotion”, effectively a state of emergency, and ordering the “immediate search and capture of anyone involved in the promotion or support of the US armed attack”. At least 14 journalists and media workers, including 13 linked to international outlets, were detained in Caracas on Monday. Gunshots and explosions were reported near the Miraflores presidential palace overnight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney has downplayed concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to boost oil production from Venezuela will have an impact on Canada's energy sector. On Tuesday Mr. Carney reiterated that Canada welcomed the removal of Mr. Maduro from office. “It creates the possibility for democratic transition in Venezuela. We very much support that,” he told reporters in Paris, where he was attending a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” to support Ukraine. Increased oil production would benefit the Venezuelan people and provide stability to the country, he added, but that won't be a threat to Canadian oil producers. “Canadian oil will be competitive because it is low-risk,” he said. He added that production costs in the oil sands have also started to fall along with carbon emissions through carbon capture programs. Ottawa closely watching Trump's next steps after U.S. military strike on Venezuela The recent memorandum of understanding between Ottawa and Alberta on a new pipeline to the West Coast will also help open new markets for Canadian energy. In the 1990s, U.S. refineries imported almost two million barrels per day from Venezuela. Venezuela's overall production, which is sold largely to China, has dropped to 934,000 barrels per day from more than three million in the 1990s. But even a modest increase in production could have an impact on Canada, which produces about five million barrels a day and sells most of it to the U.S. Canada needs new pipeline urgently to counter Venezuelan oil surge, Strathcona chair says Mr. Carney also took aim at Mr. Trump's reiteration of his desire to annex Greenland for “national security” reasons. He added that whatever security concerns Mr. Trump has about the increasing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic can be addressed through NATO. Mr. Carney spoke to reporters before joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from more than 30 countries for a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The U.S. will be represented by Mr. Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in Paris that Canada and other Ukrainian allies are close to finalizing security guarantees for the war-torn country as part of broader ceasefire talks. Mr. Zelensky has expressed confidence that 90 per cent of the agreement is in place, but the remaining issues involve complicated negotiations over territory and security guarantees. Mr. Carney said Tuesday's meeting may not result in a final agreement, but he insisted that momentum was building. Carney announces $2.5-billion of ⁠aid for Ukraine during meeting with Zelensky Canada has offered to play a role in providing security guarantees. Secondly, there will be monitoring, training and other logistical support. Canada will be able to meet its commitment through increased military spending, redeployment of existing forces and joint ventures with the Ukrainian defence industry, Mr. Carney said.

A group of European leaders representing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain also expressed their support for Greenland and Denmark Tuesday. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has banned exports of some rare earth elements and other items to Japan that could be used for military purposes, straining already tense relations between the two countries following the Japanese prime minister's recent remarks on Taiwan. The sweeping restrictions on so-called dual-use items – goods, services and technologies that have both civilian and military applications – are effective immediately, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Tuesday. While the ministry did not specify what the impacted exports are, a catalogue of dual-use items published by the ministry includes rare earths, advanced electronics, aerospace and aviation components, drones and nuclear-related technology, among other items. Rare earth elements are critical to a wide range of goods, from everyday electronics and vehicles to advanced weapons systems such as F-35 fighter jets. It is not yet clear how far-reaching the impact of the latest restrictions will be for Japan. Relations between the two Asian powers have deteriorated rapidly since Japan's leader, Sanae Takaichi, said in parliament in November that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would constitute “a situation threatening Japan's survival,” potentially triggering a military response from Tokyo. China's ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex the island, by force if necessary. Since Takaichi's remarks, Beijing has unleashed a series of economic measures aimed at pressuring Japan to retract the comments, including cutting flights to the country, warning its citizens against traveling to or studying in Japan and suspending seafood imports from Japan. A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said the new restrictions had been imposed in response to Takaichi's “erroneous” comments and for “safeguarding national security and interests.” “These comments constitute a crude interference in China's internal affairs, seriously violate the one-China principle and are extremely harmful in nature and impact,” the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. In its statement, the ministry added that any organization or individual from any country that violated the export restrictions would be held legally accountable. CNN has reached out to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for comment. Using its global dominance in the rare earths supply chain, China has imposed controls on these exports as a powerful weapon in the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump last year. This is not the first time Beijing has weaponized rare earth exports against Japan. In 2010, China also restricted such shipments to the country following a diplomatic spat triggered by Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain near the disputed Senkaku Islands, known in China as the Diaoyus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chrystia Freeland has announced she will resign from her posts in Canada to become an economic advisor to Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky. He praised Freeland as “an expert” in economy and finance. Confirming the appointment on X, Freeland stated that her contributions to Kiev would be “voluntary” and “unpaid.” One of the most prominent figures in Canadian politics for over a decade, Freeland has held ministerial positions in international trade, foreign affairs, and finance. In September, she resigned as Canada's minister of transport to become Ottawa's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Archival evidence and research show her maternal grandfather was editor-in-chief of a Ukrainian-language newspaper in occupied Poland and Austria that published Nazi propaganda during World War II. Freeland has long rejected knowledge of these facts, claiming they were Russian disinformation. In 2023, Freeland was among the Canadian parliamentarians who gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a former member of the Waffen-SS Galicia Division, during Zelensky's visit to Ottawa. Following Freeland's appointment by Zelensky, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova branded Ukraine “a haven for neo-Nazis.” Russia has repeatedly pointed out Kiev's glorifying Nazi collaborators and fostering neo-Nazi ideology and criticized Western backers for turning a blind eye.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela's capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars. Days after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets. A state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. One Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment. The paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country. Videos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country's natural resources. Another video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro's closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.” Mr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos. “There's enough people here, there's enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests. On Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated. Police and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro's vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue. “I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand. “I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.” In Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro's capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez's ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro's regime. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro's absence a “temporary” one. “She's a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people.” “But now we're at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they're all still here.” Speaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table. “Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added. “Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said. The thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union is demanding that Serbia betray Russia as a condition for continuing its European integration, while offering Belgrade no tangible benefits in return, former Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin said in an interview with TASS. "The European Union is using every means of pressure to force Serbia not simply to make a choice — because this is not a real choice — but to betray Russia," he stressed. "This is not about choosing between two sides. Russia is making no proposals to us, and the European Union is making no proposals to us either. The European Union is demanding that we betray Russia, while Russia is demanding nothing from us. The European Union is making demands of us — and this shows what the European Union truly is: a deeply hypocritical, profoundly anti-Serbian organization," Vulin said. According to him, such measures would cause no damage to Moscow, unlike the harm they would inflict on Belgrade. Russia would neither feel nor even notice that we imposed sanctions. "You are not waging war against Russia through Serbia — you are waging war against Serbia. You want to destroy Serbia, and the current situation is merely a convenient pretext for that," the former deputy prime minister stressed. According to him, the price that Brussels is demanding in exchange for continuing European integration is unacceptable for Serbia. "The price of conflict <…> is too high — regardless of whatever promises may be made to us," Vulin concluded.</p>

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 6. /TASS/. President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is going to have a telephone conversation with US leader Donald Trump in the near future, O Globo newspaper reported, citing high-ranking diplomatic sources.

Lula da Silva will point to the need of keeping public and political stability in Venezuela during the conversation, the newspaper said. The Brazilian leader is also concerned of the situation on the border.

"The order is currently maintained inside Venezuela but the situation is still on the brink and may go out of control," a source told the news outlet.</p>
