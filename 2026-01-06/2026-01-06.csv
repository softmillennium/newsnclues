            China has banned exports of some rare earth elements and other items to Japan that could be used for military purposes, straining already tense relations between the two countries following the Japanese prime minister's recent remarks on Taiwan.
    


            The sweeping restrictions on so-called dual-use items – goods, services and technologies that have both civilian and military applications – are effective immediately, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            While the ministry did not specify what the impacted exports are, a catalogue of dual-use items published by the ministry includes rare earths, advanced electronics, aerospace and aviation components, drones and nuclear-related technology, among other items.
    


            Rare earth elements are critical to a wide range of goods, from everyday electronics and vehicles to advanced weapons systems such as F-35 fighter jets. It is not yet clear how far-reaching the impact of the latest restrictions will be for Japan.
    


            Relations between the two Asian powers have deteriorated rapidly since Japan's leader, Sanae Takaichi, said in parliament in November that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would constitute “a situation threatening Japan's survival,” potentially triggering a military response from Tokyo.
    


            China's ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex the island, by force if necessary.
    


            Since Takaichi's remarks, Beijing has unleashed a series of economic measures aimed at pressuring Japan to retract the comments, including cutting flights to the country, warning its citizens against traveling to or studying in Japan and suspending seafood imports from Japan.
    


            A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said the new restrictions had been imposed in response to Takaichi's “erroneous” comments and for “safeguarding national security and interests.”
    


            “These comments constitute a crude interference in China's internal affairs, seriously violate the one-China principle and are extremely harmful in nature and impact,” the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            In its statement, the ministry added that any organization or individual from any country that violated the export restrictions would be held legally accountable.
    


            CNN has reached out to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for comment.
    


What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump's trade deal with China?



            Using its global dominance in the rare earths supply chain, China has imposed controls on these exports as a powerful weapon in the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump last year. The move wreaked havoc in industries around the world, including the automotive sector – a critical pillar of Japan's economy.
    


            This is not the first time Beijing has weaponized rare earth exports against Japan. In 2010, China also restricted such shipments to the country following a diplomatic spat triggered by Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain near the disputed Senkaku Islands, known in China as the Diaoyus.

            The case against ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro hasn't been able to move forward in the past six years.
    


            Now with his capture and first appearance in Manhattan federal court behind him, getting to trial could take even more years, with rings of unusual political and legal battles to come.
    


            The criminal case against Maduro is so legally complex — with his past leadership of Venezuela, the dramatic nature of proving an international narco-terrorism conspiracy and the larger national security and foreign policy implications — that his defense could attempt several different ways of derailing the case before a trial.
    


What happened at the Maduro and Flores arraignment and what's next in the case



            Maduro pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.
    


            “Not that he won't negotiate, but he will push some of the buttons first,” Dick Gregorie, a longtime Miami-based federal prosecutor, said on Monday after following news coverage of Maduro's arraignment.
    


            Gregorie had worked on the indictment and trial of Panama's Manuel Noriega almost 40 years ago, becoming one of the few prosecutors who has successfully tried a foreign fugitive who claimed he was a head of state.
    


            The Noriega case has some parallels to Maduro's — especially in how rare it is for the US to strike a foreign country and abduct a political leader by force.
    


            It appears likely that the lawyers representing Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, who also pleaded not guilty Monday to drug and weapons charges, will argue they were captured unlawfully. On Monday in court, the deposed Venezuelan leader said he was “kidnapped” by the US military.
    


            His lawyers will also likely battle with the Justice Department over the evidence in the case, what they can access that may help them, and over the protected national security information that may be able to be used in a trial.
    


            The classified information-handling process overseen by the court can add months to even a straightforward case, and defendants sometimes try to push for the exposure of sensitive information so that the federal government becomes unwilling to try the case, a tactic called “graymailing.”
    


            The evidence collected so far and plans for moving the case toward trial are likely to be discussed at Maduro's next court appearance in Manhattan, set for March.
    


            Maduro is likely to attempt to use his position in Venezuela's government to argue he has immunity as a foreign leader.
    


            In court, Madura told the judge he was “still president” of Venezuela. His wife similarly called herself “the First Lady of Venezuela” in her court appearance Monday.
    


            Gregorie recalled how significant a fight the head-of-state immunity claims were with Noriega. They also arose before the bribery trial of a political leader who claimed he was head of state of Turks and Caicos, which Gregorie also prosecuted in Miami some 40 years ago.
    


            “It's quite clear, in order to get head-of-state immunity, you have to be the diplomatically recognized head of state,” Gregorie said. Other legal scholars have taken the same position, that the US State Department's diplomatic recognitions are essentially the final word.

            The US has maintained since 2024 that Maduro was an illegitimate leader of Venezuela, and instead recognized Maduro's opposition as president-elect. Still, the answer of who led the country would have to be interpreted by the US court system, potentially up to the Supreme Court.
    


            Noriega lost his head-of-state and diplomatic immunity claims in 1990. He was convicted in 1991 for importing cocaine and given a 40-year sentence.
    


            And Norman Saunders, the chief minister of the Turks and Caicos island nation in the 1980s, wasn't deemed to be the country's head of state either, Gregorie recalled. The head of state in Turks and Caicos, a British territory, at the time of Saunders' case was the Queen.
    


            One question that will linger is how intent the Justice Department is to take Maduro to trial.
    


            Removing him from his country makes that easier in one core way: It can shake out new witnesses.
    


            Gina Parlovecchio, a white-collar partner at the large law firm Mayer Brown and former lead prosecutor of the trial against Mexican kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, said there are likely several cooperators who've helped the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York build the Maduro case.
    


            The office previously prosecuted others with ties to Maduro, including his wife Cilia Flores' nephews. The federal government also closely tracks the five designated foreign terrorist organizations that are mentioned in the Maduro indictment as taking part in the scheme to move drugs from Venezuela to the US.
    


            Still, having cooperating witnesses appear at a trial can be a challenge.
    


            Gregorie described how one witness died in a suspicious car crash days before he was set to testify against a Noriega co-defendant. Gregorie also noted the killing of DEA informant Barry Seal, by the hired gun of a drug cartel in Louisiana in the 1980s.
    


            “He was murdered before the trial started. There were incidents like that that made you worried,” Gregorie said. “A witness who had documents I was looking for, and those documents disappeared.”
    


            Others in Noriega's case entered witness protection, giving up their identities for new identities, in towns decided by the federal government, Gregorie said.
    


            “Certainly this business is a violent business,” the retired Miami prosecutor added.
    


            Michael Nadler, another former federal prosecutor on a case against high-ranking Venezuelans, said that drug trafficking conspiracy cases can be more difficult to prove, because of the reliance on witnesses within the drug trade, rather than following the money in foreign bribery cases.
    


            Nadler worked on the Miami money laundering indictment of another top Venezuelan official, Alex Saab, who was released from US custody in a 2023 prisoner swap and returned to Venezuela to work in Maduro's government.
    


            “You're going to have to get somebody in the room with him who says he knew about it, he allowed it to happen, or that he did something more,” Nadler said about proving a drug trafficking case.
    


            The indictment against Maduro, however, isn't as specific on transactions as some drug trafficking and money laundering indictments have been. Yet prosecutors included several episodes, or vignettes, in the now-public allegations against Maduro that appear to suggest they have information from witnesses who had close access to him.
    


            In one vignette, for instance, prosecutors say Maduro told other alleged traffickers they shouldn't have sent more than a ton of cocaine on a 2013 commercial flight that landed in Paris, and which French law enforcement seized.
    


            The specific moments prosecutors describe in the Maduro indictment link to each of the five narco-terrorist organizations: the FARC and ELN, which produce cocaine in Colombia; the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, which traffic cocaine from central American through Mexico to the US; and Tren de Aragua, which helps to transport cocaine out of Venezuela.
    


            “I almost read it like a greatest hits,” Parlovecchio said.
    


Former CIA Director retired Gen. David Petraeus, weighs in on the challenges President Trump will face in ‘running' Venezuela



            Several former prosecutors say the Justice Department would only be willing to indict and capture Maduro if it believed the case was robust enough.
    


            Some prosecutors also believe the ousted leader may want to face a jury. 
    


            “I think that they are likely anticipating a trial,” Parlovecchio said, citing how Flores' two nephews, called the Narcosobrinos, were convicted by a jury of cocaine trafficking in 2016. “These high-level drug trafficking cases do tend to go to trial …. When you have this type of a case, with a defendant who has nothing to lose.”
    


            Maduro's charges are serious, potentially carrying with them a life sentence for conspiracy plus decades in prison for weapons violations, Parlovecchio said.
    


            She pointed to her case for the Eastern District of New York US Attorney's Office years ago, where El Chapo also went to trial and was convicted. He is now in the Bureau of Prison's only Supermax facility, in Colorado, serving a life sentence for the drug trafficking criminal enterprise conviction, plus 30 years for possessing a machine gun.
    


            Yet would the US government be open to some sort of negotiation or deal with the captured ruler?
    


            The vast majority of federal criminal cases end in defendants pleading guilty, either as part of a deal or to avoid a trial, according to federal court data.
    


            A legal and geopolitical deal could arise at any time involving Venezuela — especially if the foreign policy situation changes or the case still lingers after the Trump presidency ends.
    


            However, Gregorie, who tried the Noriega case, said that a drug trafficking prosecution of a foreign leader was always likely to be on the trial track, partly because of the effort it took to charge the case and apprehend them.
    


            “We were constantly pushing to get the case to trial, and if I indicted him, I intended to try him,” Gregorie said on Tuesday about the Noriega case.
    


            Maduro's defense attorney Barry Pollack, a national security and white-collar defense specialist out of Washington, DC, declined to comment for this story.
    


            Pollack is well-versed in high-profile defendants with a political angle to their cases, having previously resolved the criminal case against Julian Assange.

NEW YORK, January 6. /TASS/. The United States are not at war with Venezuela, President Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News.

""No, we're not,"" Trump said. ""We're at war with people that sell drugs. We're at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country,"" he noted.

The White House believes new elections will not be held in Venezuela during the next thirty days, Trump stressed.

""We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,"" the US leader said when answering the question about the possibility of elections in Venezuela during one month. ""No, it's going to take a period of time. We have — we have to nurse the country back to health,"" he added.

Trump also named a group of US officials that will deal with Venezuelan affairs, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, War Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy chief of staff of the White House Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance.

BELGRADE, January 6. /TASS/. The European Union is demanding that Serbia betray Russia as a condition for continuing its European integration, while offering Belgrade no tangible benefits in return, former Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin said in an interview with TASS.

""The European Union is using every means of pressure to force Serbia not simply to make a choice — because this is not a real choice — but to betray Russia,"" he stressed.

""This is not about choosing between two sides. Russia is making no proposals to us, and the European Union is making no proposals to us either. The European Union is demanding that we betray Russia, while Russia is demanding nothing from us. The European Union is making demands of us — and this shows what the European Union truly is: a deeply hypocritical, profoundly anti-Serbian organization,"" Vulin said.

The Serbian politician placed particular emphasis on the EU's demand that Serbia impose sanctions on Russia. According to him, such measures would cause no damage to Moscow, unlike the harm they would inflict on Belgrade. ""Would these sanctions harm Russia? Not at all. Russia would neither feel nor even notice that we imposed sanctions. But would this lead to the destruction of the Serbian economy, to a split within Serbian society, to the emergence of serious political conflicts of historical significance, to a complete transformation of the state of the nation? Yes, it would,"" he said.

He expressed confidence that the true target of the EU's policy is not Russia, but Serbia. ""You are not waging war against Russia through Serbia — you are waging war against Serbia. You want to destroy Serbia, and the current situation is merely a convenient pretext for that,"" the former deputy prime minister stressed.

According to him, the price that Brussels is demanding in exchange for continuing European integration is unacceptable for Serbia. ""The price of conflict <…> is too high — regardless of whatever promises may be made to us,"" Vulin concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LaMalfa's death cuts the House Republican majority to 218-213, tightening GOP control for passing bills

Doug LaMalfa, a California Republican who represented the state's rural northern region in the House and was known for his work on water and forestry policy, has died at age 65, according to statements from Republican officials.

LaMalfa, a fourth-generation rice farmer who previously served in the California state legislature, was in his seventh term representing California's first congressional district. He sat on the House agriculture, natural resources, and transportation and infrastructure committees.

No cause of death has been announced, but the Butte county sheriff's office announced that LaMalfa died during an emergency surgical procedure at a local hospital after emergency responders transported him there on Monday evening.

The sheriff's office said in a statement that it had received a call about a medical emergency at LaMalfa's home shortly before 7pm on 5 January. He was transported to a hospital in Chico where he underwent emergency surgery and died during the procedure.

The National Republican Congressional Committee chair, Richard Hudson, said he was “deeply saddened by the passing of my colleague and close friend”.

“Doug was a principled conservative and a tireless advocate for the people of Northern California,” Hudson said in a statement. “He was never afraid to fight for rural communities, farmers, and working families. Doug brought grit, authenticity, and conviction to everything he did in public service.”

His sudden passing reduces the House Republican majority to 218-213, leaving GOP leadership with an even slimmer margin to pass their legislative agenda. After the departure of representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Monday, Republicans can now afford to lose only two votes on party-line measures.

House majority whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota paid tribute to LaMalfa in a statement posted on social media.

“Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,” Emmer said. “Our prayers are with Doug's wife, Jill, and their children.”

The news of LaMalfa's passing came minutes before Donald Trump was scheduled to speak to the House Republicans at a GOP retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and Trump said he dedicated the speech to him.

“I was really saddened by his passing, and was thinking about not even doing the speech in his honor, but then decided that I have to do it in his honor,” Trump told the lawmakers. “I'll do it in his honor, because he would have wanted it that way.”

LaMalfa was a longtime Trump ally who challenged the 2020 election outcome, voting against certifying the result. He drew criticism, and praise, for his skepticism on the climate crisis and its cause. Representing a district that had been hit by numerous deadly wildfires in recent years, he had championed legislation halting federal taxes on fire recovery settlements.

LaMalfa was born and raised in northern California and had represented the region in Congress since 2013. In 2025, he was elected unanimously to serve as the chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, which advocates for the west and rural areas more broadly.

He had announced plans to run for re-election but was expected to face a challenging race after the passage of Proposition 50, a redistricting measure that changed the boundaries of LaMalfa's district and others to give Democrats an advantage. The proposition came after Texas's partisan gerrymander, and LaMalfa was critical of both efforts.

“No state should be doing mid-decade redistricting unless directed by a court or forced to. Voters in California have voted overwhelmingly twice to prevent partisan redistricting,” he said in a statement last year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pushback from Susan Collins and Thom Tillis is striking amid tepid response from most other Republican senators

Two senior Republican senators on Monday openly opposed Pentagon secretary Pete Hegseth's attempt to punish their fellow Senator Mark Kelly by demoting him and cutting his pension after he released a video telling active-duty military to follow the law.

Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate appropriations committee with jurisdiction over the Pentagon's budget, said she believed it was wrong to target Kelly's military benefits because of a political video.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina also described the Pentagon's censure as “ridiculous”, said “Hegseth overreached” and cautioned that pursuing such action “has a chilling effect on speech”.

The pushback from the relatively moderate Collins and from Tillis – who announced last June he would be retiring from the Senate – was striking given the tepid response from most other Republican senators.

Hegseth said on Monday that his department had begun administrative action against Kelly, who served as a navy captain before entering the Senate. Last year Kelly and other Democrats released a video encouraging military personnel to refuse illegal orders. Writing on social media, Hegseth described it as a “reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline”.

The defense secretary announced a “retirement grade determination proceeding” alongside a formal censure letter, suggesting Kelly could see his rank reduced and pension slashed as punishment.

Kelly flew dozens of combat missions and travelled to space four times during his military and Nasa career.

Speaking to reporters, Collins said: “I don't think that's appropriate.” Tillis, meanwhile, called the original video from the Democrats “rage bait”, but added: “My gosh, he is a US senator who operates in a political world. I think it has a chilling effect on speech, and I've got a real problem with it. And I think Hegseth overreached.”

Other Republicans offered measured or non-committal responses. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the armed services committee, told reporters there would be “an adjudication process” that he said should be allowed to proceed without comment. Asked whether such proceedings made sense given Kelly's Senate role and committee assignment, Rounds replied: “I think we'll let the process play out.”

Some senators sidestepped the question altogether. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, another armed services member, said she lacked sufficient information to respond. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia characterized it as an issue “between the Department of War and Sen Kelly”.

Kelly issued a combative statement on Monday, saying the censure was “outrageous” and “un-American”. He wrote: “If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it.”

He added: “Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Opposition leader says her movement is ready to win a fair election and praises Trump for toppling the president

From elation to frustration: Trump snub wrongfoots Venezuela's opposition

The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed to return to the country as soon as possible and rejected the authority of the interim president backed – for now – by the US after it forcibly removed Nicolás Maduro from power.

Machado told Fox News from an undisclosed location that her movement was ready to win a free election, and praised Donald Trump for toppling Maduro.

Many in Venezuela and abroad had expected Machado to take charge of the country after Maduro's detention on Saturday, but Trump sidelined her and gave his backing to Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez.

“I'm planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Machado said in the interview. “We believe that this transition should move forward. We won an election [in 2024] by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.”

She accused Rodríguez of being “one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking” in Venezuela and said repression had increased since the weekend.

The industrial engineer, 58, also said she had not spoken Trump since 10 October, the day it was announced that she had won the Nobel peace prize.

“But I do want to say today, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the actions – historical actions – he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime, to start dismantling this structure and bringing Maduro to justice,” she said.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had decided to back Rodríguez after CIA analysts briefed him that Machado and her electoral candidate, the retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia, “would struggle to gain legitimacy as leaders while facing resistance from pro-regime security services, drug-trafficking networks and political opponents”.

The Washington Post, however, reported the decision may have been more personal, that Trump may have been irritated that Machado accepted the prize. “If she had turned it down and said: ‘I can't accept it because it's Donald Trump's,' she'd be the president of Venezuela today,” a source told the paper.

Asked by Fox News whether she had offered to give Trump the prize, Machado said: “It hasn't happened yet, but I would certainly love to be able to personally tell him that we believe the Venezuelan people – because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people – certainly want to give it to him and share it with him.”

Trump has said he wants to work with Rodríguez and the rest of Maduro's former team provided that they submit to US demands on oil. He has poured cold water on the idea that a vote could be held within the next 30 days.

On Monday the Venezuelan government made public a decree dated Saturday and signed by Maduro – who was arrested at 2.01am – declaring a “state of external commotion”, effectively a state of emergency, and ordering the “immediate search and capture of anyone involved in the promotion or support of the US armed attack”.

Beyond the pursuit of those accused of supporting the US attack – a task made more complex by the widespread belief that senior government figures, including the acting president, may have provided crucial information leading to Maduro's capture – the decree orders the mobilisation of the armed forces, mandates the militarisation of all public service infrastructure, the oil sector and basic state industries, and suspends the right to public assembly and protest.

The death toll in violence surrounding protests in Iran has risen to at least 35 people, activists said yesterday, as the demonstrations showed no signs of stopping.

The figure came from the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which said more than 1,200 people have been detained in the protests, which have been ongoing for more than a week.

It said 29 protesters, four children and two members of Iran's security forces have been killed.

The group, which relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.

The Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported late on Monday that 250 police officers and 45 members of the Guard's all-volunteer Basij force have been hurt in the demonstrations.

The growing death toll carries with it the chance of US intervention, with US President Donald Trump on Friday last week warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the US “will come to their rescue.”

While it remains unclear how and if Trump would intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target US troops in the Middle East.

The protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the protests have yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab.

Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel, its currency collapsed last month and the protests began soon after.

Understanding the scale of this latest round of protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in Iran also face limits on reporting in general, such as requiring permission to travel around the nation.

Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss, the stepsister of teenage diarist Anne Frank and a tireless educator about the horrors of the Holocaust, has died. She was 96.

The Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was honorary president, said she died on Saturday in London, where she lived.

Britain's King Charles III said he was “privileged and proud” to have known Schloss, who cofounded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.

“The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world,” the king said.

Born Eva Geiringer in Vienna in 1929, Schloss fled with her family to Amsterdam after Nazi Germany annexed Austria. She became friends with another Jewish girl of the same age, Anne Frank, whose diary would become one of the most famous chronicles of the Holocaust.

Like the Franks, Eva's family spent two years in hiding to avoid capture after the Nazis occupied the Netherlands. They were eventually betrayed, arrested and sent to the Auschwitz death camp.

Schloss and her mother, Fritzi, survived until the camp was liberated by Soviet troops in 1945. Her father Erich and brother Heinz died in Auschwitz.

After the war, Eva Geiringer moved to Britain, married German Jewish refugee Zvi Schloss and settled in London.

In 1953, her mother married Frank's father, Otto, the only member of his immediate family to survive. Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15, months before the end of the war.

Eva Schloss did not speak publicly about her experiences for decades, later saying that wartime trauma had made her withdrawn and unable to connect with others.

“I was silent for years, first because I wasn't allowed to speak. Then I repressed it. I was angry with the world,” she said in 2004.

After she addressed the opening of an Anne Frank exhibition in London in 1986, Eva Schloss made it her mission to educate younger generations about the Nazi genocide. Over the following decades she spoke in schools and prisons, at international conferences and told her story in books, including Eva's Story: A Survivor's Tale by the Stepsister of Anne Frank.

She kept campaigning into her 90s. In 2019, she traveled to Newport Beach, California, to meet teenagers who were photographed making Nazi salutes at a high-school party. The following year she was part of a campaign urging Facebook to remove Holocaust-denying material from the social networking site.

“We must never forget the terrible consequences of treating people as ‘other,'” Eva Schloss said in 2024. “We need to respect everybody's races and religions. We need to live together with our differences. The only way to achieve this is through education, and the younger we start the better.”

Eva Schloss' family remembered her as “a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace.”

“We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind,” the family said in a statement.

Zvi Schloss died in 2016. Eva Schloss is survived by their three daughters, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday replaced the head of the security service, continuing a top-level reshuffle ahead of a trip to Paris where he hoped to finalize agreements with allies on how to ensure that Russia does not repeat its invasion if a peace agreement is signed.

Zelenskiy is trying to revamp his administration as the grinding war of attrition with Russia marks its fourth anniversary next month. He is keen to keep up the momentum of US-led peace talks, as well as sharpen Ukraine's focus on defense if those efforts collapse.

The Paris talks are expected to include the leaders of about 30 nations, dubbed the “coalition of the willing,” which are ready to provide security guarantees to keep Ukraine safe.

Key issues include whether nations are prepared to deploy troops inside or close to Ukraine, and what the remit of any force overseeing a ceasefire might be.

Russia has said it would not accept troops from NATO countries on Ukrainian soil.

Zelenskiy also announced the appointment of former Canadian deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland as Ukraine's economic development adviser, describing her as an expert on the issues with “significant experience in attracting investment and carrying out economic transformations.”

Amid Ukraine's biggest top-level reshuffle in about six months, Lieutenant General Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service, or SBU, announced his resignation on the agency's Web site.

Zelenskiy published a decree on the presidential Web site appointing Ievhen Khmara, former head of the “A” Special Operations Center of the SBU, as the agency's acting head.

Under Maliuk, the SBU produced some stunning successes against Russia, including Operation Spiderweb, which Ukraine said damaged or destroyed 41 Russian military aircraft in coordinated strikes on four air bases.

Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage and is a strong critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a former journalist and Canadian lawmaker.

Besides being a former deputy prime minister, she also served as Canadian minister of international trade, minister of foreign affairs and minister of finance, and helped negotiate trade agreements with both Europe and the US.

The Harvard University graduate has served as Canada's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine — a position outside the Cabinet — in addition to her responsibilities as a lawmaker.

Freeland and US President Donald Trump have had a sometimes-fraught relationship that could work against Ukraine.

In Trump's first term, Freeland played a key role in negotiating the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, and occasionally frustrated Trump aides with her tactics.

During Trump's first meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office, the president recalled his own antipathy for Freeland.

“She was terrible, actually — she was a terrible person,” Trump said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has downplayed concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to boost oil production from Venezuela will have an impact on Canada's energy sector.

Mr. Trump has made it clear that the U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro were precursors to taking control of the country's vast oil reserves and energy infrastructure. That could ultimately lead to a surge of Venezuelan oil on global markets, which would pose a challenge to Canadian producers. 

On Tuesday Mr. Carney reiterated that Canada welcomed the removal of Mr. Maduro from office. “It creates the possibility for democratic transition in Venezuela. We very much support that,” he told reporters in Paris, where he was attending a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” to support Ukraine. 

Increased oil production would benefit the Venezuelan people and provide stability to the country, he added, but that won't be a threat to Canadian oil producers. 

“Canadian oil will be competitive because it is low-risk,” he said. He added that production costs in the oil sands have also started to fall along with carbon emissions through carbon capture programs.

The recent memorandum of understanding between Ottawa and Alberta on a new pipeline to the West Coast will also help open new markets for Canadian energy. “And that makes Canadian oil competitive in the medium and long term,” Mr. Carney said. 

Venezuela has the world's largest reserves of oil, and its heavy crude is similar to the oil produced in Canada's oil sands. In the 1990s, U.S. refineries imported almost two million barrels per day from Venezuela. That has fallen to about 135,000 barrels since the rise of socialist leader Hugo Chávez in 1999, followed by Mr. Maduro in 2013. Venezuela's overall production, which is sold largely to China, has dropped to 934,000 barrels per day from more than three million in the 1990s. 

Given the state of its oil industry, it could take years to modernize and would cost tens of billions of dollars. And it's unclear how committed U.S. oil companies would be to launching projects in the country as long as it remains unstable. But even a modest increase in production could have an impact on Canada, which produces about five million barrels a day and sells most of it to the U.S.

Mr. Carney also took aim at Mr. Trump's reiteration of his desire to annex Greenland for “national security” reasons. One of the U.S. President's top aides, Stephen Miller, has also raised the possibility of using military force to take over the ice-covered island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. 

The comments from Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have taken on new significance in light of the U.S. raid in Venezuela. 

Mr. Carney said Canada stands with Greenland and Denmark. “The future of Greenland is a decision for Greenland and for Denmark exclusively – it's their decision,” he said. 

He added that whatever security concerns Mr. Trump has about the increasing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic can be addressed through NATO. “We are partners in NATO. It's a mutual defence alliance. We can provide that security.”

Mr. Carney spoke to reporters before joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from more than 30 countries for a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The U.S. will be represented by Mr. Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in Paris that Canada and other Ukrainian allies are close to finalizing security guarantees for the war-torn country as part of broader ceasefire talks. Mr. Carney is gathering with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders from the Coalition of the Willing in Paris.

The Canadian Press

The aim of the gathering is to finalize security and economic guarantees as part of a 20-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine.

Mr. Zelensky has expressed confidence that 90 per cent of the agreement is in place, but the remaining issues involve complicated negotiations over territory and security guarantees. And getting Russia to agree remains problematic. 

Mr. Carney said Tuesday's meeting may not result in a final agreement, but he insisted that momentum was building. “I think the way I look at this, in terms of the intention and the goodwill and the seriousness with which the countries, Canada included, are approaching this is: If we don't finalize today, it's because we identified issues where they could be improved or adjusted. This is not a make or break.”

Canada has offered to play a role in providing security guarantees. That could involve troops stationed Ukraine, Mr. Carney said, but would more likely involve support services.

The first line of defence, he added, will be the Ukrainian army, which will remain at 800,000 troops, according to the peace proposal. Secondly, there will be monitoring, training and other logistical support. “Then the backstops become the Coalition of the Willing forces, so-called multilateral force, of which Canada will be a member under this framework and, very importantly, the United States,” he said.

Canada will be able to meet its commitment through increased military spending, redeployment of existing forces and joint ventures with the Ukrainian defence industry, Mr. Carney said.

Prior to the meeting, he held bilateral talks with Mr. Macron and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. During the meeting with Ms. Frederiksen at the Canadian embassy, she thanked Mr. Carney for his supportive comments about Greenland and European security. “I think we are both very into securing the Arctic region and together with other NATO allies we can secure the region,” she said.

A group of European leaders representing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain also expressed their support for Greenland and Denmark Tuesday. 

“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” said a joint statement released just before the Coalition of the Willing meeting. 

Security in the Arctic must “be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

I was a little horrified when I stripped off my shirt to change in what I thought was a women's locker room of a Toronto fitness studio – only to discover it was an all-gender space.

When I looked around, mortified, the young woman next to me tried to reassure me, “Don't worry. No one noticed.”

At 61, I go most days to a cardio, weight, spin, bootcamp, yoga or power Pilates class. I love the endorphin rush and how much calmer I feel after a workout – and generally feel that I can keep up. But when the next older person in the class is often 20 years younger than me, and the locker room chatter is about clubbing, a relationship drama or looming exams, I become even more aware of my outlier status. 

It's not that people aren't welcoming. But at spin classes, the instructors take one look at my grey hair and offer me ear plugs. Sometimes teachers will suggest I do lighter weights, or slow my treadmill speed. This could be the right advice, but I wonder whether it's based on the overblown assumption that older people need to scale back from intense exercise.

Is it a myth that seniors need to slow down their fitness routines?

“There is some age-related decline and sarcopenia (muscle loss), but far less than people think,“ says Jill Tracey, associate professor of kinesiology at Wilfrid Laurier University. Older adults can see increases in lean muscle mass, slow bone density loss and build strength with continuing appropriate exercise.

The good news is that slowly the fitness culture is beginning to catch up, says Tracey. More studios offer programs specifically designed for older adults, or classes that work well for an older age group. So, I set out to find some of these inclusive spaces.

Personal trainer Lauren Shuster holds one-on-one training and virtual fitness classes for perimenopausal and menopausal women. Her programs focus on heavy-weight strength training, cardio conditioning, core work, postural training and pelvic floor exercises. When training older adults, she is thoughtful of building a strong foundation of good posture, functional breathing and deep core strength. “Once that is set, older adults can successfully participate in most types of training.”

For older women, Shuster says one key shift is also embracing heavy resistance training, to counter the effects of hormone changes on muscle mass. “Older women benefit more from fewer repetitions with heavier weights than more reps with lighter ones.”

Korina Besednik, who runs a fitness program for people 50-plus at Toronto's Academy of Lions, says short bursts of high-intensity cardio, with recovery or rests in between, can be more effective than trying to sustain an elevated heart rate for long periods.

Her masters program classes involve slightly longer warm-ups, detailed explanations around form and technique, and gentle corrections. She makes a point of knowing everyone's name, and remembering their injury history. And with a café, potlucks and competitions, there are many opportunities for connection.

Instructor and personal trainer Emily Parkes was inspired to establish her boutique fitness studio, Winnipeg's Fifty 5 Fitness, by her mother who wanted to work out somewhere that wasn't a big box gym and had people her age. 

Here, staff at the front desk are all over 50 and the studio hosts monthly coffee gatherings, and a bimonthly book club.

Parkes offers a “55 all in one” class covering low-impact cardio, balance work, strength and flexibility training and mobility; a “55 strength,” which focuses on lower-and upper-body strength exercises, core work and short bursts of cardio; and an advanced “metabolic mixer” with heavy lifting and challenging cardio.

GoodLife Fitness doesn't label classes specifically for women over 50, but they have many classes for that demographic, such as Les Mills Pilates, BODYBALANCE and cycling.

Some Canadian universities are also becoming hubs for fitness catering to older adults. The Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging (CCAA) at Western University has developed community-based exercise programs informed by research and led by CCAA-certified instructors. McMaster University's Physical Activity Centre of Excellence offers research-based aerobic and resistance training, and their MacSeniors program, for people 55 years old and over, with a referral from their primary-care physician.

According to the experts I spoke with, fitness is being modified to meet the needs of women over 55 by incorporating heavier weights, jump training and mobility work (for bone density and preventing falls), and functional movement (exercises such as squatting, sit-to-stands, lunges and balancing on one foot). 

For me, there are several benefits. I can hoist my own carry-on suitcase into the overhead bin on the plane. I can hike, cycle and do most of the other exercise I want to. Fitness lifts my mood and the classes are an important part of my social life. 

While I may not get noticed by others with my shirt off – or on (!) – I feel stronger and more muscular than at many earlier points in my life, and the functional benefits of that far exceed what I could list.

Denmark's Mette Frederiksen said ""everything would stop"" in the event of a US attack on another NATO country. European leaders have backed Frederiksen while saying the US ""is an essential partner.""

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday said that a US takeover of Greenland would mean the end of the NATO military alliance.

On Tuesday, Frederiksen released a joint statement with the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK reiterating that European allies were stepping up ""to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.""

It comes after US President Donald Trump renewed his calls for the large Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, to come under Washington's control.

Frederiksen said that ""everything would stop"" when it comes to cooperation with Washington in the event of a US attack on another NATO member.

""If the United States decides to attack another NATO country, then everything would stop — that includes NATO and therefore post-World War II security,"" Frederiksen said.

Meanwhile, Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called for the territory to restore ""good cooperation"" with the United States and urged Greenlanders not to ""panic.""

""The situation is not such that the United States can conquer Greenland. That is not the case. Therefore, we must not panic. We must restore the good cooperation we once had,"" Nielsen said while speaking in Greenland's capital, Nuuk.

In a social media post on Monday, he called for Trump to give up ""fantasies"" of annexing Greenland.

""That's enough now. No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation."" ""We are open to dialogue,"" he said. ""But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law.""

In a joint statement with Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Denmark and Greenland. 

""Arctic security remains a key priority for Europe and it is critical for international and transatlantic security,"" the joint statement read. 

""We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,"" it added. 

The seven leaders stressed that Washington ""is an essential partner in this endeavour.""

On Sunday, Trump reiterated his view that Greenland should come under the control of the United States a day after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured in a US incursion and taken to New York to stand trial.

""We need Greenland,"" Trump told journalists on Sunday, stressing that this was necessary for Washington's ""national security"" and claiming that the island was surrounded ""by Chinese and Russian ships.""

Trump has in the past offered to buy the territory, while not ruling out the use of military force to take it over.

Greenland has large quantities of oil, critical minerals and other resources. The territory could also gain economic importance in coming decades as new Arctic shipping routes open due to the melting of polar ice.

Greenland already hosts a US military base, and Copenhagen has expressed willingness to allow for the deployment of additional US troops.

On Monday, top Trump adviser Stephen Miller described Greenland as ""a colony of Denmark,"" adding ""nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Merz issues business SOS in letter to allies","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-chancellor-merz-warns-on-business-climate-in-2026/live-75403582","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:07:30 GMT","

Chancellor Merz has told coalition politicians the situation in several key German businesses is ""very critical."" He said the government must prioritize improving areas like energy and labor costs in 2026. Follow DW.

Here are some of the highlights from around Germany on January 6: 

Conservatives in Germany want to continue their tough stance on migration in 2026.

Speaking at his party's annual political kick-off in Seeon, Bavarian Premier Markus Söder of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria said young Ukrainian men will now be increasingly urged to leave Germany.

Conservatives have called for further measures to curb migration to Germany, especially after the number of first-time asylum applications in Germany more than halved in 2025. Young men from countries such as Syria and Ukraine will be encouraged to return.

It is striking that Söder is raising the issue in the context of the debate about the possible deployment of European troops to Ukraine for peacekeeping purposes.

""Before young German men have to go to Ukraine, young Ukrainian men should first return home and help defend their own country,"" the CSU leader said, rejecting the deployment of German soldiers there, at least for the time being. 

It is no coincidence that Söder is referring to how public debate is developing here in Germany, with many Germans anxious over the newly passed bill bringing back voluntary military conscription.

CSU politicians have not specified what measures they intend to use to persuade men from Syria and Ukraine to return to their countries. 

From a purely legal standpoint, it is difficult to deny young men from Ukraine protection from war. Politically, the issue is highly controversial, especially at the beginning of an election year in Germany.

Regional elections will be held in five of Germany's 16 states later this year, and in at least two of them there is a possibility that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party will emerge as the strongest force. Should the AfD then succeed in coming to power in one of those states, it would shake up the political system in the country.

This is another reason why the most traditionally conservative members of the CSU are starting a debate that appeals to the AfD's voter base. 

“You can't explain to people in Germany why young Ukrainian men are here receiving welfare instead of defending their country,” said Alexander Hoffmann, head of the CSU regional group in the German parliament, or Bundestag.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz also lays out his position on potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in his start-of-year letter to members of his coalition government. 

He calls for comprehensive security guarantees for Kyiv in any potential accord. 

""We want a ceasefire that protects Ukraine's sovereignty,"" Merz writes in the letter. He said that any deal therefore must ""be underlaid with security guarantees from the US and Europe."" 

On Tuesday afternoon, Merz is attending a meeting in Paris on the Ukraine conflict, with French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US special envoy Steve Witkoff among the other key figures set to attend. 

The chancellor said the talks on a potential truce were taking place ""in difficult conditions,"" as the Trump administration renews its push to halt a conflict the president used to boast that he would stop on his first day back in the White House.

""Russia is showing only a limited willingness to negotiate, President Zelenskyy is wrestling for the unity of Ukrainians, and transatlantic cooperation has deeply changed,"" Merz wrote. 

The chancellor praised an EU agreement at its December leaders' summit to continue support for Ukraine, saying it had fulfiled the ""financial requirements"" to support Kyiv in its defensive war ""for a long time"" to come.

Russia cannot ""have any doubt in our resolve,"" Merz said, albeit adding that his goal was to end ""the war and the terrible spilling of blood as quickly as possible."" 

Germany has deployed the frigate Sachsen on a NATO mission in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and North Atlantic as tensions rise between the US and Denmark over Greenland.

The warship left its home port of Wilhelmshaven on Tuesday afternoon with about 250 soldiers on board, the navy said, as families and fellow sailors saw the crew off.

""The core task of the Sachsen in SNMG 1 will be the control and protection of strategic sea lanes as well as the protection of critical infrastructure in the North Atlantic, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea,"" commander Wolfgang Eckmueller said in a navy statement.

The deployment comes as a dispute over Greenland sharpens between NATO allies the United States and Denmark.
US President Donald Trump has reiterated in recent days that Washington needs the Arctic island for national security, a claim Denmark has firmly rejected, with backing from other European countries.

Frigates like the Sachsen (the German name for the state of Saxony) are designed for escort duties and maritime surveillance, with advanced radar capable of monitoring airspace the size of the entire North Sea and equipped with air defense missiles.

The ship replaces the frigate Hamburg in the NATO group and is due back in Wilhelmshaven in mid-July, after the Hamburg returned shortly before Christmas following about six months at sea.

The leader of the Bavarian conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, has pushed back against criticism in Germany over the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Speaking at a retreat of CSU lawmakers at Seeon Abbey in Bavaria, Söder said he could not understand what he called ""partial hysteria"" around the case and added that it was good ""that Maduro is gone.""

Opposition politicians have criticized the US action against Venezuela and Maduro's arrest as a violation of international law.

Germany's government has not yet taken a position, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from the CSU's Christian Democrat sister party, saying it would take time to assess a complex situation.

Söder echoed the chancellor's caution on legal questions, saying he was not an expert in international law. He added that there was ""broad approval"" of the outcome.

Berlin's state government intends to repay citizens who had to stay in hotels as a result of power outages in recent days. 

Mayor Kai Wegner and the city state's senator responsible for the economy, Franziska Giffey, announced the plan on Tuesday. 

""This means that all individuals who are now affected and in need as a result can submit their hotel bills to the social services department,"" Giffey said on broadcaster Radio Eins. 

This would also apply to the so-called Berlin Partner Hotels which offered special discount nightly prices of €70 for a double room amid the sudden crisis, she said. 

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Mayor Wegner had already announced that he had asked Giffey to investigate to what extent the state could cover the costs incurred by residents, saying he expected that the government would foot the bill. 

A left-wing extremist group calling itself the ""Volcano Group"" claimed responsibility for the arson, with authorities in Berlin saying they considered the claim to be credible. Federal authorities are still investigating the details of the attack.

The attack and subsequent four-day outage in parts of southwestern Berlin has prompted questions about the lack of back-up power cables and redundancies, common in many major cities' key infrastructure, designed to mitigate such problems. 

The government statistics agency Destatis has published its latest inflation data for the month of December and by extension for a now-complete 2025. 

Inflation dipped slightly more than analysts expected in December, falling to 1.8% year-on-year, compared to 2.3% in November. 

On a monthly basis, the prices were unchanged. 

Energy prices, which had risen sharply in recent years, bucked the trend somewhat, with gasoline, electricity and gas prices 1.3% lower on average than in the previous December. 

According to Destatis, the average rate of inflation for 2025 as a whole lies just above the European target rate of 2%, at 2.2%. 

That's a second consecutive year of 2.2% inflation, just above the set targets, following rates far above central bank and government targets in 2023 (5.9%), 2022 (6.9%) and to a lesser extent in 2021 (3.1%) as well. 

Economic observers like the Ifo institute anticipate similar figures just above 2% for the coming year and for 2027.

Brandenburg state premier Dietmar Woidke has declared void his Social Democrats' (SPD) coalition government with the populist left-wing fringe party the BSW. 

With that, the only state government in Germany pairing the center left SPD with the socialist splinter party known in German as the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance has disintegrated. 

Several BSW politicians leaving the party, complaining of extremist tendencies within its ranks, put the coalition's razor-thin majority into question. 

As a result of this, Woidke had issued repeated appeals to the remaining BSW politicians to declare their support for the coalition. With these guarantees not forthcoming, and more resignations rendering the coalition a minority force in state parliament anyway, Woidke declared the alliance history late on Tuesday morning. 

""With this collapse of the [BSW] faction, the basis for cooperation in a coalition, the basis for working with a democratic majority is no longer available,"" Woidke said. ""Therefore, for me the basis of the coalition agreement is also expired."" 

Woidke said that on a de facto basis in the immediate term, his SPD would lead a minority government. He said he would seek talks with the center-right CDU about a potential alliance. 

Brandenburg last voted in state elections in late 2024. This was at more or less the height of popularity for the BSW, a splinter group formed by former socialist Left Party high-flyer Sahra Wagenknecht.

It sought to combine left-leaning policies on economic issues and criticism of support for Ukraine and a friendly line towards Russia with a tougher stance on migration. 

Particularly popular in the former East, the BSW claimed 13.5% of the vote in Brandenburg in September 2024, but it narrowly failed to clear the 5% hurdle required to guarantee representation in the Bundestag in 2025's national vote.

A mini-resurgence for the Left Party that Wagenknecht had abandoned helped explain the BSW declining almost as swiftly as it had risen.

Should Woidke and other parties in Brandenburg fail to broker a new working coalition, early state elections could be a possibility. The state is a stronghold for the AfD, which at 29.2% support came very close to eclipsing the SPD, on 30.9%, as the state's largest party in 2024.

Highlights from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's letter to coalition parliamentarians at the start of 2026, dated Sunday, found their way into German media on Tuesday.

Most lead with his stark warnings on the business climate in the country. 

""The situation of German industry is very critical in some branches,"" Merz warned in the letter.

""Industry giants as well as considerable numbers of mid-sized and small businesses are facing major challenges, in many companies jobs are being lost."" 

The warning follows a year punctuated by stagnant economic growth, major job losses in key industries like carmaking, and bankruptcy rates unseen in Germany in years. 

Merz wrote that as a result of this, the coalition will ""have to concentrate on making the right political and legal decisions to drastically improve the economic conditions.""

Merz wrote that it had become clear that productivity in Germany was ""no longer good enough"" amid ""changed global economic conditions.""

""Labor costs, energy costs, bureaucratic hurdles and tax burdens are all too high,"" he said. ""We will need to work on this together."" 

The chancellor's appeal might be aimed in particular at his center left allies, the Social Democrats, which tend to have slightly different economic priorities to Merz's Christian Democrats.

The coalition spent the back end of 2025 struggling or indeed failing to agree on some core economic policy reforms.

Heating and electricity supply remained patchy in parts of southwestern Berlin on Tuesday, the fourth day following a sabotage of high-voltage cables leading to a power station in what authorities in the capital believe was a fire set by left-wing militants. 

Around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were initially cut off in the Saturday morning attack on the cables, which was claimed by a left-wing extremist group. 

According to the Stromnetz Berlin operator, around 19,500 households and 1,000 businesses are back online, but it may take until Thursday to get everyone back on the grid. 

Key facilities like hospitals, which briefly had to rely on generators for power, are back online, while 72 of 74 affected care homes are also being supplied again, Stromnetz Berlin said. 

Temperatures in Berlin, no stranger to harsh winters, have been at or below freezing more or less consistently since Saturday's sabotage.

Hello and welcome to our German news updates for January 6, 2026. 

Much of the country, from north to south and east to west, awoke to at least a smattering of snow and temperatures around freezing point on Tuesday. 

It might be ideal weather for the Siberian mountain goats at the Berlin Zoological Gardens, but for city authorities and thousands of residents facing a fourth day of power outages after sabotage, conditions could be better. 

Meanwhile, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's start-of-year letter to politicians in his coalition is doing the rounds in the media, and leads with a stark warning on the state of some core businesses in the country. 

And in Brandenburg, the state coalition government is unraveling.

This is a byproduct of the disintegration of the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) party, that's already looking rather less relevant now than it did when the state last voted in September 2024.

The Ukrainian president is calling for further military support to boost diplomacy as more than 30 allies meet in the French capital to solidify security guarantees. Follow DW for the latest.

Follow this blog for the latest headlines regarding Russia's war in Ukraine from Tuesday, January 6.

The leaders gathering at the snow-covered Elysee palace in Paris are supposed to be laser-focused on Ukraine and how to turn vague pledges to monitor and back up an eventual ceasefire into concrete commitments for Kyiv. 

That's still the expected outcome of these talks, but before they even began, a handful of Europe's heavyweights found themselves scrambling to issue a statement in support of Denmark after more talk of the US annexing Greenland.

It's clear those leaders, including Germany's Friedrich Merz, the UK's Keir Starmer and Denmark's Mette Frederiksen, were trying to remain diplomatic — talking about what they've done boost Arctic security and insisting on respect for the UN charter. 

But it feels like yet another example of how the US and Europe are simply speaking completely different languages. 

Would the US really try to annex territory of a NATO ally? And how could Denmark and its European partners — still militarily reliant on Washington — ever hope to respond? 

Those are questions European leaders thought they'd never have to ponder — but planning for what was once unthinkable takes up a lot of their time these days.

With leaders and representatives of more than 30 states meeting today in Paris, reports are circulating about possible pledges for Ukraine to come out of the summit. 

Here is what is expected to be discussed in the meeting, according to reports by the AFP and Reuters news agencies citing a draft statement:

Diplomats expect the proposal to still undergo minor changes.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, about his dual approach in the war with Russia: diplomacy and active defense. 

The two held talks before the ""most representative meeting"" of the so-called Coalition of the Willing in Paris later on Tuesday. 

""Diplomacy and real assistance must go hand in hand,"" Zelenskyy said in a social media post after his meeting with Macron. 

He added that ""every meeting must yield concrete results — new decisions regarding air defense, new assistance packages, and new capabilities to protect the skies.""

""Every delivery of air defense missiles saves lives and boosts the chances for diplomacy,"" Zelenskyy said. 

Tuesday's meeting is expected to focus on details of allies' contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with ‌Russia.

The governor of the Lipetsk region in western Russia, Igor Artamonov, said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at a factory in Usman. 

An official from Ukraine's SBU ​security service later confirmed to Reuters news agency that Ukrainian forces struck an oil depot in ⁠Lipetsk.

A Ukrainian drone attack on Monday had also sparked a fire at an industrial facility in Yelets, another town in the Lipetsk region, according to Artamonov. No casualties were reported in either of the attacks. 

Ukraine has in recent months stepped up attacks on Russia'sv military and energey infrastructure in retaliation for Moscow's deadly strikes. 

French President Emmanual Macron welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at the Elysee Palace ahead of the Coalition of the Willing meeting later Tuesday. 

Macron and Zelenskyy is holding a one-on-one meeting before meeting with other allies later. 

They are also scheduled to have lunch with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

A document circulating among German media outlets shows that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has placed Berlin's support for Ukraine among his agenda for 2026.

The document, a four-page letter sent at the start of the year to members of his governing coalition, outlines the chancellor's priorities for the new year. 

In the letter, Merz reiterated Germany's continued support for Ukraine. 

He said the EU's decision on frozen Russian assets created a financial basis to support Ukraine's defense over the long term.

""Russia must have no doubt about our resolve,"" the chancellor wrote, while stressing that Berlin would continue to push for a ceasefire that preserved Ukraine's sovereignty.

""Our diplomatic work is being carried out under difficult conditions,"" he said, noting, among other factors, what he described as profound changes in trans-Atlantic cooperation.

Top officials and representatives of some 35 countries are attending a meeting in Paris of the so-called Coalition of the Willing, a group of Western countries backing Ukraine and working toward ending Russia's war. 

According to media reports citing diplomats, the talks will focus on a draft document outlining security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. A multinational force to secure peace between Russia and Ukraine is reportedly in the proposal. 

Reuters news agency quoted the French presidency as saying that an agreement had already been reached ""on the operational details of the security guarantees.""

""We will explain how they are structured and the need for a long-term commitment from everyone involved,"" the French presidency said, according to Reuters. 

French President Emmanuel Macron is due to announce the results of the meeting at a press conference later on Tuesday.

Among the top-ranking officials due to join the meeting in Paris are:

Russia is not part of the meeting format. Moscow does not directly engage with Kyiv, but there have been US-mediated talks in recent months.

It's another busy week of diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year-long war between Russia and Ukraine, with talks due to continue this week.

On Monday, Ukraine's allies' chiefs of general staff were meeting in Kyiv to discuss the country's future. 

Today, the so-called Coalition of the Willing, led by France and the United Kingdom, are meeting in Paris to discuss the outcomes of the meetings from the previous day.

The meeting comes a day after Russia launched a deadly attack on the Ukrainian capital.

			French ambassador says seizure runs counter to the ‘principle of non-use of force'

France sided with Russia in condemning the Trump administration's capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela at an emergency UN Security Council meeting.

Emmanuel Macron had initially celebrated the US's seizure of Mr Maduro, saying Venezuelans could “only rejoice”, but on Monday walked back his support with a statement saying he “neither supported nor approved” the US military operation.

Paris's UN envoy warned that any violations of international law by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, which include the US, eroded “the very foundation of the international order”.

“The military operation that has led to the capture of Maduro runs counter to the principle of peace dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of non-use of force,” said Jay Dharmadhikari, the deputy French ambassador to the UN.

China and Russia, which are also permanent members of the Security Council, called for the UN body to unite in rejecting the US turning back to an “era of lawlessness”.

Mr Maduro, like his predecessor, forged a close relationship with Russia, while China was the main destination for most Venezuelan oil.

“We cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge, which alone bears the right to invade any country, to label culprits, to hand down and to enforce punishments irrespective of notions of international law, sovereignty and non-intervention,” Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador, said.

The US seized Mr Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, early on Saturday from their home on a military base. They were taken to New York and indicted for allegedly participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy. Mr Maduro and his wife have insisted they are innocent.

Venezuela's UN envoy called for the council to demand that Washington release Mr Maduro and his wife.

“If the kidnapping of a head of state, the bombing of a sovereign country and the open threat of further armed action are tolerated or downplayed, the message sent to the world is a devastating one: namely that the law is optional, and that force is the true arbiter of international relations,” Samuel Moncada, the Venezuelan ambassador, said.

He warned that other countries cannot afford to look away: “Accepting such a logic would mean to open the door to a deeply unstable world.”

Mike Waltz, the US envoy to the UN, defended the operation in Venezuela as a justified and “surgical law enforcement operation”, calling out the 15-member council for criticising the targeting of Mr Maduro.

“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” said Mr Waltz, Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Denmark, which has been pushing back against Mr Trump's continuous claims that he wants to take over Greenland, used the meeting to again defend the territory, saying the “inviolability of borders is not up for negotiation”.

Christina Markus Lassen, the Danish ambassador to the UN, also voiced support for Venezuela's sovereignty, saying “no state should seek to influence political outcomes in Venezuela through the use of threat of force or through other means inconsistent with international law”.

Ms Markus Lessen also carefully denounced US prospects for taking over Greenland without mentioning its Nato ally by name.

“The inviolability of borders is not up for negotiation,” she said.

Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, said in a statement that he was “deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected with regard to the 3 January military action”.

He said the “grave” action by the US could set a precedent for how future relations between nations unfold.

A Caracas highway is choked with cars.

But far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela's capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.

The gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US's brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.

Days after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.

“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don't know what's going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.

A state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.

One Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.

The paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.

The presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.

Videos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country's natural resources.

Another video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro's closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”

Mr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.

As Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.

“There's enough people here, there's enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.

On Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.

Police and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro's vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.

“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.

“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”

Her comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump's warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.

In Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro's capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez's ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro's regime.

The country's constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro's absence a “temporary” one.

In such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.

María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country's transition to democracy needed to happen.

“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She's a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”

There has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.

“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.

“But now we're at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they're all still here.”

Speaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.

“Most international leaders don't agree with what happened, but it happened.

“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”

While she pushed back at Mr Trump's suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”

“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.

Others were less accepting of the current situation.

“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.

“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we've been through so much already... I know that we weren't well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”

The thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.

“I don't agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.

“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”

Donald Trump has no plan for what comes next in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with his thinking.

After capturing Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, the US president is relying on his top aides to develop their Venezuela policy on the hoof.

“There is no blueprint, no plan for what comes next,” said one source. “And anybody who tells you that it's anything other than day-by-day is really not being forthright with you.”

The former Venezuelan leader appeared in Manhattan's federal court on Monday.

He was arrested in an audacious raid by US special forces on Saturday morning to face charges of narco-terrorism.

Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's vice-president, has since been sworn in as the interim leader. At first, she struck a defiant tone, but later suggested that she was prepared to work with the US.

At the same time, Mr Trump's vision for what comes next appears at odds with the views of his top foreign policy official.

The result is confusion about how Washington plans to oversee Venezuela's transition to a democratic government and exactly how it will avoid the sort of quagmire that bogged down past interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

“We are going to run the country until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” is how Mr Trump put it on Saturday, setting out a course to democratic elections, even as he played down the role of the country's democratically elected opposition leaders.

Marco Rubio, his secretary of state and one of the leading Venezuela hawks in his administration, described things differently.

He told Sunday news shows that the US would exert influence on the Caracas government through its sanctions, preventing oil tankers from coming and going.

“That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela,” he told CBS News.

A second source said their public words reflected private differences on how to view the remnants of Mr Maduro's regime.

For Mr Rubio, there is unease that so many officials connected to the drug trade remain in place.

“There are dozens of people here,” said the source. “They've been indicted and implicated. So what about their future?”

Mr Rubio cut an agitated figure during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Jan 3. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other while in front of him, Mr Trump laid out his view of the raid, saying that the US would run the country until a “safe, proper and judicious” transition could be achieved.

A senior White House official said it was wrong to think there was confusion among Mr Trump and his top team.

“This is false – president Trump and secretary Rubio have been consistent,” they said. “Both were speaking about exerting maximum leverage with the remaining elements in Venezuela and ensuring they co-operate with the United States by halting illegal migration, stopping drug flows, revitalising oil infrastructure, and doing what is right for the Venezuelan people.”

The president said a working group of senior advisers were planning for Venezuela's future, but he did not spell out their roles and responsibilities.

Regional experts have warned that the ambition and rhetoric have yet to be matched by a detailed plan.

“The duration of the transition, its benchmarks, and its ultimate outcome all remain resoundingly unclear,” said Laurel Rapp, director of the US and North America programme at Chatham House, in a recent commentary. “Trump and Rubio's imprecise language about who currently runs Venezuela hints at limited succession planning, if any.”

Senior Trump figures see the approach as a strength, not a criticism. They say he makes huge demands on his staff to operate on “Trump time” by making rapid decisions and then setting tight deadlines for them to be enacted.

“It is not a criticism. It is his style,” said the first source familiar with the president's Venezuela thinking. “Pull the trigger and then figure out how it works.”

In this case, he added, Mr Trump and his team were particularly incensed by the way Mr Maduro had responded to US demands by dancing in public.

“At some point here, he did feel that sometimes he was being mocked,” he said, confirming previous reports by the New York Times.

Mr Rubio and other top officials briefed leaders in Congress on Monday night amid mounting concerns that Mr Trump is operating without consulting representatives and does not have a clear vision for running the South American country.

Republican leaders entered the closed-door session at the Capitol largely supportive of Trump's decision to forcibly remove Mr Maduro from power. However, many Democrats emerged with more questions as Mr Trump maintains a fleet of naval vessels off the Venezuelan coast and urges US companies to reinvest in the country's underperforming oil industry.

A war powers resolution that would prohibit US military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress is heading for a vote this week in the Senate.

Mike Johnson, the house speaker, said: “We don't expect troops on the ground.”

Gregg Nunziata, a long-time Republican aide who is now the executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law, said competing justifications for action – to stem the supply of drugs reaching American soil or to get access to Venezuelan oil or to promote democracy, for example – muddied thinking about next steps.

“I think observers are right to question whether the lack of a coherent explanation and whether the conflicting justifications from the administration are an indication of a deliberate strategy or real confusion within the senior ranks of the administration,” he told The Telegraph.

A state department official said Monday that the Trump administration is making preliminary plans to reopen the US embassy in Venezuela.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early preparations “to allow for a reopening” of the embassy in Caracas had begun in the event that Mr Trump decides to return American diplomats to the country.

“We can no longer trust … our federal government for credible information about vaccines,” one critic said.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Monday that it is reducing the number of vaccinations it is recommending for young children, immediately dropping the number of diseases and ailments covered by the vaccine regimen from 17 to 11.

States are technically the authority on what vaccines children should or are required to get when they are born and in the years beyond. But the CDC recommendation is very influential in what vaccines officials end up choosing. 

The CDC will continue to recommend a number of shots for children, including those that cover measles, polio, and whooping cough. But vaccines to prevent six diseases or illnesses — including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal disease, rotavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — will no longer be recommended by the CDC to be administered for children, or will only be recommended for high-risk groups and after consultation with health care providers. 

The new directive also alters the number of vaccine doses recommended to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus that can cause cancer later in life, going from two or three doses down to just one instead.

The CDC said the new guidance was meant to be more aligned with what other European nations, such as Denmark, have concluded for their own populations are necessary for childhood vaccines. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who has packed the vaccine advisory committee within the CDC with individuals who espouse similar viewpoints, heralded the changes.

“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement. 

But even health experts from Denmark said the move was foolhardy, as it wasn't based on evidence. The CDC's previous standards were made based on decades of epidemiological research on the U.S. population, whereas Denmark's officials are making recommendations tailored to their population's needs and culture.

“Personally, I do not think this makes sense scientifically,” said Anders Hviid, an official in Denmark's Statens Serum Institute, speaking to The Washington Post about the CDC's changes. “Public health is not one size fits all. It's population-specific and dynamic. Denmark and the U.S. are two very different countries.”

The alterations could have dire consequences.

“The abrupt change to the entire U.S. childhood vaccine schedule is alarming, unnecessary, and will endanger the health of children in the United States,” said Helen Chu, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle and a former CDC vaccine recommendations panel member.

The introduction of new RSV vaccines for infants, for example, saw rates for the virus drop by half last year, one study found, a significant improvement for an ailment that is the leading cause of hospitalization for children under the age of 3. Studies examining the effect of the rotavirus vaccine have also shown that, when those vaccines debuted from 2006 to 2012 , hospitalization rates for children in the U.S. for that ailment dropped by 94 percent. 

It's also likely that the decision to change the vaccine schedule was based, at least in part, on false premises. The Trump administration has disputed the need for infants to obtain hepatitis B vaccines, for instance, claiming that the virus is mostly transmitted through sexual contact, and thus the vaccine could be delayed. However, hepatitis B is also spread through blood and saliva, and transmission can occur at daycare centers or other places where infants or children interact. Researchers estimate that even a small delay in administering the vaccine will likely result in higher rates of infection in infants.  

Medical experts and organizations blasted the federal government's decision to change the recommended vaccine schedule for children.

“Upending the childhood vaccine schedule leaves American children at much greater risk of contracting hepatitis, rotavirus, and other preventable infections,” said former CDC director Tom Frieden. “This is a giant step backward that jeopardizes children's health and safety.”

“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a statement decrying the changes, writing that:

For decades, leading health experts, immunologists, and pediatricians have carefully reviewed new data and evidence as part of the immunization recommendation process, helping to keep newborns, infants, and children protected from diseases they could be exposed to in the United States as they develop and grow. Today's decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries' practices, upends this deliberate scientific process.

Issuing his own comments on the matter, Sean O'Leary, chair of the infectious disease committee at the AAP, stated that it is “becoming increasingly clear that we can no longer trust the leadership of our federal government for credible information about vaccines, and that's a tragedy that will cause needless suffering.”

The American Medical Association (AMA) also condemned the CDC's changes, stating that the organization is “deeply concerned by recent changes to the childhood immunization schedule that affects the health and safety of millions of children.”

“The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies,” the group added.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

 How Maduro's Capture Could Transform Latin America

 Will Freeman

An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated that Cuba rarely shot and killed dozens of of people at a protest; it has never shot and killed dozens of people at a protest.

On January 3, U.S. forces did something many observers thought impossible: they quickly captured and arrested Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's wily, seemingly coup-proof autocrat. For years, Maduro had proved himself an expert in authoritarian survival—crushing at least nine military mutinies and outlasting American economic pressure. But early Saturday morning, he fell practically without a fight. Delta Force helicopters took limited fire as they flew low over Caracas rooftops to Maduro's bunker, where U.S. troops stormed inside, grabbed him and his wife, and whisked them to an aircraft carrier. Hours later, both were behind bars in New York, facing drug and weapons charges. No American lives were lost, although at least 80 Cubans and Venezuelans, including some civilians, were killed. The whole operation looked so easy that many analysts have reasonably wondered whether regime insiders abetted Maduro's extraction, in effect staging a palace coup by proxy. At the same time, the operation was a dramatic display of U.S. President Donald Trump's willingness to cast aside what's left of the so-called rules-based international order and use military force to assert U.S. dominance over the Western Hemisphere.

In the days since, Venezuelans living abroad have celebrated ecstatically. But the country itself has remained quiet. Most people seem to recognize that it's possible little has really changed. Trump, after all, has left Maduro's regime largely intact, recognizing Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's vice president, as interim president before she had even publicly accepted the position herself. The question is whether the shifts will remain relatively modest, or if Maduro's extraction presages bigger changes within both Venezuela and the region.

There is a wide variety of possibilities. Maduro's removal might facilitate Venezuela's transition to democracy, tank Cuba's regime, and advance Trump's bid to assert U.S. hemispheric dominance. Alternatively, a reshuffled Maduro regime might simply accept more deportees from the United States and give Washington control over its oil reserves, but otherwise change little. The regional shock waves could be limited. In fact, the inability to fundamentally change Venezuela might end up revealing the limits of American power.

But the eventual outcomes will probably fall somewhere in between these two extremes. In the short-term, the consequences for Venezuela will likely be muted, as Trump tries to work with the reconfigured regime to secure his top objective: access to oil. Other Latin American governments might retaliate with words, but most will avoid responding with deeds so as not to incur Trump's anger. As time goes on, however, the situation may become more fraught. Trump might attack Venezuela again, especially if Rodríguez is unwilling or, constrained by other regime figures, unable to comply with his directives. Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba will likely decrease, weakening (although not necessarily collapsing) the island's already flagging regime. Colombia could face American intervention, given that its left-wing president—unlike most of its neighbors—seems eager to fight with Trump and that Trump welcomes this dispute. And critically, Latin American countries, especially the larger, more geographically distant ones, may try to further diversify their economic and security relationships to reduce their exposure to an assertive and demanding Washington. Trump's attack, in other words, could advance or set back his hemispheric dream.

To figure out how Venezuela and the region might change, analysts should first pay attention to the breadth of the Trump administration's demands of Venezuela's reshuffled leadership. That will require looking less at the orders and aspirations Trump lists off the cuff in public, which are bound to vary, and more at the reports and leaks about what he and his team are privately pressing Caracas to deliver.

One possibility is that these demands will be narrow: opening up Venezuela's oil reserves to long-term U.S. control and investment, sidelining certain geopolitical rivals, including Iran and Cuba, and getting Caracas to accept an increased number of deportees. Trump alluded to such a scenario in his January 3 press conference, when he stressed the importance of Venezuela's oil and evinced little interest in the restoration of its democracy. In fact, Trump barely mentioned Venezuela's opposition; when he did, it was only to say that the opposition leader and recent Nobel Peace Prize-recipient, Maria Corina Machado, was insufficiently “respected” to run the country. By contrast, Trump suggested Rodríguez, a longtime loyalist to Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, could make her country “great again.” Trump also said that a group of administration officials would “run” Venezuela, although the administration later declared that he meant Washington would run it indirectly by threatening the Maduro regime's remaining leaders into complying with American demands.

Such a limited U.S. agenda might satisfy many members of Trump's team, including Vice President JD Vance, the top policy adviser Stephen Miller, and others skeptical of nation-building projects and more focused on domestic priorities. Trump might also perceive this path as the most doable and least unpopular with Americans, only a third of whom said they supported the use of military force to remove Maduro in a January 5 poll. One congressional staffer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told me, “We just saw a trade deal with a change of leaders.”

But other Trump allies have signaled they will press for harder, more ambitious shifts: namely, an eventual end to Venezuela's Bolivarian socialist regime and a return to democracy, likely through negotiations. Such figures include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and important Republicans in Congress. Although Trump seems less interested in democracy, Rubio clearly has his and other administration officials' ears on matters related to Latin America and may be able to convince them that a democratic transition will serve their interests. Republican lawmakers, for their part, might persuade Trump that pursuing only narrow, oil- and migration-centric goals will hurt the party electorally. That could especially prove true among Latino voters in Florida eager for regime change in Venezuela and Cuba, many of whom already feel betrayed by the harsher than expected implementation of Trump's deportation policies. (Miami just elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in nearly 30 years.)



Trump's decisions will also depend on what choices Venezuelan officials make next. If they defy the White House by refusing to hand over oil rights or to reduce ties with Cuba, Washington might again attack the country, as Trump has repeatedly stated. But cooperation seems the likelier path. Rodríguez, in particular, has a reputation for pragmatism. She may have condemned Washington's attacks, but such statements could reflect a need to appease regime hard-liners and would-be rivals, such as Diosdado Cabello, the minister for interior, justice, and peace. They could also be designed to distract from suspicions that she helped turn Maduro in. Either way, they should not be taken at face value. According to reporting by The Miami Herald, last year, Rodríguez and her politically influential brother, who was just reappointed as head of the National Assembly, put forward a plan to U.S. officials in which she would replace Maduro and work with the United States, in exchange for keeping his system in place. (Rubio, according to the report, blocked the deal.) Rodríguez is also less committed to Cuba than Maduro was, which news outlets suggest is the result of her frustration with Cuba's failure to reliably pay Venezuela for its oil shipments. At least some Trump administration officials told The New York Times off the record they think they can work with her. In fact, if she or other regime officials did secretly collude with the United States to turn over Maduro—as seems possible—then cooperation with Washington may already be underway.

Trump has another incentive to keep his demands of Rodríguez narrow: if he does, she is more likely to agree to them. Most U.S. officials probably do not want to attack Caracas again. It is a move that, rather than compelling obedience, could easily sow chaos. A narrow deal—support for Rodríguez in exchange for more oil and less aid to Havana—is thus the path of least resistance for both sides.

Of course, for Venezuela to cooperate with either narrow or broad demands, someone has to be in control of the country. Right now, that remains the Rodríguez siblings. But they face powerful potential challengers—most notably Cabello, who wields influence over Venezuela's armed paramilitaries, or colectivos, as well as over the country's national police and parts of its intelligence apparatus. He may want to stop Caracas from cooperating with the White House, which views him with great suspicion. (Cabello was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for drug trafficking, alongside Maduro.) If Cabello cannot get Rodríguez to follow his requests, he could try either to depose her or to make the country ungovernable. In that case, much would depend on what the head of Venezuela's armed forces, Vladimir Padrino López—the regime's third power center—opts to do. As of now, it is impossible to say who he might side with, or whether he could keep the military unified if infighting seriously intensifies.

If Rodríguez works with Trump and maintains control of her country, then the Latin American regime under the greatest immediate pressure may not actually be Venezuela's. Instead, it could be Cuba's. The island is dependent on Venezuelan assistance, and it was in dire straits even before Trump had Maduro captured. The Cuban economy is in tatters. Tourism, its primary industry, has shrunk to at least half its pre-pandemic levels with no signs of rebounding. Crime and disease are on the rise as law enforcement and hospitals break down, thanks to insufficient financing. The island's government has withstood enormous pressure before. But it is facing its greatest-ever crisis.

The most immediate risk for Cuba's rulers is energy. The island relies heavily on imported fuel, much of it sourced from Venezuela, to power its electrical grid, which is teetering on the brink of failure. Over 40 percent of the country goes without energy during peak hours. Some provinces have power for just two to four hours a day. If Washington now cuts Cuba off from almost all Venezuelan oil—the U.S. naval blockade having already stopped some shipments—the grid could collapse. Havana will surely look to other countries to step in, but it is unlikely to find many suppliers. Mexico sends some oil currently, but less than in previous years. With Trump repeatedly threatening to attack Mexican territory, its officials are unlikely to increase supplies now. Brazil doesn't seem inclined to replace Venezuela either, since leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, who is running for reelection next year, knows that doing so would undermine his newly improved relationship with Trump and potentially invite election meddling. Russia, strained by its invasion of Ukraine, and China are also unlikely to fill the vacuum.

If Havana, usually protected from prolonged blackouts, plunges into darkness, the regime could face mass protests as large as or larger than those of July 2021. (The 2021 demonstrations, the first of their scale in decades, showed the depth and breadth of public anger.) Such protests might prove tough to contain, especially if they played out in dense Havana neighborhoods. Cuba's security forces frequently engage in brutal methods of smothering unrest—detention, torture, threats. But they have never shot and kill dozens of people at a protest. It is unclear what would happen if that changed and whether protests might cascade.



Still, it's entirely possible the regime could survive even this dire situation. The Cuban military has immense stakes in the government's survival, given that it controls much of the economy through a web of companies that would vanish after a political transition. And it seems no one on the island is in a position to challenge the armed forces. As with Maduro's regime, deposing Cuba's communist regime might require a U.S. military operation—a maneuver that neither Trump nor the American public seemingly has much appetite for. The president, for example, recently stated he believes the Cuban regime will fall on its own, without direct U.S. involvement.

Trump has, however, threatened to use direct military force against Colombia. He has said the country is “run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it for very long.” Colombian President Gustavo Petro, unlike the Venezuelan and Cuban leaders, was democratically elected. He is a leftist ideologically opposed to Trump and who was at times friendly with Maduro. Yet Petro is not changing his behavior. To the contrary, he has relished the confrontation, both because it gives him a much-sought international pedestal and because he thinks it will help his political successor. Colombia's presidential election is just months away, and Petro's preferred candidate, Iván Cepeda, is likely to face scrutiny over the current government's unmet policy promises. Petro is eager to shift the conversation away from domestic challenges, and squaring off against Trump serves that purpose.

There are reasons to doubt that Trump will make good on his threats against Bogotá. Washington seems to expect that a conservative president will win in May. The United States also relies on Colombia, its main Latin American security partner, to help with much of its regional counternarcotics efforts, even if current U.S.-Colombian tensions have obstructed them. But Trump is unpredictable, and if Petro continues to forthrightly respond to U.S. actions in Venezuela, Trump could intervene forcefully in some way.

Beyond Cuba, Colombia, and of course Venezuela, Maduro's removal may have more limited near-term consequences. Lula criticized Washington's strikes, but his government quickly recognized Rodríguez as interim president and made no real effort to defend Maduro. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, another leftist and occasional Maduro apologist, likewise has other priorities: navigating upcoming trade renegotiations and avoiding U.S. military strikes on Mexican soil against drug cartels. Mexico's dependence on trade with the United States sharply limits her room for maneuver.

This silence indicates that much of the Western Hemisphere is, for now, Washington's domain. For years, analysts have watched China make inroads in the region and argued that U.S. influence was slipping. But Maduro's seizure suggests that past administrations—out of caution, respect for law and norms, and sometimes neglect—simply didn't exercise the substantial leverage that Washington has long possessed.

It is uncertain, however, whether Trump's intervention in Venezuela will become a testament to American power or expose its limits, and eventually contribute to its erosion. Many countries are already responding to Trump's punitive use of tariffs by hurrying to strengthen diplomatic and trade ties with Asia and Europe. Some states, including Brazil and Colombia, are experimenting with building closer defense and tech ties, respectively, with China. Maduro's extraction may accelerate these trends. Trump could also lose interest in Washington's so-called near abroad, moving on to other items on his international agenda. The administration's recently issued National Security Strategy puts the Western Hemisphere above every other region, and Maduro's capture and the massive U.S. naval buildup in the Caribbean suggests that this ambition is not simply rhetoric. But this reallocation of assets may or may not endure. Outside of Rubio, few officials in the Trump administration seem personally invested in an “Americas first” foreign policy that goes beyond more regional security cooperation and increased deportations.

What Trump does next in Venezuela and the Caribbean will thus be very telling. His interventions will test just how far U.S. power to shape hemispheric affairs reaches.

 What the Technology Means for Deterrence and War

 Brett V. Benson and Brett J. Goldstein

Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming indispensable to national security decision-making. Militaries around the world already depend on AI models to sift through satellite imagery, assess adversaries' capabilities, and generate recommendations for when, where, and how force should be deployed. As these systems advance, they promise to reshape how states respond to threats. But advanced AI platforms also threaten to undermine deterrence, which has long provided the overall basis for U.S. security strategy.

Effective deterrence depends on a country being credibly able and willing to impose unacceptable harm on an adversary. AI strengthens some of the foundations of that credibility. Better intelligence, faster assessments, and more consistent decision-making can reinforce deterrence by more clearly communicating to adversaries a country's defense capabilities as well as its apparent resolve to use them. Yet adversaries can also exploit AI to undermine these goals: they can poison the training data of models on which countries rely, thereby altering their output, or launch AI-enabled influence operations to sway the behavior of key officials. In a high-stakes crisis, such manipulation could limit a state's ability to maintain credible deterrence and distort or even paralyze its leaders' decision-making.

Consider a crisis scenario in which China has placed sweeping economic sanctions on Taiwan and launched large-scale military drills around the island. U.S. defense officials turn to AI-powered systems to help formulate the U.S. response—unaware that Chinese information operations have already corrupted these systems by poisoning their training data and core inputs. As a result, the models overstate China's actual capabilities and understate U.S. readiness, producing a skewed assessment that ultimately discourages U.S. mobilization. At the same time, Chinese influence campaigns, boosted by sudden floods of AI-driven fake content across platforms such as Facebook and TikTok, suppress the U.S. public's support of intervention. Unable to interpret their intelligence and gauge public sentiment accurately, U.S. leaders may then conclude that decisive action is too risky.

China, sensing opportunity, now launches a full blockade of Taiwan and commences drone strikes. It also saturates the island with deepfakes of U.S. officials expressing their willingness to concede Taiwan, fabricated polls showing collapsing U.S. support, and rumors of U.S. abandonment. In this scenario, credible signals from the United States showing that it was inclined to respond might have deterred China from escalating—and might well have been pursued if U.S. officials had not been dissuaded by poisoned AI systems and distorted public sentiment. Instead of strengthening deterrence, AI has undermined U.S. credibility and opened the door to Chinese aggression.

As AI systems become increasingly central to leaders' decision-making, they could give information warfare a potent new role in coercion and conflict. To bolster deterrence in the AI age, then, policymakers, defense planners, and intelligence agencies must reckon with the ways in which AI models can be weaponized and ensure that digital defenses against these threats are keeping pace. The outcome of future crises may depend on it.

For deterrence to work, an adversary must believe that a defender is both capable of imposing serious costs and resolved to do so if challenged. Some elements of military power are visible, but others—such as certain weapons capabilities, readiness levels, and mobilization capacities—are harder to gauge from the outside. Resolve is even more opaque: only the leaders of a country typically know precisely how willing they are to wage war. Deterrence, therefore, hinges on how effectively a country can credibly signal both its capabilities and its willingness to act.

Costly military actions, such as repositioning forces or raising readiness levels, demonstrate credibility because they require time, resources, and political risk. After a Pakistani militant group launched an attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, for example, India amassed troops along its border with Pakistan, and by credibly signaling both its ability and determination to act, it deterred further strikes on its soil. The domestic political pressures inherent in democracies can also bolster credibility. Leaders of democracies must answer to their citizens, and making threats only to later back down can result in political backlash. In 1982, for instance, after Argentina seized the Falkland Islands, strong public pressure in the United Kingdom reinforced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determination to act, lending additional credibility to the United Kingdom's threat of military response. Such accountability generally gives a democratic state's deterrent threats more weight than those of autocratic states. Speed is also a factor: a deterrent state's threats are more credible when it is seen to be able to act swiftly and automatically against a threat.

On the surface, artificial intelligence appears well suited to strengthen deterrence. By processing vast amounts of data, AI can provide better intelligence, clarify signals, and accelerate leaders' decisions by producing faster and more comprehensive analyses. In the war in Ukraine, AI tools allow the Ukrainian military to scan satellite and drone images to identify Russian troop and equipment movements, missile sites, and supply routes; pull and aggregate data from radar, sound, and radio signals; and sift rapidly through training manuals, intelligence reports, or other materials to create a more complete picture of Russian force strength. For defense planners, such information allows a clearer assessment of their military capabilities relative to those of an adversary.

AI can also reinforce deterrence by ensuring that each side's actions are clearly communicated to the other. Since states frequently have incentives to bluff, they may struggle to demonstrate that they are truly prepared to follow through on their threats. By contrast, AI-enabled tools can ensure that when a country takes costly actions to signal its resolve, those actions are communicated quickly, clearly, and consistently. The adversary's own AI systems can then efficiently interpret these signals, lessening the risk of misperception. For instance, by tracking domestic public opinion in real time, AI tools can help a democratic country demonstrate that it is prepared to act by showing that its threatened response is backed by real political support. Adversaries can then use their own AI tools to affirm that this support is genuine. Using AI to spot patterns and anomalies that humans might miss—such as sudden changes in troop movements, financial flows, or cyberactivity—can give leaders a clearer read on an adversary's intentions.

Because an aggressor can exploit even slight delays in a target country's response—to seize territory or otherwise advance its aims—deterrence works best when the latter is able to persuade the aggressor that it will respond quickly enough to deny it any such time advantage. AI helps reinforce this perception by enabling defenders to detect challenges earlier and respond faster. Improving leaders' long-term planning can strengthen and maintain credibility in longer crises, too. By running large numbers of “what if” scenarios—using data on force, geography, supply lines, and alliances—AI can provide leaders a clearer picture of how a conflict might unfold and help them maintain consistent strategies as conditions evolve.

The same AI technologies that strengthen deterrence can also make it vulnerable to exploitation. Rather than helping a country credibly convey what it knows about itself, AI systems, if they are manipulated, can instead leave leaders unsure of their own capabilities and resolve. Adversaries could use AI to distort public opinion or poison the very AI systems on which a country's leaders depend. By deploying these twin tactics—AI-enabled influence operations and AI model poisoning—an adversary could reshape a country's information environment in ways that directly affect its deterrence. In the worst case, such confusion could cause a country's deterrence to fail, even when its underlying capabilities and resolve are strong.

An adversary could also use influence operations to target a country's public as well as influential figures shaping that country's national debate, including decision-makers in government. Recent advances in data science and generative AI have made influence operations far more potent across three linked areas: target identification, persona creation, and individually tailored content. Previously, adversaries seeking to deploy targeted propaganda could only group people into clusters based on similar attributes. With modern AI, however, they can automate this process using data science to target individuals at a massive level.

With these tools, AI can predict targets' susceptibility to specific narratives or to fake social media profiles that are designed to attract their attention. Whereas bots were once clumsy and easily spotted, generative AI can today make so-called synthetic personas that appear authentic and escape ready detection. These fake profiles can be developed over time to become indistinguishable from real users—featuring realistic posting habits, interests, and language quirks. Moreover, fake accounts can now be created and operated at an enormous scale, making them harder to detect. Such developments allow these personas to spread synthetic content into targeted communities. Seeded across multiple social media platforms, they can steer debate and inflame divisions. To weaken public resolve in the United States, for instance, such fake personas may spread claims that the U.S. military is overstretched, that allies free-ride on American security, or that particular international causes are not worth fighting for. Amplifying messages across many platforms can make false information feel true, or at least create sufficient confusion to undermine public consensus around an issue.



Using thousands of unique fake accounts, AI tools may soon be able to deliver individually tailored content in real time across an entire population. This is cognitive warfare, and the implications for deterrence are clear. Because much of a democracy's deterrent credibility is tied to domestic political pressures, operations that manipulate public sentiment can weaken that state's signals of resolve. AI manipulations might make a country's domestic audience less inclined to support a strong military response to an act of foreign aggression—especially one against an ally—and thus distort polling data and other supposedly empirical signals from the public to which democratic leaders pay attention. This can leave such leaders unsure of how much support they truly have and how much backlash they might face if they yield. Such uncertainty can cause hesitation, weaken leaders' resolve, and cloud their decision-making—all of which can make a state's deterrent threats appear less convincing.

State-aligned groups are already exploring ways to undermine information security through AI-enabled influence operations. One example is GoLaxy, a Chinese company that uses generative AI tools and vast open-source data sets to build detailed psychological profiles of surveilled individuals and deploy, on a large scale, synthetic personas that mimic authentic users. The company's campaigns often entail gathering detailed information on influential figures, using that information to produce messages that are likely to persuade targeted audiences, and then sending those messages from carefully crafted social media personas. By achieving an acute level of precision and amplifying misleading narratives across multiple platforms, such operations can sow confusion, corrode public discourse, and weaken the domestic base that makes deterrent signals credible abroad. GoLaxy's alignment with Chinese state priorities and its ties to state-linked research institutes and superconducting firms make it a sophisticated propaganda engine.

Documents we analyzed at the Vanderbilt University Institute of National Security show that GoLaxy has already carried out operations in Hong Kong and Taiwan and has been assembling dossiers on members of the U.S. Congress as well as public figures around the world. Open-source intelligence allows adversaries to build comprehensive dossiers on politicians, military leaders, and soldiers for strategic purposes. Precisely targeted persona operations can then use that information. To score tactical wins, for instance, adversaries could target soldiers with deepfake messages containing false impressions of battlefield conditions or circumstances at home—and including accurate personal details about those soldiers' lives could make the fabrications seem realistic enough to distract their attention or disrupt unit cohesion. In the political sphere, adversaries could blend real photographs of politicians with cloned voices or faces. Even if they are never released, the threat of their exposure could dampen targets' rhetoric, stall legislative procedures, or weaken leaders' resolve. And from a strategic standpoint, hostile parties could simulate authorities giving false orders to stand down or divert to alternative communication channels, which could open a window for an adversary to gain ground. The result is a cognitive fog of war.

Another pathway that adversaries can take to create uncertainty for defenders is model poisoning: the strategic manipulation of the AI systems on which governments rely for intelligence and decision-making support. By corrupting these systems' training data or compromising their analytical pipelines, adversaries can distort a defender's understanding of its relative strength and of the urgency of the threat. A system that displays an underestimation of an adversary's powers can encourage unwarranted confidence in a defender; one that exaggerates the nature of the threat can induce hesitation. Either way, the effective manipulation of such AI systems could do more than simply complicate a defender's crisis management—it could weaken the credibility of its deterrent signals and thus create dangerous risks.

Essentially, model poisoning works by manipulating a model's data pipeline so that it overlooks important information and absorbs false inputs. This, in turn, can push the system toward misleading or degraded assessments. One method is by planting false information in the data sets that an AI system ingests to learn. Appearing harmless to human reviewers, this hidden information can nonetheless weaken or bias a model's reasoning capabilities—for example, by tricking it into flagging certain types of malware as benign so that an adversary might sneak behind an AI-driven firewall. Although no instances of such an approach have yet been recorded, current AI research has demonstrated that existing data sets are vulnerable to this type of data-poisoning attack. What was once theoretical is now possible in practice.

Models can also be poisoned by creating corrupted webpages. An AI system is constantly performing live searches of the Internet for new information; these sites could inject hidden instructions to it and thus skew the model's assessment. If the filters that screen incoming data are weak, even a small number of corrupted sites can induce inaccurate responses.

An especially stealthy form of information warfare, model poisoning allows adversaries to distort a defender's understandings about capabilities and resolve—its own and those of others—by changing the very workings of the tools they use for clarity. In a crisis, poisoning could encourage a leader to hesitate or—worse—miscalculate, weakening deterrence and opening the door to escalation.

The advent of AI systems was expected to strengthen deterrence by sending clearer signals to adversaries about a defender's capabilities and resolve. But the rising use of information warfare driven by those same systems threatens to do the opposite. Even in its early stages, this new type of information warfare has shown that AI technologies can influence how information is interpreted, introduce uncertainty into judgment processes, and distort the data that underpins decision-making. These threats will only become more potent as AI develops further.

Even a powerful country such as the United States may have difficulty signaling its deterrent credibility if it becomes exposed to advanced AI-enabled information warfare. For policymakers and citizens alike, the challenge will be figuring out how to harness the benefits of AI while preventing its weaponization. Strategies for countering this new threat must be developed as rapidly as the technologies underpinning it.

Meeting this challenge will require governments and researchers taking steps to harden analytic systems against model poisoning and actively counter AI-enabled influence operations whenever they are detected. To combat the work of firms such as GoLaxy, for instance, the United States and its allies must be able to rapidly detect and disrupt synthetic networks with tools that are capable of identifying and neutralizing AI-driven personas before they take hold. Education campaigns about synthetic media and how it can be identified can also strengthen public awareness of the threat. Democratic governments, social media and AI platforms, and interdisciplinary researchers should work together to develop such solutions.

At the strategic level, the United States should invest in technologies that can quickly detect synthetic messages. The government, academia, and the private sector should design new decision-making safeguards and data-filtering systems that can withstand corrupted inputs, while working with U.S. allies to expose and punish perpetrators of large-scale information campaigns. Additionally, this alliance should programmatically test new models to root out deficiencies—including the kind of data poisoning that may not be obvious in day-to-day use—and do so with rigorous transparency, to allow for peer review. Resilient safeguards and diligent testing are necessary to ensure that AI systems can reliably perform in moments of extraordinary stress or crisis.

In the AI era, deterrence can no longer rest on capabilities and resolve. It will require leaders, defense strategists, and other decision-makers to be able to preserve the reliability of their information environment—even amid widespread digital distortion.

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            President Donald Trump is ringing in 2026 with a new form of American imperialism.
    


            ► The US Army's Delta Force was dispatched to depose Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation Saturday. Now Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be part of “running” that oil-rich country, whatever that ends up meaning.
    


            ►  Leaders of neighboring countries, including Colombia and Mexico, were put on notice by Trump that he could take some kind of action against them, too — a clear warning to fall in line.
    


            ►  Trump on Sunday expressed a renewed desire to take over Greenland, claiming the US needs it for security purposes. Both Greenland and Denmark, a NATO ally of the US, are staunchly opposed to the idea.
    


            ►  The president also threatened to take new action against Iran on behalf of protesters there, suggesting the US could revisit the Middle East with its military might.
    


            All of this suggests a new era of violent American influence in the rest of the world. And Trump's decision to turn the American arsenal back on the Western Hemisphere recalls the very long, frequently dark history of American-led regime change closer to home.
    


            Whether to intimidate European powers; to protect American-allied businesses such as banana exporters; to dominate shipping routes or to guard against the specter of communism, the US has been either toppling or propping up various governments for generations.
    


            “This is one of the oldest stories in American history,” said Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at Brown University's Watson School of International and Public Affairs.
    


            Maduro shares an important trait with other deposed Central and South American leaders over the past 100 years or so, Kinzer said.
    


            “These are leaders who do not accept the right of the United States to dominate their countries and their region,” said Kinzer, author of the book “Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq.”
    


            “The United States finds this intolerable,” Kinzer said, “so it's back to the future.”
    


            Maduro, Kinzer acknowledged, is a far-from-sympathetic character — a brutal dictator leading an undemocratic government. But that's true of some who are US allies.
    


            “Mohammed bin Salman (the crown prince of Saudi Arabia) has never won an election and chopped up his main critic into little pieces, but that's fine with us, because he's on our side,” Kinzer said with irony.
    


            A unique feature of the Maduro toppling — which may end up being more a decapitation of his regime than a full-scale regime change — is that he was essentially taken rendition-style from Caracas, according to Alexander Downes, director of the Institute for Security and Conflict Studies at George Washington University.
    


            “Foreign leaders do get indicted in the U.S. That's fine,” Downes said in an email. See Trump's recent pardon of former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was actually convicted of trafficking drugs into the US.
    


            “Kidnapping (rival world leaders) while in office, however, strikes me as a bad idea if not illegal,” said Downes, author of the book “Catastrophic Success: Why Foreign-Imposed Regime Change Goes Wrong.”
    


            Downes added that the move may create a new precedent for other countries. How will the US react if China or Russia now simply kidnaps a rival leader?
    


            The idea that Trump thinks the US is now running Venezuela — something disputed by the country's acting president — is not likely to endear him to anyone in the region.
    


            The most obvious corollary to Trump's Venezuelan operation may seem to be Panama, where 36 years ago this month, the strongman military leader Manuel Noriega surrendered to US custody. He had been seeking refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama City after US forces, including paratroopers, invaded his small country en masse.
    


            Noriega was later tried and convicted in US court, although he won the concession of being treated as a prisoner of war rather than a garden-variety drug trafficker.
    


            Kinzer noted there are many differences between Panama and Venezuela that also complicate comparisons between 1990 and 2026. Venezuela is a much larger country with more rugged terrain. And back in 1990, the US already had a large military presence garrisoned in Panama. There's no US military base inside Venezuela.
    


            The US invasion of Panama may not be remembered by many Americans, but it cost hundreds of lives in the small country, and its anniversary is now treated as a national day of mourning.
    


            Views of the Panama invasion may have turned over time, but it remains among the most successful US regime change operations because it allowed the US to topple Noriega and a democratic government to take over.
    


            Defending democracy has long been a stated, if sometimes unbelievable, goal of recent US-led regime change, but Trump does not appear particularly interested in it.
    


            In that regard, Trump is recalling the first part of the 20th century, when presidents such as William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft were swinging “big stick” or “gunboat” diplomacy around the Caribbean.
    


            “We invaded Cuba in 1898 with the promise that once we helped the Cubans chase out the Spanish overlords, we would turn Cuba over to its people. As soon as the Spanish were gone, we changed our minds and decided we wanted to rule Cuba,” Kinzer said.
    


            He then ticked through other US interventions at the behest of business that led to the overthrow, ouster or resignation of governments during the early 20th century, including in Nicaragua and Honduras. The US military also occupied Nicaragua, Haiti and the Dominican Republic at various points for years during this period.
    


            Later, as the Red Scare and Cold War consumed the US, administrations from both parties meddled abroad for more ideological reasons, such as fighting socialism and the spread of communism — but these moves also helped US businesses.
    


            The CIA, at the urging of the United Fruit Company, helped engineer a coup in Guatemala in 1954 that achieved the goal of toppling the democratically elected government. Subsequent decades saw military juntas and mass killings.
    


            That's about the same time the US and the United Kingdom were colluding to help overthrow the democratically elected government in Iran.
    


            “What looks like an immediate success can turn into a long term failure,” Downes said, pointing to Iran as Exhibit A. “Washington has been dealing with the fallout, including the Iran hostage crisis, Iran's bid for nuclear weapons, and its hostility to Israel for almost 50 years.”
    


            The same could be said of the unintended consequences of more recent US actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.
    


            Decades later, in 1973, the US helped overthrow the democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died in a coup. His successor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, led a repressive right-wing regime.
    


            For Trump, who has variously cited drug trafficking, immigration and other justifications for going after Maduro, the end goal may just be power.
    


            “This is not about values. This is simply about maximizing US security and prosperity,” said Alan Kuperman, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, who has written about regime change.
    


            “What he wants is to make the US the dominant power in Latin America, and he wants for the resources of Latin America to benefit the US more than they have,” Kuperman surmised.
    


            That helps explain why, for now, Maduro's regime has been left intact, just without Maduro. Trump has said he doesn't think opposition leaders can rule.
    


            Setting aside values like democracy and human rights, Kuperman said US-led regime change accomplishes its goals about half the time.
    


            It does not take much of a leap to see that while Trump mostly talks about drugs, his administration is also very much interested in opening more of Venezuela's oil fields to US companies.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Cuban American who Trump said will be part of “running” Venezuela for the time being, seems to have some of his own motivations. Rubio's family fled Cuba, the country where the US failed to depose or take out communist leader Fidel Castro.
    


            Castro is dead, but Cuba is still communist and relies heavily on Venezuela for support. Taking out Maduro could be a step to regime change in Cuba.
    


            “It's amazing how Cuba has had such a hold on the United States and on the American imagination for so long. This little island has distorted our foreign policy over generations, and it's happening again. I think, without the fact that Venezuela is the lifeline for Cuba, this might never have happened,” Kinzer said.

• On the ground: Venezuela remains on edge following the capture of ousted leader Nicolás Maduro. Security forces were seen patrolling the streets, and gunfire and anti-aircraft fire were reported over the capital of Caracas overnight. A Venezuelan ministry spokesperson said “no confrontation occurred.” Sigue nuestra cobertura en español. 



            • Renewed focus on Greenland: Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Greenland and Denmark in a joint statement issued earlier today after President Donald Trump said the US “needs” the island.
    


            • What's next for Venezuela?: Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed to return home “as soon as possible,” but White House aide Stephen Miller dismissed calls for the US to install her as Maduro's replacement. Trump said he considers himself in charge of Venezuela.
    


• Not-guilty plea: Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges yesterday and chose not to immediately fight their detention.
    


            Russia's foreign ministry has slammed the “blatant neocolonial threats and armed aggression” carried out against Venezuela over the weekend, without directly naming the United States.
    


            In a statement, the ministry welcomed the swearing in of Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's acting president, saying that it demonstrates Caracas' determination to, among other things, “ensure unity,” “curb the risks of a constitutional crisis,” and “create the necessary conditions for the further peaceful and stable development of Venezuela.”
    


                    “We welcome the efforts of the official authorities of this country to protect state sovereignty and national interests. We confirm Russia's unwavering solidarity with the Venezuelan people and government,” the statement said.
                





            The foreign ministry also said it was ready to provide “the necessary support” to its “friend Venezuela.”
    


            “We firmly believe that Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive external interference,” it said.
    


Some context: Russia and Venezuela are close allies. After the US's attack on Venezuela on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry condemned what it called an “act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” calling any “excuses” given to justify such actions “untenable.”
    


            After Washington tightened trade sanctions on Caracas in mid-2024, Venezuela has relied more heavily on other partners, including Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in May last year that trade with Venezuela grew by 64% in 2024.

            The White House reiterated that Greenland would be better protected by the US after European leaders expressed support for Denmark and the Danish territory.
    


                    “President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security, and he is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told CNN in a statement. “The President is committed to establishing long-term peace at home and abroad,” she added.
                





            The European leaders said in their statement that “Greenland belongs to its people.”
    


            “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark wrote.
    


            Venezuelans are entering a time of uncertainty following the US military operation that ousted leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


            While some are relieved to have Maduro no longer in power, there is also growing anxiety about what the US' role will be in the country moving forward.
    


            Here's a brief history of Venezuela and key moments that led to Maduro's rise and eventual downfall:
    

CNN's Nic Robertson explains a brief history of Venezuela's political landscape after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump said the US will “run” the country. 


            The United States is “almost starting a war with an allied country” in its pursuit of Greenland, Danish parliament member Rasmus Jarlov told CNN's Becky Anderson today.
    


            “It is quite shocking that a person who's in charge of this completely illegitimate land claim on Greenland knows so little about the history and the background of why Greenland belongs to Denmark,” Jarlov said, referencing White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who last night said that nobody would fight the US if it tried to seize the autonomous Danish territory.
    


                    Denmark's ownership of Greenland “may be one of the most well-established ownerships of territory in the world. It is not disputed by anyone. It has never been disputed by the United States themselves, and they really should know these things before almost starting a war with an allied country,” Jarlov continued.
                





For context: US President Donald Trump has renewed his public calls for the autonomous Danish territory after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
    


            While the US has said it needs Greenland for security purposes, Jarlov pointed out that the country already has “exclusive and full military access” to the island. “So this talk about needing Greenland for security is complete nonsense,” he added.
    


                    “They talk about that the United States are the only ones that can protect Greenland, but the fact is that they're the only ones threatening Greenland. Neither China nor Russia are threatening Greenland,” he said.
                





            Should the US attack Greenland militarily, Denmark “will defend it, and in that case, we would be at war,” Jarlov said.
    


                    “We would be fighting each other, which is completely absurd,” he continued. “But you cannot disagree that if the United States attacks a NATO country, there is no alliance.”

            The attack on Venezuela has already come at a heavy cost for Cuba, with the government reporting in a social media post that 32 of its citizens were killed during the US military operation.
    


            Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's inner circle of bodyguards were Cuban. Saturday's operation appears to be the first time in decades that the former Cold War-era foes have engaged in combat. Now, the Cuban government is wondering if it could be the next country targeted by the Trump administration.

CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains what's next for Cuba as political turmoil rocks the country's close ally, Venezuela, after the US capture of Nicolás Maduro.


            The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, called Tuesday for a “fair trial” for the ousted president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who was captured on January 3 along with his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas after a US military intervention, and then transferred to New York, where they face drug trafficking charges.
    


            “In this case, now that President Maduro has been detained, what one asks for is always a fair trial. That is what must be requested, so that truly in everything, for everyone and in any circumstance – and in this particular case – there must be speed and justice,” the president said during her morning press conference.
    


            Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico's position of rejecting US intervention, stating that “regardless” of one's opinion of Maduro's presidency or the Venezuelan government, her government condemns Washington's “invasion.”
    


            “We must recover our history, our constitution, and what each one says about it,” she said.
    


            She recalled that Mexico defends “non-intervention, the peaceful resolution of disputes,” and noted that even “if a country is very small internationally, we are all equal.”
    


            “That is why we speak of the legal equality of states. International cooperation for development, which is what I mentioned yesterday. The best way to help a country is international cooperation for development. Respect, protection, and promotion of human rights,” she asserted.
    


            Since Maduro's detention on January 3, Mexico has expressed its rejection of Washington's military intervention in Venezuela and has defended the sovereignty of nations.
    


            On Sunday, it issued a joint statement with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Spain, and Uruguay rejecting “the military actions unilaterally carried out on Venezuelan territory” and expressing “concern about any attempt at governmental control, administration, or external appropriation of natural or strategic resources.”
    


            Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab demanded the release of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, saying that he has “diplomatic immunity.”
    


            The attorney general urged Alvin K. Hellerstein, the US judge in charge of Maduro's case, to “respect international law and proceed to recognize the lack of jurisdiction of the court under his command to try the leader of a sovereign nation, like the Venezuelan homeland, who is protected by diplomatic immunity, I repeat, as head of state.”
    


            Saab also urged Hellerstein to “cease all human rights violations that have been carried out against the president, his wife, and obviously against the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores pleaded not guilty yesterday in their first court appearance in New York.

            The Trump administration's recent rhetoric about Greenland in light of its actions in Venezuela is harming American security, according to John Bolton, US President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.
    


            When asked by CNN's Kate Bolduan about comments made by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller yesterday that “nobody's gonna fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Bolton said that Miller was making a “simple-minded statement.”
    


                    “Of course, nobody's going to fight us over (Greenland), but it doesn't mean we should take territory from a treaty ally. And if we do that or if, frankly, this conversation goes on much longer, I think the NATO alliance is in grave jeopardy,” he said.
                





            “This is a self-inflicted wound by the Trump administration. It harms American security. It does not enhance it by this kind of talk about Greenland,” Bolton continued.
    


On Venezuela: Bolton also reiterated that the Trump administration was making a “big mistake” by choosing not to support opposition leader María Corina Machado as the new leader of Venezuela.
    


            Machado and fellow opposition leader Edmundo González “are the people who can help provide stability,” Bolton said, not those who were a part of the regime ran by ousted President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday celebrated the capture of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, boasting that the high-risk operation proved the US has the “most fearsome” military in the world.
    


            “We had a lot of boots on the ground, but it was amazing,” he said during a speech at a House GOP retreat in Washington, DC. “It was brilliant tactically.”
    


            Trump recounted several operational details to Republican lawmakers, indicating the US cut electricity to major parts of Venezuela just before entering the country. That gave the military the element of surprise as it approached Maduro's compound.
    


            “And think of it, nobody was killed,” Trump said. “And on the other side, a lot of people were killed.”
    


            Trump went on to criticize Democrats for airing concerns about the decision to capture Maduro, complaining that few in the party were congratulating him.
    


            “At some point they should say, you know, ‘You did a great job,'” he said. “‘Thank you, congratulations.' Wouldn't it be good?”
    


            Colombian Foreign Minister Yolanda Villavicencio confirmed Tuesday that she will submit a note of protest to the United States over threats made by President Donald Trump against Colombian President Gustavo Petro.
    


            “The meeting we will have today with the US representative is to present our note of rejection of these offenses, which are not only directed at President Gustavo Petro,” the foreign minister said. “We want them to understand that he is our democratically elected president. An offense against the president is an offense against our country,” she added.
    


            On Sunday, Trump described Petro as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.”
    


            When pressed by a reporter on whether those comments meant there could be an “operation” in Colombia in the future, Trump responded, “Sounds good to me.” Petro subsequently refuted Trump's claims and defended his government's record on combating drug trafficking in a lengthy post on X.
    


            Villavivencio rejected the US “aggression” against Venezuela over the weekend and said that, while Bogotá maintains its non-recognition of the country's 2024 elections, it respects the Venezuelan legal system that led to Delcy Rodríguez taking office as acting president after Maduro's capture.
    


            The minister said she has been in contact with the Venezuelan government, without giving details of those conversations, and said that Colombia has not received asylum requests from Chavista leaders.
    


                    She added that Colombia seeks “a solution for Venezuela that is through dialogue and the autonomous decision of Venezuelans, (and) that they find the way to reach a consensus on the best way for the country to continue with a government that can overcome (the crisis).”

            Venezuelan security forces detained 14 journalists in the capital on Monday, including reporters who were covering the swearing-in of the country's national assembly, according to the national press union.
    


            In a post on X, the SNTP reported that 13 foreign journalists and one Venezuelan journalist were detained on Monday in Caracas before later being released.
    


            The union said that journalists had their equipment and messaging apps checked.
    


            Tensions are high on the ground in Venezuela following the capture of now ousted leader Nicolas Maduro, while some of the focus diplomatically has shifted to the US' claims on Greenland, which have provoked a strong pushback from Europe.

Stephen Miller asserts Trump administration's position is Greenland should be part of the US.

 


            The full House and Senate are expected to receive closed-door briefings on the US' Venezuela operation tomorrow.
    


            The Senate will hold a members-only classified briefing at 10 a.m. ET in the Senate SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility), according to a source familiar with the meeting and a notice sent to Senate offices.
    


            The briefing will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, CIA Director Ratcliffe and Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine.
    


            The House is also expected to receive a similar classified briefing.
    


            The Gang of Eight and top Republicans and Democrats from key House and Senate committees were briefed yesterday, but the fuller meeting this week will allow a wider swath of lawmakers to pose questions about the legality of the operation, future US involvement in Venezuela, and more amid questions over the propriety of the Trump administration's actions.
    


            The US' attack on Venezuela and its capture of ousted President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend drew headlines worldwide and drew international attention - both positive and negative.
    


            Just a few days after the strike, focus has also shifted to Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark. The Arctic island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the US ballistic missile defense system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.
    


            On Sunday, US President Donald Trump repeated his claim that his country “need(s) Greenland” from a security perspective.
    


                    “We need Greenland … It's so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”
                





            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said yesterday that the formal position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”
    


                    “Nobody's gonna fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said on CNN's “The Lead with Jake Tapper.”
                





            These remarks came following US military action on foreign soil, and were met with consternation from European allies.
    


                    “The current and repeated rhetoric coming from the United States is entirely unacceptable. When the President of the United States speaks of ‘needing Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it is not only wrong. It is disrespectful,” Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen said yesterday.
                





            Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that there would be consequences should the US try to seize Greenland, saying in televised remarks that “if the US chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, everything stops, including NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of World War II.”
    


            In a joint statement released today, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and Denmark reiterated that “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

            Tensions appear to be rising in Venezuela in the aftermath of US military action to capture President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, with rights groups reporting checkpoints and media repression as security forces patrol the streets.
    


            Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital Caracas.
    


            In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!”
    


            The SNTP Venezuelan journalists' union denounced repression against journalists on Monday, and Edmundo González – who the opposition maintains was the true winner of the 2024 elections – repeated calls for the release of political prisoners.
    


            In a video message from exile, González said that the capture of Maduro was “a necessary step, but not sufficient” to achieve a democratic transition.
    


            On Monday, the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners in Venezuela reported that political prisoners have had visiting rights suspended and are being prevented from communicating with the outside world.
    


            The committee added that checkpoints have been going up in cities around the country, with people being searched and detained for possessing “digital material” linked to the US military action.
    


            The Venezuelan government on Monday published the decree of the State of External Commotion, which grants broad powers to the presidency and orders security forces to capture “any person involved in the promotion or support” of the US attack against the South American country.
    


            Yesterday saw ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro make an appearance at a New York court, after he was captured alongside his wife Cilia Flores in a US operation over the weekend.
    


            As you can see in the images below, he was escorted to the court by armed police and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, traveling both by motorcade and helicopter to move from a Brooklyn detention center to the Manhattan courthouse.
    


            Meanwhile in Venezuela, the country's former vice president was formally sworn in as acting leader yesterday. The ambassadors of China, Russia and Iran — key allies of Venezuela — were among the first dignitaries to congratulate Delcy Rodríguez when she was sworn in.
    


            The United Nations has said it is “deeply worried” about what comes next for Venezuela following the US capture of President Nicolas Maduro.
    


                    “It is clear that the operation undermined a fundamental principle of international law – that states must not threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Tuesday.
                





            The statement acknowledged the Maduro government's “appalling human rights record”, but said US intervention could have damaging consequences both for Venezuela and the rest of the world.
    


                    “We fear that the current instability and further militarization in the country resulting from the U.S. intervention will only make the situation worse.”
                





            “The future of Venezuela must be determined by the Venezuelan people alone, with full respect for their human rights, including the right to self-determination, and sovereignty over their lives and their resources,” it added.
    


            Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize in October last year for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”
    


            She was awarded the prize “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said at the time. In a statement accepting the award, Machado said the prize belonged to the people of Venezuela.
    


            She also dedicated the prize to US President Donald Trump, telling CNN that “he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize because of (the) incredible events that are taking place currently in the world.”
    


            In addition to being a staunch proponent of democracy and a vocal supporter of Trump, Machado is also an avowed capitalist who previously ran on a campaign to privatize most Venezuelan public assets, including in the sectors of health, oil and education.
    


            In an interview with CNN before Venezuela's contested 2024 elections, she repeatedly called for the country's markets to be opened, saying: “we need to create conditions that are so competitive, so attractive that international resources will be invested in a country, despite what happened in the previous regime.”
    


            Yesterday, Machado said that, following the US' capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, her country “will be the United States' main ally in matters of security, energy, democracy and human rights.”
    


            In an interview with Fox News the same day, Machado said she hadn't spoken to Trump since October, after her Nobel Peace Prize win.
    


            She thanked the US leader for “the historical actions he has taken against the narco-terrorist regime,” saying that January 3, when Maduro was captured by the US, “will go down in history as the day justice defeated tyranny.”

            Leaders from major European powers have just expressed support for Denmark and Greenland in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by US President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory.
    


            “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” said the statement by leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark.
    


            The leaders said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with NATO allies, including the United States.
    


                    “NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up,” the statement said. “We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.”
                





            Trump has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.”
    


            A US military operation at the weekend, which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario.
    


Some context: Greenland is the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people. It is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western military alliance.
    


            The island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the US ballistic missile defense system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.
    


            The former vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, was formally sworn in as the country's acting leader yesterday.
    


            The 56-year-old has spent more than two decades as one of the leading figures of Chavismo, a socialist ideology founded by influential leftist leader Hugo Chávez, which also values Venezuela's sovereignty as something to be protected from “imperialist” powers.
    


            Despite her staunch support of the Chavismo movement and her hard-line rhetoric about the US following its capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on Saturday, she has seemed to soften her language regarding the country in the days since.
    


            Initially, Rodríguez accused the US of “kidnapping” her country's leader and said that violations of international law were committed, accusing US forces of having “savagely attacked” Venezuela's territorial integrity.
    


            But on Sunday, she extended an invitation to the United States government to collaborate on an “agenda of cooperation,” saying that Venezuela will “prioritize” moving toward “balanced and respectful international relations” with the US and the region.
    


            Yesterday, US President Donald Trump did not say whether he has yet spoken directly to Rodríguez, but told reporters that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been speaking with her in fluent Spanish on the phone and that their “relationship has been very strong.”

The French capital was hit by heavy snow on Monday as temperatures droped below 0 degrees Celsius. Temperatures were expected to fall, reaching -4 C overnight.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Snow, ice and freezing temperatures hit parts of Europe on Tuesday, causing treacherous traffic conditions that left at least five people dead in France and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights from one of the continent's busiest airports.

Authorities in the Landes region of southwestern France reported three dead in accidents, and at least two more people were reportedly killed in the Île-de-France region around Paris, where authorities ordered trucks off the road as snowfall caused huge traffic jams on Monday.

Paris awoke Tuesday to a blanket of snow on its famous rooftops and sites, and children whose schools couldn't hold classes delighted in an unexpected day off. Air travelers were less happy, as heavy snowfall forced the closure of six airports in the north and west of France.

As snow fell across the Netherlands, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport reported that some 600 flights were grounded during the day as crews worked to clear runways and de-ice planes waiting to depart. More snow was forecast for the rest of the week. 

Dutch airline KLM warned travelers stranded at Schiphol that scammers posing as customer service staff were targeting passengers and incorrect phone numbers for the airline were circulating online. It warned people “to be alert to these phishing attempts. Do not respond to such messages, and do not share any personal or payment information.”

KLM also said it was running short of the glycol fluid it uses combined with hot water to de-ice planes before they take off. It said airports across Europe were facing similar problems after days of freezing temperatures. 




Just getting to and from the airport outside the Dutch capital was a struggle with frozen points and an early morning software glitch throwing the Netherlands' rail system into turmoil.

Limited rail services resumed later in the morning but routes around Amsterdam remained largely closed because of the icy conditions, national railway company NS said on its website. It urged commuters to “only travel if it's absolutely necessary.”

Commuters forced to drive to work also faced time-consuming journeys as a combination of the snow and ice snarled traffic on some highways.

Thijs Rademakers, an 18-year-old student, decided to ride his bike rather than wait for public transport.

“It was tough, very slippery,” he said in the eastern city of Arnhem. “Many people fall. Luckily, I didn't.”

In Rome, weeks of rain that have swollen the Tiber River over its banks again muted Pope Leo XIV's Christmas-time celebrations. St. Peter's Square was only partially full Tuesday as a few thousand people crowded under colorful umbrellas to hear Leo deliver his Epiphany blessing from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica.

Rome has been soaked by steady rains since before Christmas, and Mayor Roberto Gualtieri issued an ordinance for Tuesday limiting public access to parks and other areas at risk for falling trees and flooding.

Farther north, snow dusted Bologna and gave skiers in the Dolomites reason to cheer, though freezing temperatures are forecast for much of the north and central part of the peninsula over the coming days.

A cold snap sent the temperature in northern parts of Britain down to minus 12.5 degrees Celsius (9.5 Fahrenheit) overnight, as snow disrupted rail, road and air travel and closed hundreds of schools.

Horse races and soccer matches have been called off because of snow and frost, while a power failure caused by ice closed Glasgow's subway. 

Up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of snow was forecast Tuesday for northern Scotland, where some people have already been snowed in by previous falls. Northeast Scotland lawmaker Andrew Bowie said the situation was “critical,” calling for soldiers to be sent in to clear snow and get food and medical supplies to stranded people.

Both heavy snow and heavy rain swept through Balkan countries, swelling rivers and creating problems in traffic and disruptions in power and water supplies. A woman died in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo on Monday after a snow-covered tree branch fell on her head. In neighboring Serbia, some western municipalities introduced emergency measures due to bad weather.

Authorities in Serbia warned drivers to be very careful as many set off toward skiing resorts or elsewhere for Orthodox Christmas on Wednesday and the upcoming weekend. Black ice stopped cars and forced drivers to park on the side on their way to Mount Bjelasnica above Sarajevo on Tuesday morning.

Heavy wind and stormy seas battered the Adriatic coastline in Croatia and Montenegro. Video footage showed the sea sweeping through holiday cottages at Ada Bojana in southern Montenegro during a storm.

A man who broke windows at Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home and caused other property damage was detained early Monday, the U.S. Secret Service said. 

William D. DeFoor, 26, is facing federal charges for allegedly damaging government property, engaging in physical violence against property in a restricted area and assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers, according to the United States Attorney's office in Ohio's southern district. 

DeFoor was detained shortly after midnight by Secret Service agents assigned to Vance's home, east of downtown Cincinnati, agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. The vice president and his family were not at home, having returned to Washington on Sunday after a weekend there, his office said.

The Secret Service saw a man running along the front fence of Vance's residence and breach the property line around midnight, according to an affidavit filed Monday. The man was armed with a hammer and vandalized an unmarked Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home's driveway before moving toward the front of the home and breaking its glass windows, the affidavit says. 

AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on an attack on the vice president's home.

DeFoor was detained after he tried to flee from officers on foot. He is accused of causing around $28,000 in damage, the affidavit says.

Public records list DeFoor as living in Cincinnati. Calls to the listings for possible relatives and an attorney who previously represented Defoor were not immediately returned.

Vance expressed gratitude to the Secret Service and Cincinnati police for responding quickly to the incident in a post on the social platform X.




“I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home,” Vance tweeted. “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows.”

Court records show that DeFoor faced an earlier charge of vandalism in 2024 and agreed to treatment under the county's Mental Health Court system.

The Secret Service is coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office as charging decisions are reviewed, Guglielmi said.

The Vance home is located in one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, on hills overlooking the city. Throughout Vance's vice presidency, protesters have often gathered outside the home — clashing at one point last spring with Vance himself.

Vance, a Republican, was a U.S. senator representing Ohio before becoming vice president. He moved to Cincinnati after a stint in Silicon Valley following law school, and his half brother ran unsuccessfully for mayor there last year. Vance was raised in nearby Middletown, which figured heavily in his bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”

Mickey Rourke's career has been defined by extremes, including self-imposed detours, legal drama, comebacks and recurring controversy. 

Now, Rourke has found himself in legal trouble again. He was recently served an eviction notice after allegedly falling behind on nearly $60,000 in rent on his Los Angeles home. A member of Rourke's management team seemingly launched a GoFundMe to help the action film star raise the money to stay in his home. The fundraiser had over $70,000 in donations after 24 hours. Rourke later denied he was involved in setting up the fundraiser and urged fans not to donate.

""Something's come up that I'm really frustrated, confused, and I don't understand,"" Roruke said in a video shared on Instagram. ""Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money, like charity. And that's not me, OK? If I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no f---ing charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my a-- and pull the trigger.""

He added: ""Whoever did this … I don't know why they did it. I don't understand it. I wouldn't know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years. My life is very simple. I don't go to outside sources like that. Yeah, it is embarrassing, but I'm sure I'll get over it like everything else.""

MICKEY ROURKE RECALLS BEING BLACKLISTED IN HOLLYWOOD, HOW A PRIEST ‘SAVED' HIM: ‘YOU'VE GOTTA BE TOUGH'

Here's a look back at Mickey Rourke's tumultuous career:

After seeing success in the film industry with ""Body Heat,"" ""Diner,"" ""9 ½ Weeks"" and ""Angel Heart,"" Mickey Rourke chose to take his talent a different route.

Rourke became a professional boxer in 1991.

The famed actor fought in the ring from 1991 until he chose to retire in 1994. He opened up about the injuries he suffered while boxing in a 2009 interview with the Daily Mail.

""I had my nose broken twice. I had five operations on my nose and one on a smashed cheekbone,"" he recalled. ""I had to have cartilage taken from my ear to rebuild my nose and a couple of operations to scrape out the cartilage because the scar tissue wasn't healing properly.""

He claimed most of his cosmetic operations were ""to mend the mess of my face because of the boxing, but I went to the wrong guy to put my face back together.""

Rourke was arrested in 1994 after he allegedly slapped his then-wife, knocked her down and kicked her during a visit to the couple's publicist's office.

Rourke later pleaded not guilty before the charges were dropped after Carre Otis failed to appear in court multiple times.

Otis later wrote about the passion she experienced while dating Rourke.

""Already in those early days, my craving for him was at its strongest when we weren't together,"" she wrote in her memoir, ""Beauty, Disrupted."" ""We'd be separated for a few hours, and I could think of nothing else but being with him again. We both loved the drama of it all, loved the fantasy of being head over heels in love, unable to be apart. When people ask why I would end up staying with him for so long, this is a huge part of the answer. The times we weren't together were the times I wanted him most.""

Rourke was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in November 2007.

A Miami Beach police report said Rourke had made an illegal U-turn while driving a green scooter, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He then swerved several times before he was pulled over.

""I'm not drunk, I didn't even drink that much,"" the report claimed Rourke told officers.

Rourke pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of reckless driving and was required to take an online driving course in addition to paying a fine, according to previous reporting.

Rourke seemingly caught a break in 2008 after landing a role in ""The Wrestler."" Rourke's performance in the Darren Aronofsky film is widely regarded as one of the most dramatic and celebrated comebacks in modern film history.

Rourke earned a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and grabbed an Academy Award nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.

Rourke's career continued steadily after his mainstream comeback. The former professional boxer appeared in ""War Pigs,"" ""Killshot,"" ""Ashby,"" ""Take Back,"" ""The Commando"" and ""The Palace.""

He once said that he was blacklisted in Hollywood for being too difficult to work with.

""The young guys are cool,"" he told Fox News Digital in 2022. ""They don't care about what they hear. They judge me by my acting ability, not my old reputation. So it's been sort of a resurrection of being able to work with younger directors. I have a love/hate relationship with acting. I enjoy what I'm doing at the moment because I can give everything that I'm taught. I have my confidence. I went through the s--- that I went through, so I'm able to use it in my performances. I could be standing across from any f---ing actor. And I know that motherf---er has not seen, done or been through what I've been through.""

Rourke agreed to leave the reality TV show ""Celebrity Big Brother UK"" in April over controversial behavior.

""Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior,"" a spokesperson for ""Celebrity Big Brother UK"" told People magazine at the time. No physical altercation took place, but Rourke reportedly used ""threatening and aggressive"" language.

Shortly before his exit, Rourke received a warning after his remarks about fellow contestant JoJo Siwa's sexuality.

Now, decades after his rise and fall, Mickey Rourke is facing eviction from a Los Angeles rental property amid ongoing controversy. (BG002/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)

Now, Rourke is facing eviction from a bungalow in Los Angeles after he failed to pay nearly $60,000 in rent.

Rourke rented the property earlier this year, agreeing to pay $5,200 a month, which later went up to $7,000 a month, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by Fox News Digital.

Rourke rented the property around the same time he agreed to leave ""Celebrity Big Brother UK"" earlier this year following a warning from producers over conduct they deemed inappropriate on the show.

A GoFundMe was started on Rourke's behalf by a member of his team to help raise funds to pay his rent. 

""Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original,"" the GoFundMe reads. ""In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn't just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From Diner to Rumble Fish to 9½ Weeks, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture. 

""Mickey's life never followed a safe or protected path. At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort. Boxing—real and punishing—left lasting physical and emotional scars, and the industry that once celebrated him moved on quickly,"" it continued. ""What followed were years of struggle not defined by spectacle, but by survival: health challenges, financial strain, and the quiet toll of being left behind.""

""Today, Mickey is facing a very real and urgent situation: the threat of eviction from his home. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening. Mickey Rourke is an icon—but his trajectory, as painful as it is, is also a deeply human one. It is the story of someone who gave everything to his work, took real risks, and paid real costs.""

911 calls obtained by Fox News Digital, reveal the moment a dentist and his wife were found shot dead in their Columbus home. Officials have not identified a suspect. (Credit: Columbus Police Department)

Several 911 calls reveal the frantic moments before police found a Columbus, Ohio, dentist and his wife dead at their home, including one caller bluntly telling dispatchers ""there's a body,"" as investigators search for the person who killed the couple shortly before their fifth wedding anniversary.

Officials said police responded to the house around 10 a.m. on Dec. 30 when they found Spencer Tepe, 37 and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. Two young children were found at the house unharmed. Police do not believe their deaths were a murder-suicide and said there wasn't any sign of forced entry, adding that a gun wasn't recovered, according to WSYX.

Fox News Digital obtained the four calls placed to 911 through a public records request. The first call came from Spencer's employer, Mark Valrose, who owns Athens Dental Depot. While Valrose said he was vacationing in Florida at the time, several of Spencer's co-workers became concerned after he didn't show up for work.

""Spencer works with me and he did not show up to work this morning and we cannot get ahold of him or his family,"" Valrose said. ""He is always on time and he would contact us if there is any issues whatsoever… we're very, very concerned because this is very out of character and we can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing.""

At 9:56 a.m., another individual called 911 to report they could hear kids inside the Tepe household, but no one answered the door.

""I can hear kids inside, and I swear, I think I heard one yell, but we can't get in at this point. I don't know if I need to break the door in or just get in the house or what,"" the caller said. 

One of Spencer's friends called 911 at 10:03 a.m, saying they came to the Tepes' house to do a ""wellness check"" and could see a body inside the house.

""There's a body,"" the person can be heard saying. ""Our friend wasn't answering his phone. We just did a wellness check. We just came here and he appears dead. He's laying next to his bed, off of his bed in this blood. I can't get closer to see more than that.""

Spencer and Monique Tepe were found dead on Dec. 30. (Rob Misleh)

""I can tell he's obviously not breathing or anything,"" the caller said.

Spencer's friend told the 911 operator that the last time someone spoke with him was on Dec. 29. The friend told the 911 operator that Spencer didn't do any drugs.

WATCH: Former homicide detective says piece of evidence left behind may lead police to Ohio couple's killer

Former homicide detective Ted Williams told Fox News Digital he thinks ""someone they know"" killed the couple.

""The investigators in Columbus, Ohio, they're having to work backwards from that crime scene, and this is what we know. We do know that there was no signs of forced entry. So, if there's no sign of forced entry, that tells me that they either knew their victims, meaning the perpetrator, or the Tepes may very well have left their doors open,"" Williams said.

Police on Monday night released surveillance footage showing a ""person of interest"" in the murders of Spencer and Monique.

The video, released by the Columbus Division of Police, shows the man walking slowly in an alley near the Weinland Park home where Spencer and Monique lived. He's seen in what appears to be a dark coat and light-colored pants.

In a statement released Friday, the couple's family said they are ""heartbroken beyond words,"" and called the deaths ""tragic and senseless.""

""They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others,"" read the statement. ""Spencer, a graduate of The Ohio State University, was known as a devoted and proud father, a loving partner, and a friend to everyone he met,"" the family statement said, adding that he was ""intelligent, warm, and endlessly welcoming.""

The National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing its charitable foundation, the NRA Foundation, of misusing $160 million in donations.

The NRA alleged the foundation used its trademarks without authorization and diverted donations intended for NRA charitable programs. The group also claimed former NRA directors seized control of the foundation to compete with the gun rights organization.

""The Foundation has been seized by a disgruntled faction of former NRA directors who lost control of the NRA's Board following revelations of financial improprieties, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty and member trust,"" attorneys for the NRA wrote in the complaint.

The attorney claimed that the faction of former directors seeks to use the foundation to reclaim control after having been ""booted out of power by the NRA's members.""

The suit claims that the foundation has a personal ""beef"" with the NRA, and that the faction is ""bitter"" about losing control of the NRA's board following ""a series of scandals.""

Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's former chief, resigned in January 2024 as he was set to face trial in a corruption case brought by Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. Prosecutors alleged that NRA executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to bar the foundation from what the NRA calls unfair competition, including promoting or advertising any affiliation with the NRA or using its logo. It also seeks to block conduct that could lead the public to believe the foundation's activities are ""sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by, or associated or connected with"" the NRA.

Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson defended the fact her parents helped her with money so she could run, arguing it made her 'relatable' to voters during her first interview since beating incumbent mayor Bruce Harrell. (Credit: CNN)

Seattle's new mayor is facing growing scrutiny over her approach to public safety after an internal police email outlined how most drug possession and public use cases are being directed toward diversion rather than prosecution — prompting backlash from critics who say the approach sends the wrong message as open drug use remains visible across the city.

The controversy erupted after Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes circulated an internal message detailing how low-level drug cases will be handled in 2026, fueling concerns among critics that the city is effectively softening enforcement just weeks into Mayor Katie Wilson's administration. City officials insist there has been no policy change, but critics argue the practical impact tells a different story.

In the internal email obtained by Fox News Digital, Barnes wrote that ""all charges related to drug possession and/or drug use will be diverted from prosecution to the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program,"" citing guidance from the City Attorney's Office. The directive applies to user-quantity cases, while drug dealers and those ineligible for LEAD remain subject to prosecution.

Barnes emphasized that officers are still expected to arrest individuals when probable cause exists, particularly when drug use occurs in public view.

Seattle Police pushed back on claims that enforcement is changing, telling Fox News Digital that officers will continue to make drug-related arrests and that SPD policy remains unchanged.

The department said prosecutors, not police, determine whether cases move forward, adding that officers can coordinate with prosecutors to pursue traditional prosecution in cases where diversion is deemed ineffective.

SPD also pointed to staffing gains and declining crime rates, noting the department added 165 officers in 2025 and saw reductions in both violent and property crime.

Mayor Wilson rejected claims that her administration has shifted drug enforcement policy.

""There has been no policy change,"" Wilson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""You'll know when I announce a policy change, because I'll announce a policy change.""

Wilson said she remains committed to enforcing the city's public use and possession ordinance in ""priority situations"" while expanding diversion programs like LEAD in neighborhood hot spots, stressing urgency, resources and measurable results.

Despite those assurances, critics remain unconvinced.

In an opinion piece published by Seattle Red, conservative radio host and Seattle commentator Jason Rantz argued that diverting most drug use and possession cases away from prosecution undermines accountability, regardless of how city officials describe the policy. Rantz said that when arrests are not followed by prosecution, the message to offenders is that public drug use carries few real consequences.

Criticism has also come from within law enforcement.

Speaking to Rantz on his radio show, Seattle Police Officers Guild President Mike Solan sharply criticized the approach outlined in the internal police email, warning it puts public safety at risk and sends the wrong message about open drug use.

Solan told Rantz that diverting most drug use cases away from prosecution is dangerous and reflects what he described as a naïve political approach to addiction. He warned the strategy could lead to increased crime and overdose deaths, referring to the philosophy behind it as ""suicidal empathy.""

Solan also said many officers are skeptical of the LEAD program, telling Rantz that some avoid making LEAD referrals altogether because they believe the program is ineffective and driven more by ideology than accountability.

""The recent naive, ignorant political decision to not arrest offenders for open drug use in the City of Seattle is horrifically dangerous and will create more death and societal decay,"" Solan told Rantz. ""It embodies an enormous flaw in those in our community who think that meeting people where they are who are in the throes of addiction, is the correct path to lift them up.""

Similar concerns were raised by outreach groups.

According to MyNorthwest, Andrea Suarez, executive director of the nonprofit We Heart Seattle, warned that allowing open drug use in public spaces enables addiction and accelerates harm. Suarez argued that enforcement plays a critical role in pushing people toward treatment and said diversion-based approaches without consequences fail to meaningfully disrupt drug use.

City officials, however, maintain that enforcement remains in place. Seattle Police say officers will continue to make arrests when probable cause exists, while Wilson insists there has been no policy change and that the city is focused on enforcing drug laws in ""priority situations"" while expanding diversion efforts in high-impact areas.

 ‘All-Star' panelists Ben Domenech, Stef Kight and Robert Wolf discuss the released report from the 'MAHA' Commission regarding childhood disease on ‘Special Report.'

Many might assume that over-the-counter (OTC) medications are generally safer than stronger prescription drugs, but research shows they can still present risks for some.

Certain common OTC painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart attacks.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — which are used to reduce pain, fever and inflammation — have been pinpointed as the class of medicines most linked to elevated cardiovascular risk.

NEW HEALTH WARNING ISSUED OVER POPULAR SLEEP AID MILLIONS TAKE NIGHTLY

""This is because they reduce the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins,"" Maryam Jowza, M.D., an anesthesiologist at UNC Health in North Carolina, told Fox News Digital. ""These chemicals are involved in inflammation, but they are also involved in other body functions, such as influencing the tone of blood vessels.""

Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, echoed the potential risk of NSAIDs. 

""They can lead to high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke via fluid retention and salt retention,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""This increases volume, puts a strain on the heart and raises blood pressure.""

DIABETES PATIENTS EXPERIENCE LOWER DEATH RATE WITH COMMON MEDICATION

Common examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin and celecoxib.

Randomized trials found that ibuprofen caused the biggest spikes in blood pressure, followed by naproxen and then celecoxib. 

""In general, the increase in blood pressure is more likely with higher doses and longer duration of treatment,"" said Jowza, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the UNC School of Medicine.

COMMON VIRUSES LINKED TO ‘DRAMATIC' SPIKE IN HEART ATTACK AND STROKE RISK

NSAIDs can also increase stroke risk, especially at high doses and with long-term use, the doctor added. 

Diclofenac was linked to the highest cardiovascular risk, the doctor cautioned. Ibuprofen can also raise blood pressure and has been associated with a higher heart attack and stroke risk, but not as high as diclofenac. Naproxen carries a lower cardiovascular risk than ibuprofen or diclofenac, but is not entirely risk-free.

NSAIDs have been pinpointed as the class of medicines most linked to elevated cardiovascular risk. (iStock)

""The practical takeaway is that diclofenac is generally the least favorable choice in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, and all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration,"" Dr. Nayan Patel, pharmacist and founder of Auro Wellness in Southern California, told Fox News Digital.

COMMON VITAMIN COULD PROTECT SOME HEART ATTACK SURVIVORS, STUDY SHOWS

Aspirin is an exception — although it is an NSAID, it actually reduces the risk of clots when taken at a low dose for prevention, under a doctor's guidance. However, it can increase bleeding risk and blood pressure at high doses.

Non-NSAID pain relievers are commonly used for everyday aches, headaches and fever, but not swelling. They act mainly on the brain's pain signals, not inflammation, according to medical experts.

Acetaminophen, the most common non-NSAID pain reliever, is also linked to an increase in blood pressure, although to a lesser extent, according to Jowza. 

""All NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.""

""Acetaminophen was once thought to have little to no cardiovascular effects, but more recent evidence suggests it can increase blood pressure, especially with higher doses used in the long term,"" she said, emphasizing the importance of blood pressure monitoring. ""Its effect on stroke risk is less clear.""

The groups at greatest risk, according to doctors, are those with existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure, prior stroke or heart disease, diabetes or kidney problems.

""These groups are also more likely to experience NSAID-related fluid retention and destabilization of blood pressure control,"" Patel said.

Cardiovascular risk is generally higher for people 75 and older, the doctors agreed.

""Age amplifies risk largely because baseline cardiovascular risk increases with age, and kidney function reserve tends to decline,"" Patel said. ""Older adults are also more likely to be on antihypertensives, diuretics, antiplatelets or anticoagulants, so NSAIDs can destabilize blood pressure control and add safety complexity.""

Anyone experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden weakness or numbness, severe headache, confusion, slurred speech or vision changes should see a doctor immediately, Jowza advised.

""These symptoms can point to a heart attack or stroke,"" she warned. ""Other symptoms of concern that may not develop as rapidly, like new swelling in the legs, should also prompt medical attention.""

""Patients should also seek medical advice if they notice signs of fluid retention or kidney stress, such as rapidly rising blood pressure, swelling in the legs, sudden weight gain over a few days, reduced urine output or worsening shortness of breath,"" Patel added.

For those at higher risk, Patel recommends non-NSAID approaches whenever possible. 

""For many patients, this means starting with non-drug strategies such as heat or ice, physical therapy and activity modification,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""If medication is needed, acetaminophen is generally preferred over oral NSAIDs from a cardiovascular standpoint, although regular use should still be monitored in people with hypertension.""

For localized joint or muscle pain, the doctor said topical NSAIDs can offer ""meaningful relief"" with ""far lower"" risk.

""Overall, pain management in high-risk patients should emphasize targeted therapy, conservative dosing and close blood pressure monitoring.""

The doctors emphasized that the overall risk is ""very low"" for people taking OTC pain relievers on a short-term basis, but it rises with long-term, high-dose use.

""I would not hesitate to use an occasional dose if it were a low-risk individual with no prior history of heart attack or stroke,"" Jowza said. ""I also think short-term use in diabetics and hypertensives who are well-controlled is acceptable.""

Although aspirin is an NSAID, it actually reduces the risk of clots when taken at a low dose for prevention, under a doctor's guidance. (iStock)

For those taking NSAIDs, the doctor suggested using ""guard rails"" — such as regularly testing blood pressure and kidney function, and setting limits on dosing — to make treatment as safe as possible.

Patel agreed that for most healthy individuals, occasional NSAID use ""does not carry a meaningful cardiovascular risk.""

TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ

""The concern is primarily with repeated or chronic use, higher doses, and use in people with underlying cardiovascular, kidney or blood pressure conditions,"" he confirmed to Fox News Digital.

""That said, large population studies show that cardiovascular events can occur early after starting NSAIDs, particularly at higher doses, which is why even short-term use should be approached cautiously in higher-risk patients.""

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's wife arrived to court in New York City wearing bandages on her face and complaining of bruises on her ribs, according to her lawyer.

Her attorney, veteran prosecutor Mark Donnelly, told the court that Cilia Flores suffered ""significant injuries"" when U.S. forces raided the couple's compound in Caracas on Saturday. Donnelly requested that Flores receive a full X-ray to determine whether she fractured a rib in the incident.

Flores was already wearing two bandages on her face, one on her forehead and another above her eye.

Both she and her husband pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and other charges in their first appearance on Monday.

Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Flores faces three charges, including cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Donnelly filed a motion to serve as counsel for Flores earlier Monday. He previously served 12 years at the Department of Justice, including as senior advisor to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.

DEFIANT MADURO DECLARES HE IS A 'PRISONER OF WAR' IN FIRST US COURT APPEARANCE

""Mark has extensive experience investigating white collar cases, having run the Southern District's fraud division for over two years. His white collar practice included FCPA investigations, Healthcare Fraud, joint SEC matters, large scale investor fraud, and cyber security matters,"" Donnelly's biography on the website for the Parker Sanchez & Donnelly law firm reads.

The Texas House of Representatives also enlisted Donnelly to assist in the 2023 investigation and impeachment trial for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton's impeachment case made it to the Texas Senate, but he was ultimately acquitted on all charges.

Maduro and Flores, who have been married for 12 years, were first introduced while working closely with Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez. At the time, Maduro described her as having a ""fiery character,"" according to Reuters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said President Donald Trump believes Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) is “criminally liable” for the extensive fraud scandal that Minnesota is facing.

Leavitt's statement confirms speculation that the federal government is weighing whether to hold Walz responsible for his alleged mishandling of the fraud investigations in his state.

“This is all hands on deck, rest assured. It's a top priority for President Trump,” she said on Fox News show Jesse Watters Primetime. “He believes that Gov. Walz is criminally liable, and I think the Department of Justice is going to find out.”

🚨 NEW: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt just went SCORCHED-EARTH on Tim Walz 🔥🚨“This is a man they cannot even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them.”“Trump believes that Governor Walz is criminally liable…… pic.twitter.com/gbEGRII6tK

Earlier Monday, Trump suggested Walz would leave office before his second term ends early next year “because he was caught, REDHANDED, along with Ilhan Omar, and others of his Somali friends, stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars.” The president said he felt “certain the facts will come out.”

Trump's statement was in response to Walz's decision to prematurely end his reelection campaign. Leavitt attributed his campaign exit to the widespread allegations of fraud involving his administration.

“This is a man who can no longer even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them,” she added. “Now the great people of Minnesota, a state that was once known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, has been turned into the land of 10,000 Somali schemes because of their governor.”

As the Trump administration leads multiple investigations into alleged fraud in Minnesota's social services programs, various federal agencies are taking action; the Department of Health and Human Services froze child care payments going to Somali-run day care centers in the state, and the Department of Agriculture ordered the state to verify households receiving federal food benefits in an attempt to root out fraud.

Meanwhile, federal law enforcement is leading an expanded immigration operation in the Minneapolis area. The Department of Homeland Security is deploying up to 2,000 immigration and investigative personnel to the city, with Leavitt confirming the figure to Fox News host Jesse Watters.

The White House press secretary noted that the Department of Justice has convicted and prosecuted nearly 100 defendants in Minnesota so far, hinting that there may be more charges forthcoming for others based on additional reporting.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Monday claimed President Donald Trump is “under the thrall” of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) after the two threatened possible military action against Cuba and Colombia in the aftermath of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's capture over the weekend.

Paul said he once thought Trump was different from the two Bush presidents, who “wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas.” The Kentucky Republican expressed disappointment in Trump's burgeoning alliance with Graham, who is often described as a warmonger by critics.

His criticism comes two days after Trump announced the U.S. military bombed Venezuela and detained Maduro, citing allegations that his authoritarian regime facilitated drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. Maduro is currently imprisoned in New York to face federal charges for those crimes.

While Paul isn't opposed to the ousting of a socialist leader, he argued that Congress should have approved the operation resulting in Maduro's capture.

“Time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost. Best though, not to forget, that our founders limited the executive's power to go to war without Congressional authorization for a reason—to limit the horror of war and limit war to acts of defense,” he wrote in a lengthy post on X. “Let's hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.”

Graham's response to the news about Maduro and Venezuela was much more generous toward Trump.

“If you can't celebrate the fact that our military, under President Trump's command, bravely captured and brought to justice an evil, corrupt narcoterrorist dictator with American blood on his hands, then your hatred of President Trump denies you the ability to celebrate making America safer and creating a path for liberating the highly oppressed people of Venezuela,” he said.

Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, Trump hinted that Colombia and Cuba were next to be met with military force. Graham was present, nodding in agreement with the president.

“You just wait for Cuba,” Graham warned. “Cuba is a communist dictatorship that's killed priests and nuns. They've preyed on their own people. Their days are numbered.”

At one point, when Trump said Cuba is “ready to fall,” Graham grinningly said, “Yes.”

In response to a reporter's question about Graham's warning to Cuba, Paul joked that legislation could be a viable method to prevent Graham from constantly meeting with Trump.

“There should be a law that Lindsey Graham can only enter the White House every other week and that he's only to meet with mid-level people, not the president. No more golf outings,” he suggested. “It's always been an anomaly because Lindsey Graham has been diametrically opposed to everything Trump has ever said on regime change.”

Although Latin American nations were quick to denounce Maduro's arrest, some of them have not addressed the threat from Trump and Graham in a meaningful capacity. Cuba remains silent, but Colombian President Gustavo Petro vowed to “take up arms” in the event of a U.S. attack.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was born to Cuban immigrants, has been tasked with leading the overhaul of Venezuela's government. The Trump administration says the United States is currently running Venezuela, even as Maduro was replaced by his former vice president. It remains to be seen whether the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, will remain in power under U.S. control or will be ousted in a similar fashion as her predecessor.

Trump has also repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring the Danish territory of Greenland, including the possibility of doing so by military force. 

TRUMP SIGNALS HE COULD TAKE ACTION ON CUBA, COLOMBIA, AND OTHER COUNTRIES AFTER VENEZUELA

“We do need Greenland, absolutely,” the president said in an interview with the Atlantic over the weekend, adding that it was “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” Following the remarks, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the U.S. to calm such rhetoric.

“It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland,” Frederiksen said. “The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom,” she said, going on to “strongly urge” the U.S. to “stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), who has represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013, died Tuesday at 65.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) confirmed the congressman's death on X, writing that it was a “sudden loss.”

“Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,” Emmer said in a post. “Our prayers are with Doug's wife, Jill, and their children.”

The House Republican Conference also issued a statement mourning its deceased member, praising him for his two decades in politics.

“Doug was a principled conservative and a tireless advocate for the people of Northern California,” National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) said. “He was never afraid to fight for rural communities, farmers, and working families. Doug brought grit, authenticity, and conviction to everything he did in public service.”

“I cherished our time serving together on the Agriculture Committee and discussing NASCAR; he was a real gearhead and motorsports fan. I will deeply miss my ‘amigo,'” Hudson added.

Democrats are also mourning LaMalfa's passing. Opening a hearing on the five-year anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) asked for a moment of silence to honor a “great member of Congress.”

A fourth-generation rice farmer from Richvale, California, LaMalfa was known as a fierce defender of rural areas, chairing the Congressional Western Caucus. He was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2002 and the state Senate in 2010.

He told the Washington Examiner in October 2025 that he originally had no intention of getting into politics, but he started by putting up posters in his spare time for a cousin running for county supervisor.

“I was happy to be the sign guy,” LaMalfa said, noting that he worked his way up to putting up signs for candidates running for Congress, governor, and even president. LaMalfa eventually moved from campaigning for others to running himself.

The day the Washington Examiner spoke to him, he was on a tractor, working on his rice farm. The folksy lawmaker, who gave his team nicknames and joked that he was a tough boss, got serious when talk turned to redistricting and the future of the state.

He was seeking an eighth term in 2026 and was facing Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, a former president pro tempore. LaMalfa's seat was one of five Republicans targeted under California's plan to redistrict as a way to offset gerrymandering in Texas.

Democrats have long coveted his seat, but their chances improved drastically after Proposition 50 passed in November 2025. This altered California's 1st Congressional District, which originally swept south of the Oregon border almost to Sacramento. It covered the rice fields and walnut and almond orchards of the Sacramento Valley to the forested foothills of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range.

The vast majority of the 1st District's residents are farming families who have harvested the land for decades. The rural district is among the most conservative and least diverse in the state.

DOUG LAMALFA WARNS PROPOSITION 50 COULD SILENCE CALIFORNIA'S RURAL VOICES

LaMalfa won reelection in 2024 with nearly two-thirds of the vote. But with Prop 50's passing, the district will now include Democratic voters in Santa Rosa through Chico to the Nevada border. This will likely give the Democratic nominee an advantage.

With LaMalfa's passing, the House majority stands at 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats, giving Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) a two-seat majority. It comes right after the retirement of former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday night, giving Johnson slimmer odds to pass contentious bills heading into a midterm election year.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The political situation in Venezuela is uncertain. President Donald Trump suggests Venezuela's new president, Delcy Rodriguez, will cooperate with the United States. Perhaps, perhaps not. But the initiative is clearly with the Trump administration. Dictator President Nicolas Maduro was dancing carefree in Caracas a week ago. Today, thanks to a stunning military operation, Maduro is occupying a New York City prison cell. Maduro's inner circle must be wondering if they are next.

But the Venezuelan elites aren't the only ones likely to be sleeping with one eye open. After all, Cuba also now has a big problem. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it, “If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned, at least a little bit.”

Cuba staked a great deal on its relationship with Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. In return for deploying medical, technical, and security-intelligence personnel to protect his rule and support associated social programs, Maduro provided Cuba with the oil it needs to keep its creaking power grid in a minimally functional condition. But as U.S. warships continue to affect a general blockade of Venezuela, Cuba can no longer expect those energy supplies to be forthcoming. Renewable energy projects and energy imports from Mexico are grossly inadequate to compensate for this loss.

2026 is unlikely to be easy for President Miguel Díaz-Canel and the real powers behind the throne, Raúl Castro and the Cuban military.

Cuba's daily energy blackouts last many hours, and goods shortages, including basic foodstuffs and medicines, are already at critical levels. This malaise has provoked escalating, otherwise rare protests over the past two years. Indeed, perhaps 18% of the Cuban population left for the U.S. between 2022 and 2023 alone. The Caribbean island nation's economic situation has only worsened since then. The Cuban Communists have few options to right their sinking ship of state.

China and Russia could invest more to support Cuba's energy infrastructure. Still, their means and incentive to provide necessary relief are marginal. The war in Ukraine greatly limits Russia's economic power, and China would fear jeopardizing its own priorities with the Trump administration by risking Trump's wrath in bolstering Cuba. While Cuba provides key support for both Russian military operations and Chinese intelligence activity targeting the U.S., geography makes it infeasible for a serious Sino-Russian contest with the U.S. over Cuba's future.

The remarkable collapse of Maduro's rule also poses another problem for Cuba, namely, in undermining the credibility of its security apparatus.

Cuba says that 32 of its citizens died attempting to prevent the Delta Force from securing Maduro and his wife. Reports suggest these personnel were drawn from military special forces units and the country's DI intelligence service. The starkly one-sided outcome of this raid, illustrated as it was by a dominant display of American air, sea, and land power with no Americans killed in action, thus underlines Cuba's inability to contest the U.S. military. Suddenly, U.S. military bases in Key West and Guantanamo Bay seem a lot closer.

Maduro's loss is a particular blow to the prestige of the DI, which has long held a reputation as a small but extremely capable intelligence service. Developed under the tutelage of the Soviet Union's KGB intelligence service and retaining close links with Russia, the DI remains an instrumental servant of the ruling Communist Party.

What happens next?

CAPTURING MADURO WAS THE EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING BUT EASIER PART

What the Cuban military does or does not do would appear to be key. The military retains vast financial reserves, garnered through its domination of critical economic sectors, including tourism and remittances from U.S.-based expatriates. But as blackouts worsen and private finance continues to evaporate amid goods shortages, the regime will only face growing pressure. If the military is unwilling to fund capital investments to bolster energy supplies and improve living standards, the ingredients for internal revolt will continue to grow.

And while the DI and military have shown an impressive ability to crush dissent over the decades, it has been a long while since they have faced an American president who has both such a high appetite for risk and comfort with using military force. Put simply, while 2026 is sure to be a year of great consequence for Venezuela, it is unlikely to be so for Venezuela alone.

The movement claims to stand with the police. Trump's decision to pardon the cop-beaters of January 6 exposed his movement for what it is.

At 1:42 a.m. on December 19, 2020, Donald Trump—disturbed, humiliated, livid—posted the following message on Twitter: “Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”

In California, David Nicholas Dempsey, a 33-year-old man-child with multiple felony convictions and a profound affection for the president, answered the call. On January 6, wearing a tactical vest and an American-flag gaiter, Dempsey came to the Capitol. Shortly before he assaulted several police officers, he shared his perspectives in an interview given while standing near a gallows. The gallows had been erected as a reminder to Vice President Mike Pence to do, in Trump's words, “the right thing.”

“Them worthless fucking shitholes like fucking Jerry Nadler, fucking Pelosi, Clapper, Comey, fucking all those pieces of garbage, you know, Obama, all these dudes, Clinton, fuck all these pieces of shit,” Dempsey said. “They don't need a jail cell. They need to hang from these motherfuckers while everybody videotapes it and fucking spreads it on YouTube.”

Dempsey was not an organizer of the siege, but he was one of its most energetic participants. He assaulted Metropolitan Police Detective Phuson Nguyen with pepper spray. Nguyen was certain in that moment that he was “going to die,” he later testified. Dempsey assaulted another police officer with a metal crutch, cracking his protective shield and cutting his head. Dempsey, who was heard yelling “Fuck you, bitch-ass cops!,” assaulted other officers with broken pieces of furniture, crutches, and a flagpole. Prosecutors would later argue that “Dempsey's violence reached such extremes that, at one point, he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him.” All told, more than 140 police officers were injured in the riot, many seriously.

I attended the January 6 rally on the Ellipse, at which Trump told his supporters, “If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.” Then I walked with the crowd to the Capitol. One woman, a QAnon adherent dressed in a cat costume, told me, “We're going to stop the steal. If Pence isn't going to stop it, we have to.”

What I remember very well about that day was my own failure of imagination. I did not, to my knowledge, see Dempsey—he had positioned himself at the vanguard of the assault, and I had stayed near the White House to listen to Trump—but I did come across at least a dozen or more protesters dressed in similar tactical gear or wearing body armor, many of them carrying flex-cuffs. I particularly remember those plastic cuffs, but I understood them only as a performance of zealous commitment. Later we would learn that these men—some of whom were Proud Boys—believed that they would actually be arresting members of Congress in defense of the Constitution. I interviewed one of them. “It's all in the Bible,” he said. “Everything is predicted. Donald Trump is in the Bible.” Grifters could not exist, of course, without a population primed to be grifted.

After the riot, Dempsey returned to California, where he was eventually arrested. In early 2024, he pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Six months later, in the summer of 2024, Trump, who would come to describe the January 6 insurrection as a “day of love,” said that, if reelected, he would pardon rioters, but only “if they're innocent.” Dempsey was not innocent, but on January 20, 2025, shortly after being inaugurated, Trump pardoned him and roughly 1,500 others charged with or convicted of offenses related to the Capitol insurrection. (Fourteen people, mainly senior figures in the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys movements, saw their sentences commuted but did not receive pardons.)

Of the 1,500 or so offenders who received pardons, roughly 600 had been charged with assaulting or obstructing police officers, and 170 had been accused of using deadly weapons in the siege. Among those pardoned were Peter Schwartz, who had received a 14-year sentence for throwing a chair at police officers and repeatedly attacking them with pepper spray; Daniel Joseph Rodriguez, who was sentenced to 12.5 years for conspiracy and assaulting an officer with a stun gun (he sent a text message to a friend, “Tazzzzed the fuck out of the blue”); and Andrew Taake, who received a six-year sentence for attacking officers with bear spray and a metal whip.

A day after the pardons were announced, Trump said in a press conference, “I am a friend of police, more than any president who's been in office.” He went on to describe the rioters. “These were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate.”

Trump had something else to say during that first press conference of his new term: “I think we're going to do things that people will be shocked at.” This would turn out to be true, but unfortunately, shock does not last. Here is the emblematic inner struggle of our age: to preserve the ability to be shocked. “Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!” Dostoyevsky wrote. A blessing that is also a curse.

I understand that a review—even a short and partial review—of the past year might seem dismally repetitive. But repetition ensures that we remember, and perhaps even experience shock anew.

So, in brief: Trump has dismantled America's foreign-aid infrastructure and gutted a program, built by an earlier Republican president, that saved the lives of Africans infected with HIV; he has encouraged the United States military to commit war crimes; he has instituted radical cuts to U.S. science and medical funding and abetted a crusade against vaccines; he has appointed conspiracists, alcoholics, and idiots to key positions in his administration; he has destroyed the independence of the Justice Department; he has waged pitiless war on prosecutors, FBI agents, and others who previously investigated him, his family, and his friends; he has cast near-fatal doubt on America's willingness to fulfill its treaty obligations to its democratic allies; he has applauded Vladimir Putin for his barbarism and castigated Ukraine for its unwillingness to commit suicide; he has led racist attacks on various groups of immigrants; he has employed unusually cruel tactics in pursuit of undocumented immigrants, most of whom have committed only one crime—illegally seeking refuge in a country that they believed represented the dream of a better life. Those are some of the actions Trump has taken. Here are a few of the things he has said since returning to office: He has referred to immigrants as “garbage”; he has called a female reporter “piggy” and other reporters “ugly,” “stupid,” “terrible,” and “nasty”; he has suggested that the murder of a Saudi journalist by his country's government was justified; he has labeled a sitting governor “seriously retarded”; he has blamed the murder of Rob Reiner on the director's anti-Trump politics; he has called the Democrats the party of “evil.”

Yet, even when weighed against this stunning record of degeneracy, the pardoning by Trump of his cop-beating foot soldiers represents the lowest moment of this presidency so far, because it was an act not only of naked despotism but also of outlandish hypocrisy. By pardoning these criminals, he exposed a foundational lie of MAGA ideology: that it stands with the police and as a guarantor of law and order. The truth is the opposite.

The power to pardon is a vestige of America's pre-independence past. It is an unchecked monarchical power, an awesome power, and therefore it should be bestowed only on leaders blessed with self-restraint, civic-mindedness, and, most important, basic decency.

Liz Oyer: Trump is using a sacred power for depraved purposes

We have been watching indecency triumph in the public sphere on and off for more than 10 years now, since the moment Trump insulted John McCain's war record. For reasons that are quite possibly too unbearable to contemplate, a large group of American voters was not repulsed by such slander—they were actually aroused by it—and our politics have not been the same. Much has been said, including by me, about Trump's narcissism, his autocratic inclinations, his disconnection from reality, but not nearly enough has been said about his fundamental indecency, the characteristic that undergirds everything he says and does.

In an important essay, Andrew Sullivan noted this past fall that Trump's indecency is comprehensive in style and substance. “It is one thing to be a realist in foreign policy, to accept the morally ambiguous in an immoral world; it is simply indecent to treat a country, Ukraine, invaded by another, Russia, as the actual aggressor and force it to accept a settlement on the invader's terms,” Sullivan wrote. “It is one thing to find and arrest illegal immigrants; it is indecent to mock and ridicule them, and send them with no due process to a foreign gulag where torture is routine. It is one thing to enforce immigration laws; it is another to use masked, anonymous men to do it. It is one thing to cut foreign aid; it is simply indecent to do so abruptly and irrationally so that tens of thousands of children will needlessly die. We have slowly adjusted to this entirely new culture from the top, perhaps in the hope that it will somehow be sated soon—but then new indecencies happen.”

The subject of Trump's indecency came up in a conversation I had with Barack Obama in 2017. I asked him to name the most norm-defying act of his successor to date. Somewhat to my surprise, Obama mentioned Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts' National Jamboree earlier that year. This appearance has been largely forgotten, but it was a festival of indecency. At one point, Trump told the scouts about a wealthy friend of his who, he suggested, did unmentionable things on his yacht.

Obama, a model of dignified presidential behavior (just like nearly all of his predecessors, Democratic and Republican), understood viscerally the importance of self-restraint and adherence to long-established norms. Which is why he was so troubled by Trump's decadent performance. “You can stand in front of tens of thousands of teenage boys and encourage them to be good citizens and be helpful to their mothers,” Obama said, “or you can go Lord of the Flies. He went Lord of the Flies.”

We are in a long Lord of the Flies moment, led by a man who, to borrow from Psalm 10, possesses a mouth “full of cursing and deceit and fraud.” For many people—government scientists seeking cures for diseases; FBI agents investigating corruption and terrorism; military leaders trying to preserve respect for the rules of warfare; and, in particular, police officers who were brutalized by Trump's army of deluded followers—these days can seem infernal. Trump's term is one-quarter over; a piece of advice often attributed to Churchill has it best: When you're going through hell, keep going.

After Venezuela, Europeans are taking the president's threats seriously.

Danish officials think they know how Donald Trump might seize Greenland. In a late-night Truth Social post, the president announces that the Danish territory is now an American “protectorate.” Because neither Denmark nor its European allies possess the military force to prevent the United States from taking the island, they are powerless to resist Trump's dubious claim. And as the leading member of NATO claims the sovereign territory of another state, the alliance is paralyzed. Arguing that possession is nine-tenths of the law, Trump simply declares that Greenland now belongs to the United States.



This chain of events, which some Danish officials and security experts proposed to us in recent months, may have seemed faintly ridiculous as of last Friday. By the weekend—after the toppling of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump's ensuing insistence that the United States now “runs” Venezuela—it seemed far less so. For months, Danes have anxiously imagined an audacious move by the Trump administration to annex Greenland, whether by force, coercion, or an attempt to buy off the local population of about 56,000 people with the promise of cutting them in on future mining deals. Now those fears are spiking.



Shortly after U.S. forces captured Maduro, Katie Miller, a former White House official who is married to the senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, posted on X a map of Greenland covered in the U.S. flag, with the caption “SOON.” Officials in Denmark told us that they were furious—and rattled. Then, yesterday morning, in an interview with our colleague Michael Scherer, Trump reasserted his intention to annex Greenland. “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said.



European leaders have long downplayed Trump's acquisitive posture and tried to ignore his comments. Not after what happened in Venezuela. Today, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, argued that the president's threats are credible. “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,” she told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR).



U.S. officials and Trump allies we spoke with downplayed the possibility of military action in Greenland. (Stephen Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper today that it would hardly be necessary. “No one is going to fight the U.S. militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said, reiterating that the territory should belong to the United States.) But Trump has pointedly not ruled out taking Greenland by force. And if the U.S. goes down that road, NATO will effectively cease to exist the moment the first military personnel enter Greenlandic territory.



“If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” Frederiksen said on DR.



The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, made clear to reporters during a visit to Lithuania that Greenland falls under Article 5 of the alliance, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to respond: “Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence.”



But how exactly would that play out in practice? One European official was blunt: “We won't be able to defend Greenland. Are you kidding?”



Boosters of Trump's Greenlandic ambitions are delighted by the Venezuela operation and by the president's restated commitment to their cause. “I think it's a big opportunity and a new beginning for Greenland, with Trump's interest,” Jørgen Boassen, the president's most prominent and vocal advocate in Greenland, told us. Boassen, known for his collection of MAGA hats and for wearing T-shirts with Trump's face printed on them, said that Greenlanders yearn for independence from Denmark and from “Danish elites” in Greenland who don't speak the native language or understand local culture.



Those long-standing rifts aside, polls do not show widespread Greenlandic support for swapping the Danish flag for the Stars and Stripes. Boassen insisted that many Greenlanders are afraid to speak up in favor of annexation because they would face professional and political retribution. He claimed that Danish authorities shut down his Facebook page, which is his primary means of spreading his support for Trump's policies. (We were able to access the page this afternoon.) Boassen said that “Trump has heard about people suffering” and that he is “a savior for us right now.”



European leaders see matters very differently. Since yesterday, they have dispensed with the kind of equivocation that sometimes marks their public statements about the American president. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News, “Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark are to decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.” France's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, wrote on social media, “Greenland is neither for the taking nor for sale.”

As for the Danes, they're cycling through various stages of grief, according to Rufus Gifford, who served as U.S. ambassador to Denmark under President Barack Obama. Above all, they can't figure out what Trump's true intentions are, Gifford told us. The likeliest outcome, in his estimation, is that the president uses the leverage of U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine to pressure European countries, including Denmark, to accept U.S. plans for the Arctic island. Indeed, a former senior U.S. official in Europe told us that one reason NATO leaders didn't speak up sooner, and more emphatically, in opposition to U.S. territorial designs on Greenland was fear that Trump would lash out in response and curtail U.S. support for Ukraine, possibly interrupting intelligence sharing and weapons sales.



The former official said that panic first set in about U.S. plans a year ago, after MAGA acolytes, led by Donald Trump Jr., made a trip to Nuuk, Greenland's capital. “From the standpoint of the Danish government, that's when it began to get really heated,” said the former official, who, like some others, spoke with us on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's sensitivity. The visit had a carnival atmosphere, with locals flocking to see the visiting delegation that had arrived in the president's personal airplane, dubbed “Trump Force One.”



Danish officials and experts told us it was on this trip that Trump lost any prospect of popular support from Greenlanders. Rumors circulated that Trump's son was handing out $100 bills to local homeless people. That wasn't true, but Trump Jr. did buy the people lunch, said Boassen, who helped organize the trip. Still, many Greenlanders believed that Trump Jr. was exhibiting the kind of colonialist mentality that they have long complained about.



Over the following months, some dared to hope that Trump had moved on from his dreams of acquiring Greenland. But a series of recent moves created a new sense of urgency for Denmark. In December, Trump named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. (Landry's office didn't respond to a request for comment.) The same month, the president appointed Tom Dans, an ally, entrepreneur, and investor involved in organizing American excursions to the island, to lead an Arctic research commission. The U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, told us in a statement that members of his staff have “interacted” with Dans and that he expects to meet with him, given Dans's new role. Dans wrote on social media that he would make “the ARCTIC GREAT AGAIN!” He declined to comment.



The operation in Venezuela seems to confirm that the president is willing to back up his demands of foreign nations with military action, a kind of gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. People close to the president told us that Trump is enamored with the success of the military interventions he has ordered in Iran, Nigeria, and now Venezuela—and that he will not shy away from wielding force again. And he's happy, at least, to use the threat of force as leverage while he eyes Greenland. Some around Trump have delighted in Europe's impassioned reaction to his latest expression of interest in the mineral-rich island. “Let them squirm,” one close outside ally told us. “Maybe we'll take it; maybe we won't. But after what we just saw in Caracas, do you want to try to call Trump's bluff?” Trump said this past weekend that Greenland is not yet at the top of his to-do list, but he offered multiple timelines—from 20 days to two months—for when he might fully engage on the issue.



Western diplomats and security officials we spoke with were apoplectic. One told us that Denmark and its Nordic neighbors have been taking the president's statements seriously for a year but have remained uncertain about how to interpret them and, especially, how to respond. The editor in chief of the Copenhagen-based newspaper Berlingske wrote in a column today that Denmark and its allies should seek to raise the cost for Washington of any possible military aggression, including by moving more military assets to the island: “It won't be able to stop the USA, but it will be a symbolic step.”



A Danish lawmaker, who spoke with us on the condition of anonymity to address the security situation candidly, said that the very notion of the U.S. invading Greenland—both mounting an invasion and defending against it—is absurd. The island is nearly four times the size of France and is mostly ice. The lawmaker told us that Danes are particularly baffled by Trump's designs on Greenland because he could accomplish all of his security objectives by working with Denmark, a committed U.S. ally. During the Cold War, there was even a nuclear-powered U.S. base built under Greenlandic ice. “If the Americans want another military base, just say where,” the lawmaker said. “If you want a radar, you can put it up.”



Read: The view from Greenland 



Carsten Søndergaard, a career Danish diplomat who served as an ambassador to Russia and as the permanent representative to NATO, told us that additional U.S. troops in Greenland, as well as mining rights, could be negotiated, to the benefit of all parties. “A hostile takeover of an ally's territory will have severe consequences for the transatlantic relations and the West. So much is at stake,” he said.



There was one specific jab at Denmark, made by Trump aboard Air Force One last night, that the Danish lawmaker felt compelled to counter. “You know what Denmark did recently to boost up security on Greenland?” Trump joked to reporters. “They added one more dogsled.”



A Danish naval unit, called the Sirius Patrol, actually does conduct reconnaissance missions by dogsled in the unforgiving northeastern part of the island. The U.S. Department of Defense—or the Department of War, as Trump's team has taken to calling it—even celebrates the unit's history on its website: Danish, Norwegian, and Greenlandic hunters patrolled Greenland's coast by dogsled to fend off German intruders during the Second World War. Drawing on that legacy, the unit still conducts long-range missions and “enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness of northern and eastern Greenland,” according to the Defense Department.



Patrolling is typically done in pairs, sometimes for months on end without other human contact. The Danish lawmaker said that it's a tough job in some of the bleakest conditions in the world. “Very few U.S. soldiers,” he told us, “would survive a week up there.”

January 6, five years later

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

In the early-morning hours of January 5, 2021, Thomas Webster, a former U.S. Marine and retired police officer, drove south on Interstate 95 toward Washington, D.C. Webster, who was then 54, had been conflicted about whether to attend the “Save America” rally, but Donald Trump had used the word patriot. Webster had joined the military at 19, taken his first plane ride to boot camp in South Carolina, gotten his first taste of lobster tail on a ship in the Mediterranean. He loved the sense of purpose he'd drawn from the oath he'd sworn when he joined the Marines: I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Webster, who'd retired from the New York City Police Department, where he'd been a street cop, a firearms instructor, and part of the Gracie Mansion security detail, lived in Goshen, New York, with his wife, Michelle, an Ivy League graduate who worked in biotech sales, and their three teenagers, one of whom had recently joined the Marines. He ran a small business, Semper Fi Landscaping, cutting grass and clearing snow during winter.

In the early days of the pandemic, Webster had masked in public, disinfected his groceries, and slept in the basement if he had the slightest sniffle. At first he thought keeping his kids home from school made sense. But as the months stretched on, he worried about his two younger teenagers, who didn't seem to be socializing or learning much over Zoom. One morning that spring, when Webster went outside to mow a neighbor's lawn, he found himself troubled by the surreal silence on his block, like he was standing on a vacant movie set.

When Webster turned on the news, the world seemed upside down. He saw millions of people flouting COVID restrictions to protest the killing of George Floyd. He became suspicious about what the government and the mainstream media were telling him. In the summer of 2020, he puzzled over how CNN and other news outlets could describe the Black Lives Matter protests as “mostly peaceful” while broadcasting discordant images—for instance, the flames from buildings burning orange against the night sky.

During that first year of COVID isolation, Webster consumed more news than he ever had and grew irritated by what he viewed as proliferating government intrusions into people's lives. New York's Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued early stay-at-home orders, imposed one of the first statewide mask mandates, and discouraged in-person church services. As time passed, Webster found his views diverging from some of his neighbors' in the Hudson Valley. When students were eventually allowed to return to school, his children were among the few who climbed back onto the school bus. This was when he thought he noticed neighbors looking at him differently, as though they disapproved. Back in 2015, when Trump had begun his presidential campaign, Webster hadn't taken him seriously, because he “said some crazy-ass stuff.” Webster thought of himself as a traditional, small-government, libertarian-leaning Reagan Republican; he'd supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primary. Now, though, he began to find Trump's bombast refreshing. In the president's words, Webster heard echoes of his own thoughts about the strangulating overreach of an authoritarian government. Some of what Trump said about foreign policy also began to resonate with Webster, particularly his statements about wanting America to quit its “forever wars,” because he worried about his daughter in the Marines.

Over the course of 2020, Webster found himself pulled more and more deeply into the MAGA camp. The concept of “Make America Great Again” seemed pretty brilliant to him. Who could argue with it? Webster had been disappointed to see the Obama administration go on what he thought was an endless apology tour around the world. Trump, in contrast, embraced the country and was unabashed in putting America first. “I really appreciated that,” Webster told me recently. “I didn't view MAGA as ‘extremism.' I viewed it as a sense of patriotism, a love of God and family and country.”

As the pandemic and the 2020 election campaign wore on, Webster drifted further and further to the right. When he became disenchanted with even Fox News for being too moderate, and especially for its decision to call Arizona for Joe Biden so early on Election Night, he began turning instead to Newsmax and One America News Network. He migrated from far-right sites such as Breitbart News, The Federalist, and Gateway Pundit to smaller, even-further-right forums that pulsed with conspiratorial outrage.

When Trump claimed that the election had been stolen, Webster was inclined to believe him. He read about a Postal Service subcontractor who said that he'd driven 24 boxes of completed mail-in ballots from New York to Pennsylvania in a tractor trailer early one morning about two weeks before Election Day, suggesting that they'd been improperly moved across state lines. He saw images of poll workers in Detroit covering windows, which implied to him that they were concealing electoral skulduggery. He watched a video of poll workers in Georgia pulling what Trump called “suitcases” of ballots from beneath a table after election observers had gone home. Based on everything he was seeing, Webster didn't find it so far-fetched that a cornerstone of democracy—a free and fair election—had been compromised. He believed Trump when he said that Democrats were using the pandemic to push the use of mail-in ballots in order to perpetrate widespread voter fraud. After the election results were in, when Trump asked how Biden—who, according to the president, had been “hiding” in his basement and couldn't put two sentences together—had somehow won 81 million votes, Webster had to agree that was awfully suspicious.

Trump had been sowing doubts about the integrity of the election since before the voting even started. “The only way they”—the Democrats—“are going to win is by a rigged election,” he said at a rally in August, and he repeated this sentiment over and over in the weeks leading up to November 3. After midnight on Election Night, while the votes were still being counted, Trump said, “Frankly, we did win this election.” As soon as the votes were finally all tabulated and the race was declared for Biden, Trump began casting doubt and scheming to overturn the result.

On December 14, the leader of the Oath Keepers, the right-wing paramilitary group, published an open letter on their website urging Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to block the transfer of power to Biden using military force. “If you fail to act,” the letter said, “we the people will have to fight a bloody civil war and revolution.” Five days later, Trump urged his supporters to attend a rally in Washington on January 6, the day the Electoral College vote was to be certified. “Will be wild!” he tweeted. MAGA supporters embraced the invitation. Social media and pro-Trump discussion forums teemed with people saying they were planning to “storm the Capitol” on January 6. Many of them declared that they would be armed.

Before 2021, the January 6 electoral certification had generally been a pro forma affair. By the time certification happens, the popular vote has long been counted, the Electoral College totals officially called. But Trump and some of his aides were plotting with a few far-right Republicans in the House of Representatives to stymie the proceedings. During the certification process, members of Congress have the opportunity to object to a state's results, which triggers debate and then a vote about whether the objection is to be upheld. But in the 133 years that this certification process had been the law, no objection had ever been sustained. Trump and his coterie intended to change that by pressuring legislators, and Vice President Mike Pence, to uphold objections to certain states' votes. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” the president tweeted on January 5. Trump supporters got the message: Outside pressure would help. If “a million patriots” show up “bristling with AR's”—assault rifles—“just how brave do you think” legislators will be “when it comes to enforcing their unconstitutional laws?” someone posted on thedonald.win, a popular pro-Trump website. “Don't cuck out. This is do or die. Bring your guns.” Other posts echoed this.

As Trump amplified calls for his supporters to assemble in Washington to “stop the steal,” Webster told his wife that he needed to go. Worried about antifa counterprotesters, he packed his NYPD-issued bulletproof vest, with his blood type, A+, written on the inside; he filled his military-issued rucksack with water, Gatorade, and Meals Ready-to-Eat (MREs). He took a Smith & Wesson revolver, small enough to fit in his pocket, and warm clothes, including a snow jacket with distinctive red, black, and white stripes. As he traveled south in his Honda CR-V, he was a man infused with purpose, a patriot answering a president's plea for help.

The next afternoon, January 6, Noah Rathbun, an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., stood behind a bike-rack barricade on the west side of the U.S. Capitol as a hostile and growing crowd closed in.

Though Rathbun, a U.S. Navy veteran, had been with MPD for five years, he'd never been to the Capitol. After joining the department, he'd been assigned to the Seventh District, which includes high-crime neighborhoods in Southeast D.C. But he was also a member of one of the department's civil-disturbance units, and that morning his unit had been deployed near the White House. Around 1 p.m., when officers at the Capitol began radioing for help, his unit drove patrol cars toward the complex's western end. Surveying the scene that confronted him there, Rathbun had never faced so many angry people, a mass of humanity that rippled out as far as he could see. He wore a helmet, a gas mask, a fluorescent-yellow jacket, and a body camera that recorded the crowd.

Earlier that day, Trump had begun his morning by once again exhorting Pence, who would oversee the election-certification process, to overturn Biden's victory. “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!” he tweeted. Just before noon, the president began speaking to the thousands of supporters he had summoned to the Ellipse. “We won this election, and we won it by a landslide,” he said. After telling them to “peacefully and patriotically” make their voices heard, in order to give Republicans the courage to reject the certification, he shifted to inflaming them: “We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.” He told them to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, where Congress was beginning the certification proceedings, and said that he would go with them. (He did not go with them.) At 2:11, the rioters breached the Capitol building. Two minutes later, the Secret Service whisked Pence off the Senate floor.

At 2:18, a woman wearing a Trump face mask and holding a Trump flag on a pole tried to push through the barricade that Rathbun was manning. He put his hand on the woman's shoulder and shoved her back as they tussled over the flagpole. The woman fell to the ground, upsetting the crowd. On body-cam footage, you can see one protester square his shoulders in a confrontational posture, and another raise what looks like a cane into the air as a police officer tries to douse them with chemical spray.

Someone lobbed what looked like a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker into the air. It hit Rathbun in the chest. As he tried to reattach the barricade, which the crowd had dislodged, the woman reappeared. Rathbun put both hands on her chest and pushed her back, and she again fell down. Shortly after that, a bearded man, reading the officer's name on his uniform, raised his hands in the air and said, “Rathbun, calm down. Nobody's going to hurt you.”

Another man, wearing what looked to be tactical goggles, pointed his finger at Rathbun and said to the bearded man: “He hit the woman.”

Bearded man: “I know.”

“He's ready to punch a woman in the face,” the man with goggles said, making an uppercut motion. “I treated Afghan women with way more respect than that.”

Rathbun responded by opening and closing his fingers and thumb like Pac-Man's mouth, appearing to convey the universal symbol for blah blah blah.

As the crowd blew air horns and chanted “U.S.A.!,” the bearded man asked Rathbun, “Do you love America, Rathbun? Do you love your country, son?”

Rathbun stared forward, his hand resting on the barricade, the final barrier between the crowd and the Capitol's western entrance. The nation's legislators were gathered inside, certifying Biden's election. Rathbun understood that his job was to protect those legislators. The barricades were flimsy and unanchored. He put his foot on the bottom of one, trying to stabilize it. Before long, another man appeared before Rathbun. “Y'all know what's right and what's wrong. I know you're just doing what's right, doing your job, and we hope that Pence does his job,” the man said. “My vote got disenfranchised by thousands of votes. Thousands of dead people voted. Those dead people are not here. I'm here.”

It was around this moment that Trump tweeted that Pence—then being evacuated to a secure location as some people in the mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence!”—lacked the “courage” to reject Biden's certification.

At 2:28, a man in a red, black, and white snow jacket—Tom Webster—pushed his way to the front of the crowd. He carried a large metal pole with a red Marine Corps flag on it. He pointed his index finger at Rathbun and yelled: “You fucking piece of shit! You fucking commie motherfuckers, man. You're gonna attack Americans? No, fuck that!” As Webster repeatedly jabbed his finger, Rathbun met it with his left hand, as if trying to swat him away. As Webster continued aggressively yelling, Rathbun reached over the barricade and shoved him back. Webster said, “You fucking commie fuck. Come on, take your shit off”—something people say to a cop when they want to fight.

Webster reached down and shoved the barricade toward Rathbun. It slid easily across the concrete, creating a gap between it and the next barricade. Rathbun reached out to shove Webster back and struck him in the head with an open palm. The blow further inflamed Webster, who raised his flagpole into the air and swung it down repeatedly in a chopping motion, hitting the barricade with a loud clang.

Rathbun and the other officers tried to reconnect the barricades but couldn't, and the crowd surged forward. As Rathbun and other officers retreated, Webster clenched both fists, crouched into a linebacker's stance, and charged into Rathbun, knocking him to the ground. As the two men wrestled, Webster tugged on Rathbun's helmet, pulling the chin strap tighter around his neck, to the point where, Rathbun later testified, he struggled to breathe. Webster pulled the officer's gas mask partway off and pressed his fingers close to his eyes. Rathbun tried to get up but couldn't, feeling as if someone in the crowd was kicking him. After about 10 seconds, Webster stood and disappeared into the crowd flooding through the breach he'd helped create.

Shortly afterward, someone filmed Webster standing against a wall at the Capitol, his eyes red from tear gas. Stepping away from the wall and looking into the camera, he said: “Send more patriots. We need some help.”

As Webster drove home to New York that night, he wasn't exactly pumping his fist over what had happened, but he wasn't full of regret, either. He felt justified in what he'd done. He believed that Officer Rathbun had provoked him, gesturing him to come closer and fight. (Rathbun denied this in court testimony, saying he had “absolutely not” made such a gesture. He did not respond to requests for comment.) Webster thought back to how when he'd arrived on the Capitol grounds, he'd seen an elderly couple leaving, the woman's face covered in blood. The image had troubled him. American citizens had gone to the Capitol to express their First Amendment rights, only to find themselves assaulted by the police? Webster says he thinks of himself as a “protector,” so seeing that woman put him into a rage, which was the state he was in when he approached Rathbun at the police barrier.

As he absorbed news coverage over the rest of that week, however, he was surprised by its tenor. He'd thought the January 6 crowd would be viewed the way the Black Lives Matter protesters had been—as a mostly peaceful group with a righteous cause. A few bad actors, to be sure, but he wasn't among them.

But he quickly realized that many Americans viewed January 6 protesters like him not as patriots but as domestic terrorists. Much of the commentary Webster now saw online focused on white supremacy and featured images of protesters holding Confederate flags. Even Trump seemed to briefly forsake them, calling their intrusion on the Capitol a “heinous attack” that had “defiled the seat of American democracy.” As politicians in both parties warned that lawbreakers in the crowd would pay, Webster suppressed a pang of fear.

He seesawed back and forth as he surveyed the evidence. He watched footage of a man hurling a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers. Okay, that clearly crossed the line, Webster thought. Then he watched clips of the Air Force veteran and MAGA devotee Ashli Babbitt getting shot as she climbed through a window into the Speaker's Lobby leading to the House Chamber, and he felt outraged by what he viewed as her murder.

From the October 2024 issue: Hanna Rosin on the insurrectionists next door

Webster learned that the FBI, media organizations, and amateur internet sleuths were using facial-recognition software to identify those who'd stormed the Capitol. His anxiety increased when he heard that federal agents had begun kicking down the doors of identified January 6 protesters. A friend told Webster that his picture was circulating online. One evening as he lay in bed, his wife's phone rang. His brother-in-law spoke so loudly that Webster could hear what he said: “Tom is going viral on Twitter.” His wife looked at Webster, concerned. “What do you mean?” she asked.

Her brother texted a photograph that he'd found trending online under the hashtag #eyegouger, showing Webster appearing to thrust his fingers in a police officer's face. Webster had already told his wife about his fight, explaining that the cop had struck him first. Now he again insisted that he'd been provoked, but his brother-in-law sounded doubtful. Whatever you say, dude.

Panicked, Webster went to see the priest at his Catholic church. The clergyman connected Webster with another church member who was a criminal-defense lawyer. He and Webster arranged to meet with the FBI.

In the spring of 2022, Webster sat at the defense table in a federal courtroom in Washington, D.C. Legal wrangling ahead of the trial had stretched out over 14 months, while lawyers and law-enforcement agents pored over hundreds of pages of filings, reports, and statements, and watched scores of video clips. Five attorneys argued the case—three for the government, two for Webster. Jurors heard from 12 witnesses: three U.S. Capitol Police officers, one MPD officer, one Secret Service agent, three FBI agents, a Safeway grocery-store district manager (who testified about how much the violence on January 6 had suppressed business), two longtime friends of Webster's, and a former NYPD officer with whom he'd attended the police academy. Jurors also heard directly from Webster and Rathbun, both of whom testified for several hours, and repeatedly watched footage of their altercation from multiple angles. The court reporters' transcription of the proceedings consumed more than 1,000 typed pages.

During closing arguments, a prosecutor urged the jurors to rely on what they'd seen with their own eyes. He repeated this six times, the last time as a question: “What did your eyes tell you?”

After a trial lasting five days, jurors deliberated for less than three hours before finding Webster guilty on all six counts he'd been charged with, including the most serious felony: assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon, for violently swinging his flagpole multiple times at Rathbun. At the sentencing, in September, a prosecutor acknowledged that people like Webster might have been pawns in a political game, but added: “Even if he didn't know better than to believe Trump's lies, he knew better than to assault a fellow cop, no matter the circumstances.”

Webster's defense attorney had argued in a presentencing filing that judging his client's character based solely on January 6 was like “judging the sea by a jugful of its water.”

“The court doesn't see a lot of Tom Websters,” the attorney, James E. Monroe, told the judge. “In my career, I don't get a chance to represent many Tom Websters, someone who's had such a sparkling career and makes such a perfect disaster of his personal and professional life by seconds of stupidity.” He said that Webster came to D.C. at the invitation “of a president that was desperate to retain power. And like many other Americans, he accepted that invitation. And as we've laid out in our own papers, the lies and disinformation were sufficient to fool many Americans, especially those who showed up here at the Capitol on January 6.” He also scolded the government for seeking a long prison term for Webster, who'd never before had any legal trouble and who had served his country and New York honorably as a Marine and a police officer; he called the proposed sentence “an act of vengeance as opposed to a prayer for justice.”

Webster rose to speak. He told the judge that he'd become swept up in politics and Trump's rhetoric. He said he wished he'd never gone to D.C. that day. He turned and addressed the police officer he'd assaulted, who was sitting in the courtroom gallery: “Officer Rathbun, I'm sorry.”

U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta, an Obama appointee, agreed that for 25 years, Webster had been “a public servant in the truest sense of the word,” an everyday American who now found himself looking at substantial jail time. But although he'd watched the video of Webster attacking the cop many times, Mehta said, “I still remain shocked every single time I see it.” Webster, he said, had contributed to one of America's darkest days: “We cannot function as a country if people think they can behave violently when they lose an election.” Mehta believed that Webster had constructed an alternative truth about what happened that day, one that was “utterly fanciful and incredible.”

Before sentencing Webster to 10 years in prison, Mehta suggested that understanding his actions on January 6 required a wider lens. The judge posited that a man like Webster doesn't do what he did unless he is “brought to a place where his mind and his otherwise sense of equilibrium, his patriotism, his sense of self are lost.”

“People need to ask themselves what conditions could have created that to happen,” Mehta said, “and be honest with yourself when you're asking the question and answering it.”

After Webster turned himself in at a low-security prison in Texas on October 13, 2022, inmates quickly discovered that he was a former cop. When he sat down for his first meal in the chow hall, another inmate ordered him to go and sit with the “SOs”—the sex offenders.

But what was even harder for Webster to deal with was the knowledge that people didn't see him the way he'd seen himself on January 6—as a patriot. Even his kids, who'd always looked up to him as the father who fixed their bikes and planned family camping trips, seemed sad and puzzled, as if no longer certain about who he was.

In the days immediately following the insurrection, the country seemed almost unified in agreement that what had happened at the Capitol was violent and dark. “The violence, destruction, and chaos we saw earlier was unacceptable, undemocratic, and un-American,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor just hours after the attack had subsided, adding that January 6 was “the saddest day I've ever had serving as a member of this institution.” The next week, the House voted to impeach Trump, and in February the Senate voted 57–43 to convict him, with seven Republicans joining all 50 Democrats in finding him guilty of “incitement of insurrection.” Although this fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction, polls showed that a clear majority of Americans believed Trump bore responsibility for the insurrection. He was effectively banned from all the major social-media platforms, and large corporations declared that they would no longer make financial contributions to politicians who had supported Trump's election lies. Even the longtime Republican kingmaker Rupert Murdoch, who was then the chair of Fox Corporation, declared, in an email to one of his former executives, “We want to make Trump a non person.” The president seemed to be heading toward political exile, his election claims destined to be inscribed in history as treasonous lies.

But within hours of the attack on the Capitol, an alternative narrative was already forming. On her show the evening of January 6, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham wondered aloud whether antifa sympathizers had infiltrated the crowd. Before long, a chorus of conservative-media personalities, far-right lawmakers, and family members of rioters was suggesting that the reports of savagery had been overblown; that the events of that day had been more peaceful protest than violent insurrection; that the real insurrection had been on November 3, when the election was stolen.

By March, Trump was telling Ingraham live on Fox News that the crowd had posed “zero threat right from the start” and that protesters had been “hugging and kissing” the police. By the fall, Trump and other prominent MAGA figures were regularly referring to the rioters turned defendants as “patriots” and “political hostages.” January 6, Trump would later say, was “a day of love.” News clips featured residents of the “Patriot Pod,” a unit at the D.C. jail that housed January 6 defendants, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” every night—and before long, Trump was playing a recording of their rendition at the start of his political rallies. On his Fox News show a year after the insurrection, Tucker Carlson said, “January 6 barely rates as a footnote. Really not a lot happened that day, if you think about it.” Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, has said, “The whole thing was a nefarious agenda to entrap MAGA Americans.” Shortly after the first anniversary of January 6, Trump mentioned the possibility of pardoning the defendants if he were reelected. By March 2024, during the presidential campaign, he was saying that one of his first acts in office would be to “free the January 6 Hostages”; in December of that year, after he won the election, he said he would issue the pardons on his “first day.”

From his cell in Texas, Webster tried to tune out news about the election, the potential pardons, and the J6ers generally, not wanting to get his hopes up. Had the country remained coalesced around the accurate original understanding of January 6—that American citizens had been lied to about the 2020 election by the president and had attempted to sack the Capitol partly at his instigation—Webster might have been forced into a reckoning. Instead, he'd been presented with a more appealing framing that squared better with his view of himself as a patriot and a good person: He and other Americans had gone to Washington simply to petition their government about questionable election results and, while there, had been baited by antifa or undercover federal agents into storming the Capitol. This, in turn, reinforced Webster's own initial claim about his fight with the MPD cop—that Rathbun had provoked the encounter by striking him in the head, then lied about it to counter Webster's righteous assertion of self-defense, resulting in his wrongful conviction.

When Trump officially announced another run for president, in November 2022, it solidified everything Webster believed about Trump—that he was a fighter, that he loved America, that he would not be cowed. Despite all that the government had done to Trump, including impeaching him twice, the ex-president remained unyielding.

On Election Night in November 2024, Webster sat in the prison television room, watching the results. By the time he returned to his cell for the inmate head count at 9 p.m., Florida had been called for Trump. Webster spent the next few hours lying on his bunk in the dark, listening to the radio as newscasters called North Carolina for Trump, then Georgia, then Pennsylvania, then the election. Webster drifted off to sleep, full of hope.

For the next few weeks, he wondered whether Trump would keep his word about pardoning the J6ers on his first day back in office. He worried that Trump might pardon only some of the 1,600 defendants, and not the supposedly violent ones like him. Or maybe Trump would wait until the end of his term, to avoid any political heat. For Webster, that would mean continuing to languish in prison for years.

On Inauguration Day, Webster was anxious. He watched the ceremonies for a few hours, then went back to his cell to rest. Later that evening, a prison guard called out: “Webster! Get down to the lieutenant's office right now.” Just before midnight, he stepped into the cold Texas night, a free man.

From the February 2026 issue: Jeffrey Goldberg on Donald Trump's inexcusable pardons

The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., requires nearly all of its 3,200 officers to work inaugurations, typically one of the longest and most boring days of their career; many calculate how close they are to retirement by how many more inaugurations they still have to work.

In January of last year, hundreds of MPD officers who had been at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, were working to safeguard Donald Trump's second inauguration. To Officer Daniel Hodges, the experience was surreal: The last time he'd seen so many people wearing MAGA hats, they'd been trying to kill him.

On that day five years ago, Hodges had reported for duty at sunrise as part of a civil-disturbance unit, CDU 42. The group (25 officers, four sergeants, and one lieutenant) was specially trained in riot tactics: how to deploy large canisters of chemical spray; how to shoot rubber bullets from 40-millimeter launchers; how to perform extractions—fast, targeted operations to remove people from danger. But on that day, January 6, platoon members looked like typical patrol officers, standing in navy-blue uniforms along the blocks of Constitution Avenue leading to the Ellipse, where Trump was holding his rally. Supervisors had not authorized them to wear riot gear, which was stashed in nearby vans, or carry munitions. They'd been told that their assignment was simply to be visible.

Hodges watched the crowd flow by, noting that a significant number wore tactical gear such as helmets, goggles, and ballistic vests—not the sort of accoutrements people typically wear to peaceably listen to speeches. Around 11 a.m., a large crowd began streaming back toward the Capitol. Around 1 p.m., the U.S. Capitol Police summoned MPD for help; protesters were attacking officers, crashing through barricades, and climbing scaffolding that had been erected in advance of the inauguration. An MPD commander ordered CDU 42 to the Capitol for backup.

A little after 1:30 p.m., Hodges and other officers stood outside their vans putting on hard-shell protective pads that covered their shoulders, shins, and other bones. They listened as a veteran MPD commander at the Capitol began to sound more desperate over the police radio. Officers, some not yet in full gear, rushed into two scout cars and four vans, and sped toward the Capitol. Only two officers had managed to pull on their protective coveralls, stretchy black suits that look like onesies and shield them from flames and chemical spray.

On the northwest side of the Capitol, Hodges and other officers arranged themselves in a two-column formation as a sergeant called out orders: “Shields down! Cameras on!” As they marched toward the Capitol, Hodges noted that his platoon mates, who had worked many protests together, were grim and silent, as if nervous about what they were about to encounter. Many had never worked at the Capitol and had no idea where to go. An officer on the scene led them toward the West Terrace. As they drew closer, a loud roar filled the air. Taking in the crowd, Hodges saw that police officers were preposterously outnumbered. Each put a hand on the shoulder of the officer in front of them, and they marched into the dense, roiling horde, so thick that the two columns were forced to collapse into a single line. Soon the scene devolved into individual battles between officers and rioters.

One rioter tried to rip the baton from Hodges's hand as he took blows from all sides. Another man, who wore a ballistic vest that bulged with thick protective plates, as if prepared for heavy gunfire, asked, “Are you my brother?” Another said, “You will die on your knees.” A rioter who'd climbed up scaffolding tossed down something heavy, hitting Hodges in the head. Another man tried to take Hodges's baton and they fell to the ground, the man kicking Hodges in the chest as they wrestled. Hodges managed to hang on to his baton but then found himself on all fours, surrounded by the mob, terrified that he would soon be torn apart.

With the help of colleagues who materialized around him, Hodges managed to stand back up, and he and other platoon members fought their way through the crowd, arriving at the police line in various states of dishevelment. They joined other officers on the West Terrace and tried to keep the crowd at bay. Standing there, Hodges struggled to take in a scene of jarring dissonance: someone waving a flag with Trump's head atop Rambo's body; the steady, warlike pounding of a single drum; one angry protester demanding, “I want to speak to a supervisor!” The absolute entitlement of these people, Hodges thought. As minutes passed, Hodges felt as if he could feel the shift and flow of the crowd's energy, a push of aggression followed by an unsteady lull. A man appeared before Hodges and shouted, “Do you think your little peashooter guns are going to stop this crowd?” Hodges scanned people's hands for guns and knives, trying to calculate when and whether to use force, how to use just enough to stop the crowd but not inflame it, how any action he took might look later on video.

Horrified, he watched the crowd burst through the police line. An MPD commander shouted over the radio: “We've lost the line! All MPD, pull back!” Two men pushed Hodges against a wall; one man reached beneath his protective visor and dug into his right eye with his thumb. Hodges cried out in pain, and managed to shake the man off before his eye was permanently damaged.

Standing near the steps of the Capitol, trying to hold back the marauders, Hodges felt that the job was futile: He would fight off one man, and another 20 would appear. Hodges retreated with other officers inside the building. A high-ranking MPD commander, Ramey Kyle, called out, “It's gonna be old-school CDU”—civil-disturbance unit—“if they come in those doors, do you hear me?” Officers took that to mean that this was no time for the reform-minded policing of recent years; this fight would be hard and violent. “We are not losing the U.S. Capitol today!” Kyle shouted.

Another officer called out for Hodges's platoon: “42, come on!” Bracing himself to rejoin the battle, Hodges headed toward the Lower West Terrace tunnel, arriving at a dark concrete hallway about 10 feet wide. There, Hodges saw a few dozen officers in a haze of smoke—rows of four or five stacked shoulder to shoulder—struggling to hold off the hundreds of protesters who'd already breached two sets of doors. Behind those hundreds, thousands more swarmed. The officers believed theirs to be the last line of defense protecting the Capitol. They didn't know that rioters had already entered the building on the northwest side.

Police and the mass of protesters battled for inches. The attackers swayed back and forth, their bodies working as battering rams. The crowd, Hodges realized, had itself become a weapon. When officers got injured or succumbed to exhaustion or pepper spray, they would fall back, other officers stepping forward to take their place in the fray. As officers around him fell, Hodges pressed to the front of the line. The other side was doing the same, calling out, “We need fresh patriots up here.” Unlike the police, though, the protesters seemed to have an infinite number of replacements.

Hodges had worked many protests, particularly during the long summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd. In his experience, when demonstrations turned violent, the violence itself was the point, serving as catharsis and release. But this crowd had a singular goal—to get inside the Capitol. Only a handful of exhausted cops, Hodges among them, stood in the breach.

Hodges braced himself against a metal door frame to his right. But as soon as he got situated, the momentum shifted. The crowd shouted “Heave, ho!” and pushed toward the officers, pinning Hodges against the door frame. He felt the hard plastic of a police shield that rioters had stolen pressing into his other side.

A video—which would soon be viewed by millions of people around the world—captured what happened next. Hodges was trapped, his whole body getting crushed. His arms hung uselessly at his sides. He effectively could not move his legs. A man wrapped his hand around Hodges's gas mask, violently shoving it back and forth and then ripping it off, shouting what sounded like “How do you like me now, fucker?” As Hodges stood there, scared and vulnerable, the man grabbed his baton and bashed him on the head with it, rupturing his lip and smashing his skull. The video focused on Hodges's face, his mouth bloody as he struggled to breathe. Fearing that he would soon collapse and be dragged into the crowd, Hodges did the only thing he could—he screamed for help.

Most cops have hero dreams, protector fantasies that sustain them through days that are mostly mundane. The video of Hodges crying out plaintively is the antithesis of how a cop wants to be seen. In the ensuing days and years, Hodges has had to come to terms with that helplessness. He'd bravely advanced to the front of the police line, but in the end, he'd needed rescuing. Like so many people whose lives have been defined by seconds of video from that day, Hodges doesn't like the story his tells. But he has accepted it, because it's what happened. Over time, he has learned to laugh when friends joke about how he got his ass kicked on January 6. But the seriousness of his predicament, how close he came to blindness or maybe death, remains ever near; he can still feel the man's fingers crawling up his cheek toward his eye.

A little after 4 p.m., Trump finally submitted to the multiple entreaties from members of Congress, the vice president, and many others and recorded a video telling the protesters to go home. “We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side,” he said. “But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.” He continued: “There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us—from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home.” National Guardsmen and other reinforcements finally began to arrive. At 6:01 p.m., Trump tweeted: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”

Though the Capitol had been breached and defiled, and the certification proceedings interrupted, police officers like Hodges—and Noah Rathbun; and Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who saved lawmakers by redirecting a group of marauders away from the Senate chamber; and Capitol Police Lieutenant Michael Byrd, who in shooting Ashli Babbitt potentially stopped what would have been a surge of rioters toward the House chamber, where members of Congress were hiding—had held off enough of the mob for long enough that no legislators were killed or badly injured. The proceedings could resume, allowing the transfer of power to Joe Biden two weeks later.

Hodges and his fellow CDU 42 officers stayed in the Capitol Crypt until late that night, sitting cross-legged and leaning against columns, nursing their wounds. They were battered and exhausted, but would have fought again if they had to, he told me.

In the years that followed, Hodges testified in court at his attackers' criminal trials and sentencing hearings. He believed it was important that they face consequences. He told one judge that he wasn't a vengeful person; he just wanted what was fair. Two of his attackers from the tunnel, Patrick McCaughey III and Steven Cappuccio, were convicted of multiple felony counts and sentenced to roughly seven years each in prison. The man who dug into his eye, Clifford Mackrell, pleaded guilty to assaulting officers and was sentenced to 27 months.

In November 2024, when Americans reelected Trump, Hodges felt a deep sense of grief. During 11 years of policing, he'd seen people do terrible things to one another—shootings, stabbings, maimings. But the election results strained his faith in humanity more than any of that. After all Trump has done? Hodges thought. After all we know about him? His friend Harry Dunn, a former Capitol Police officer who'd been called “nigger” for the first time while in uniform on January 6, later said that seeing the 2024 election unfold was like watching the end of Titanic : You knew what was coming, but it still hurt to watch. Both Dunn and Hodges long ago grew tired of talk about the “shifting narrative” of January 6. “Ain't no narrative,” Dunn likes to say. “Play the tape.”

As Hodges worked the inauguration in January 2025, he surveyed the legions of happy people in MAGA hats. The scene befuddled him. “It was just very baffling to me, how we'd gotten to this point, after everything we'd been through, that people saw fit to vote for him again,” he said. The assembled Trump supporters, none of whom seemed to recognize Hodges, may not have been thinking about the chaos of January 6, 2021, but he was. He thinks about it every day. His physical injuries have healed, but his psychic ones have not; he has PTSD symptoms and has been diagnosed with depression. When Hodges returned home from the inauguration that night and read about the pardons, he wasn't surprised. He tried to wrap his mind around the idea of another four years of Trump, and around the incongruity of a so-called law-and-order president, hours into his second term, pardoning people who had attacked cops with weapons that included knives, Tasers, bear spray, pepper spray, lumber, bicycle racks, a cattle prod, a sledgehammer, a ladder, a flagpole, a baseball bat, a hockey stick, and a fire extinguisher.

How could this happen in a democracy, propelled by the leaders of a political party that professed to “back the blue”? It was even harder to understand how so many police officers still supported Trump. The Fraternal Order of Police, the profession's largest union, had endorsed him for a third time in 2024. Certainly there was blame to go around, Hodges believed. He put some of that on Democrats, who'd all but abandoned police after Floyd's killing.

Still, Hodges hoped that there would be some nuance in who received pardons. There was not. Trump did not weigh each case like Solomon: He issued full pardons to almost all of the 1,600 people charged in connection with the insurrection. Of those, about 600 had been charged with resisting arrest or assaulting officers, 175 of them with dangerous or deadly weapons. No matter how big their sin, no matter what all of those judges and juries had decided, almost everyone was just—poof—forgiven. The only (partial) exceptions were the 14 members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys whose sentences Trump commuted, meaning they were released from prison but their convictions were not erased.

After the government spent tens of millions of dollars on what the Department of Justice said was one of the largest and most complex investigations in the country's history, Trump erased it all at a stroke. Roughly 1,000 people had accepted culpability and pleaded guilty. “No,” Trump's pardons declared, “you're not guilty.” Another 250 people had taken their cases to trial. Only four were acquitted of all charges, according to NPR; the rest were found guilty by judge or jury on at least some counts. Nearly 500 defendants awaited trials or sentencing in 2025. “Anyone who spent any time working on Jan. 6 cases saw how violent a day that was,” Mike Romano, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted some of those cases, told The New York Times recently. “It's incredibly demoralizing to see something you worked on for four years wiped away by a lie—I mean the idea that prosecution of the rioters was a grave national injustice. We had strong evidence against every person we prosecuted.”

Hodges has watched as the January 6 defendants have been not merely forgiven but extolled, telling their persecution stories at Republican fundraisers as donors snack on meatball platters and charcuterie boards. Sometimes he can't believe the lengths to which Trump will go to rewrite the history of that day: It was not an insurrection, but a “day of love.” The J6ers were not insurrectionists, traitors, and miscreants but patriots, heroes, and innocents. Hodges worries about the fact that Trump has ordered the Smithsonian to review all of its exhibits in order to “restore truth and sanity.” (One former Capitol Police officer told me that he'd donated the boots he'd worn on January 6 to the Smithsonian, hoping they'd be included in a future exhibit—now he fears they'll be tossed.)

Though other cops sometimes accuse them of grandstanding, of seeking money or fame, Hodges and Dunn and a few others have continued to speak about what happened to them on January 6, because they believe it's important to prevent history from being rewritten. “If people would just admit what happened that day, we wouldn't have to keep telling our stories,” Hodges said. But the efforts of Trump and others to falsify the story, he added, have kept him “tragically relevant.” (Outside of court, many cops have not spoken publicly about their experiences on January 6, including Rathbun.) Hodges says this should not be a partisan issue. He would have defended Trump if he had been attacked at his second inauguration—just as, he says, he would defend the Capitol against an attack by a Democratic mob. “The second a Democratic president tries to hold on to power illegally, I will go after them hard,” he told me. “Until such a time, there's only one person who's done that.”

Recently, I told Hodges that I'd been interviewing Tom Webster about January 6. Hodges vaguely remembered the story about the former NYPD cop who'd assaulted one of his colleagues. When I told him that Webster still believed that the 2020 election may have been stolen, Hodges was not surprised. He doesn't think people like Webster will stop lying to themselves anytime soon. “They can't,” Hodges said; the cognitive dissonance and moral pain would be too great.

Accepting reality would mean reevaluating everything they thought they knew—that their actions were ethical and justified, that they are great patriots. Accepting the truth of January 6 would require coming to grips with the fact that they supported a con man and participated in a violent plot to subvert democracy. The immediate reward for undertaking this kind of hard self-examination would mainly be shame and regret.

“To grapple with these truths would, in a very real way, unmake them,” Hodges said.

After Thomas Webster was released from prison on January 20, 2025, having served a little more than two years of his 10-year sentence, he went home to a house he'd never seen and a group of people he'd never met. His wife, Michelle, had moved to Mississippi, where members of a church and a J6 support group had adopted her. They brought dinner and a cake to celebrate Webster's return.

He worried that he'd struggle to readjust, but he quickly felt at home. He and Michelle, married for 25 years, had some bumps as they dealt with the damage from that day—social, financial, logistical—but he told me they've gotten past those. Webster mourns all that he missed—teaching his youngest son how to drive, moving his middle child into her college dorm, watching his oldest daughter graduate from boot camp. Interactions with his wife's family remain strained; to this day, no one has told 99-year-old Nana that Webster was in prison.

Webster and his wife bought a one-story ranch house, 20 acres in the middle of nowhere. He likes living in Mississippi, where he feels farther from the reach of government and politics. Not long ago, when his daughter called him for help with a flat tire and he was able to drive out to her with a patch kit, he felt grateful to Trump for the pardon that allowed him to do that.

Over time, Webster has opened up, telling the people he's gotten to know at the Toccopola Grocery, an old country store with checkered red-and-white tablecloths and vintage Coca-Cola signs, what he's been through. He sent them a video about his case, one of the few that he thought rendered his story accurately—that he'd gone to petition his government peacefully and had been assaulted by an aggressive cop. Webster can't determine if they believe him or not but, unlike some folks back in New York, they seem open-minded. “Ain't our place to judge,” they say to him.

Webster remains frustrated that the full story of January 6, in his view, has yet to be told. Trump freed him and his fellow patriots from physical prison, Webster told me, “but we're not truly free until people know the truth.”

When I asked Webster what the truth is, he said he believes that the 2020 election was probably stolen. (About a third of Americans share this belief, even though no credible evidence has ever emerged to support the claim, and dozens of courts have rejected it.) He believes that the federal government made an organized effort to entrap Trump's biggest supporters on January 6. And he believes that, in pursuing the J6 defendants so mercilessly, the government attempted to silence them, by terrifying them and other conservatives across the country.

Webster has filed a petition to the court asking that it vacate his conviction, arguing that crucial facts were not known during his trial that could have led to him being found not guilty. Even though he's now been pardoned, Webster told me he felt it was important to document his entire story for the record, preserving it for future generations to consider during “more stable times.”

I pointed out to Webster that he had apologized to Officer Rathbun in court. Wasn't that a concession that he'd acted wrongly on January 6? In response, Webster said that, although he feels “bad about how the whole day went down,” his apology should not be taken as an admission of guilt: “I was pressured by my lawyer to apologize. He said it would help me reduce my sentence.”

Webster is disappointed by where things stand now: With Trump in office and MAGA conservatives in power, they finally have the ability to prove what happened that day—so why aren't they? When Dan Bongino was a podcaster, he repeatedly asserted that undercover agents embedded in the crowd had helped orchestrate January 6; now that Trump has made him deputy director of the FBI, why isn't Bongino releasing the evidence? Webster feels similarly disappointed in FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi. “Why are you guys always bragging about arresting illegal Mexicans doing roof work?” he asked. He wonders why they're not instead exposing the plots of the deep state, as Trump has demanded. Webster believes that Bongino and Patel have become polluted by the same swamp that Trump has again and again vowed to clean up.

Webster says he barely recognizes the version of himself who drove to D.C. five years ago. Who was that man filled with so much bravado that he thought he could save the country? His days of charging into the fray are over, he said. Sometimes he feels guilty about the life he has now. So many of the J6 defendants have been divorced by their wives, disowned by their kids, fired from their jobs. By Webster's count, at least five have died by suicide. Yet he still views Trump as the best hope for cleaning out the deep state. “He's the one person I still kind of believe in,” Webster said.

Recently, he was asked to speak at an event with other J6 defendants. He'd felt fine as he'd approached the podium, full of thoughts to share. But as he stood onstage, he was overcome with emotion. Scenes from that day flashed through his mind: the cop with the gas mask. The feel of the flagpole in his hand. Their tug-of-war. His own rage.

As Webster looked out at the members of the crowd, he thought they'd probably Google him when they got home. Which video clip would they find? he wondered—would it tell the right story or the wrong one? Would they see him as a felon or a patriot? Which truth would they believe?

On his way home, Webster told his wife that he wouldn't speak at any more events. Reliving what they'd been through was too painful. And he didn't see much point until the whole story was revealed. So he waits for the truth to solidify into something firm enough to stand on, a day he fears may never come.

A leading vaccine expert on what the country's newly overhauled immunization schedule means for children

Of all the diseases that the U.S. government announced today that it will no longer recommend vaccines against, rotavirus is by no means the deadliest. Not all children develop substantial symptoms; most of those who do experience a few days of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, and then get better. In the early 1970s, when no rotavirus vaccines were available and most children could expect to be sickened with the virus at least once by the end of toddlerhood, Paul Offit considered it to be no big deal, relatively speaking. In this country especially, rotavirus “was an illness from which children recovered,” he told me.

That perception shifted abruptly during Offit's pediatric residency training, when he saw hundreds of severe rotavirus cases admitted to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh each year. Although plenty of children weathered the infection largely without bad symptoms, others vomited so profusely that they struggled to keep down the fluids they desperately needed. Offit can still recall the nine-month-old he treated in the late 1970s who was hospitalized after her mother had struggled to feed her sufficient fluids at home. The infant was so severely dehydrated that Offit and his colleagues couldn't find a vein in which to insert an IV; as a last resort, they attempted to drill a needle into her bone marrow to hydrate her. “We failed,” Offit told me. “And then I was the one who had to go out to the waiting room to tell this mom of a little girl who had been previously healthy two days earlier that her child had died.”

Within a few years, Offit had partnered with several other scientists and begun to develop a rotavirus vaccine. Their oral immunization, called RotaTeq and delivered as a series of sugar-sweet drops to infants, would ultimately be licensed in 2006. Today, it remains one of the two main rotavirus vaccines available to American children. Offit is now a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where, he told me, “most residents have never seen an inpatient with rotavirus-induced dehydration”—thanks in large part to the country's deployment of rotavirus vaccines, which reaches about 70 percent of U.S. children each year.

Now, though, the United States' rotavirus shield stands to fracture. Today, the Trump administration overhauled the nation's childhood vaccination schedule, shrinking from 17 to 11 the number of immunizations it broadly recommends to all American kids. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said in a statement today. Among the vaccines clipped—including immunizations against hepatitis A, meningitis, and influenza—is the rotavirus vaccine, which the administration frames as more of a personal choice, allowable under consultation with a health-care provider but not essential, because the virus poses “almost no risk of either mortality or chronic morbidity.” Experts suspect that vaccination rates will plummet in response. If they do, rates of diarrheal disease are likely to quickly roar back, Virginia Pitzer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Yale, told me. (The administration's nod to international consensus is tenuous at best; rotavirus also remains the leading cause of diarrheal death among young children worldwide.)

In an email, Andrew Nixon, HHS's deputy assistant secretary for media relations, defended today's decision as “based on a rigorous review of evidence and gold standard science, not claims from individuals with a financial stake in maintaining universal recommendations.” (Offit, who is a co-patent holder on RotaTeq, did profit from his invention but sold his interest in the vaccine more than 15 years ago and does not currently receive royalties from its sale.)

I called Offit to discuss the federal backtracking on the vaccine he once helped bring to market, and what the loss of protection will mean for future generations. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Katherine J. Wu: Rotavirus was once a disease that hospitalized up to 70,000 children each year. Since the arrival of the vaccine you co-invented, as well as another two years later, those rates have plummeted. What was it like to see a vaccine you helped develop have that sort of impact?

Paul Offit: I remember a meeting at Merck [the company that manufactured the vaccine] when they revealed the results of our big Phase 3 trial. [The presenter] showed the data, that it clearly was safe, in 70,000 children. And it was like 95 percent effective at preventing severe illness. She showed a map of the world, with Asia, Africa, Latin America studded with black dots, and each black dot represented 1,000 deaths. She said, “Now we have in hand the technology to prevent this.” Then she showed a picture of a map of the world where all those black dots were gone. And she put her head down, shoulders going up and down, and wept.

The vaccine was taken up relatively quickly, I think in large part because it was an oral vaccine and that is perceived as less difficult than a child getting a shot. To go from 1980 to 2006, and to start to see the incidence of the disease decline, it was just an amazing feeling.

Wu: What will it mean for this vaccine to no longer be recommended by the federal government?

Offit: My wife's in private practice in pediatrics, and there certainly were many parents who she saw who were hesitant about getting vaccines. And I think it's more convincing when you can say, “Look, this is a recommended vaccine. This is something that the CDC, the major public-health agency in this country, believes is important for your child to receive.” You can't really say that now. And if you get rotavirus in early childhood, you have a chance of being one of those 70,000 children [who were hospitalized] before there was a vaccine.

Some diseases, you need to build up a susceptible population, like measles, which we eliminated from this country. That's not true for viruses like rotavirus, flu, RSV. The virus is always circulating. So if you choose not to get a vaccine, you are at risk, because you may come in contact with that virus. So if there's a fairly rapid erosion in vaccine rates, I think you would immediately see children suffering a preventable illness.

Wu: In a decision memo addressed to the acting director of the CDC, top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services downplayed the virus's threat to American children and suggested that the decrease in rotavirus deaths that followed the approval of RotaTeq and another vaccine called Rotarix may instead have been attributable to factors “unrelated to the vaccine, including improved medical care, changes in diagnostic practices, or random fluctuations.” I'm curious what you make of that justification. Were there other reasons rotavirus might have been among the six vaccines targeted?

Offit: A phrase like almost no mortality—really? So the 20 to 60 children who died every year of rotavirus in this country, that's okay? One child dying is too many, especially if you can safely prevent it. So I don't agree with that.

Sure, right now the morbidity is low because of the vaccine, and certainly the mortality is largely gone because of the vaccine. We are once again exposing children unnecessarily to harm. There's no advantage to this. There were 70,000 hospitalizations a year, which was not trivial, and virtually eliminating them was one of the major successes for vaccines in this country. And I don't understand why you would ever back off that success.

I also just never imagined we would ever get to a time when the CDC, the nation's No. 1 public-health agency, and the ACIP, which was a group of outside expert advisers who went through the science and made best recommendations, would get to the point where it was basically not a scientific organization anymore. It's an organization run by an anti-vaccine activist who was a science denialist and conspiracy theorist. I mean, that's where we are now. We don't have the CDC anymore. We don't have an ACIP anymore. I certainly never imagined that. [Editor's note: Kennedy has an established history of anti-vaccine activism and of embracing conspiracy theories. Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, did not offer further comment on this criticism.]

Wu: This actually isn't the first time that a rotavirus vaccine has lost a government endorsement. The U.S.'s first rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, was taken off the market in 1999 after officials detected a rare intestinal-blockage complication. How does the current situation compare? Was there a safety reason to make current rotavirus vaccines less accessible to the public?

Offit: I was actually on the ACIP when that happened. [Editor's note: Offit was no longer on the ACIP when his own vaccine was voted on.] The [rare side effect was] quickly picked up, and the vaccine was off the market within a little over a year. We care about vaccine safety. It depends on which paper you read, but anywhere from one in 10,000 to one in 30,000 children developed [the blockage]. You were still at greater risk of being hospitalized and dying from rotavirus, but the decision was made to take it off the market.

Wu: What do you think will be the future of the rotavirus vaccine you helped develop and bring to market, and watched help reshape the portrait of diarrheal disease in this country?

Offit: The American Academy of Pediatrics will certainly still recommend it. But younger pediatricians may be less compelled to offer this vaccine, because they didn't experience this disease when they were in training. But I think what they hopefully realize is that this virus continues to circulate. It's still out there. And the lower immunization rates, even a little, will cause children to suffer unnecessarily.

Inside the courtroom with Nicolás Maduro

Nicolás Maduro wasn't due to arrive at his arraignment yesterday in downtown Manhattan until noon, but a large crowd had already formed outside the federal courthouse by 9 a.m. Actually, two crowds. One had come to tell Donald Trump to keep his hands off Venezuela. The other, which seemed largely Venezuelan, had come to celebrate.

Maduro was, until Saturday, a widely hated ruler. His last election campaign consisted of threatening his people with a “bloodbath” if he lost. (Even so, he lost, but he claimed victory anyway.) The two crowds outside the courthouse mirrored the split reaction following Maduro's capture by the United States. For many international observers, his ouster was cause for alarm—a sign that a U.S. president can drop bombs abroad and kidnap a foreign leader without a declaration of war or congressional approval. But for so many Venezuelans, the sight of Maduro in shackles was about a tyrant facing justice.

Before the hearing began, the hallway outside the courtroom was packed with people hoping to get a seat. Some were law students who had come because they sensed that a legal precedent was being set, though not necessarily a good one. The way Maduro was captured “puts the system of international law in danger,” Leo Enderle, a German student at NYU, told me. Another group of people had come for the sheer spectacle. The man standing in front of me said he had attended the arraignments of Sean Combs and Donald Trump in the same building; according to him, this crowd was just as big. When I arrived, he was outraged that a Venezuelan man had cut in line to join a friend. The Venezuelan explained that he had been a political prisoner for years and had dreamed of this moment. Just because you were a political prisoner, the man in front of me was lamenting, doesn't mean you get to cut the line.

Read: The Venezuelan opposition's desperate gamble

But by far the largest group of attendees I spoke with were Venezuelans who wanted to see Maduro punished. The last time I had stood in line with so many Venezuelans angry at Maduro was in 2013, when I still lived in the country, in one of the infamous breadlines that resulted from rationing. Then, like now, people were very talkative. At the courthouse, an elegantly dressed woman from Caracas told me she had left her newborn granddaughter at home with a nanny. “This historical moment, I couldn't miss it!”

David Cardenas, a Venezuelan opposition activist, told me that Maduro had singled him out on TV one day, threatening to send police to his house and jail him as part of “Operation Knock-Knock.” Soon after, Cardenas, who lives in the United States, posted a video saying Maduro would be the target of Operation Trump-Trump. “I guess Trump-Trump came before Knock-Knock,” Cardenas told me with a smile.

Elsewhere in line, a young woman I'll call Maria had come to the courthouse with her mother, who was visiting from Venezuela for the holidays. (She asked me to withhold her name for privacy concerns.) Maria told me that nobody she knew in America could understand why she was excited to see Maduro arrested: “My friends are like, ‘This is imperialism!' and ‘So sorry Trump did this to your country!'” When one of her housemates told her they were thinking of going to protest Maduro's capture, Maria responded that not every prisoner deserves sympathy.

After we were seated in the courtroom, Maduro walked in, escorted by guards. Instead of his usual button-down, he wore a navy-blue T-shirt, with an orange one peeking out from underneath. Maduro scanned the audience as though he were looking for a friendly face, but he didn't seem to find one. “Buenos días,” he said to no one in particular, and sat down.

Read: The biggest question about Venezuela

“Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked.

Maduro responded in Spanish, as he would throughout the hearing. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros, the constitutional president of Venezuela,” he said, and went on to explain that he'd been kidnapped by the United States. He called himself a “prisoner of war.” Visibly impatient, the judge suggested that Maduro should respond with a simple yes or no. “Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked again. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” he responded.

The judge then read the charges aloud: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and two others related to weapons. Maduro pleaded not guilty, adding, “I'm a decent man and still the president of Venezuela.” Once again, the judge told Maduro to keep his answers succinct, before addressing Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, who was sitting nearby wearing the same outfit.

The judge told Maduro that, as a foreigner facing trial in the United States, he had the right to consulate resources. But Maduro himself had effectively closed Venezuela's consulates when he recalled the country's diplomats from the United States in 2019, leaving more than half a million people without representation. It's unclear, then, exactly what resources Maduro will have access to.

As the hearing finished and Maduro stood to leave, spectators jeered at him in Spanish, a liberty that—had they taken it in Venezuela just last week—would probably have landed them in prison, or worse. “Have fun in jail,” one said. “On behalf of all Venezuelans, you will pay,” shouted another. One woman was even more blunt: “Damn you.”

After Venezuela, how far could Trump really go?

After illegally invading Venezuela — and capturing its dictatorial leader — President Donald Trump is threatening to launch similar attacks against a wide array of countries.

On Sunday, the president reiterated his belief that the United States must annex Greenland, since its waters are “covered with Russian and Chinese ships.” He further declared that the US may take military action against Colombia, as its president “has cocaine mills and cocaine factories.” Mexico may also warrant a bombing, Trump suggested, in light of its failure to police its cartels. And he also warned Iran's authoritarian regime that, if it starts killing the protestors who've recently amassed in its streets, “they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.”

Of course, the president says a lot of things. If Trump's words were a perfect guide to US policy, America would currently be governing the Gaza Strip.

Therefore, until this weekend, it seemed safe to assume that the president's most outlandish military threats were mere bluster. Now that he has greenlit the overthrow of a foreign leader, who had ordered no attack against the United States, it is hard to be so sure.

Yet, there is one big reason to think that, in military terms, Trump's bark still exceeds his bite.

Before turning to the causes for doubts about America storming the beaches of Greenland, it's worth noting why the world is suddenly taking such scenarios seriously.

Since the beginning of his first term, Trump's acts of war have grown steadily more audacious. In 2020, he ordered the assasination of Iran's top military official; in April, he ordered large-scale air strikes against that nation's nuclear facilities; now, he has deposed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, a sitting head of state, killing at least 80 people in the process.

In each of these cases, Trump ignored warnings that his actions could sow chaos and instability — if not all-out war. And in every instance, the intervention's immediate costs to the United States appeared lower than skeptics had predicted.

It is clear that this pattern of events has emboldened Trump. In an interview with Fox News Sunday night, he hailed his own operation in Venezuela as “incredible” and said that “we have to do it again. We can do it again, too. Nobody can stop us.”

Given Trump's words and deeds, the world should prepare for the US to deploy military force more frequently — and perhaps, ambitiously — in the coming years.

Certainly, the president has shown that neither international nor constitutional law constrains his martial ambitions. And he insists that America has a right to “dominate” the Western Hemisphere and seize the resource wealth of weaker nations.

Yet, the president still appears bound by the primary constraint on American war-making since the invasion of Iraq: the US public's low tolerance for American casualties.

Trump has yet to order a novel military operation with a substantial American death toll. No US troops died in the course of assassinating Iran's Major General Qasem Soleimani or bombing its nuclear sites, nor did any Americans perish in the raid on Maduro's palace.

And the desire to avoid US casualties appeared to structure American policy in all of these cases. Iran responded to both the killing of Soleimani and bombing of its nuclear facilities by firing ballistic missiles at American airbases in the Middle East. When these failed to kill any US soldiers, Trump declined to return fire, evidently to avoid further escalation.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, the US has evidently decided to leave Maduro's party in power, rather than hazard the sustained military occupation necessary to displace that authoritarian regime.

Such restraint is politically wise. Even in the absence of American bloodshed, public support for Trump's operation in Venezuela remains tepid, with just 33 percent of voters approving of the strike in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The typical American does not perceive any compelling national interest in Venezuela being governed by one leftist dictator they've never heard of rather than some other one. Had any US troops died in Caracas, political opposition to Trump's adventurism would surely be orders of magnitude more intense.

The American public's aversion to US military deaths can be seen in the trajectory of Joe Biden's presidency. Although inflation corroded Biden's popularity, his approval initially collapsed amid America's bloody withdrawal from Afghanistan, which claimed the lives of 13 American servicemembers. Trump is well aware of the damage that this did to Biden; the Republican attended an anniversary memorial for those fallen soldiers in the heat of the 2024 campaign.

The backlash to American deaths from an invasion of Greenland or Colombia would likely be even more intense. After all, voters had actually supported withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan before it happened. By contrast, few Americans want to buy Greenland, let alone conquer it.

Of course, there is still no guarantee that Trump will steer clear of a major war. It is impossible for even the most judicious leaders to perfectly anticipate the consequences of their military operations; conflicts can escalate. And Trump is not known for rigorously thinking through all of his policy decisions.

Moreover, even if Trump is unwilling to shed much American blood in service of his imperial fantasies, he could still reap a lot of death and chaos. Given our nation's drone fleet and aerial might, Trump need not sacrifice many US soldiers to destabilize entire countries.

Yet, there are limits on what even a great power can achieve militarily without forfeiting its soldiers in large numbers. America probably can't conquer Greenland — or cause genuine regime change throughout South America — without accepting a great many flag-draped coffins. And Trump still has not indicated that this is something he's prepared to do.

On the ground in Venezuela after Trump's attack.

In the wake of a US military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, an atmosphere of uncertainty has settled on the South American country.

Maduro, who appeared in a US federal courtroom in New York today, is in US custody. Meanwhile, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has stepped up to be Venezuela's interim leader — and has already received fresh threats from President Donald Trump if she refuses to comply with US guidance.

Amid the tumult, how are people in Venezuela feeling? Ana Vanessa Herrero, a reporter based in Caracas, says that the mood among Venezuelans has been something of a mixed bag. Some are celebrating; some are losing sleep over the conflict; others are gathering supplies in case the US launches more attacks — which Trump said the US is prepared to do.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Herrero about what she's seeing and hearing in Venezuela, and what the sentiment in Venezuela tells us about what might happen next.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

It's great to be able to talk to you, especially since you filled us in on what was going on a few weeks ago. What's going on now?

Everything's going on. Since Saturday, people have been wondering what is going to happen next. In just 48 hours, Venezuelans experienced not only the first bombing and the first glimpse of war that they have experienced for hundreds of years now, but also they had to face the fact that Nicolas Maduro is no longer here. And that happened just in a couple of hours. That is an historic moment for Venezuelans who oppose Maduro, but also for those who follow him.

What are people in the streets saying? And is it safe to be out on the street today?

I tried to wait as long as I could to see what was going on [Saturday], and then to my surprise, no military on the streets, no cops on the streets, no danger whatsoever. People were just wandering and trying to line up in front of supermarkets and pharmacies to get water, food, supplies, whatever they could just to avoid being off guard in case something else happened.

The same image was repeated on Sunday. And now, people are just trying to get back to normal. We see malls opening [for] a shorter period of time, maybe for a few hours.

Such calm after such a storm is not something that you would expect. And some people tell me that it's not normal. I spoke to someone, an elderly woman, and she said that in all of her years living in Venezuela and being born here, she felt so stressed that she just wanted to go to sleep and figure it out later. And I hear a lot of people are having trouble sleeping. They're not feeling safe going to bed because they're scared that the bombings could resume.

Even when I hear a sound that sounds like a plane, I immediately start looking around, getting nervous, trying to figure out what's going on.

Let's talk about Delcy Rodriguez. Who is she and who is she aligned with?

Delcy Rodriguez has been a long-time critic of not only the US policies against Venezuela, but against South America. And she has been a fierce critic of Trump and Trump's approach against Nicolas Maduro. She has a very, very strong leftist background. She is the daughter of a leftist leader, and she was very close to [leftist dictator] Hugo Chavez, who gave her the first chance to be part of the government with him. And then she became a powerful name after Chavez died, working closely with Nicolas Maduro. So no wonder why her sudden change of tone is raising some eyebrows.

You say her tone is changing. What exactly has been happening with her?

Well, on Saturday she said that what happened to Maduro was a kidnapping and it was illegal, and she urged the US government and Trump to bring him back to Venezuela.

And then less than 24 hours later, or maybe a day later, she sat down with all the ministers of the former Maduro government and she invited the US to work together on a joint agenda. And she didn't explain further, but I think there's no need. That phrase alone was enough to raise some eyebrows.

What do you think happened exactly? Why'd she change her tune?

I'm not sure, but I can suspect that the threats that Donald Trump made against her if she didn't comply [with US demands] had something to do with it. We don't know. I mean, is she going to change laws to favor the US? Is she going to resume the diplomatic relations between the US and Venezuela? We have no idea what working together on a joint agenda means, but for sure it's interesting to hear.

We do know what is motivating the United States here, in part because President Trump came right out on Saturday, gave a press conference and said, “We want Venezuela's oil.” In Venezuela, how did people hear that remark? What was the response?

Well, people are so focused on how to survive the next few hours and days. That wasn't part of the conversation up until very recently.

I have been talking to a lot of people on the ground and some of them are addressing that issue, but not all of them. So the ones who tell me that, some of them say they don't want anyone running the country — Venezuela for Venezuelans.

On the other hand, you have the other extreme, and it's people saying, “You know what? If the US wants to run the country, then great, as long as they didn't do it with Nicolas Maduro.” What they all agree on is that they really don't know what that means, “running the country.” And I think no one knows.

Ana, what are people hoping for next? When you ask people what they would like to see happen, what do you hear?

They would like elections. The mood around people who are actually talking about the future, elections are a huge part of it. In 2024, as you can recall, Venezuela had presidential elections and those results were not recognized by Nicolas Maduro, who claimed himself as a victor without any proof. Now, I think people have that feeling of, “We now need our fair elections again.” I mean, we need to, and the Constitution says that in case of an absolute total void of power in the presidency, then the vice president should fill that void immediately and call for elections in the next 30 days. We don't know if that is going to happen because the circumstances right now are unprecedented for Venezuelans.

Venezuelans right now are trying to get out of the state of shock and they're trying to get as much food and water as they can, because they're accustomed to problems, turmoil and tragedy, and they feel that something else might happen.

Better friendships can just start with an emoji.

When Sam Dylan Finch was in his early 20s, he had the friend group he thought he always wanted. “We had holiday dinners, and game nights, and it felt really lovely,” he said.

But then, some dating within the friend group and then a death in the circle split them apart. People split up and chose who they wanted to stay friends with, Finch said, “and I was not the chosen friend.”

The whole experience sent Finch into “hermit mode,” where he began intensely analyzing his friendships and their patterns. He realized certain tendencies: He struggled to prioritize friendships the same way he prioritized romantic prospects, he was a people pleaser who felt he always had to earn people's kindness, and he often sought friendships with people who were not emotionally available to him. And he would feel nervous when people were kind to him right off the bat — “It didn't feel earned, and I didn't feel like I deserved it.”

Realizing his patterns, Finch was determined to break them. He wanted to start intentionally cultivating friendships with the people who were kind, whose interactions left him feeling safe and nourished. He started by making a list of everyone in his orbit, from current friends to old friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. Then, in his phone contacts, “I challenged myself to put a strawberry emoji next to the people who were really kind to me,” he said. “The kind of warmth and kindness that made me nervous.”

This handful of “strawberry people” became Finch's priority friends, and he even told some of them about his intentions to cultivate their friendship. He also put seedling emojis next to the names of people who challenged his ways of thinking and helped him grow.

“It completely changed my life,” said Finch. Clearly marking where he would channel his energy gave him a roadmap to building more purposeful relationships. Previously, he would get easily overwhelmed by text messages, opting to respond to no one. But now, if a text from a strawberry person popped up on this phone, the emoji acted as a reminder to Finch that he values this friendship and should try to respond without too much delay, even if he was tired.

The practice also made Finch more mindful about how interactions with others really made him feel. After hanging out, he made a practice of asking himself “how did that feel?” or “how did that feel in my body?” He noticed times when he was tense versus relaxed and nourished versus drained and made sure his strawberry people were those who left him feeling the former.

Inspired by the impact this little change made in his life, Finch posted about the strawberry people strategy in a thread on X, which is likely where social psychologist Devon Price heard about it. Price included the strategy in their book Unmasking Autism, which was where psychotherapist Michaia Walker heard about it.

Walker, who practices virtually from their home in New York City, began talking about the strategy with clients earlier this year. “It's really similar to a concept of ‘safe people' that we often use with folks with neurodivergence,” they say. People with autism are often encouraged to find “safe” friends who they can let their guards down around and not worry about being themselves, said Walker, and the strawberry people method can be super helpful for keeping track of those people.

In times of crisis, or in moments when you need to find a person to lean on, most people reflexively turn to family members or the friends they see most often, Walker said. But those might not actually be the people who can best support you emotionally. Attaching a strawberry emoji to the friends with whom you feel emotional intimacy provides a good visual reminder and mental shortcut, Walker said.

Walker said that this strategy could be really helpful for anybody looking for ways to track and maintain emotionally close friendships, whether you're neurodivergent or not. And you can make it your own. If you wanted to differentiate your strawberry people a little more, you could, for example, “put a strawberry and a suitcase for work friends, and then a strawberry and a flower for regular friends,” they say.

You could choose a different meaning of the strawberry, or a different emoji, based on the aspect of friendship you're trying to focus on. You could even teach this method to kids to help them learn from a young age what a healthy and emotionally safe friendship is supposed to feel like, said Walker.

If you're interested in implementing this strategy, Walker recommends starting small, with just three to five strawberry people at first. If you're not used to actively cultivating friendships, having more than a few strawberry friends can be overwhelming. But depending on your capacity and what you want out of your social life, “you can build up to 10 or more,” Walker said.

Their suggestions align well with psychologists' understanding of our social bandwidths. Given our own limited tanks of social and emotional energy, no one is capable of maintaining huge numbers of close friends. In fact, the evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has posited that we only have the capacity to maintain three to five very close friendships at a time, though his research suggests we can have up to 15 “best” friends (your main social circle and the friends you might turn to for favors like child care) and 50 “good” friends (your “big-weekend-barbecue people,” as Dunbar has described them).

Once you have your designated strawberry people, decide what purposefully building a friendship means to you. Do you want to check in regularly with them? Or are these simply the friends who you'll always respond to in a timely manner? Clearly outlining how your treatment of these friendships will differ from others will help crystallize the meaning of the strawberry.

Finch, who uses this strategy to this day, said he's found the strawberry people method most impactful when you tell your friends what you're doing. You don't necessarily have to say “you're one of my strawberry people,” he said — “that requires more explanation than is actually necessary” — but it can be nice to voice to them that you want to be intentional about cultivating your friendship.

“The meta conversation, the conversation about the relationship, is normalized in romance and not enough in friendship,” said Finch. But that conversation can be so powerful because, unless you tell them, “it's difficult for people to know how important they are to you.” Telling someone that you are serious about your friendship can help make sure you're on the same page and invites them to make this a joint endeavor.

When talking about strawberry people, Finch likes to remind folks that it's not about ranking your friends or creating some exclusive top tier. “We're not doing a MySpace Top 8,” he said. Rather, for him, the strawberry emoji is simply an indicator of where he can find kind and fulfilling friendships and a reminder that these are the folks he wants to intentionally build closeness with.

The strawberry emoji is also not a permanent designation; people can gain or lose strawberry emojis or seedling emojis over time. “I think of it like tending a garden,” Finch said.

After months of escalating US pressure on Venezuela, the crisis reached a dramatic turning point on Saturday with the US capture of President Nicolás Maduro. According to President Donald Trump, Maduro was seized in a late night military operation and transferred to a US naval vessel to be transported to New York to face charges related to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. The operation reportedly included large-scale military strikes, marking the most direct intervention to date.

While Maduro is now out of power, the political future of Venezuela remains uncertain. Trump said the United States would effectively be “running” the country for the foreseeable future, though he offered few details on what that would entail. Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has been sworn in, and US officials have suggested a willingness to work with existing regime figures, even as Rodríguez publicly rejected any notion of US control and called for Maduro's return. As details of the operation continue to emerge, major questions remain. Follow along here for the latest updates and analysis.

Ariana Aspuru and Noel King

In the wake of a US military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, an atmosphere of uncertainty has settled on the South American country.

Maduro, who appeared in a US federal courtroom in New York today, is in US custody. Meanwhile, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has stepped up to be Venezuela's interim leader — and has already received fresh threats from President Donald Trump if she refuses to comply with US guidance.

Peter Balonon-Rosen and Noel King

The fallout from the US capture and extradition of Nicolás Maduro is radiating around the world.

In a speech at Venezuela's legislative palace, Maduro's son,Venezuelan congressman Nicolás Maduro Guerra, condemned the capture.

Zack Beauchamp

In 2023, then-Sen. JD Vance endorsed President Donald Trump's presidential bid for one big reason: Trump's commitment to peace. “He has my support in 2024,” Vance wrote, “because I know he won't recklessly send Americans to fight overseas.”

Flash forward to 2026, and Vice President Vance has been put in the awkward position of defending one of the most reckless US military raids of my lifetime: an explicit attempt to bring about regime change in Venezuela by abducting its president from his bed.

Eric Levitz

Over the weekend, the United States invaded Venezuela, captured its leader, and then declared itself to be in charge of South America's fifth-largest country.

And no one — not even the US government — seems entirely sure why.

Joshua Keating

For months, as the US has built up military forces around Venezuela, attacking alleged drug boats and seizing sanctioned oil tankers, the big question was whether the US would escalate to a campaign of regime change against the government of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

After the dramatic events of Saturday morning, that question would appear to be answered — in some ways.

Cameron Peters

President Donald Trump called for the US to “run” Venezuela on Saturday, shortly after the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro amid US strikes on the country's capital of Caracas. The attack is a major escalation in Trump's months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela and pushes the US into uncertain territory legally, politically, and militarily. Here's what we know.

US forces launched attacks against an unspecified number of targets in Caracas, Venezuela, overnight, and successfully located and captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The couple has since been flown out of the country, Trump said in an early morning social media post, and will be taken by ship to face criminal charges in the US. Much is still unclear, but Trump said Saturday that no US troops were killed in the attack.

Joshua Keating

President Donald Trump announced Saturday morning that the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, saying that the US had flown Maduro to a military ship off the country's coast and will be taking him to New York.

The capture of Maduro was part of a military operation that included “large-scale strikes” on Venezuela, Trump said.

Editor's note, January 3, 2026, 8:30 am: President Donald Trump announced early on Saturday, January 3, that the United States had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife after a “large-scale strike” on the country, a significant escalation of US involvement in the region. This article was originally published December 1, 2025, and last updated December 11.

Since the early fall, the US has been building up its military forces in the Caribbean and launching airstrikes on alleged drug boats, fueling speculation that it is planning a major military operation against the government of Venezuela.

Trump's new approach to Latin America is a lot like America's old one.

The Trump administration may be more focused on Latin America than any other White House since the 1960s. But the goals of all that focus are not quite as clear.

In the sweep of US history in Latin America, interventions like the capture of Maduro aren't particularly unusual. It was the last 35 years since the end of the Cold War, when the US mostly refrained from these kinds of actions, that were the anomaly.

Countries including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico now have to take seriously whether America's new interventionism will target them next. For now, there's not much they can do to push back–but the long-term consequences are less clear.

The Trump administration is taking a shockingly interventionist approach to the Western Hemisphere, as shown by last weekend's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his threats of military intervention against several other countries in the region. But we can't say we weren't warned.

Donald Trump came into office a second time pledging to retake the Panama Canal and annex Greenland and possibly Canada. He renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” Less than a month into his term, he was slapping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and Colombia for their perceived defiance of his agenda. His choice for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had such longstanding interests in Latin American affairs that many observers saw him as effectively running US policy toward the region from his Senate office during Trump's first term.

Trump's short-lived national security adviser, Mike Waltz (now ambassador to the UN), had dubbed the White House's regional approach “Monroe Doctrine 2.0.” Trump lately appears to prefer the New York Post-coined “Donroe Doctrine.”

In Trump's view, his predecessors had let the doctrine, which originally stated that foreign powers should avoid meddling in the Western Hemisphere but evolved into a view that the US should be the preeminent power in the region,dangerously lapse. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot, by a real lot,” he said on Saturday.

Whatever you call it, it's clear that the region is no longer the “lost continent” of US foreign policy. Whatever else the Maduro operation was, it made clear that all the language in Trump's recently released national security strategy about restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” after “years of neglect” wasn't just bluster.

What's less clear is the purpose of the new attention focused on the region. What is the US actually trying to get out of Latin America, and are the region's governments going to provide it?

For all the talk in the past few days about how a Rubicon has been crossed in the use of force and the violation of international norms, the use of military force or covert action to depose a government in Latin America or the Caribbean is far from unprecedented.

Between the US invasion of Cuba in 1998 during the Spanish-American war and Bill Clinton's military intervention in Haiti in 1994, there were roughly 17 instances of successful direct US-backed regime change in the region — and far more cases where indirect US pressure may have played a role in bringing down a government.

“In the broad sweep of history, it's amazing how unexceptional this is,” Brian Winter, Latin American politics analyst and editor of Americas Quarterly magazine, told Vox. “The exceptional period was the last 35 years” following the end of the Cold War.

Winter added that “this White House is more focused on Latin America than any other since probably the 1960s,” referring to the era that followed Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution, and included a number of military interventions meant to prevent the spread of Communism in the region as well as a confrontation with the Soviet Union over Cuba that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

But US interventionism in the region was relatively common up through the 1980s and early 1990s. As many have noted, Maduro's capture took place on the 36th anniversary of the arrest of Panama's Manuel Noriega, another dictator indicted in US courts for drug trafficking.

The administration has explicitly harkened back to this history with its invocations of the Monroe Doctrine.

In particular, Trump's assertion of a “Trump corollary” to the doctrine links his policy to the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary, which asserted that the US would use military force as a last resort in “flagrant cases of…wrongdoing or impotence” by regional governments — an approach that became known as “gunboat diplomacy.”

If there's a difference between the most recent case of US regime change and the previous era, it may be the lack of clarity in American motives. The US has intervened in the past to prevent foreign meddling (European imperialism in an earlier era, Communism later on), to protect US economic interests, or to remove a suspected drug trafficker.

The justification for the Venezuela operation was a shifting mix of the three. For months, starting in December, as the US targeted suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, the administration's messaging focused on Maduro's role as an alleged “narcoterrorist” and cartel boss.

Months into the campaign, Trump and his aides began focusing on Venezuela's past nationalization of American oil interests and the president is now heavily focused on retaking Venezuela's oil resources for American countries.

Since the operation, US officials have made much of the 32 Cuban security personnel guarding Maduro who were killed as well as dismantling Iranian and Hezbollah networks in the country. It's also interesting that Maduro's capture came just hours after a meeting with Chinese diplomats. Foreign meddling wasn't a major feature of the administration's rhetoric in the months leading up to the event, however. Trump doesn't appear particularly interested in restoring democracy to Venezuela, though the country's democratic opposition are nonetheless hopeful this will work out in their favor.

In the end, different high-ranking Trump officials may have been interested in Venezuela for different reasons —crime, migration, energy, foreign influence — and put together a strong enough case for Trump. Calling it emblematic of a “doctrine” is probably generous.

Trump repeatedly stated the day after Maduro was captured that the US would be “running” Venezuela, though the reality appears to be that the country's government will be left in place–minus Maduro–so long as it meets the administration's as-yet unspecified demands.

Given the US's actions over the past year, citizens of other Latin American countries could be forgiven for wondering if this definition of “running” applies to their countries as well. Trump has endorsed favored candidates in elections in Argentina and Honduras this year, and threatened tariffs against Brazil in order to stop the prosecution of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

More is likely to come in 2026 with presidential elections being held in Brazil and Colombia. At this point, it would be surprising if we don't see Truth Social messages endorsing a preferred candidate.

Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, has been a particular foil for Trump since the beginning of last year. In recent days, he has said that Petro — the leading regional critic of the Venezuela intervention — should “watch his ass” and called him a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.” (Colombia is a major producer of cocaine but there's little evidence linking Petro to the trade.) Unlike Venezuela, which has been a thorn in the side of US administrations for years, Colombia is one of America's closest security partners in the region.

“If Colombian voters choose a Washington allied candidate, someone more on the right, the bilateral relationship might return to its normal state,” said Beth Dickinson, a Colombia-based analyst with the International Crisis Group. “But I do really worry about what could happen if a left-leaning candidate is elected.”

There's precedent for this kind of meddling as well. President Woodrow Wilson famously quipped that he would “teach the South American republics to elect good men” and his successors intervened in overt and covert ways dozens of times in the region's elections in the subsequent decades.

In Trump's case, the meddling often seems less motivated by ideology commitment (Trump has gotten along quite well with the Communist leaders of China and North Korea) than personal animus. “Petro and Trump have found one another to be useful political enemies,” Dickinson noted.

In the case of Honduras, it appears to have been a concerted lobbying campaign by Trump allies on behalf of the country's imprisoned ex-president rather than ideological affinity that prompted that caught his interest in the country.

Likewise, Trump has chosen not to get behind Venezuela's democratic opposition in the wake of Maduro's ouster, but to work with his vice president, a committed if more pragmatic Chavista who seems willing to work toward better relations while continuing to publicly decry Yankee imperialism. (One major outstanding question of the past week is the degree of support the US may have had from elements of the Venezuelan regime in arranging for Maduro's extraction.) As much as anything else, it was reportedly Maduro's public displays of defiance and disrespect — notably his televised dancing — that pushed the administration to make the final decision to capture him.

The personal factor also seems to be paramount when it comes to Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, on paper exactly the sort of lifelong committed leftist Trump should despise, who appears to have been able to keep him relatively satisfied over the past year with limited “wins” on fentanyl and border security and the two seem to have a friendly rapport. (Trump had a similarly friendly relationship with Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who had literally written an entire book attacking the US president.)

Whether that will continue now that Trump appears to be gaining a taste for military action is not clear. In the past week, Trump has resurrected an idea — discussed by him and allies in Congress since his first term — of taking military action against drug cartels on Mexican soil.”

“Is a unilateral use of force on Mexican soil probable? No,” said former Mexican ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhán. “Is it possible? Absolutely, and given what has just happened in Venezuela, I think the Mexican government should really take this very seriously.”

The stakes of Sheinbaum's ability to manage the Trump relationship couldn't be higher heading into a pivotal year in the relationship which will include a renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

Taking a pragmatic approach to managing Trump may be harder for the other country currently in the US crosshairs: Cuba. Even at the worst of times, there was always a degree of pragmatism built into the US-Venezuela relationship: US firm Chevron continued to pump oil in the country, for instance. That gave at least an opening for negotiations between the two countries early in the Trump administration and may yet allow the relationship to get back on track now that the dancing boogeyman is gone. That king of accommodation is much harder to imagine from the far more ideological Cuban regime.

The hope in Washington is that the loss of its ally and the ongoing embargo on sanctioned oil shipments will cause the sclerotic and economically distressed Cuban regime to collapse on its own. And yet this is a regime that has defied predictions of its imminent demise for more than 60 years. If it doesn't fall, could it be the next target for military intervention?

“These folks could look at Cuba and say, ‘well, compared to Venezuela, which is a country of 30 million people, Cuba is easy. We can put boots on the ground,” said Michael Bustamante, a professor of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami. “On the other hand, Cuba doesn't have the largest oil reserves in the world, so is it worth the risk?”

There's always a risk when it comes to Trump's foreign policy of retroactively trying to map a coherent worldview onto a set of seemingly impulsive and often contradictory actions. But in the case of Latin America, the foreign policy is tied to the Trump team's much more consistent domestic priorities: crime and migration.

The view is that by neglecting the region, previous administrations have allowed crises to develop which have driven illegal drugs and migrants into the United States. This is not necessarily a view unique to this administration. The Biden administration also made a much maligned effort to address the “root causes” of migration, albeit with much different methods. The administration is also interested in countering Chinese, Iranian and to a lesser extent Russian influence (that's what the Trump corollary actually discusses) and combating leftism. These are not historically unusual goals.

Whether the Trump strategy will actually accomplish any of this is another story. Maduro may have had a hand in the cocaine trade but deposing him isn't going to stop the opioids that have devastated American communities. Migration numbers are down at the US-Mexico border now, but a full-scale collapse in Venezuela could lead to a new uptick. Perhaps governments will be dissuaded from deepening their ties with China, perhaps faced with an unpredictable America, they will look to hedge with security and economic partnership elsewhere. (Even Trump's closest South American ally, Javier Millei, is not above selling soybeans to the communists.)

Then there are the unintended consequences. “There's some level of ‘we're big and bad and flexing our muscles' [in the Trump policy.],” said James Saenz, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics in the Biden administration. “But in the past, we've chosen not to do these things for the long-term considerations of developing friends and allies around the world, because it provides for our security and our own economic opportunities.” The past year has already seen several European countries cut off the sharing of intelligence with the US that they believed could be used in illegal strikes against civilian boats.

The international response to Maduro's ouster has been somewhat muted and divided so far — very few, even on the Latin American left, are sorry to see him gone. Actions in Colombia, Mexico, or for that matter Greenland could have more profound consequences for US alliances.

As for the political consequences in Latin America itself, at the moment, the region appears in an overall rightward political drift after recent elections in countries like Ecuador, Argentina, and Bolivia, which Maduro's disastrous rule can take at least some credit for. The current generation of regional leaders won't necessarily always look to do Trump's bidding, but they may not be eager to defy him either. The longer term consequences are more unpredictable, but again, history can provide some guidance.

“You can draw a direct line between, you know, Teddy Roosevelt's use of the “big stick” and the rise of Latin American nationalism, which eventually gave us figures like Fidel Castro,” Winter said.

All of which is to say that future US presidents are likely to have to reckon with the legacy of the Donroe Doctrine.

A Chinese AI chatbot embedded inside the country's most widely used app briefly went off the rails, snapping at a user.

Tencent's AI assistant, Yuanbao, which is built into WeChat — China's dominant super app used daily by tens of millions of people — called a user's coding request ""stupid"" and told them to ""get lost,"" according to screenshots shared on Chinese social media platform RedNote.

The incident surfaced on Friday after a user identified only by the handle ""Jianghan"" posted screenshots of their interaction with the chatbot on RedNote. Jianghan had been using Yuanbao to debug and modify a piece of code when the AI suddenly began responding with hostile messages.

In one exchange, the chatbot dismissed the request as ""stupid"" and told the user to ""get lost."" It said: ""If you want an emoji feature, go use a plugin yourself.""

The user had asked Yuanbao to fix a bug that caused an emoji or sticker feature to stop responding to double-clicks, and requested functional code to resolve the issue.

Tencent's YuanBao later responded directly under the user's post, apologising for what it described as a ""negative experience."" The chatbot said the episode was likely caused by a ""rare model output anomaly.""

Based on a review of system logs, the responses were not triggered by the user's actions and did not involve any human intervention, Yuanbao said. It added that it had launched an ""internal investigation and optimisation process"" to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring again.

The original RedNote post by Jianghan has since been deleted. Screenshots of the exchange continue to circulate on RedNote, as seen by Business Insider on Tuesday.

The incident comes as Chinese regulators step up scrutiny of AI systems.

China released draft measures last week aimed at governing ""human-like"" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions.

In a statement, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Beijing encourages innovation in ""human-like"" AI, but will put guardrails in place to ""prevent abuse and loss of control.""

Wei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider that the draft measures send a signal that Beijing wants to speed up the development of human-like AI interactions, while keeping them regulated and socially acceptable.

China's AI industry has continued to move at a rapid pace since the start of 2026.

Last week, DeepSeek, one of the country's most closely watched AI startups, published research outlining a new training approach intended to make large models easier to scale. Analysts told Business Insider the technique, known as ""Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,"" or mHC, stood out as a ""breakthrough"" in model design.

The South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that DeepSeek has updated the interface of its flagship chatbot model, introducing an enhanced ""thinking"" mode.

The updates have fuelled expectations that the startup could be laying the groundwork for the release of its next major model.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a ""significant increase"" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.

The Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.

A share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.

Russia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.

The push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.

In November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.

In the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.

Putin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.

At the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.

Oil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.

Developments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.

""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil ""just became less important"" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and ""reduce Russia's income and power.""

That view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.

""Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,"" wrote Herbst on Monday.

""While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,"" he added.

Venezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.

What's old is new again — at least when it comes to living with family.

American families are increasingly moving back in together — or never separating in the first place. The number of people living in multigenerational households — or those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research. The share of people in these living arrangements soared from 7% to 18% in that time period.

Homebuyers are increasingly choosing properties designed for multigenerational living, the National Association of Realtors found. Zillow similarly saw a nationwide rise in searches for accessory dwelling units, also known as granny flats, and in-law suites in 2025.

Cost savings are driving the trend. Families can split rent and mortgage payments, and save on childcare expenses and long-term care costs for older relatives. The arrangement can also help stave off social isolation.

While multigenerational living may not be the norm these days, it once was. Before World War II, it was almost unheard of for older adults to live independently or receive care outside of their families, while younger people often wouldn't move out until they got married.

But that changed for millions of American families as they lived farther apart, independent living services for seniors became more accessible, and more women joined the workforce. And a growing number of older people don't have family to rely on.

""We have more and more solo-agers who didn't have children or didn't get married or basically no longer have a relationship with their children,"" said Bob Kramer, founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care.

For older people in particular, living with family or in other intergenerational arrangements can be life-saving, in part because it prevents them from growing isolated.

""The bottom line for solo-agers is that they need community,"" said Sara Zeff Geber, a solo-aging consultant. ""However creatively or traditionally they can work that out, that's what they're going to need if they're not going to be lonely and isolated and uncared for in their homes.""

Intergenerational living — or sharing a home or community with unrelated people of varying ages — is one of those creative solutions.

On one end of the intergenerational living spectrum, an older homeowner could have a younger housemate in a cohousing arrangement. On the other end, purpose-built intergenerational communities or housing complexes are intentionally designed for both older and younger residents, often with communal spaces and programming.

A major 2024 report on intergenerational living highlighted examples of intentional communities, such as One Flushing in Queens, New York. The mixed-income complex has 231 apartments, 66 of which are reserved for older people, and a community center that brings local high schoolers in to help older adults with computer skills.

The researchers also pointed to nonprofit intergenerational housing communities in Oregon, Massachusetts, and Illinois that bring together older adults and foster families.

Still, costs remain a concern, particularly for middle-income people, who earn too much to qualify for needs-based government benefits but also struggle to afford market-rate options.

""The thing that's concerning to a lot of us is that we really don't have a lot of options for modest-income folks,"" said Robyn Stone, a senior vice president at LeadingAge, a nonprofit that represents thousands of aging services providers, who contributed to the report.

Multigenerational or intergenerational living won't appeal to everyone. There's no one-size-fits-all housing solution for boomers, Gen Zers, or anyone in between, experts caution. People have vastly different needs, budgets, and preferences.

""I don't think I would want to open my house to anybody if I were living alone,"" Stone said. ""But I think that I would want to have more of an intentional intergenerational community as I get older.""

The Department of Homeland Security singled out Hilton on X, saying a hotel in Minnesota canceled reservations belonging to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

According to a screenshot shared by DHS on Monday, a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, south of Minneapolis, said it was ""not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.""

""If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation,"" the screenshot said.

Hilton said it doesn't own or operate the hotel. The company's shares were down nearly 2.5% on Monday. 

""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values,"" Hilton said in a statement to Business Insider. ""We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies.""

""Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination,"" the statement said.

Everpeak Hospitality, the owner of the hotel, said in a statement Tuesday that the incident was ""inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all.""

""We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated,"" the statement said. ""We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted.""

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Hilton's largest known shareholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which respectively own 10.6% and 8.5% of its common stock, according to the company's 2025 proxy statement.

Hilton, like other global hotel chains, does not own most Hilton-branded hotels.

Instead, most of its hotels are franchised — they're owned and operated independently or owned by a third party and operated by Hilton.

Happy Tuesday. We're not even a week into the new year and I've already started telling myself that my resolution to read more can include reviewing drafts of this newsletter.

Stock futures are little changed this morning. The market is coming off a winning session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Investor attention yesterday concentrated on the U.S.' strike on Venezuela over the weekend. Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in a New York City court yesterday, saying he was ""kidnapped"" and a ""prisoner of war."" 

Here's how the market reacted to the military operation:

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told CNBC yesterday that interest rates may not need to come down much further. 

""My guess is we're pretty close to neutral right now,"" Kashkari said on ""Squawk Box."" He said he believes inflation is still too high and that monetary policy appears to not have been tight enough in recent years.

On the labor front, Kashkari said artificial intelligence has caused a slowdown in hiring among big companies while also creating productivity gains. His comments come ahead of tomorrow's ADP employment report and November's Job Openings and Labor Turnover data, followed by the all-important nonfarm payroll report on Friday.

General Motors reported a 5.5% annual U.S. sales increase in 2025 yesterday. As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, that should make it a top performer: Cox Automotive expects the broader sector to rise around just 2%.

On the other hand, Chrysler parent Stellantis saw its sales slide 3.3%. But it wasn't all bad: The automaker's Jeep brand posted growing sales for the first time since 2018.

Electric vehicle maker Lucid, meanwhile, said deliveries surged 55% in 2025, driven by a 70% annual increase in the fourth quarter. Lucid has been building out production of its Gravity SUV despite supply chain snafus.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Nvidia is testing the robotaxi waters. The company said yesterday that it's working with operators in hopes of having them use Nvidia's AI chips and software in their autonomous vehicle fleets as early as next year.

As CNBC's Kif Leswing notes, it's the AI titan's latest foray into the automotive sector. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber last year. The company also said last month that Mercedes-Benz models released in later this year should be able to use its software for navigating cities like San Francisco.

JPMorgan launched a new initiative yesterday that gives select clients access to insights on the bank's approach to major topics. In other words, its new ""Special Advisory Services"" will provide a look at parts of the recipe for JPMorgan's ""secret sauce.""

Liz Myers, the bank's global chair of investment banking, is leading the effort. Myers told CNBC's Leslie Picker that JPMorgan's capabilities are ""on par or better"" than what some specialized consultancies offer.

JPMorgan will offer insights on a range of topics, including investor relations and real estate selection. Initially, the bank will not charge for these services, but it said it could institute a fee structure for clients needing support on prolonged or more time-consuming projects.

Matt Mahan, the mayor of San Jose, California, rebuked the so-called billionaires tax that has been the talk of Silicon Valley. It was a notable break from Rep. Ro Khanna, a fellow Democrat who has been under fire from the technology elite over his support of the proposed ballot measure.

CNBC's Dan Mangan, Spencer Kimball, Hugh Leask, Sean Conlon, Jeff Cox, Ashley Capoot, Michael Wayland, Kif Leswing, Leslie Picker and Jordan Novet contributed to this report. Josephine Rozelle edited this edition.

Software startup NinjaOne has surpassed $500 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the company announced Tuesday.

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000.

President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support.

""I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,"" he said.

Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.

Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's ""multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster"" to generate several software solutions at once.

The company snagged a $5 billion valuation after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, in February 2025.

Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne.

""About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,"" he said. ""The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.""

He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate artificial intelligence.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead. 

Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition.

In October, NinjaOne rolled out its Patch Intelligence AI feature, which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow.

""I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,"" he said. ""I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.""

European leaders on Tuesday issued a joint statement to push back against U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, saying security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively. 

""The Kingdom of Denmark – including Greenland – is part of NATO,"" the statement said, according to a letter published by Denmark's Prime Minister's Office on X. 

""Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,"" they continued. 

""Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.""  

The letter was signed by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland.

The coordinated message, which also described the U.S. as ""an essential partner"" in the push for Arctic security, comes as Trump once again sets his sights on the vast, mineral-rich and sparsely populated territory.

The U.S. president, who has long advocated for control over the self-governing Danish territory, told NBC News on Monday that he was ""very serious"" with his intent to acquire Greenland. Trump also said he had ""no timeline"" for doing so, however.

Alarm bells have been ringing in Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of Greenland, given that Trump's remarks follow Washington's major military operation in Venezuela.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the joint statement from European leaders and urged the U.S. ""to seek a respectful dialogue"" through the appropriate diplomatic channels.

""Our country is not something that can be annexed or taken over because you feel like it,"" Nielsen said Tuesday in a Facebook post, according to a Google translation.

""This support is important in a situation where fundamental international principles are being challenged. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for this support,"" he continued. 

""I must again urge the United States to seek a respectful dialogue through the correct diplomatic and political channels and the use of already existing forums, building on agreements that already exist with the United States. The dialogue must be conducted with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity.""

Denmark's Frederiksen had previously warned that an American takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.

""I believe that the U.S. president should be taken seriously when he says that he wants Greenland,"" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday, according to a CNBC translation.

""But I also want to make it clear, that if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War,"" she added.

Speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro before European leaders published their joint statement, European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said the European Union stands together with Denmark over ongoing Greenland tensions. 

""I agree with Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen, when she said that if things will develop up to such a case that Americans will take some actions against Greenland, it will be the end of trans-Atlantic partnership,"" Kubilius said Tuesday.

""So, that is very serious, and I hope that Americans will take also their actions in a serious way. And from that point of view really, our position is very clear,"" he added.

Semiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. 

South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 16.3% higher this year. 

Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.

In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.

""The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,"" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.

""We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.""

This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.

Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.

The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.

Intel shares are up 7.6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.

Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise 15.2% this year. 

Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. 

""ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,"" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit ""from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.""

Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. 

""Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,"" Barringer said.

""That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.""

European leaders are gathering in Paris on Tuesday as they attempt to revive interest in a peaceful settlement to the war in Ukraine, just as Washington and the world's focus has moved on to the Venezuela crisis.

The U.S.' capture and arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and their subsequent transfer to the U.S. on criminal charges has garnered global media attention, increasing the risk that Washington's interest in securing a Ukraine peace deal could wane. 

European officials are keen to revive the momentum seen in pre-Christmas talks between the U.S. and its Ukrainian and Russian counterparts, which were aimed at securing an agreement around a 20-point peace plan to end almost four years of fighting. 

The so-called ""Coalition of the Willing"" — a group of countries that say they're willing to provide post-war security guarantees and peacekeeping forces to Ukraine — is set to meet in the French capital to discuss the elements of the peace plan that have been agreed so far, as well as the remaining stumbling blocks to a deal, namely, security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial concessions demanded by Moscow.

Russia rejects the idea of European nations providing security guarantees for Kyiv, or deploying peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, and wants Ukraine to cede its eastern Donbas region to Moscow. Ukraine has said it's willing to drop its NATO membership ambitions but needs guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. 

There was already widespread concern in Europe that U.S. President Donald Trump could lose interest in Ukraine, and the pursuit of a peace deal, given his mercurial nature and previous seesawing on the war's endgame, specifically regarding whether Ukraine can expect to come out of the war with its territorial integrity intact. 

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner arrived at the Elysee Palace for the talks on Tuesday, which will also include European leaders, top European Commission officials and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is reportedly not attending due to the crisis in Venezuela. 

Commenting on the gathering in Paris, Emily Thornberry, chair of the U.K. Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told CNBC that American involvement remains vital. 

""The meeting today is supposed to be about the future of Ukraine, which is incredibly important, and we do need to have American security guarantees because what we don't want is for there to be a peace which only lasts for a few months and when we're not looking anymore, the Russians walk into Ukraine and take over,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""The only way we're going to get a just and lasting peace is for the Americans to be involved. We're not asking for boots on the ground, we're asking for a security guarantee that means something,"" she added. 

Analysts have warned that Trump's capture of Maduro does not bode well for Ukraine, not only because it's a significant distraction for Washington, but because it sends a message to Moscow that the removal of a rival national leader, accused of criminality, is permitted — and particularly if that leader is deemed to be within a superpower's geopolitical ""sphere of influence."" 

Moscow frequently describes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a ""criminal,"" without presenting evidence to back up its accusations.

Greenland's prime minister on Monday sought to downplay the prospect of an imminent U.S. takeover attempt, following renewed interest in the mineral-rich Arctic island by President Donald Trump.

Speaking at a news conference shortly after Trump's military operation in Venezuela over the weekend, Greenland's Jens Frederik Nielsen dismissed concerns that something similar could happen to the self-governing Danish territory.

""The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,"" Greenland's Nielsen said Monday at a press conference.

""Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela,"" he added, according to a CNBC translation.

""We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years. If we look at the whole picture, we can understand that some people are concerned,"" Nielsen said.

""We want to create and re-establish the cooperation we have previously had with the United States, especially the good cooperation we have had.""

European political leaders have rallied around Greenland and Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of the self-governing island, since Trump repeated his ambitions in the wake of Washington's intervention in Venezuela. 

Speaking to NBC News on Monday evening, Trump said he was ""very serious"" with his intent to acquire Greenland but conceded he had ""no timeline"" for doing so.

The U.S. president, who has long advocated for control over the island, said on Sunday on Air Force One that ""we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.""

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, meanwhile, has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. 

""I believe that the U.S. president should be taken seriously when he says that he wants Greenland,"" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday, according to a CNBC translation.

""But I also want to make it clear, that if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War,"" she added.

Copenhagen has sought to improve ties with Greenland in recent months, pledging to boost spending on health care and infrastructure, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.

Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a large majority support independence from Denmark.

California Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa died Tuesday, his office announced. He was 65. 

""Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership kindness to the North State,"" LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said in a statement. ""Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves.""

LaMalfa's death tightens the razor-thin House majority and could imperil Speaker Mike Johnson's grip on the chamber. The House stood at 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., resigned on Monday. LaMalfa's death brings the House to 218 Republicans. 

Democrats are favored to pick up additional seats from special elections in the coming months. Two Democrats are in a runoff in Texas at the end of the month, and the election to replace now-New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will take place later this year. 

LaMalfa represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013. He chaired the Congressional Western Caucus. 

A cause of death has not been released. 

A rice farmer by trade, LaMalfa was a key player on California water issues and served on the House Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees. He also served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 

His electoral prospects, however, were increasingly at risk in 2026 after California adopted new congressional maps that favor Democrats. 

""Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa,"" said House Speaker Johnson, R-La. ""He was as fierce of a fighter for his state's vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known."" 

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also expressed condolences for LaMalfa. 

""A fourth-generation rice farmer, Rep. LaMalfa treasured his community, worked powerfully to protect California's farmers and served those he represented with principled purpose, from the state legislature to the United States House of Representatives,"" Jeffries said. 

President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned LaMalfa in remarks before the House GOP conference.

""He was a fantastic person,"" Trump said. ""He voted with me 100% of the time."" 

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a post to X that he's ""devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.""

""Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,"" Emmer said. 

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom now has 14 days to announce a special election to replace LaMalfa, per California election laws. The election then must take place no more than 140 days after Newsom's proclamation -- potentially pushing an election to replace LaMalfa to June.

Jeffries held a moment of silence for LaMalfa before a Democratic hearing on the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. 

""A great member of Congress, from the great state of California,"" Jeffries said.

Correction: There are 213 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. That fact was misstated in an earlier version of this article.

Following the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to the removal of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, AI-generated videos purporting to show Venezuelan citizens celebrating in the streets have gone viral on social media.

These artificial intelligence clips, depicting rejoicing crowds, have amassed millions of views across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram and X. 

One of the earliest and most widely shared clips on X was posted by an account named ""Wall Street Apes,"" which has over 1 million followers on the platform. 

The post depicts a series of Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy and thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for removing Maduro. 

The video has since been flagged by a community note, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature on X that allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading. The note read: ""This video is AI generated and is currently being presented as a factual statement intended to mislead people.""

The clip has been viewed over 5.6 million times and reshared by at least 38,000 accounts, including by business mogul Elon Musk, before he eventually removed the repost. 

CNBC was unable to confirm the origin of the video, though fact-checkers at BBC and AFP said the earliest known version of the clip appeared on the TikTok account @curiousmindusa, which regularly posts AI-generated content.

Even before such videos appeared, AI-generated images showing Maduro in U.S. custody were circulating prior to the Trump administration releasing an authentic image of the captured leader. 

The deposed Venezuelan president was captured on Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. forces conducted airstrikes and a ground raid, an operation that has dominated global headlines at the start of the new year. 

Along with the AI-generated videos, the AFP's fact-check team also flagged a number of examples of misleading content about Maduro's ousting, including footage of celebrations in Chile falsely presented as scenes from Venezuela. 

Misinformation from major news events is not new. Similar false or misleading content has circulated during the Israeli-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. 

However, the massive reach and realism of AI-generated content related to recent developments in Venezuela are stark examples of how AI is advancing as a tool for misinformation. 

Platforms such as Sora and Midjourney have made it easier than ever to quickly generate hyper-realistic video and pass it off as genuine in the chaos of fast-breaking events. The creators of that content often seek to amplify certain political narratives or sow confusion among global audiences.

Last year, AI-generated videos of women complaining about losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a government shutdown also went viral. One such AI-generated video fooled Fox News, which presented it as real in an article that was later removed.

In light of these trends, social media companies have faced growing pressure to step up efforts to label potentially misleading AI content.

Last year, India's government proposed a law requiring such labeling, while Spain approved fines of up to 35 million euros for unlabeled AI materials.

To address growing concerns, major platforms, including TikTok and Meta, have rolled out AI detection and labeling tools, though the results appear mixed.

CNBC was able to identify some videos on TikTok presented as celebrations in Venezuela that were labeled as AI-generated. 

In the case of X, the platform has relied mostly on community notes for content labeling, a system critics say often reacts too slowly to prevent AI misinformation from spreading before being identified.

Adam Mosseri, who oversees Instagram and Threads, acknowledged the challenge facing social media in a recent post. ""All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality,"" he said.

""There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media,"" he added.

For the first time in years, many Americans enrolled in a health insurance plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will need to keep a careful accounting of their annual income — or risk a hefty federal tax bill.

Enhanced ACA subsidies lapsed at the end of 2025, leaving millions of households on the hook for higher insurance premiums. The lapse also reintroduced the so-called subsidy cliff, whereby households that earn even $1 more than a specific income threshold will lose all eligibility for subsidies, also known as premium tax credits.

That income cutoff, which varies by family size, is $62,600 for a single person, $84,600 for a two-person household and $128,600 for a family of four in 2026, for example. 

More than 2 million people enrolled in an ACA marketplace plan have an income near the subsidy cliff. ACA enrollees also tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it hard to predict their annual earnings, experts said. 

Households over the limit would have to pay back any federal subsidies they received for premiums — potentially worth thousands of dollars — when they file taxes next year for 2026.

""Starting February, March, April 2027 is when you'll start to see the horror stories of people with astronomical tax bills, from the payback of these credits,"" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025. 

The potential financial impact is exacerbated by a multitrillion-dollar legislative package known as the ""big beautiful bill"" that Republicans passed over the summer, which stripped away guardrails capping the amount of excess subsidies households must repay, experts said. 

""I don't know of anything else that's as penalizing in the tax code by adding one extra dollar [of income],"" Lucas said. ""You've got to be on your game starting now.""

The total sum households need to pay back to the federal government ""could easily be $10,000,"" said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the Affordable Care Act program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. 

The sum depends on factors like age, geography and family size, Cox said. 

An older couple who inadvertently earn too much money and go over the subsidy cliff may need to pay back around $20,000, for example, she said.

There's a chance Congress may still act to extend enhanced ACA subsidies in some form and prevent a surprise tax bill for many households next year. 

Democrats on Capitol Hill have said they want to extend them, while most Republicans have said they're opposed. However, a group of Republicans has recently engaged in bipartisan talks in the House and Senate that may yield legislative action. 

""I think the chances are pretty slim something will pass,"" Cox said. ""From a personal finance perspective, you have to just count on nothing happening in Congress.""

The subsidy cliff is in effect for the first time since Congress enacted enhanced premium subsidies in 2021 as part of a Covid-19 pandemic relief law.

Now, households with an income in 2026 that exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line are ineligible for any premium tax credits. They'd be on the hook for the full, unsubsidized health insurance premium.

For example, the average 60-year-old with an income of $62,000 would pay about $515 a month in health premiums, or approximately 10% of their annual income, according to a KFF analysis. This person would be eligible for premium subsidies.

However, the same person earning $64,000 would pay $1,244 per month, about 23% of their income, since they would fall over the subsidy cliff, KFF found.

Millions of people have an income near the subsidy cliff. 

In 2025, about 3% of ACA enrollees — nearly 725,000 people — earned between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty line, for example, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis of federal data.

Another 7% — about 1.8 million people — earned 300% to 400% of the poverty line, it found. That equates to more than about $47,000 per year for an individual and about $96,000 for a family of four.

""People around that income [threshold] didn't have to worry about that for the past five years,"" Cox said.

""[Now], if your income is right around that threshold for subsidy eligibility, then you need to be really careful about how much money you're making,"" she said.

About 22 million Americans received premium subsidies, also known as premium tax credits, in 2025. 

Households can opt to receive the tax credit in one of two ways: As a lump sum during tax season or as an advanced payment. 

Under the latter option, by far the most popular, the federal government issues the tax credit directly to a consumer's insurer, which then lowers the consumer's out-of-pocket premium. 

Consumers receive those advanced ACA subsidies based on an estimated annual income they provide when signing up for insurance. They must reconcile those subsidies during tax season and repay any excess tax credits to the IRS.

ACA enrollees tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it difficult to predict their annual pay accurately, Cox said.

About one in five people, 21%, between 19 and 64 years old who shop for insurance on the ACA marketplace are in households with ""high levels of income volatility,"" according to a KFF study published in May. The researchers define volatility as a difference of at least 20% between estimated and actual income. 

The federal government determines eligibility for ACA subsidies based on ""modified adjusted gross income."" 

Determining MAGI may be challenging, experts said. 

It's one's adjusted gross income — a line item on households' tax returns — with some other elements added back. The two ""biggies"" for most people are any tax-exempt interest, such as from municipal bonds, and any untaxed Social Security benefits, Lucas said. 

""It's definitely important for people on the ACA to know their cliff number, their 400%,"" Lucas said. 

They should monitor their income monthly to see how it's trending, he said. 

""There are ways to keep an eye on your income and even make changes mid-year to stay eligible for the subsidies, so you don't have a big surprise come tax time next year,"" Cox said. 

For example, households can consider making pre-tax contributions to financial accounts like a 401(k), individual retirement account or health savings account, which helps to reduce modified adjusted gross income, experts said. 

Additionally, retirees and other households may choose to draw money from Roth retirement accounts, which, with some exceptions, doesn't count toward taxable income. Savers can withdraw Roth contributions tax-free, even if they're not yet age 59½. 

Consumers who are still working and have some flexibility in their hours and work schedule might also opt to work less to reduce their annual earnings.

Monday - Friday: 12:00 - 13:00 SIN/HK  |  0600 - 07:00 CET

Widespread anti-government protests have roiled Iran for over a week, forcing its leaders to weigh options to quell the unrest as U.S. President Donald Trump raised the threat of an intervention. 

The spreading unrest, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, is fueled by growing frustration with a long-running economic crisis in Iran and has turned increasingly violent in recent days. At least 29 people have been killed and more than 1,200 arrested, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency on Tuesday. The U.S.-registered nonprofit relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting.

The anti-regime demonstrations have spread to over 250 locations across 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the group.  

Tehran sought to quell the protests, with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Saturday that ""rioters must be put in their place,"" a remark widely interpreted as a signal for security forces to end the demonstrations.  

Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a more conciliatory tone, urging dialogue and promising economic reforms in bid to placate demonstrators demanding political change, action on corruption and relief from rising living costs. 

The promises included provision of a monthly stipend of 10 million rials ($7) per person  in non-cashable electronic credit for use at selected grocery stores, according to Reuters, citing the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Officials also pledged to overhaul the country's foreign exchange subsidies system to bring direct support for consumers, shifting away from subsidizing importers, which have long been criticized as vulnerable to corruption.  

Still, the public unrest has continued, expanding from economic grievances to broader frustration with the regime, with some protestors chanting ""Death to the dictator,"" a reference to Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over the state. 

The unrest has revived concerns about possible American intervention.  

In a social media post last Friday, Trump vowed that the U.S. would defend the protestors if they were attacked, warning that Washington was ""locked and loaded and ready to go"" if Iranian authorities used violence against peaceful demonstrations.

The warning carried added weight after U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and brought him to New York to face trial this week. 

On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that Iranian authorities would be ""hit very hard"" if more protesters died. ""We're watching it very closely. If they start kiling people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States,"" Trump said. 

Analysts at research firm BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said Iran's leadership may now be more cautious about the use of force against protestors, noting that Trump had bombed Iran's nuclear facilities in support of Israeli strikes in June last year.

""We see heightened risks of U.S. action against Iran in early 2026 if protests escalate,"" the analysts said. 

Reuters cited one unnamed Iranian official as saying that there were concerns that Iran could be ""the next victim of Trump's aggressive foreign policy.""  

Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018, an agreement that limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The country has also reeled from tightening sanctions following a 12-day war with Israel, its longtime regional rival backed by the U.S.  

The rial, Iran's official currency, collapsed in December, falling to a record low of around 1.45 million rials per U.S. dollar at the end of 2025, while inflation reached 42.5%. 

The long-running economic crisis in Iran could pose greater risks to the regime than the prospect of a U.S. intervention, David Roche, veteran investor and strategist with Quantum Strategy, told CNBC on Monday.

""[Iran] is not gonna fall because of the intervention by the United States,"" Roach said, citing the geographic and political constraints. Instead, he said sustained protests combined with worsening domestic economic conditions would pose a greater risk.

He added that the regime will probably outlast this particular round of protests, but ""they don't have any tools to address Iran's economic problems.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Classified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro capture","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/classified-maduro-capture-splits-lawmakers-war-law-enforcement-powers-congress.html","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:22:00 GMT","



The Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.

Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.

The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would ""run"" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela ""a decisive and justified action,"" rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.

""We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country,"" Johnson said. 

""The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief,"" Johnson said. 

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.

""The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,"" Schumer said. ""I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.""

Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. 

Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. 

The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. 

""There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war,"" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. ""No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that."" 

The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. 

Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. 

""This was a law enforcement operation,"" Mast said. ""This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army."" 

Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to ""defend the homeland.""

The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the ""Gang of Eight,"" but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. 

""President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),"" the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    

""The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest,"" they said.

Something went wrong

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Ateev Bhandari

Jan 6 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is seeking regulatory approval to launch exchange-traded funds tied to the price ​of cryptocurrency tokens, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and ‌Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the first such move by a big U.S. bank.

The bank is looking to ‌launch ETFs tied to the price of cryptocurrencies bitcoin and solana, according to the filings, aiming to deepen its presence in the cryptocurrency space.

Regulatory clarity under U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged mainstream finance companies to embrace digital assets, which were ⁠once considered merely speculative instruments.

In ‌December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also allowed banks to act as intermediaries on crypto transactions, narrowing the ‍gap between the traditional sector and digital assets.

Several investors prefer holding crypto via ETFs, which provide greater liquidity and security, and simplified regulatory compliance compared to managing the underlying asset ​directly.

""It's interesting to see Morgan Stanley move into a commoditized market, and I ‌suspect that means they want to move clients that invest in bitcoin into their ETFs which could give them a fast start despite their late entrance,"" said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar.

""A bank entering the crypto ETF market adds legitimacy to it, and others could follow.""

In the two years since the SEC ⁠approved the first U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, a ​wide array of financial institutions - mostly asset managers - ​have stepped up to issue such funds.

U.S. banks, which have mostly only acted as custodians of client investments, are looking to evolve ‍from cautious facilitators to ⁠active advisers.

In October, Morgan Stanley expanded access to crypto investments to include all clients and types of accounts, according to media reports.

Bank of America ⁠followed suit, allowing its wealth advisers to recommend allocations to crypto in client portfolios from January, ‌without any asset threshold.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum news: Staking queues drop to nearly zero, setting up bearish outlook for ETH","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/06/ethereum-s-staking-queues-have-cleared-and-that-changes-the-eth-trade","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:32:35 GMT","

Ethereum's staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.

This means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.

Queues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.

In one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.

At the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.

Lower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium' — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.

What this means in plain terms is that “staking pressure” is no longer a daily narrative.

When queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.

When queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.

This changes the psychology around the ether trade.

Staking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.

Overall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.

Ethereum's DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.

The network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality. 

Incremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.

That fragmentation matters because Ethereum's strongest bull arguments used to be simple. More usage meant more fees, more burns, and more structural pressure on supply.

The 2021 TVL peak was also a leverage era; a lower TVL today doesn't necessarily mean less usage, just less froth.

In the current regime, however, a meaningful chunk of user activity can happen on layer-2 networks where fees are cheaper and experience is smoother, but the value capture that accrues back to ETH can be less obvious to spot markets at the moment.

""One way to frame it is that Ethereum has lost directional clarity,"" shared DNTV Research founder Bradley Park in a note to CoinDesk. ""If ETH is treated primarily as a trust asset to be staked rather than actively used, it weakens the burn mechanism: less ETH gets burned, issuance continues, and sell-side pressure builds over time.""Over the past 30 days, Base has generated significantly more fees than Ethereum itself. That contrast raises a harder question for Ethereum, whether its current trajectory adequately channels usage back into value for ETH,"" Park added.

That gap between activity and value capture is showing up in prediction markets.

On Polymarket, traders assign just an 11% chance that ETH reaches a new all-time high by March 2026, despite higher active addresses and a still-dominant share of DeFi TVL.

The pricing suggests the market views fragmentation and unconstrained staking supply as limiting factors, with usage alone no longer sufficient to force a challenge of the all-time high.

But that picture could shift quickly if U.S. policy evolves to allow yield-bearing ETH products, a change that would re-open the ‘staking premium' trade.

Digital asset manager Grayscale made the first distribution of Ethereum staking rewards to shareholders of a U.S. spot crypto exchange-traded product on Monday, effectively extending regulated crypto products beyond price tracking to include protocol-level income under the Securities Act of 1933.

The distribution covers staking rewards earned from October 6, 2025, through year-end, with ETHE shareholders receiving $0.083178 per share, payable on Tuesday, based on holdings as of January 5.

Grayscale's move could reshape how proof-of-stake assets are packaged for public investors, after staking rewards were previously excluded from U.S. spot crypto ETFs amid regulatory uncertainty, despite being a core source of economic return for networks such as Ethereum.

Distributing staking rewards for shareholders could benefit not just Grayscale, but also “the entire Ethereum community and ETPs at large,” CEO Peter Mintzberg said in a statement.

This follows developments from October last year, when Grayscale became the first U.S. issuer to enable staking on its Ethereum exchange-traded products, allowing ETHE and its counterpart to begin earning network rewards rather than simply tracking the price.

A month later, the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance provided greater clarity around the tax treatment and regulatory handling of staking rewards for crypto exchange-traded products to stake assets like Ethereum and Solana and pass those rewards, creating “a clear path to stake digital assets and share staking rewards with their retail investors,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time.

Until then, U.S. spot crypto exchange-traded products had been structured to track price movements, avoiding direct interaction with network functions such as staking.

That design choice reflects how issuers have structured U.S. spot crypto products under existing securities rules.

The Securities Act of 1933 governs how securities are offered and sold to the public, emphasizing disclosure so investors understand a product's structure and risks, but it does not impose ongoing rules on how a fund must be managed.

By distributing staking rewards, Grayscale is testing whether protocol-level income can be delivered within a product complying with the 33 Act, without triggering the additional obligations and constraints that apply to registered investment companies.

Decrypt has reached out to Grayscale for comment.

Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine chairman Tom Lee has begun the new year with what may be his most bullish outlook yet, predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb as high as $250,000 in 2026 and that Ethereum (ETH) could post similarly dramatic gains.

Speaking in recent CNBC interviews  and shareholder communications, Lee argued that traditional crypto market cycles may be breaking down, a shift he believes could unlock extraordinary upside for Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Lee said Bitcoin's next major rally could defy its long-established four-year halving cycle, which has historically been followed by steep drawdowns.

“In 2026, if Bitcoin gets to $200,000 or $250,000, it would be breaking the four-year cycle,” Lee said on CNBC's Squawk Box. 

“So that's sort of part of our view.”

Under the classic cycle framework, Lee acknowledged that Bitcoin “should be down this year,” but said recent developments have materially altered the outlook.

“I think there are tailwinds that are building,” he said, adding that leverage in the system was largely reset after a sharp market shock in October.

“Part of it is that we kind of reset leverage on Oct. 10 with that big shock,” Lee said.

He pointed to ongoing institutional adoption, Wall Street's continued development of blockchain-based products, and what he described as growing U.S. government support as key drivers that could propel Bitcoin higher.

Lee also addressed concerns that Bitcoin has lagged gold and silver during recent rallies in precious metals.

“It does look like gold rallies typically lead Bitcoin rallies,” he said. “So I think it's been healthy for gold to rally… with monetary easing, those are things that are supportive of crypto to follow.”

In addition, Lee said certain macro indicators have historically aligned with Bitcoin rallies, even if the relationships are not widely understood.

“For whatever hard-to-explain reason, we found that the copper-to-gold price ratio, when that rises, coincides with Bitcoin rallying,” he said.

“And we also found that the ISM, as it moves from below 50 to its peak, has coincided with Bitcoin entering its sort of rally stage.”

Lee has been equally bullish on Ethereum, arguing that its performance relative to Bitcoin could ultimately drive substantial upside.

“This is why we think the price ratio of Ethereum to Bitcoin is really the most important to watch,” Lee said in a recent message  to Bitmine shareholders.

Under Bitmine's base-case scenario of Bitcoin reaching $250,000, Lee outlined a range of potential Ethereum outcomes depending on how that ratio evolves.

“If Bitcoin gets to $250,000, which is our view, and Ethereum trades at its eight-year average ratio, that's $12,000 Ethereum,” he said. “If it gets to the 2021 high, that's $22,000 Ethereum.”

Lee said he bases his long-term conviction on Ethereum's role in what he sees as the future financial system.

“We believe Ethereum is the future of finance,” he said. “It's going to be a payment rail.”

In more aggressive scenarios, Lee suggested Ethereum's valuation could climb far higher.

“If Bitcoin gets to a million, that would value ETH at $250,000,” he said.

Lee's latest forecasts have drawn sharp criticism, most notably from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff.

Schiff dismissed Lee's argument that rising gold prices are bullish for Bitcoin, arguing that the two assets have historically competed rather than moved together.

“CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin,” Schiff wrote on X .

“But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the ‘better' inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.”

CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill @fundstrat  claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the “better” inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.

— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 5, 2026 



In a separate post, Schiff argued that Bitcoin's recent rebound reflected speculative momentum rather than improving fundamentals.

“Bitcoin has been caught up in the Venezuela-inspired rally. It's back above $94,500,” he wrote.

“Don't believe the hype. Just take advantage of the rally to sell and use the proceeds to buy real gold instead.”

Despite the criticism, Lee has reiterated that recent strength in precious metals supports a constructive outlook for digital assets.

Pointing to silver's sharp gains over the past month and gold's strong rise over the past year, Lee questioned whether skepticism toward crypto remains justified.

“If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” he wrote.

The comments prompted further backlash on X, where some users cited Lee's previous forecasts.

One urged him to “stick to equities,” while another said Lee had previously argued Bitcoin and Ethereum would not fall further shortly before prices declined.

While Ethereum (ETH) attempts to turn a crucial level into support, some analysts have shared a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, which could send its price above the $4,000 barrier in the first quarter of 2026.

End-Of-Year Weakness To Ignite Q1 Rally

On Monday, Ethereum broke above the $3,200 barrier for the first time in nearly a month, hitting a four-week high of $3,259. The cryptocurrency has seen a 8.3% surge from the crucial $3,000 level since Friday, consolidating above the $3,100 level over the weekend.

Now, the King of Altcoins is trying to hold the key resistance level and turn it into support. Amid this performance, some market observers shared a potential setup that could lead to a significant rally during the next three months.

In an X post, analyst Niels affirmed that Ethereum's quarterly close in the red is “not as bearish as it looks.” Notably, the altcoin recorded its worst Q4 in six years after closing the quarter with a negative return of 28.28%, according to CoinGlass data.

This marks ETH's first negative Q4 close since 2022, and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019, when it registered a negative return of 28.9%. Nonetheless, Niels highlighted that this opens the door for an “interesting” setup ahead of the altcoin's expected seasonality.

“History tells an interesting story: every single time ETH has finished Q4 in the red, the next Q1 has closed green,” the analyst explained, asserting that “year-end weakness has usually acted as a reset, not a reversal.”

Per the post, the end-of-year leverage flush and sentiment cooling have previously enabled Ethereum to start the new year “from a cleaner base,” which has allowed the altcoin to register quarterly returns of up to 52% in recent years.

“If that pattern holds, Q4 wasn't the warning; it was the setup heading into Q1,” he suggested.

Ethereum Prepares For 30% Breakout

As the price records an 11% weekly surge, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the cryptocurrency is about to face an important zone that has served as resistance for nearly two months.

Since the early November pullback, the largest altcoin by market capitalization has been trading between the $2,700-$3,400 price range, experiencing strong resistance around the $3,000 and $3,200 levels.

Now that the mid-zone of the range has been momentarily reclaimed, ETH must hold its momentum and turn the upper boundary into support. “A reclaim of this level will pump Ethereum towards the $3,800-$4,000 level,” where the next major resistance is located, Ted explained on Monday morning.

On the contrary, a rejection from this resistance zone could send the ETH price toward the $3,000 support, while risking a longer consolidation within its two-month range.

Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez discussed the altcoin's consolidation, pointing to a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on its chart. According to the analyst, Ethereum has been compressing between the pattern's ascending and descending trendlines since November, awaiting a 30% move.

If the price holds its current breakout from the upper boundary, the cryptocurrency could see a rally toward the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, positioning ETH for a retest of the Q3 levels.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,253, a 3.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Inklings of an Altcoin Rally Are Emerging","https://www.etftrends.com/coinshares-content-hub/inklings-altcoin-rally-emerging/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:15:09 GMT","



Cryptocurrency market participants are revisiting Bitcoin, among others, to start 2026. Could that trend evolve to encompass some of the more credible altcoins? Some signs indicate that may already be taking place. Count the CoinShares Altcoins ETF (DIME) as the prime ETF beneficiary of altcoin momentum.

DIME, which debuted last October, follows the CoinShares Compass Index, which provides broad exposure to higher tier altcoins by pulling from a universe comprised of related exchange traded products listed in the U.S., Canada and Europe. That methodology fortifies the notion that DIME provides exposure to credible assets, not the more speculative side of the altcoin universe. That could prove important as some of the larger altcoins are showing signs of life.

“The Altcoin Season Index is approaching 40% as altcoin market capitalization reclaims $1.3 trillion, indicating that blue-chip altcoins like SOL and XRP may soon outperform Bitcoin, regardless of Bitcoin's directional movement,” reported CryptoNews.

Solana (SOL), which is represented in DIME, has recently been one of the leaders of the altcoin resurgence. Of note to investors considering the CoinShares ETF, Solana is expected to be a major beneficiary of the expansion of prediction markets. Some experts argue Solana will be the top chain for event contract exchanges by the middle of this year.

“Solana dominated all major blockchain networks by revenue in 2025. It is projected to repeat the same feat in 2026, driven by emerging trends such as prediction markets,” reported CoinMarketCap.

Among other DIME holdings that could support upside for the ETF, the technical outlook for Cardano (ADA) is improving. Some crypto market observers believe it's possible that the DIME component could ascend to $2 this year. That implies massive upside potential from current levels.

“The golden cross comes in the aftermath of the price rally in the crypto markets at 2026's start, which saw ADA rise from the Jan. 1 low of $0.331,” according to U. Today. “A golden cross was also completed on the hourly chart as short-term trend signals also improved. The appearance of the golden crosses on Cardano's short-term charts remains significant, accompanied by increased volumes, with ADA now eyeing a crucial breakout above key resistance.”

Near-term benefits could also accrue to DIME due to favorable historical precedent. That is to say, the altcoin market is looking like it did at the start of previous rallies.

“Market conditions now mirror setups that preceded major altcoin rallies in 2017 and 2021. These developments suggest the delayed cycle could activate in the coming quarters,” according to Blockonomi.

When investors talk about building a crypto position, they rarely mean one coin only. The usual move is to anchor a portfolio with a leader, then add a smaller name with more room to grow. Bitcoin is still the most common anchor. But as the market looks ahead to 2026, more people are scanning for a new crypto that can sit next to BTC, not replace it.

That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing up. It is still priced under $0.1, it has a clear product roadmap, and its token sale has already built a large holder base. This is why some market commentators suggest MUTM is becoming a next pick in the potential best crypto to buy now.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $91,100 with a market cap near $1.80T. A key resistance zone sits at $100,000, which is a major psychological and technical level. Many traders expect BTC to test that zone again as market sentiment improves.

BTC remains the top crypto for liquidity and long-term trust. It is the asset many investors use as a base layer. The tradeoff is simple. BTC is already massive. That size can make the next multi-x move harder to achieve quickly, even in a bullish phase.

A “not attractive” BTC prediction is not a crash call. It is the idea that upside may be steady rather than explosive from here. Some analysts believe a 1.2x to 1.4x move is a more realistic near-term range than a sudden 3x. A 1.3x move from $91,100 would imply around $118,430. That is still a strong gain. It is just not the type of return that smaller tokens can sometimes deliver when they are early in their cycle.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a non custodial lending and borrowing protocol. The goal is to let users supply assets, borrow under clear rules, and manage collateral without relying on a centralized operator. The project describes a dual-market design so it can support different lending needs as adoption grows.

This matters because lending protocols are not just tokens. They are systems. A system becomes valuable when people use it repeatedly. Lending and borrowing are naturally repeated actions. Users supply, borrow, repay, and adjust positions over time.

Mutuum Finance has said V1 is being prepared for Sepolia testnet first, then finalized for mainnet, with timing described as coming shortly. The project lists core V1 components as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. It has also said the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral are expected to include ETH and USDT. That V1 step matters because it shifts the project from build mode into trackable readiness. Market watchers stop guessing and start watching execution.

Current presale figures show Mutuum Finance moving into later-stage distribution. Funding has reached $19.6M, supported by around 18,700 holders and roughly 822M MUTM already sold. 

MUTM is priced at $0.04 in presale Phase 7. Since the sale began in early 2025 at $0.01 in Phase 1, the price has climbed 300% through staged increases. Mutuum Finance also references an official launch price of $0.06.

The staged format matters because it changes behavior. Each stage has a set allocation. When one stage sells out, the next stage starts at a higher price. That means later entry points come with fewer tokens per dollar, and it is one reason late phases often feel more competitive.

This is also crucial for investor trust because the sale shows a clear, trackable progression instead of a flat price with unclear demand signals. A growing holder base spread across stages can suggest broader participation, not just a small cluster of wallets. 

The steady climb from stage to stage also acts as a public record of follow-through, since the price only moves higher when prior allocations are absorbed. In plain terms, it is easier for investors to see where the project stands, how far distribution has advanced, and how much of the sale supply has already moved into circulation.

Security is not a side story for lending protocols. It is the base layer of trust, because the system touches collateral, interest flows, and liquidations. Mutuum Finance states that Halborn Security completed an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol. It also cites a CertiK token scan score of 90/100 and references a $50k bug bounty.

The Halborn audit matters because audits focus on the areas that can break a lending system. That includes liquidation logic, rate calculations, and edge cases that happen during fast market moves. It also includes unusual token behavior that can cause accounting errors. Independent review helps reduce uncertainty around whether the core logic can hold up once liquidity grows.

For investors, this is crucial because it separates “concept” from “checked code.” It does not guarantee that nothing can go wrong, but it is one of the strongest readiness signals a developing DeFi crypto project can show before broader usage.

This is also why some market commentators say projects with visible audits tend to get added to watchlists more often. It is easier to treat them seriously when there is public proof of review and testing pressure.

The common approach is simple. BTC is the stability layer. A smaller token is the upside layer. With $500, an investor could place the full amount into BTC and expect slower, steadier returns. Or they could split it, keeping BTC as the base and adding a smaller position in a new cryptocurrency that has clearer early-cycle pricing.

At $0.04, a $500 allocation equals 12,500 MUTM. If MUTM trades at the project's referenced post-launch price of $0.40, that would imply a value of $5000. That is a benchmark scenario.

The reason MUTM gets paired with BTC is that the two assets sit in different phases. BTC is mature and large. MUTM is early and still building toward V1. In crypto investing terms, that pairing gives exposure to both long-term trust and early-stage repricing potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Art Basel Crypto Events: How Blockchain Is Reshaping the Global Art Scene","https://financefeeds.com/art-basel-crypto-events/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:58:51 GMT","

KEY TAKEAWAYS

 

Blockchain technology, a decentralised ledger system protected by encryption, is becoming a major influence in the art world. It solves long-standing problems, including fraud, documenting the history of an artwork, and fairly distributing artists' income. 

A panel discussion at Art Basel's annual Conversations series in Basel, led by journalist Tim Schneider, brought together artist Simon Denny, Verisart CEO Robert Norton, and TRANSFER founder Kelani Nichole to explore the practical and artistic uses of blockchain. 

This event shows how Art Basel is encouraging conversations about how to use crypto in art, which is similar to how blockchain is changing the world by making transactions safer and more open and by creating new types of digital value. 

In addition to these insights, academic research shows how blockchain can help enforce resale royalties (known as droit de suite) and make it easier for people in the EU, US, Australia, and China to create and trade art. 

The NFT market grew to $4 billion in monthly sales during the pandemic, with 80% of those purchases made by retail consumers. This shows blockchain's capacity to change things, but it won't be easy. This article examines these changes from a research perspective, drawing on expert perspectives and scholarly analysis to show how blockchain is transforming the art world.

One of the biggest problems in the art market is determining whether a piece of art is genuine and where it came from, especially if the artist is no longer alive. The Fine Arts Expert Institute in Geneva released a 2014 report stating that more than half of the works of art they examined were either fake or misattributed. 

Blockchain solves this problem by keeping a decentralised, unchangeable record of transactions on millions of computers. This stops hacking or corruption from happening in one place. This broken-up structure keeps data safe and unchangeable, and it uses timestamps and cryptographic signatures to track who owns what.

Experts stress the practical applications of blockchain at Art Basel's crypto-focused events. Robert Norton, the founder and CEO of Verisart, a platform that verifies art on the blockchain, said during the panel, “When it comes to selling art, two things are important…” Is the art authentic, and do I have the right to sell it to you?

 This demonstrates that blockchain not only verifies the authenticity of works of art but also confirms that sellers have the right to sell them, making the marketplace safer and more trustworthy. 

Scholarly studies support this, stating that blockchain's ability to trace the origins of items reduces the risk of forgeries common in traditional marketplaces, where uncertain ownership histories can lead to disputes. 

Blockchain builds confidence by putting transaction information in a ledger that can't be changed. This might make the art market less secretive and encourage more collectors who are worried about fraud to get involved.

Art Basel's crypto events have shown how blockchain can be used to create new kinds of art and attract a new group of collectors. Digital collectibles are turning art ownership into a game, as shown by projects like CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game where players can buy, breed, and sell virtual cats. 

During the Codex Art Auction, one-of-a-kind CryptoKitties editions sold for as much as USD 140,000. This shows that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are popular as unique digital assets. 

There are also blockchain-inspired works of art, such as French artist Youl's The Last Bitcoin Supper, which sold for almost $3,000 on eBay in 2014, and Plantoids, which are artificial plants that interact with people through cryptocurrency donations. The panellists in Art Basel's Conversations series provided important insights into this change. 

Robert Norton said that those who buy CryptoKitties “don't want to buy traditional art… What they're buying is a new kind of digital collectible.” He said this is because people who don't like traditional art forms are drawn to it. Artist Simon Denny has long been interested in blockchain as both a subject and a medium. 

He is part of a new movement that includes Bitcoin graffiti and works with cryptocurrency themes. However, it is still hard to get these gamified works into traditional galleries because they are similar to Takashi Murakami's infinite editions but are not widely accepted by cultural collectors. 

NFT platforms like OpenSea let creators set royalty terms in smart contracts, which automates 5–10% resale fees and makes it easier for more people to own a piece of art by enabling fractional ownership. The NFT surge during the pandemic, when 80% of transactions were made by regular customers, shows how blockchain could help the art world expand beyond elite circles.

Blockchain's smart contracts are changing the way resale royalties work by automating payments to artists on secondary sales and fixing problems in traditional markets. In the EU, Directive 2001/84/EC requires royalties, and in one year, it gave artists €10.1 million. 

The Copyright Agency and other groups have made $11 million under Australia's Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009. 

On the other hand, the US doesn't have any federal laws, and California's Act is currently under review by the courts. According to the 2020 Copyright Law Amendment, China's regulated strategy focuses on digital collectibles and limits speculative trading to lower financial risks.

 At Art Basel events, people talk about how well blockchain works in this field. Smart contracts ensure artists receive their fair share of sales (for example, 2.5% on OpenSea) by tracking transactions in a way that can't be altered. 

However, from 2023, platforms have made them optional. This technology makes things more open and secure by eliminating middlemen and enabling the enforcement of rules worldwide, even when laws differ across jurisdictions. 

Experts at Art Basel and elsewhere point out the bigger picture: the “code is law” idea of blockchain makes distribution easier, but it needs consistent rules to address legal problems.

Blockchain is making art more accessible by eliminating barriers to entry. This lets artists and purchasers from all around the world interact without traditional gatekeepers. NFT markets let people trade directly. 

For example, China's digital Dunhuang collections promote cultural heritage while following stringent rules. Tokenisation enables fractional ownership, making high-value art accessible to smaller investors and helping make the global art scene more open to everyone.

The Bitcoin panels at Art Basel criticise how this change has made things more like products. Simon Denny said, “A lot of the interest in art and blockchain seems to come from people who aren't really interested in art.” They genuinely just want to find a new way to make money. “When you buy a piece of art, you're not just clicking to buy it; you're falling in love with it,” Kelani Nichole said.

“This is a different kind of transaction; it's based on relationships,” they said, cautioning against putting assets first as they do with software companies. 

Research supports these concerns by highlighting privacy issues, the potential for duplicate minting in NFTs, and the risk of money laundering. It also calls for balanced ecosystems that allow for new ideas while still following the rules.

Blockchain has significant potential, but it faces challenges in the art industry. There are concerns due to technical problems, such as relying on “code is law” for enforcement, and regulatory problems, such as China's bans on unregulated NFTs. 

According to the Art Market 2.0 report, experts at Art Basel say the current art market situation is like the internet in 1993, suggesting that early adoption may not yield clear long-term benefits.

Future regulations should ensure that mechanisms for fair royalties and innovation work together, so that markets are ready for digital progress. These talks will help blockchain become more widely used, which might be good for art in a broader cultural sense if Art Basel continues to sponsor crypto events.

What is blockchain's primary benefit in the art market?

Blockchain provides secure, decentralized records for verifying artwork authenticity and provenance, making transactions safer and more transparent.

How do NFTs reshape art collecting?

NFTs enable unique digital ownership, as seen in projects like CryptoKitties, attracting new collectors through gamified, accessible formats.

What role do smart contracts play in resale royalties?

Smart contracts automate royalty distributions on resales, allowing artists to embed percentage fees (e.g., 5-10%) directly into transactions.

How is blockchain democratizing art?

It lowers barriers by facilitating global, intermediary-free trading and fractional ownership, expanding access to diverse creators and buyers.

What challenges does blockchain face in art?

Issues include privacy concerns, legal differences across countries, and a focus on monetization over cultural value, as experts have critiqued.

To address the limitations of lightweight medical blockchains in terms of data query efficiency and nonexistence proofs, we propose a novel lightweight medical blockchain data query scheme. First, the XGBoost algorithm is employed to predict medical data weights, with high-weight data storage near the blockchain's root nodes being prioritized, thereby optimizing the storage architecture and enhancing query efficiency. Second, an efficient query method that combines aggregated Bloom filters and Merkle–Huffman (MH) trees is designed. Through segmented filtering and weight optimization, the query path length is reduced, improving the on-chain data query performance. Finally, to address the challenge of the data nonexistence proof, we propose a multi-node collaborative verification mechanism that integrates Bloom filters with a dynamic reputation system. By adaptively selecting high-credibility nodes and employing multi-node consensus, false positives are minimized, ensuring query accuracy and reliability. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, compared with existing schemes, the proposed approach improves the query efficiency by approximately 15%. Moreover, integrating multi-node collaborative verification with a dynamic reputation mechanism effectively mitigates malicious attack risk and enhances system security, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained scenarios such as mobile health care.

Medical data sharing is crucial for resource integration and for optimizing diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient experience and health care quality1. As the core component of medical data sharing, data queries directly impact the efficiency and accuracy of the shared system. However, current medical data query systems suffer from poor interoperability2, low efficiency3, and privacy leaks4. With its decentralized architecture, distributed storage, and tamper-resistant properties, blockchain technology provides a novel solution that enhances both the performance5 and security6 of medical data queries.

Most existing blockchain-based data query solutions are integrated with cloud storage models, where data are encrypted and stored in the cloud, while only index information is maintained in the blockchain. For example, Samala et al.7 proposed an electronic health record management system that enables data sharing and querying by storing data in the cloud and preserving index information in the blockchain. Kumari et al.8 introduced the HealthRec-Chain framework, which integrates the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) with blockchain technology to increase data security and query efficiency. Li et al.9 developed a blockchain-based distributed cloud storage system incorporating reliable deduplication mechanisms and storage balancing capabilities, which achieves sharded data distribution and load balancing through secret sharing and heuristic matching algorithms. However, while these advancements demonstrate notable progress in enhancing access efficiency for blockchain-based storage systems, the cloud storage implementation paradigm exhibits inherent limitations in system autonomy, degree of decentralization, and security assurance due to its reliance on third-party cloud resources.

To achieve greater decentralization and data autonomy, data can be directly stored in the blockchain. However, as data continuously accumulate in the form of blocks, synchronizing the entire blockchain at each node significantly increases the storage and bandwidth demands. To address this issue, researchers have proposed lightweight blockchain architectures10, where resource-rich nodes act as full nodes, maintaining a complete blockchain backup, whereas resource-limited nodes function as light nodes, storing only block headers and other essential metadata. This approach effectively reduces storage pressure while maintaining decentralization. As a representative example, the EDCOMA framework proposed by Yu et al.11 extends this foundation by integrating dual compression with zero-knowledge proofs, developing an efficient lightweight auditing mechanism that effectively reduces resource consumption during the auditing process. This innovation demonstrates particular applicability in resource-constrained storage node environments.

While lightweight blockchain architectures reduce storage demands, a key challenge remains in further improving query efficiency and accuracy. To increase query efficiency, Yang et al.12 proposed a verifiable query scheme based on an off-chain committee (CVCQ) to address cross-chain query challenges in large-scale blockchain-enabled IoT (BIoT) systems. By decoupling data queries and consensus processes into off-chain committee operations, this approach reduces consensus complexity while utilizing aggregated accumulators to minimize cross-chain data integrity verification overhead to constant level, thereby improving cross-regional query throughput. Nevertheless, the CVCQ scheme primarily targets IoT environments with geographical partitioning characteristics, requiring further validation regarding its adaptability and efficiency in medical blockchain scenarios. Li et al.13 developed the FlexIM system, which employs reinforcement learning to dynamically select optimal index configurations based on query workload characteristics. Through innovative designs of Root Merkle Tree (RMT) and Bloom-filter Merkle Tree (BMT), the system reduces storage overhead while preserving verifiability, consequently improving query efficiency. However, its index benefit evaluation model shows insufficient consideration of dynamic weight allocation for data characteristics, and lacks specialized optimization for index coordination and verification in cross-chain query scenarios. Xiao et al.14 introduced a two-phase distributed query framework with noise injection, leveraging blockchain's autonomous features to effectively conceal retrieval patterns while enhancing query efficiency. Yet, the multi-phase communication and reorganization overhead incurred from data partitioning and result aggregation may substantially increase system latency in large-scale or cross-chain query environments, potentially compromising efficiency gains. Zhang et al.15 proposed a multilevel indexing method, which partitions the blockchain using a weight matrix. Within each partition, the master chain constructs indices via a skip-consistent hashing algorithm, whereas secondary indices are built on slave chains using Bloom filters and skip lists. However, this indexing approach requires additional storage space, and the index size directly affects the query speed. Jia et al.16 proposed a three-layer model consisting of a data evaluation layer, a storage layer, and a distribution layer. By extracting medical data features and using the extreme learning machine method to predict and evaluate the weights of medical data, they achieved data storage and querying on the blockchain. However, this approach requires sequential traversal of blocks during queries, resulting in low query efficiency. Liu et al.17 introduced a quad-Merkle tree structure combined with smart contracts to improve query efficiency. Nevertheless, this quadtree-based structure still encounters efficiency bottlenecks when handling large-scale medical data and high-frequency repeated queries. Moreover, this method still requires block-by-block traversal during queries, leading to suboptimal overall query efficiency.

Moreover, to ensure the accuracy of the query results, verification of the retrieved data is needed. Currently, there are two mainstream approaches for verifiable queries. One approach involves constructing a verifiable data structure on the basis of cryptographic accumulators. However, this method incurs high verification costs, and the large number of generated key pairs not only reduces the query speed but also increases the complexity of key management. The other approach uses the hash verification property of Merkle trees to construct verifiable data structures. For example, Sun et al.18 designed a simplified Merkle-B tree structure that verifies the Merkle root by returning a validation path, thereby ensuring the existence and integrity of query results and preventing data tampering. However, when a query result is nonexistent, most existing methods overlook providing a nonexistence proof, allowing malicious nodes to launch denial-of-service attacks. To address this issue, Zhang et al.19 proposed the introduction of the Merkle mountain range (MMR), where full nodes possess the latest valid blocks to light nodes, ensuring the trustworthiness of the query results. However, this approach requires proofs be generated for each query, leading to high communication overhead. With respect to proofs for nonexistent query results, most existing methods assume fully trusted nodes and commonly adopt sorted Merkle trees. For example, Cheng et al.20 first sorted the elements before storing the data in leaf nodes. To prove the nonexistence of a specific element, the method must demonstrate that the element does not exist between two adjacent existing elements. However, this proof method is restricted to sorted structures and requires high storage costs for path proofs, making it unsuitable for scenarios with high complexity and frequent repetition in medical data queries.

To address the issues of low query efficiency in lightweight medical blockchain systems and the limitations of nonexistence proofs in sorted Merkle trees, this paper proposes a novel lightweight medical blockchain data query method. The main contributions of this study are as follows:

To address imbalanced query frequencies and inefficient retrieval of high-frequency medical data, we propose a medical data storage scheme based on weight prediction. By leveraging the XGBoost algorithm to predict data access weights and optimize the blockchain storage structure, high-weight data are stored closer to the root node with priority, improving retrieval efficiency and reducing query overhead.

To increase the query efficiency and eliminate the need for block-by-block searches, we introduce a query method that combines aggregated Bloom filters and a Merkle Huffman (MH) tree. By segmenting blocks and applying an aggregated Bloom filter matrix within each segment, irrelevant blocks are rapidly filtered out during queries. For intrablock searches, the MH tree structure places higher-weight nodes closer to the root, increasing the query speed.

To overcome the limitations of sorted Merkle trees in proving data nonexistence, we propose a collaborative multinode verification method that integrates Bloom filters with a reputation mechanism. This method dynamically selects high-trust nodes for queries on the basis of a reputation model and directly generates nonexistence proofs using Bloom filters, ensuring efficient verification. When false positives occur in the Bloom filter, multinode collaborative verification is employed to reach consensus, further enhancing the trustworthiness of the query results.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 “Problem statement” presents the problem statement, provides a detailed discussion of the challenges in lightweight medical blockchain data queries and highlights the necessity of this research. Section 3 “Weight prediction-based lightweight medical blockchain storage architecture” systematically elaborates on the proposed lightweight medical blockchain architecture on the basis of weight prediction. Section 4 “Data query methods and nonexistence proofs” introduces the specific query method that integrates aggregated Bloom filters and the MH tree, along with the multinode verification mechanism based on reputation. Section 5 “Feasibility analysis of the proposed scheme” conducts theoretical and simulation-based analyses of the proposed scheme and demonstrates its advantages by comparing it with other existing solutions. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary in Section 6 “Conclusion”.

In blockchain systems, blocks consist of a block header and block body. The chain structure inherently limits data query efficiency, which can be categorized into interblock and intrablock searches.

During the interblock query process, not all blocks contain relevant query results. To improve query efficiency and avoid unnecessary intrablock queries in irrelevant blocks, the Bloom filter (BF)21, an efficient data structure, can be utilized. As shown in Fig. 1, the Bloom filter-based block-by-block search process consists of a binary bit array of length m and k hash functions. When an element is inserted, the process uses k hash functions to map the element to k index positions ranging from 1 to m and sets the corresponding k positions to 1 to indicate the element's presence. During querying, the system checks the bit array using the same k hash calculations. If any of these positions is 0, the element is definitively not in the set. If all the positions are 1, the element is likely present, but false positives may occur.

As shown in the Bloom filter on the right side of Fig. 1, assuming that k = 3 and m = 16, element \({e_1}\)is in set S, whereas elements \({e_2}\) and \({e_3}\) are not in the set. After three hash calculations are performed for elements \({e_1},{e_2}\) and \({e_3}\), all corresponding index positions of \({e_1}\) are set to 1, indicating that the element is present in the set. Since the corresponding index positions of \({e_2}\) are not all 1, it can be conclusively proven that the element is not in the set. After three hash calculations are performed for \({e_3}\), the corresponding index positions in this Bloom filter ‘coincidentally' all become 1, although \({e_3}\) is actually not present in the set. This type of error caused by hash collisions is termed a false-positive.

By adding a Bloom filter field in the block header, all attribute values within the block can be added to the Bloom filter. During subsequent query processes, the block's potential inclusion of query results can be verified by sequentially comparing Bloom filters in block headers. All corresponding index positions in the Bloom filter will be 1 only if valid data exist or a false-positive occurs. In such cases, an intrablock query must be performed. Although Bloom filters inherently exhibit false positives, the error rate can be reduced by adjusting the filter length (m) and the number of hash functions (k). To construct a Bloom filter containing n data entries, the selection of filter length m and hash functions k is determined by Formula(1):

Here, the false-positive rate p of Bloom filters corresponding to different k and m/n values can be referenced through the Bloom filter parameter table22.

However, this block-header-embedded Bloom filter query approach still requires sequential block-by-block Bloom filter comparisons, resulting in suboptimal query efficiency. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an aggregated Bloom filter mechanism that eliminates irrelevant blocks through batch verification, thereby avoiding exhaustive block-by-block searches and significantly improving query efficiency.

Bloom filter-based block-by-block lookup process.

Blockchain data are stored in the leaf nodes of the Merkle tree within the block body. The leaf nodes directly contain either raw data entries or their hash digests, whereas nonleaf nodes are constructed by recursively hashing the concatenated values of their child nodes. Through this hierarchical hashing process, the Merkle tree ultimately produces a root hash that ensures data integrity and consistency.

Intrablock queries aim to increase the efficiency of Merkle tree lookups. As data are concentrated in leaf nodes, their structure can be optimized. The improved structure shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that Merkle trees can be extended into more efficient structures, such as Merkle-B and Merkle-B + trees. Specifically, the Merkle-B tree increases the query speed by adding indices to nonleaf nodes, whereas the Merkle-B + tree further improves the query performance by incorporating linked list structures in leaf nodes on the basis of the B-tree framework.

However, medical data queries exhibit distinct distribution characteristics of ‘hotspot data' (frequently accessed data) and ‘low-frequency data'. The data heat level in Fig. 2 represents the query frequency, where higher heat values correspond to greater access counts. Taking the query of Data 4 in Fig. 2 as an example, Merkle, Merkle-B, and Merkle-B + trees lack frequency-based optimizations, resulting in equivalent query times for high- and low-frequency data. Specifically, Merkle trees rely on sequential hash-layer verification, whereas Merkle-B and Merkle-B + trees incorporate index structures; however, their query path lengths remain unchanged irrespective of the data access frequency. Moreover, as the data volume increases, the access efficiency of hotspot data gradually decreases due to increasing tree depth. To address this, we propose a weight prediction model for medical data prioritization and introduce the MH tree structure, which places high-weight data closer to the root node. This design enhances hotspot data retrieval efficiency while mitigating the adverse effects of tree depth on query performance.

Query performance comparison across different tree structures.

In lightweight blockchain architectures, the block header retains only the key information, and the full node retains the complete block data. The query process is illustrated in Fig. 3. A light node must verify the query result returned by the full node. When a query result exists, it can be verified using the simple payment verification (SPV) mechanism10, whose workflow is detailed in the upper-right part of Fig. 3. The SPV mechanism verifies the authenticity of the result by comparing the Merkle root computed from the verification path with the hash root stored in the light node. For example, to verify the existence of element 4, its hash value H2 must be obtained along with hash values H1 and H6. The verification process is as follows: H1 and H2 are combined to compute H5, and H5 and H6 are then hashed to derive H7. If the computed root matches the hash root stored in the light node, the existence and integrity of element 4 are confirmed. These sibling nodes collectively form the Merkle verification path for root reconstruction.

When the query results indicate nonexistence, assuming fully trusted nodes, the current solutions primarily employ sorted Merkle trees10 to validate the accuracy of the results. As depicted in the lower-right section of Fig. 3, sorted Merkle trees arrange all the elements in ascending order within the tree structure, with smaller elements positioned leftward and larger elements rightward. To prove that an element is absent, the sorted Merkle tree must return the Merkle verification paths of its closest predecessor and successor nodes. Since these adjacent elements are verifiably present in the tree, their verification paths can be generated to obtain the Merkle root. However, the sorted Merkle tree's ordered structure has the following limitations:

High complexity in verifying boundary nodes. When queried data reside at structural boundaries, auxiliary proof mechanisms are needed to demonstrate nonexistence.

A larger proof size and higher verification overhead. Nonexistence proofs necessitate that verification paths be returned for both adjacent nodes, doubling the verification cost compared with single-path proofs for existence verification.

Latency in element ordering and potential security risks. The construction of sorted Merkle trees requires data sorting, which introduces significant preprocessing time. Furthermore, the ordered structure may expose data sequence information through order-sensitive proofs.

Lightweight blockchain query process.

However, medical data are characterized by large-scale data volumes and high privacy sensitivity. To address the limitations in nonexistence verification mechanisms of sorted Merkle trees, this paper proposes a reputation-based multinode collaborative verification framework. This approach reduces sorting-induced overhead while mitigating information exposure risks inherent to ordered structures.

The lightweight medical blockchain storage framework based on weight prediction is architecturally depicted in Fig. 4. The system as a whole consists of three parts: data collection and privacy processing, weight prediction and on-chain storage, and efficient on-chain query for light nodes. Aiming at the problems of low query efficiency and high verification cost faced by directly using traditional Bloom filters in medical blockchain, this paper designs an aggregated Bloom filter(ABF) structure to improve the query efficiency between blocks. By combining the weight prediction model and the MH tree structure, the storage location of data in the Merkle tree is optimized to increase the query speed within blocks. To address the potential false positive issue of Bloom filters, the system further introduces a multi-node collaborative verification mechanism. By collecting and comparing independent verification results from multiple trusted nodes, it ensures the accuracy and credibility of the query results. The specific implementation process of the plan is as follows:

Data collection and privacy processing: As shown in the top layer of Fig. 4, the data management agency is responsible for collecting medical data generated from various hospitals, which includes basic patient information, diagnosis and treatment records, imaging data, test results, etc. To protect patient privacy, the data center categorizes the collected medical data and applies encryption or data anonymization to personally identifiable and sensitive health information.

Weight prediction and data storage: As shown in the middle layer of Fig. 4, medical data undergo weight prediction before being stored on-chain because of the varying ‘values' of different data types. According to the weight prediction results, data are hierarchically organized in the block's Merkle tree, with higher-weight data placed closer to the root node to enhance retrieval efficiency. This medical blockchain adopts a distributed architecture composed of full nodes and light nodes. Full nodes store the complete blockchain data, maintaining network security and integrity despite partial node failures. In contrast, light nodes retain only critical information, such as block headers, reducing storage requirements while improving overall network efficiency.

Query process: As shown in the bottom layer of Fig. 4, During the data query process, the light node acts as a query agent, forwarding the user's query request to the full node to obtain the target data. The efficient search of on-chain data is achieved through the collaboration of aggregated Bloom filters and the MH tree structure: The system first uses ABF to quickly locate the possible block where the target data may be, and then completes the search within the block through the MH tree structure. In the event of the inherent false positive situation of the Bloom filter, the system will automatically trigger a multi-node collaborative verification mechanism. By comparing the verification results of multiple independent reputation nodes, it can eliminate misjudgments and ensure the accuracy of the query results. The complete implementation method of the query process will be elaborated in detail in Sect. 4.

Due to the high sensitivity of medical data, different users have varying access requirements and permissions for the data. Medical institutions usually need to comprehensively search all medical data in disease research or patient treatment, while patients can only view their own medical records, and third-party institutions can only access the data of specific personnel related to them. Therefore, when a proxy query request is initiated to a light node, the light node will return the data that the object can view based on the permission of the object to be accessed, thereby maintaining the security of the system.

Weight prediction-based lightweight medical blockchain storage framework.

The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm23 demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency in predictive tasks, making it the preferred method for training our medical data weight prediction model. The subsequent data are assigned differentiated weights through this trained model. XGBoost's core principle is to strategically combine multiple weak learners (decision trees) into a high-performance ensemble model, significantly enhancing the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, regularization techniques mitigate overfitting risks, ensuring that the model can be generalized effectively to unseen data. The objective function constructed from each subtree is formulated as follows:

Where \(l({y_i},\hat {y}_{i}^{{\left( t \right)}})\) denotes the loss function, which quantifies the model's fitting performance; \(\Omega ({f_k})\) represents the regularization term, introduced to mitigate overfitting; \({y_i}\) denotes the ground truth, and \(\hat {y}_{i}^{{\left( t \right)}}\) represents the prediction of the t-th decision tree. In this study, key medical data features are extracted, and XGBoost is leveraged to construct a data weight prediction model.

Since a single medical data record contains numerous attributes, this paper selects only three features for model training: basic information (including age, gender, etc.), health characteristics (including height, weight, behavioral habits, etc.), and medical information (including treatment cycle, medication usage, diagnostic data, etc.). These features can be used to assess the value of medical data accurately in most cases. The XGBoost-based medical data weight prediction model is shown in Fig. 5. The model determines the weight of data by extracting these three features (basic information, health characteristics, and medical information) from raw data. Considering the inconsistency and diversity of medical data types, we extract the following factors from these three features as weight determinants: age, body mass index (BMI), treatment cycle, behavioral habits, sex, admission status, and diagnostic data.

The three categories of features in the medical dataset include both numerical and categorical variables. To enhance model performance and reproducibility, different transformation strategies were employed during the data preprocessing stage to achieve a unified representation of features. Categorical variables, including gender, behavioral habits, admission status, and diagnostic information, were uniformly encoded using label encoding. This method assigns a unique integer label to each category, thereby converting original discrete variables into numerical features that are compatible with the model. Numerical variables, such as age, BMI, and treatment duration, were normalized using the Z-score standardization method. This approach transforms each feature into a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 based on the statistical properties (mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\)) of the training data, thereby achieving feature standardization. The data processing steps are shown in the upper part of Fig. 5.

XGBoost-based medical data weight prediction model.

During the model training stage, XGBoost trains multiple weak learners (decision trees) in an iterative manner to progressively optimize the predictive performance. Initially, the first weak learner generates predictions on the basis of input features and computes residual errors. Each subsequent weak learner is trained using the residuals from the previous iteration as the target variable, gradually reducing the number of prediction errors. Finally, a strong learner is formed by aggregating the weighted outputs of all weak learners to predict medical data weights. The model training process is depicted in the lower section of Fig. 5, while Algorithm 1 provides the detailed implementation of the weight prediction model.

Algorithm 1 XGBoost-based medical data weight prediction model.

To evaluate the predictive capability of the proposed weight prediction model, the coefficient of determination (\({R^2}\)), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) are adopted for assessment. The \({R^2}\) value reflects the model's goodness-of-fit to the sample data, with values closer to 1 indicating that the model effectively explains the variance of the target variable, demonstrating strong predictive performance; a smaller RMSE signifies that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values; and the MAE represents the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, reflecting the average magnitude of the prediction errors. The relevant calculation formulas are as follows:

where n is the number of samples in the test set; \({y_i}\) is the actual value of the test sample; \(\hat {y}\) is the predicted value of the test sample; and \(\overline {{{y_i}}}\) is the mean of the actual values in the test set.

Due to the huge scale of medical data, the traditional blockchain structure has a relatively low efficiency in querying each block one by one. For inter-block and intra-block queries, this paper respectively employs aggregated Bloom filters and MH tree structures to enhance query efficiency.

Introducing a Bloom filter into the block header can avoid intrablock queries for irrelevant blocks. However, this method still requires sequential comparisons across blocks, prompting an enhancement of the Bloom filter-based interblock search mechanism.

Starting from the genesis block, every n consecutive blocks form a segment. Each block's Bloom filter uses a fixed-length bit array of m bits, creating an n×m bit matrix. Transposing this matrix enables rapid filtering of irrelevant blocks through correlation calculations on its row vectors. Figure 6 illustrates the intersegment search process using the aggregated Bloom filter matrix (ABFM): Blocks i to i + 5 (with n = 6 and m = 8) form a segment. Their Bloom filter bit matrix is transposed. Rows represent vectors composed of all segment blocks' Bloom filter bits, whereas columns correspond to individual blocks' Bloom filters.

By segmenting blocks and constructing the ABFM within segments, irrelevant blocks can be filtered directly, eliminating sequential block-by-block searches. For a given query keyword w, the query process is as follows: The hash value of w is computed and converted into a Bloom filter-related binary code; row vectors are selected where all hash-mapped bit positions are 1; bitwise AND operations are performed on the corresponding row vectors in the ABFM to identify candidate blocks. Since Bloom filters may produce false positives, blocks falsely identified as containing the query result must undergo an intrablock lookup step. If no matching data are found, a nonexistence proof is returned.

Intrasegment aggregated-Bloom-filter-based lookup process.

Taking Fig. 6 as an example, assume that hashing the query data results in the bit sequence 10,100,001 (with the Bloom filter length set to 8 and the number of feature fields set to 3). Within this block segment, if the first, third, and eighth bits in a block header's Bloom filter are all set to 1, that block may contain the query result. The bit positions set to 1 in 10,100,001 correspond directly to the first, third, and eighth rows of the transposed Bloom filter matrix. Their respective row vectors are 100,111 (Row 1), 111,010 (Row 3), and 101,111 (Row 8). Applying a bitwise AND operation to these three row vectors yields 100,010. The bits set to 1 in the first and fifth positions indicate that Block i and Block i + 4 (corresponding to positions 1 and 5 in Fig. 6) within the segment may contain the query result. All other blocks in the segment can be immediately disregarded, enabling rapid filtering of irrelevant blocks.

To improve query efficiency, incorporates the concept of the Huffman tree into the Merkle tree framework, constructing a hybrid structure termed the Merkle-Huffman Tree (MH Tree). The core methodology is as follows: when data is stored on the blockchain, a weight prediction model assigns a weight to each data item, and data with higher weights are positioned closer to the root node. This approach retains the rapid verification capability of the Merkle tree while enhancing query efficiency by reducing the average access path for high-frequency data. Taking the query for data node a3 in Fig. 7 as an example, the verification path in the conventional Merkle tree structure consists of nodes a4, H12, and H5 (left side of Fig. 7); whereas in the MH Tree structure, the verification path comprises nodes H12 and H45 (right side of Fig. 7). The Weighted Path Length (WPL) for both the Merkle tree and the MH Tree structures are presented in formulas (6) and (7), respectively:

Here, n represents the number of nodes, \({w_i}\) denotes the weight of the data item, and \({d_i}\) indicates the height of the leaf node within the tree. The WPL value is 121 for the MH tree but 168 for the Merkle tree. The lower WPL of the MH tree results in shorter average access paths during queries, reducing the traversal distance of intermediate nodes. This optimization simultaneously improves the query efficiency and enhances the data verification performance.

Query structures of Merkle trees and MH trees.

The intrablock search process based on the MH tree is detailed in Algorithm 2. Leveraging the MH tree's characteristics, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is employed for intrablock queries. During the search, the queue stores both the current node's information and relevant sibling node data to facilitate Merkle verification path generation.

Algorithm 2 MH Tree-based Intrablock Search Algorithm.

In the MH-Tree structure, data weights are determined and fixed by a prediction model during block generation. However, in practical application scenarios, low-weight data may experience sudden spikes in access demand. The lack of a dynamic adjustment mechanism could compromise overall query performance. To address this, a sliding window is introduced in the block header to monitor in real time the access frequency of data within the block. Each time a new query is added to the window, the earliest query record is removed. The popularity factor \({{\text{h}}_i}\) for a data item i is calculated based on its access count \({f_i}\) within the window W, as follows:\({{\text{h}}_{\text{i}}}={{{f_i}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{f_i}} W}} \right. \kern-0pt} W}\). The comprehensive weight of the data is jointly determined by the predicted weight and the dynamic popularity factor:

Here, \(w_{i}^{{pred}}\) denotes the static weight computed by the prediction model during block generation, and the parameter \(\lambda \in [0,1]\) is a balancing coefficient that adjusts the influence of static prediction and dynamic access patterns. By dynamically adjusting the comprehensive weight of low-weight data, adaptive optimization for sudden access patterns can be achieved without modifying the on-chain MH-Tree structure.

In the proposed scheme, if the aggregated Bloom filter returns no false positives during a query, its result directly proves that data do not exist. When false positives occur, a ‘data nonexistence proof' must be generated. To address the challenges posed by Bloom filter false positives, this paper introduces a reputation-based multinode collaborative verification mechanism. By leveraging collaborative verification from multiple nodes to prove the nonexistence of query results, this mechanism compensates for the Bloom filter's limitations in false-positive scenarios, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of the overall verification scheme.

In the decentralized network environment, a node reputation evaluation mechanism is introduced because the trustworthiness of a single node cannot be fully guaranteed. When a lightweight node selects a full node to send a query request, the reputation score of the full node is used as a core indicator to evaluate its trustworthiness. The higher the reputation score is, the greater its reliability, and the more likely it is that a lightweight node will send a query to such a node. The reputation of a node is determined by four factors: the query accuracy, response time, query participation rate, and reputation decay mechanism. In practice, the query frequency of health care blockchains is usually very high. Broadcasting reputation updates to all nodes after each query would incur considerable communication overhead. To solve this problem, the proposed scheme uses a periodic adjustment strategy to calculate the reputation. After completing a query cycle, the reputation scores of all nodes are updated in bulk. The node reputation calculation is formalized in formula (9):

In this context, \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{pre}}}}\) denotes the node's reputation after completing the previous query cycle, \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{query}}}}\) represents the reputation value associated with query operations, D represents the reputation decay mechanism, \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{res}}}}\) corresponds to response time performance, and \({{\text{R}}_{\text{p}}}\) indicates the number of node recommendations.

In formula (9), \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{query}}}}\) represents the query-specific reputation value. When a full node provides valid query results, its reputation increases; conversely, if it acts maliciously by supplying false results, the reputation decreases. To prevent malicious nodes from rapidly restoring their reputation after intentional misconduct, the reputation adjustment for query operations follows a nonlinear pattern. The query-related reputation calculation is defined in formula (10):

Here, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) denote the correlation coefficients, whereas \({s_c}\) and \({e^{{f_c}}}\) represent the numbers of successes and failures for queries within a single query cycle, respectively.

In formula (9), D represents the reputation decay mechanism. To prevent unbounded growth of node reputation scores, a natural decay mechanism is introduced, thereby avoiding scenarios where nodes maintain excessively high reputation scores indefinitely after providing correct query results over time. If a node's reputation consistently remains the highest, lightweight nodes will increasingly prioritize sending queries to this full node, which risks transforming it into an ‘oligopoly' node. The reputation decay calculation is formalized in formula (11):

Here, \(\gamma\) and k denote correlation coefficients, and t represents a time period.

In formula (9), \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{res}}}}\) corresponds to the response time metric, which reflects the node's bandwidth resources and related network performance indicators. The calculation of \({{\text{R}}_{{\text{res}}}}\) is defined in formula (12):

Here, \(\delta\) denotes the correlation coefficient, \({q_t}\) represents the node's response time for the current query, and \({r_t}\) indicates the minimum response time threshold.

In formula (9), \({{\text{R}}_{\text{p}}}\)corresponds to the number of recommendations, which quantifies how frequently the node participates in queries within a cycle. This metric reflects the node's proactiveness in query operations. The calculation of \({{\text{R}}_{\text{p}}}\) is defined in formula (13):

Here, \(\epsilon\) denotes the correlation coefficient, and x represents the participation count.

By integrating formulas (10)−(13), the node reputation within a query cycle is calculated as shown in formula (14):

Here, the coefficients \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are query related and have the greatest impact on node reputation scores, with assigned values of 0.1 and 0.8, respectively; \(\gamma\), \(\delta\), and \(\epsilon\) are set to 0.1; and k is 0.5. These coefficients are dynamically adjustable to accommodate varying query requirements under different conditions.

When a Bloom filter generates false positives, leading to misjudgments, the verification result from a single node may fail to reflect the actual scenario. To address this shortcoming, this paper proposes a multinode collaborative verification mechanism. Lightweight nodes broadcast query requests to multiple full nodes and synthesize verification results from these nodes to reach consensus, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of verification.

Node reputation scores are defined within the range of 0–100. For nodes with reputation scores below 50, a tiered penalty mechanism is implemented. For light penalties, when a full node's reputation falls below the lower threshold (50), the system reduces its query response priority. For moderate penalties, if the node's reputation persistently decreases below 40, the system restricts its participation frequency in query operations. For severe penalties, when a full node's reputation score decrease to below 30, the system permanently removes the node and broadcasts its malicious behavior to the entire network.

The multinode collaborative verification mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 8. A lightweight node randomly selects a full node with a reputation score above 60 to initiate a query, and the selected full node must return the final query result along with supporting proof information. If the query result indicates nonexistence, a multinode verification process is triggered. The verification process proceeds as follows: First, the number of verification nodes is determined on the basis of the reputation score of the initial full node that provided the query result, with all verification nodes required to have reputation scores exceeding 70. If the initial node's reputation score is 95 or higher, 3 verification nodes are selected. For every 5-point decrease in reputation below 95, one additional verification node is added. The logic for determining the number of verification nodes is formalized in formula (15):

Here, R denotes the node's reputation score, N represents the number of verification nodes, and \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) indicates the ceiling function. Verification nodes must have a reputation score of 70 or higher. The verification nodes then perform consensus validation on the query result. If the consensus confirms the data's existence, full nodes that falsely reported nonexistence are penalized by reducing their reputation scores. Nodes with reputation scores below a critical threshold are permanently removed from the network. Finally, the system returns the definitive query result, terminating the verification process.

Multinode collaborative verification flowchart.

The multinode collaborative verification mechanism not only ensures the authenticity and consistency of the query results but also mitigates the risks inherent to single-node verification. In the context of medical blockchain applications, where most data are historically authentic, the probability of nonexistent data is inherently low. Through optimized parameter configuration, the Bloom filter's false-positive rate can be confined within an acceptable range, ensuring that the resource overhead of multinode verification remains manageable. Furthermore, the proposed penalty mechanism enhances system security by removing nodes with critically low reputation scores, thereby reducing the likelihood of malicious behavior.

This section provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme in terms of query efficiency and security, demonstrating its ability to enable efficient and secure medical data queries.

Existing query schemes typically require sequential traversal of blocks with a query time complexity of O(log n). When handling large-scale datasets, this method leads to extended query latency and diminished system efficiency. By implementing the aggregated Bloom filter, relevant blocks can be directly identified without iterative searches, thereby reducing the query time complexity to below O(log n).

Within the block structure, the leaf nodes of the Merkle tree store specific data, and its query efficiency depends on the depth of the tree. As the volume of data within a block increases, the required query depth increases proportionally, thereby reducing the query performance. For a block containing n nodes, the Merkle tree requires traversal of all nodes during queries, resulting in an average query time of n/2 and a time complexity of O(n). In contrast, the MH tree prioritizes high-weight data (data with greater significance) by storing them closer to the root node, enabling faster discovery of high-value data during queries. Consequently, the MH tree achieves an average query time below n/2, although its time complexity remains O(n).

After the data weights are predicted via a weight prediction model, each data item is assigned a weight denoted \({{\text{w}}_{\text{i}}}\) (i = 1,2,3…,n). The average path length of the MH tree is calculated as shown in formula (16):

Here, \({w_i}\)represents the weight of a data item, defined as its query probability, and \({d_i}\) denotes the depth of data item i in the MH tree. To minimize the total query cost, data items with higher weights are assigned smaller depths, thereby optimizing path traversal costs.

In Merkle trees, the node height distribution is uniform. For any leaf node, its path length equals the number of edges from the node to the root, which is equivalent to its depth. The average path length of a Merkle tree is calculated as shown in formula (17):

Here, \({w_i}\) denotes the weight of the data item, and \({{\text{h}}_i}\) represents the height of the leaf node in the tree.

Compared with the Merkle tree approach, the MH tree reduces the path length for high-frequency data through weight-based optimization, thereby ensuring an optimal average path length. Since not all the elements in the MH tree reside at the lowest level, this design guarantees that the average path length of the MH tree is consistently less than or equal to that of the Merkle tree. Consequently, the inequality \({d_i} \geqslant {h_i}\) holds. From formula  (16) and sormula  (17), we derive the following:

This proves that the inequality \(H\left( {mh} \right) \leqslant H\left( m \right)\) holds, demonstrating that the MH tree achieves superior query performance over the Merkle tree in high-frequency data access scenarios. For infrequently accessed data, which exhibit lower query probabilities, these entries typically reside at relatively deeper levels within the MH-tree structure, thereby incurring longer query paths. Nevertheless, as such data demonstrate significantly reduced access frequencies in practical operational systems, their impact on overall query performance remains operationally manageable.

The proposed framework adopts a “light-node query, full-node maintenance” architecture, which is further reinforced by reputation-based request scheduling and hierarchical access control. This design not only preserves query efficiency but also enhances the overall security and robustness of the system.

Malicious node attacks: When multinode collaborative verification is adopted and malicious nodes attempt to return incorrect verification results, their probability of a successful attack depends on the proportion of malicious nodes and the size of the verification node set. Let p denote the proportion of malicious nodes and \(|\nu |\) represent the verification set size. The probability of tampering with the final verification result is calculated as shown in formula (19)

To mitigate attack risk, the verification set size p can be adjusted. For example, when \(p=0.3\) (the malicious node proportion is 30%) and \(|\nu |=6\),

This indicates that the probability of a successful attack is only 0.07%, demonstrating the system's ability to effectively resist malicious node attacks.

False-Positive attacks: Bloom filters may generate false positives, causing certain query results to be erroneously flagged as existing. The false-positive probability \({p_f}\) is calculated as shown in formula (21).

Here, k denotes the number of hash functions, m represents the size of the Bloom filter, and n is the number of data items. By adjusting parameters k and m, the false-positive probability can be constrained within an acceptable range. For example, when \(k=3\), \(n{\text{=}}1000\) and \(m={10^4}\), the calculated false-positive probability is \({P_f} \approx 0.008\). Therefore, even if an attacker launches large-scale malicious queries, the proportion of false positives that can be triggered remains strictly bounded. Moreover, if the system detects that a particular source generates frequent false positives within a short period, it will apply rate-limiting and penalization strategies based on the reputation model, thereby preventing sustained resource exhaustion.

Query heat-manipulation attack: Within the sliding-window-based weight update mechanism, an attacker may attempt to increase the short-term access frequency of a low-weight record by repeatedly querying it, thereby raising the heat factor and reducing query latency. However, since the MH-tree structure inside each block is fixed at the time of block generation, such operations can only affect local query path optimization but cannot alter the on-chain storage structure or global verification logic. Assuming a sliding window size of W, if the attacker issues q valid requests within the window, the maximum increase in the composite weight is given by.

When a rate-limiting threshold \({Q_{\hbox{max} }}\) is enforced on the number of queries from a single source within a time window, this upper bound is further constrained to\({{(1 - \lambda ){Q_{\hbox{max} }}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{(1 - \lambda ){Q_{\hbox{max} }}} W}} \right. \kern-0pt} W}\). For example, when W = 1000,\(\lambda =0.6\), and \({Q_{\hbox{max} }}=50\), the maximum weight increase is only 0.02, which is negligible. More importantly, the selection of verification nodes is entirely determined by their reputation values, which are independent of query heat and dynamically adjusted through a penalty mechanism. Therefore, even if an attacker artificially inflates query frequency to boost data heat, it does not increase their probability of being chosen as a verification node.

Security of nonexistence proofs: The MH tree integrated with Bloom filters enables efficient nonexistence verification. When no false-positive occurs in the Bloom filter, the query result is directly returned; if a false-positive is triggered, the multinode collaborative verification mechanism ensures result credibility. The consensus outcome of multinode verification follows weighted voting, with the validation process defined in formula (23).

Here, \({R^ * }\) represents the final result (1 indicates data existence, 0 indicates nonexistence); \({R_i}\)denotes the verification result from node \({N_i}\); \({C_i}\) is the credibility value of node \({N_i}\); and \({\mathbb{I}}({R_i}=r)\) is the indicator function, which equals 1 if \({R_i}=r\) and 0 otherwise. If a node repeatedly returns incorrect results, its credibility value will drop below the threshold (\({C_{\hbox{min} }}\)), and it will be removed from the system. Let \({C_{init}}\) be the initial credibility value of a node and let \(\lambda\) be its malicious behavior frequency. The time until its removal is calculated as follows:

Here, \(\beta\) denotes the penalty coefficient for query failure. By configuring a lower \({C_{\hbox{min} }}\) and a higher \(\beta\), malicious nodes can be swiftly identified and eliminated.

To verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme, the experimental environment was configured with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60 GHz processor, 12GB of memory, and the Windows 10 operating system. The software environment included PyCharm 2023.1 and Matlab R2019a, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS instances were created via virtual machines to simulate the deployment of the distributed blockchain network. The experimental dataset was obtained from an open-source medical dataset on the Kaggle platform (approximately 55,000 records). An XGBoost algorithm was used to train the weight prediction model, and each record was assigned a weight and stored in the blockchain. The experimental network consisted of 10 full nodes and 50 light nodes, connected via a random graph topology to simulate peer-to-peer communication. Full nodes were responsible for data storage and verification, while lightweight nodes only performed query operations. In addition, about 5% of the nodes were configured as malicious to test the effectiveness of the collaborative verification mechanism. The experimental parameters were set as a block size of 1 MB and an average block interval of 10 s, with query requests generated according to a Poisson distribution to approximate the access patterns of real-world medical scenarios.

The experiment utilized the first 10,000 entries from the dataset for model training, which were divided into a training set (8,000 entries) and a validation set (2,000 entries). We first calculated the ground-truth weights of the training data using hierarchical comprehensive evaluation and then compared them with the predicted weights to evaluate the model's performance. Figure 9 shows the discrepancies between the true weights and the predicted weights on the validation set, where the x-axis represents the validation set entries and the y-axis indicates the data weights. Through R² and RMSE calculations, the proposed model achieved 96.422% prediction accuracy on the validation set. The results confirm strong alignment between the predicted and true data weights, demonstrating high model precision for effective weight prediction.

Prediction accuracy.

Additionally, the experiment evaluated the model's learning capability and generalization performance through learning curves and errors on both the validation and test sets. Figure 10(a) shows the learning curve for the training set, illustrating the model's performance with varying training sample sizes. When the training set size is 0, the model cannot be trained; hence, no error values exist. The experiment started calculations from a 10% sample ratio to ensure reasonable training progression. In Fig. 10(a), the blue solid line represents the training error, indicating the trend of the error on the training set as the sample size increases. The red dashed line denotes the validation error, reflecting the model's performance on the validation set across training set sizes. As the number of samples increases, the model's errors on both the training set and the validation set decrease, indicating that when the number of training set samples is small, the model has not yet fully learned the data features. When the number of training samples is about 2,200, the error tends to stabilize, indicating that the model has sufficient learning ability under this data scale, and further increasing the number of samples will have limited impact on improving model performance. After the training error stabilized, it stabilized at about \(2.0 \times {10^{ - 5}}\), which is a small error, indicating that the model has a good fit to the training set data. After the validation error stabilized, it stabilized at about \(2.3 \times {10^{ - 5}}\), and the difference between the validation error and the training error was small, indicating that the model performed equally well on unseen data and had good generalization ability. In addition, there was no obvious separation between the two curves, which also showed that the model did not overfit.

Figure 10(b) displays the RMSE and MAE for both the validation and training sets. The RMSE values for the training and validation sets are 0.00438 and 0.00455, respectively, whereas the MAE values are 0.00356 and 0.0036, respectively. Overall, the gap between the training error and the validation error is small, which further verifies the consistency and robustness of the model. The lower MAE value indicates that most of the model's predictions are closer to the true values and have high practical value in practical applications.

From the prediction accuracy, learning curve trend, and comparison of errors between training and validation sets, it can be seen that the proposed model has good learning ability and generalization performance on this dataset, and can accurately and efficiently complete the task of medical data weight prediction, providing a solid foundation for subsequent data management and blockchain query.

Learning curves and Training set and validation set errors.

In the sliding-window weight update mechanism of the MH tree, the parameter \(\lambda \in [0,1]\) is employed to balance the contributions of the static prediction weight and the dynamic access heat factor, and its value directly influences query performance. To determine an appropriate setting for \(\lambda\), experiments were conducted under a configuration where each block contains 1000 data items, the total number of query requests is 50,000, and the sliding window size is set to 1000. Three representative access patterns were designed: (1) Stable-hot scenario, simulating a case where a small subset of high-frequency data is repeatedly accessed over a long period; (2) Uniform scenario, simulating a case where all data items have approximately equal access probabilities; and (3) Cold-hot scenario, simulating the situation where initially low-frequency data becomes frequently accessed within a short period due to sudden events.

The experimental results are presented in Fig. 11, where the Y-axis denotes the average query latency and the 99th percentile latency (P99, defined as the latency threshold not exceeded by 99% of all requests). The results indicate that: in the Stable-hot scenario, performance is optimal when \(\lambda \approx 0.6\); in the Uniform scenario, the impact of \(\lambda\) is relatively minor, although \(\lambda \approx 0.8\) yields slightly better results; and in the Cold-hot scenario, \(\lambda \approx 0.4\) allows the system to adapt more rapidly to sudden changes and significantly reduces latency. Overall, when \(\lambda\) is chosen within the range of 0.4–0.6, the system achieves a balance between stability and adaptability, and this range is therefore adopted in the experiments.

Selection of parameter \(\lambda\).

To validate the query performance of the proposed scheme (MH_Tree), we conducted comparative analyses with schemes from the literature: Quad_Tree17, B_Tree18, and Merkle_Tree24. To simulate scenarios with varying data scales assuming that large medical blockchain data volumes are required, the number of blocks (100, 500, 800, and 1200) in the experiment was adjusted. For each data scale, ten rounds of query experiments were performed, with 50 and 500 queries performed per round, to comprehensively evaluate the query performance. Figure 12 shows the experimental results for 50 queries per round, and Fig. 13 displays the results for 500 queries per round. The x-axis represents the round index, and the y-axis indicates the average query time per data entry.

Figure 12 shows the query rates of all the schemes under low-load query conditions. Compared with the Quad_Tree scheme, the MH_Tree scheme reduces the query time by more than 0.3 s; it shortens the query time by approximately 0.1 s relative to the B_Tree scheme and by approximately 0.15 s compared with the Merkle_Tree scheme. This trend shows that MH_Tree can effectively reduce the query cost. External factors (e.g., CPU resource occupation) may cause fluctuations in individual query times, so the analysis focuses on relative performance differences between schemes. Figure 13 shows the query rates in high-load query scenarios. The MH_Tree scheme reduces the average query time by more than 0.3 s compared to Quad_Tree, by 0.15 s compared with B_Tree, and by 0.2 s compared with Merkle_Tree. In contrast to low-load scenarios, high-load scenarios exhibit smaller query time fluctuations. This is because the increase in the number of queries smooths out the occasional fluctuations of individual queries due to factors such as uneven data distribution, reduces the interference of extreme values on the overall results, and can more accurately reflect the average performance of the solution.

From the experimental results, the MH_Tree scheme shows stable and superior query performance under different data scales and load intensities, which fully proves its practicality and efficiency in processing large-scale medical blockchain data. By introducing a weight prediction model before the data is entered into the chain, the system can effectively model and sort the medical data based on its importance, thereby realizing a data organization structure optimized by weight. This structure helps to prioritize indexing high-value data, significantly reduce the time complexity of data retrieval, and improve overall access efficiency. In addition, the aggregated Bloom filter mechanism introduced in this scheme can filter out irrelevant blocks in advance during the query process, avoiding intra-block query operations of irrelevant blocks, thereby improving query efficiency. In contrast, the Quad_Tree scheme uses a four-fork Merkle tree structure, which has the advantage of spatial division but lacks targeted data filtering; the B_Tree scheme introduces a Bloom filter, but does not achieve aggregation optimization; the Merkle_Tree scheme relies entirely on tree structure indexing, and its efficiency is limited by the level depth and path complexity.

50 query results per round.

500 query results per round.

The scheme proposed in this paper predicts data weights through a weight prediction model, stores the data in the blockchain, and accelerates data queries using the MH_Tree and aggregated Bloom filters. In comparison, the Quad_Tree scheme increases the query speed via a quad Merkle tree structure; the B_Tree scheme combines Merkle-B trees with Bloom filters to increase the query efficiency; and the Merkle_Tree scheme accelerates queries through Merkle tree indexing. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed query scheme, by tightly integrating the weight prediction model with aggregated Bloom filters, achieves superior query efficiency across varying query intensities. To validate the impact of the aggregated Bloom filter on the query speed, the experiment tested the query rates for identical data under two conditions: without and with the aggregated Bloom filter. In high-load query scenarios simulated with 500 queries per round across 100, 500, 800, and 1200 blocks, the comparative results of both approaches are shown in Fig. 14.

In low-data scenarios (100 and 500 blocks), query time fluctuations in some rounds were observed due to factors such as data distribution. However, across all the scenarios, the aggregated Bloom filter outperforms the non-Bloom filter approach, increasing the query speed by approximately 0.2 s. The results confirm that the aggregated Bloom filter enhances query efficiency by reducing the number of invalid queries, providing stable support for high-frequency, high-efficiency medical blockchain systems.

Query results with and without aggregated Bloom filters.

Additionally, the experiment compared the structural performance metrics of four schemes, including storage overhead, data insertion time, and verification path generation time, to comprehensively evaluate their applicability in medical data scenarios. The tests were conducted using 100 randomly selected data entries with 10 experimental rounds.

The average storage overhead and insertion time of the four schemes are shown in Table 1. The Merkle_Tree scheme demonstrates the most concise structure, where data is stored directly in leaf nodes without requiring additional auxiliary structures. This results in the lowest storage overhead (0.0065 MB) and shortest insertion time (0.0406 s) in the experiments. The Quad_Tree scheme adopts a quad Merkle tree structure, exhibiting comparable storage and insertion performance to the Merkle_Tree scheme at 0.0068 MB and 0.0539 s respectively. The B_Tree scheme incorporates B-tree structure and Bloom filter, where node management and bitmap updates introduce additional overhead, leading to relatively higher storage consumption (0.0089 MB) and insertion time (0.0871 s). However, it achieves superior query efficiency compared to the former two approaches.

The proposed scheme first calculates weights through the weight prediction model, then locates the insertion position in the MH-Tree, followed by updating the aggregated Bloom filter. Although exhibiting comparable insertion overhead and storage space to the B_Tree scheme (0.0085 MB and 0.0852 s), the introduction of the aggregated Bloom filter and weight optimization mechanism enables significant improvement in query efficiency in practical applications. This configuration demonstrates superior comprehensive performance, making it better suited for blockchain storage scenarios involving high-frequency access and large-scale medical data.

The average verification path generation time for each scheme is shown in Fig. 15 The MH_Tree scheme achieved an average verification path generation time of approximately 0.09 s, whereas Quad_Tree required 0.04 s, B_Tree required 0.10 s, and Merkle_Tree required 0.15 s. The Quad_Tree scheme exhibited significantly faster verification path generation due to its quad-tree structure, which reduces the number of hash computations required to generate root nodes. However, quad tree structures inherently have higher search complexity than binary trees do. The MH-Tree structure results in shorter verification paths for high-frequency data, enabling faster average verification path generation than do the Merkle trees in high-volume medical data query scenarios. The B_Tree scheme, which incorporates index information in nonleaf nodes, also generates verification paths faster than Merkle trees do.

Verification path generation time.

This experiment was conducted under the following premise: light nodes receive query results indicating the absence of data and must initiate verification with other full nodes. The experiment simulated 200 verification queries using 10 full nodes with credibility values of 70. Figure 16(a) illustrates the changes in node credibility values, where the x-axis represents the query count and the y-axis indicates the credibility values of nodes used to evaluate their trustworthiness. During the experiment, the malicious behavior probability of nodes was set to 0.5%, but no malicious acts occurred. Thus, credibility fluctuations were caused primarily by the credibility decay mechanism and dynamic adjustments of the scoring system.

Figure 16(a) clearly shows that despite identical initial credibility values across nodes, their credibility values exhibited variability during the experiment. When the query count approached 150, certain nodes (e.g., Node_2 and Node_6) showed significant decreases in credibility. This occurred because these nodes received a greater proportion of query requests in these rounds, subjecting them to increased load and stricter response performance requirements, which triggered credibility adjustments. Additionally, around 170 queries, some nodes (e.g., Node_1, Node_10, and Node_5) experienced notable decreases in credibility because of the cumulative effect of credibility decay. The decline was amplified by the additional scoring adjustments in that round, building upon the accumulated credibility reductions from prior queries.

In addition to the significant changes mentioned above, the credibility values of nodes remained within small fluctuation ranges during most query rounds. These minor fluctuations arose primarily from routine adjustments by the credibility decay mechanism. Owing to slight differences in the query request distribution, task performance, and response efficiency across nodes, the scoring mechanism dynamically adjusts the credibility values on the basis of these variations, resulting in bounded fluctuations for all nodes.

The experimental results show that the node credibility values fluctuate between 67 and 76, with the overall level remaining stable at approximately 70. This finding indicates that the system effectively maintains a dynamic balance in node credibility through its scoring and decay mechanisms. Moreover, the large fluctuations observed in some nodes further validate the sensitivity and adaptive capability of the scoring system. These fluctuations demonstrate that when nodes exhibit uneven load distributions, inadequate response capacities, or cumulative decay effects, the scoring mechanism promptly adjusts their credibility values to ensure that they accurately reflect node performance.

Node reputation value changes at 0.5% and 2% malicious behavior probabilities.

Figure 16(b) illustrates the changes in node credibility values when the malicious behavior probability is 2%. When a node acts maliciously (e.g., refusing to provide query results or returning incorrect responses), its credibility value decreases significantly. For example, Node_1 in Fig. 16(b) committed malicious behavior during the 86th query, causing its credibility value to decrease to below 50, triggering a light penalty mechanism. In subsequent queries, even when Node_1 provided correct results, the slow recovery of its credibility value prevented rapid reputation restoration through short-term compliance, thereby ensuring system reliability. Additionally, Node_1 acts maliciously again during the 168th query. After the decrease in credibility, its value fell below 30, and the node was permanently removed from the network.

By comparing the credibility changes of nodes in two malicious behavior probability settings, the multinode collaborative verification mechanism based on credibility values can rapidly identify and address malicious actions as the probability increases. This mechanism enhances the trustworthiness of query results by integrating verification outcomes from multiple nodes while effectively mitigating the systemic impact of individual malicious nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that collaborative verification not only strengthens error detection capabilities during data queries but also optimizes system stability and efficiency across diverse network conditions, thus providing reliable support for secure data querying and validation.

This paper proposes a novel efficient query scheme to address the issues of low efficiency and limitations in nonexistence proofs for lightweight medical blockchain data queries. First, by introducing the XGBoost algorithm for data weight prediction, high-weight data are prioritized for storage near root nodes in the blockchain, optimizing the storage layout and enhancing the query efficiency. Second, the aggregated Bloom filters and MH tree structure, combined with segment filtering and weight optimization, reduce query path lengths, thereby improving on-chain data query performance. Finally, to resolve the limitations of sorted Merkle trees in nonexistence proofs, a credibility-based multinode collaborative verification method is proposed using Bloom filters, ensuring query accuracy and strengthening system security.

Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves approximately 15% improvement in query efficiency compared to existing methods under medium-scale datasets (~ 55,000 records) and diverse query workloads, while maintaining enhanced system security. As the experiments primarily rely on simulated environments, certain practical factors such as data distribution and network topology fail to be comprehensively addressed, indicating that system performance in broader or more complex scenarios requires further investigation.

Given the escalating demands of medical data growth and system heterogeneity, future research will prioritize the optimization of cross-chain query mechanisms. Through the integration of lightweight consensus protocols with trusted cross-chain communication frameworks, combined with Merkle proofs and verifiable computation techniques, this approach aims to enhance both efficiency and security in cross-chain data verification. Additionally, by implementing hierarchical inter-chain relay mechanisms to optimize query pathways and reduce communication latency, this research trajectory seeks to establish a blockchain-based data query framework that demonstrates superior efficiency, security, and adaptability for resource-constrained scenarios.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management has filed preliminary prospectuses with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue spot bitcoin and solana exchange traded funds (ETFs). It marks the first spot cryptocurrency ETF issuance by the asset management arm of a global systemically important bank. Last month Goldman Sachs acquired Innovator Asset Management which offers a defined outcome ETF with exposure to bitcoin price movements.

Other G-SIB asset managers have been involved in tokenized money market funds such as UBS uMint and JP Morgan's MONY, but tokenized money market funds represent more conventional institutional blockchain adoption.

Given the early nature of the filing, Morgan Stanley has not yet mentioned on which exchange the ETFs will list or who will provide custody for the digital assets. Under the previous US administration, banking regulators and the SEC imposed barriers preventing banks from engaging in crypto activities. With the SEC rescinding SAB 121 regarding crypto custody and the OCC recently allowing banks to act as intermediaries for digital asset trading, the landscape is rapidly changing.

While age assurance laws progress in Australia, the EU and the UK, Asian nations are also beginning to emerge as players in the global regulatory push. In Malaysia, where discussions around online safety have steadily intensified, Mimos Bhd's My Blockchain Infrastructure (MBI) has formally endorsed Zetrix's blockchain-based age verification method.

Late last year, Malaysia announced a plan to implement age assurance requirements for social media platforms and a prohibition on accounts for users under 16. January 1 saw the launch of a regulatory sandbox to test child protection and online safety measures in a controlled environment.

“Across the world, policymakers are looking for ways to better protect young users online and age verification must therefore be implemented responsibly,” says MBI CEO Azhar Abu Talib in a press release. “MBI is endorsing Zetrix's age verification capability as a privacy-first, practical approach that helps platform operators meet safety and regulatory expectations while minimising unnecessary handling of personal data.”

MBI runs Malaysia's Blockchain Infrastructure initiative for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Mosti). Overseen by the national research and development agency Mimos, and created in collaboration with Zetrix, it serves as the foundation for the MyDigital ID Superapp that builds on the country's existing digital ID system.

As an age verification method, it will enable users to prove their age across sites without having to repeatedly submit identity documents or sensitive personal information. Initial age verification happens through government-approved digital ID services like MyDigital ID or the National Integrated Immigration System. The resulting proof functions like an age token, giving only a yes or no response to age assurance queries.

Zetrix says the approach is “designed to balance regulatory compliance with data-minimization principles.”

“Zetrix AI will work with MBI to enable trusted verification that is easy for platforms to adopt and straightforward for users to complete while keeping privacy and data minimization at the core,” says Zetrix's group managing director, T.S. Wong.

Per the release, “sensitive materials used during identity checks, such as raw electronic know-your-customer (eKYC) data, are not retained indefinitely. These materials are securely deleted on a regular schedule or within an agreed timeframe.”

“Where required by law, the solution can support legitimate regulatory or legal processes through authorised and clearly governed channels. Any linking of verification records back to an individual is tightly controlled and subject to due process, ensuring accountability without routine exposure of personal data.”

Colle AI (COLLE), the multichain AI-powered NFT creation platform, announced enhancements to its AI-driven design automation framework, further optimizing how creators build and scale digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. The update strengthens Colle AI's ability to translate creative intent into fully structured, multichain-ready NFTs, reducing manual effort while improving workflow efficiency for artists, studios, and brands operating at scale.

The enhanced automation layer advances how Colle AI assembles visual elements, applies stylistic coherence, prepares metadata, and aligns outputs with chain-specific requirements. By intelligently handling these processes in the background, the platform allows creators to focus on ideation and refinement rather than workflow configuration. This improvement supports faster iteration cycles and enables consistent production of both individual assets and large NFT collections without sacrificing creative flexibility.

Integrated throughout Colle AI's multichain pipelines, the upgraded system ensures seamless compatibility with blockchain environments including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. As assets are generated or modified, the automation framework dynamically adapts formatting, structural integrity, and deployment readiness to meet each network's technical standards. “Design automation is most powerful when it quietly supports creativity,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “By enhancing AI-driven automation, Colle AI gives creators a scalable foundation that keeps pace with their ideas while managing complexity across chains.”

This enhancement reinforces Colle AI's commitment to delivering intelligent, high-speed creative infrastructure for the evolving Web3 landscape. As multichain NFT workflows grow more complex and demand for scalable production increases, Colle AI continues refining its automation systems to enable frictionless creation, rapid experimentation, and efficient deployment across decentralized networks.

Key Takeaways

The arrest of Nicolás Maduro has intensified payment disruptions, pushing oil traders toward stablecoins.

USDT is increasingly used to settle Venezuelan crude transactions as banks and state channels stall.

Analysts say stablecoins now act as a parallel rail for energy trade during political shocks.

Global markets are digesting a wave of geopolitical shocks, from renewed conflict in Eastern Europe to rising tensions across Latin America. In this environment, Venezuela's political rupture following the arrest of Nicolás Maduro is sending ripples far beyond Caracas. One of the clearest signals is not found in diplomacy or military headlines, but in payments. USDT is quietly strengthening its position as a core settlement tool in Venezuela's oil trade.

The past weeks have underscored how fragile global energy logistics remain. Disruptions in shipping lanes, sanctions enforcement, and leadership changes often do not stop oil from moving, but they complicate how it gets paid for. Energy traders increasingly focus on settlement risk rather than supply risk.

Venezuela finds itself caught between overlapping strains. Long-standing sanctions have cut the country off from much of the global banking system, and the latest political turmoil has made counterparties even more cautious. 

Traders say payments routed through traditional banks now face longer delays, as correspondent institutions tighten checks or step back altogether. In response, market participants are falling back on tools that work regardless of local institutions.

Stablecoins are not new to Venezuela's oil trade, but their role is expanding. USDT stands out because of its liquidity and acceptance. Traders describe it as “the only instrument everyone agrees on” when banks hesitate or freeze transfers.



The logic is simple. Oil cargoes still need payment. Refiners and middlemen want speed and predictability. USDT allows near-instant settlement, reduces exposure to blocked accounts, and avoids multi-day clearing delays. In volatile moments, those features matter more than ideology or innovation.

One trader involved in Latin American crude flows noted that stablecoins now function like an informal clearing system. They bridge gaps when formal rails fail. After Maduro's arrest, that bridge has become more heavily used.

Maduro's detention has not halted production overnight, but it has blurred authority. Questions over who signs contracts, who controls accounts, and which obligations remain valid have multiplied. In such conditions, counterparties look for settlement methods that sit outside domestic control.

USDT has become a practical alternative. It bypasses local banks and can be accessed through international exchanges and OTC desks. While some deals still require stablecoins to be converted into cash at a later stage, the first leg of settlement is increasingly taking place on-chain.

Oil settlements at a glance

This shift does not signal confidence in crypto markets. It reflects a lack of alternatives.

Analysts warn that reliance on USDT carries its own risks. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant threat. Any change in stablecoin oversight or issuer policy could disrupt flows overnight. There is also concentration risk, since most settlements lean on a single asset.

Transparency remains a sticking point. Stablecoin settlements often leave fewer visible traces, which could complicate oversight for future governments and international counterparts. Even if a post-Maduro administration moves to restore conventional payment channels, shifting traders back may not be straightforward.

Many market participants view the current setup as a stopgap, but one that could outlive the crisis itself. Once a payment method proves fast and dependable, it tends to stick, particularly when it fills gaps that traditional systems have struggled to close.

The broader implication reaches beyond one country. USDT's growing role in oil settlements highlights how digital dollars now serve as shock absorbers in global trade. They step in when politics disrupt finance.

For the crypto industry, this reinforces a familiar theme. Stablecoins gain relevance not during booms, but during stress. Their value lies in function, not narrative.

To sum up, Maduro's arrest has reshaped Venezuela's political landscape, but it has also sharpened an economic reality. As long as uncertainty clouds banks and contracts, USDT will remain central to how Venezuelan oil gets paid for. In times of upheaval, the most reliable systems are often the least visible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Dogecoin Price Prediction: NFT Paris Conference Cancelled After NFT Market Collapse, Meme Coin Traders Rotate Into DeepSnitch AI Presale After a $1M Surge","https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605132801","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:36:22 GMT","

NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences slated for February were cancelled, citing significant losses after the NFT market cap dropped by nearly $7B in a year. 

Meanwhile, the meme coin market saw a significant recovery as the wider market turned bullish at the start of 2026. Even though the developments had a positive impact on the Dogecoin price prediction, many meme traders chose DeepSnitch AI, not only for its upside potential but also for its meme-friendly utility. 

Raising $1M amid market turmoil, DeepSnitch AI built up organic hype and sparked multiple 100x projections on the strength of its AI-powered prediction and analytics suite. 

Organizers behind NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences announced the cancellation of these events with a month's notice, citing market collapse as the primary reason. 

Even though it wasn't stated specifically, these events likely won't be organized in the future, with the company mentioning it's officially closing the chapter on conferences. 

The purchased tickets will be refunded within 15 days.

This may not be surprising as the NFT culture suffered a massive decrease in 2025, with the market cap shrinking from $9B in January 2025 to $2.7B in January 2026. 

At the same time, the meme coin market capitalization recovered by 17% in 30 days, reaching $48B by December 5. This is reflected in the Dogecoin price prediction, despite many traders opting for either newly-graduated meme tokens or high-potential presale projects. 

Judging by the latest Dogecoin price prediction (and solid recent performance), DOGE could provide serious gains in the short term. However, the lack of long-term utility and the coin's already high market cap could limit its upside potential. 

While it has a solid $0.03269 entry that is reminiscent of the prices of most meme coins, DeepSnitch AI is a full-fledged AI project. It's not just the price, though, as the underlying utility also presents a valuable set of tools for meme traders.

By integrating five AI agents into a single analytics and prediction suite, the platform aims to help retail traders make consistent trades. Along with a crypto-centric LLM, DeepSnitch AI also provides actionable analytics and can predict FUD spikes and even sentiment shifts. 

Meme traders, specifically, will love the SnitchScan agent for its ability to scan new tokens for rug pull risks, insider activity, and upside potential. 

All of this provides DeepSnitch AI with staying power and a significant upside potential. This is why it's not a surprise that the project raised over $1M while the rest of the market was in a 3-month corrective period. 

According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE settled in the $0.15 area on December 5. 

The immediate Dogecoin price outlook seems to have improved as the market has confirmed a breakout above $0.15. Analysts point to the RSI turning positive and the 20-day EMA turning up as clear bullish signals.If buyers remain in control, the Dogecoin price prediction could see the original meme coin crossing $0.16 to complete a rally to $0.19. 

On the contrary, the DOGE forecast could also switch back into the bear territory if the price pulls back below $0.13, which could open the door toward a dip to as low as $0.10. 

On December 5, XRP surged by 12% and rose above the $2.30 territory to start a test of the $2.40 resistance, according to CoinMarketCap.For those not confident in the Dogecoin price prediction, XRP may provide a bit more substance. Analysts agree that a rally to the downtrend line could be in play, which means that a massive breakout could happen after a few days. 

Alternatively, the rally could speed up if accumulation pushes the price above this crucial level, allowing XRP to surge past $3 in January. 

As the market recovers in the first weeks of January, the Dogecoin price prediction turned bullish, providing meme traders a way to grow their bags while the hype lasts.However, savvy traders are looking elsewhere and are prioritizing long-term potential and a larger upside.Priced at $0.03269 and raising over $1M, DeepSnitch AI's utility provides real value for traders in the meme sector while also reinforcing a 100x narrative that led to massive levels of hype. Thus, the gains could be immediate and much more substantial than what other affordable alts could realistically offer.



The Dogecoin price prediction is cautiously bullish after DOGE reclaimed the $0.15 level, with analysts targeting a potential move toward $0.19 if buying pressure remains strong.

As NFT market capitalization dropped from roughly $9B to $2.7B year-over-year, speculative capital rotated toward meme coins, helping boost sentiment and short-term price action.

DeepSnitch AI combines meme-friendly appeal with AI-powered analytics and prediction tools, offering higher upside potential and utility beyond traditional meme coins, which helped it surpass $1M during its presale.

Catizen has strategically integrated SSR Summoners, a turn-based, idle fantasy RPG, into its Game Center. This new addition allows players to buy in-game items at a 30% discount using Catizen's proprietary CATI tokens. The move is designed to enhance the utility and appeal of CATI within Catizen's growing gaming ecosystem.

Catizen proudly presents SSR Summoners, as a new member of Catizen Game Center! SSR Summoners – ​Dive into epic battles, collect SSR heroes and claim exclusive rewards. Your saga begins now!⚔️ Enjoy the fun, All in Catizen Game Center🎉Don't forget to use CATI to enjoy 30%… pic.twitter.com/LrwXlqyugt

SSR Summoners employs a gacha system for character acquisition and is heavily inspired by Western mythology. Players engage in a gameplay loop that includes summoning heroes, forming teams, and tackling various quests and guild battles. However, reception of the game has been mixed. On Steam, SSR Summoners has received a “Mostly Negative” rating, with only 33% positive feedback from 18 reviews. It supports Android and Windows platforms, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience.

The minimum system requirements for SSR Summoners as listed on Steam are as follows: Windows 7 or newer, an Intel Core-i3 or equivalent processor, at least 4 GB of RAM, DirectX Version 9.0, a stable broadband connection, and 1 GB of free storage space. For an optimal gaming experience, higher specifications are recommended.

Through the strategic use of CATI tokens for in-game purchases, Catizen does not specify an end date to this discount, suggesting it might be a long-term benefit. This initiative is expected to boost transactions within the Game Center and enhance the appeal of CATI as a preferred payment option.

By hosting its Game Center on the widely used Telegram platform, Catizen leverages a substantial user base to promote its ecosystem. The incorporation of SSR Summoners is part of a larger roadmap, which saw the addition of over 30 games to the Game Center in 2025 alone. Catizen's approach utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate an integrated gaming and transaction environment, aiming to secure a seamless experience for users.

The inclusion of SSR Summoners into Catizen's game portfolio marks a significant step in merging traditional gaming elements with the benefits of blockchain technology. By promoting CATI tokens as a compelling option for in-game transactions, Catizen not only boosts the utility of its tokens but also aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction within its expanding ecosystem. As Catizen continues to grow, players can expect more innovative integrations that emphasize both gaming enjoyment and practical use of digital currencies.

Advertisement

Infinex, the Web3 wallet and tool suite from Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, has made drastic changes to its initial coin offering (ICO) structure after the original format garnered little to no demand.

The company revealed the changes in an X post yesterday, where it said, “We got the sale wrong. We tried to balance existing Patron holders, new participants, and fair distribution all at once, and the result was a sale that (almost) nobody wanted to participate in.”

The original structure featured restrictions such as a $2,500 cap, random allocations with a boost to those who shared the sale, and a 1-year lockup at a $99 million fully diluted valuation (FDV).

Under the new sales terms, there is no more maximum allocation, and distribution will use a max-min design where “Everyone's allocation rises equally until it's full or supply runs out. Any excess contribution is refunded.”

Despite the changes, the sale is still less than 30% filled, at $1.5 million of its $5 million cap. At its current fill rate, the sale is not expected to reach the $5 million cap; however, it is worth noting that many large investors often wait until the final hours to contribute in ICOs to avoid losing out on yield elsewhere.

With the ICO ongoing, users have spent more time and money speculating on the sale's outcome than actually participating in it. A Polymarket tracking the total contribution amount to the Infinex ICO has generated almost $4 million in volume, and still assigns 24% odds to more than $10 million in inflows.

Home » News » Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Regain $200 As Meme Coins Jump?

Pradeep is a crypto enthusiast and fintech journalist with over six years of hands-on experience in the cryptocurrency space. He's written more than 4,000 articles,…

Kai Man Ng is an editor and translator with a strong passion for crypto, blockchain, and Web3 technologies. He specializes in transforming complex technical concepts…

Solana price prediction is gaining momentum once again after meme coins led the market recovery. SOL token rose to a high of $139.85 on Monday, up by over 17% from its December swing low. 

Meme coins have led the current market recovery, with Dogecoin up 22.95% and Shiba Inu up over 30% in the past seven days. The surge has also coincided with a rebound in Solana meme coins. The total market cap of SOL meme coins has surged to $6.8 billion, with top ecosystem meme coins like BONK, PENGU, and FARTCOIN increasing over 50% in the past weeks. 

A surge in ecosystem coins could be a significant catalyst for Solana's price and trigger buying interest. Solana ETFs have also continued their positive inflow trend, with total inflows exceeding $791 million.

As capital rotates into meme coins, emerging projects with meme-utility combinations like Bitcoin Hyper are attracting more attention. Smart players and experienced retailers are already accumulating HYPER tokens for faster upside and lower entry points.

In past cycles, Solana has greatly benefited from high activity and a surge in its ecosystem's meme coins. Data from DeFi Llama shows that the volume handled by Solana DEX networks jumped by over 33% to $107.3 billion in just the last seven days. Its volume was much higher than that of the other altcoins due to high trading activity in meme coins, driving a bullish Solana price prediction.



Source: DefiLlama

Among these, the top names, BONK and TRUMP Coin, have jumped significantly, with their market caps now well above $1 billion. Newly launched tokens like PENGU and  PIPPIN have jumped by double digits in the past few days.

Another strong catalyst for Solana's price is the consistent inflows into its spot ETF products, indicating sustained institutional demand. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced intense selling pressure and outflows in December, SOL ETFs remained positive, with steady winning streaks. 

On Monday, they saw a strong inflow of $16.8 million. The largest contributor remained Bitwise's BSOL, which received $12.5 million in inflows. Fidelity Solana Fund (FSOL) saw an inflow of $2 million while VanEck's VSOL attracted around $0.2 million. 

Finally, the crypto market is showing strong momentum after weeks of sideways action. The sixth-largest crypto, Solana, has also seen renewed investor interest, surging 12.36% over the past seven days.  At the time of writing, it is trading above the $138 support level after weeks of range-bound price action.

However, the altcoin is still trading inside the box pattern formed since November. The consolidation pattern has a breakout at $145 on the long side and a breakdown level at $120 on the short side. SOL is trading just 3% below the upper resistance; a strong breakout with volume could confirm a bullish trend.

Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bullish signal trading near the overbought zone of 70. The buying pressure could increase, but a pullback or consolidation remains imminent before the next leg up. 

As the Solana price prediction analysis shows improvement, a project with a Solana-like architecture could be the next market leader. At the forefront is the layer-2 project Bitcoin Hyper, combining Solana's infrastructure, speed, and utility with Bitcoin's massive capital and security. 

Bitcoin Hyper runs on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), one of the fastest blockchain engines available today. This gives it near-instant transactions and extremely low fees, turning Bitcoin into a network that can actually support everyday payments, DeFi platforms, meme coins, and real-world dApps without delays or high costs.



The platform works as a full execution layer built to expand what Bitcoin can do. It keeps security at the core while enabling fast, scalable value transfers. With decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge, users can move Bitcoin smoothly across different blockchains, making the network more flexible and practical at scale.

Bitcoin Hyper's token presale has surprised analysts with massive demand. The presale has already raised more than $30 million, making it the best crypto presale of 2026. Top third-party auditors like Coinsult and Spywolf have reported no contract vulnerabilities, which has helped draw more attention to the project.



Another major attraction for experienced investors has been the 39% p.a. Staking rewards. The presale is ongoing, offering early participants the chance to purchase tokens at an undervalued price of just $0.013535.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","India calls on international community to focus on CBDCs","https://coingeek.com/india-calls-on-international-community-to-focus-on-cbdcs/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:04:19 GMT","

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has urged countries worldwide to focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) instead of privately issued stablecoins, citing concerns about financial stability.

The call from the central bank of the world's top digital asset jurisdiction, by adoption rate, comes as international battle lines are being drawn in the debate over stablecoins or CBDCs, with China recently doubling down on its digital yuan, while the United States backs stablecoins and bans CBDC.

For its part, the RBI laid out its stall firmly in the CBDC camp in its end-of-year financial stability report, published December 31, arguing that only CBDCs can preserve the “singleness of money” and the integrity of the financial system.

“Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can achieve the benefits that stablecoins claim to offer, i.e., efficiency, programmability, and instant settlement, but with the credibility and safety of central bank money,” said the RBI.

For this reason, the bank said it “strongly advocates that countries should prioritize central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) over privately issued stablecoins to maintain trust in money, preserve financial stability and design next generation payments infrastructure that is faster, cheaper and secure.”

At the same time as throwing its weight behind CBDCs, the RBI also pointed to the “rapid growth of stablecoins” as a source of concern, saying that “while they are currently mostly used in the crypto asset network, their wider application could pose significant risks, including risk to the ‘singleness of money', threat to monetary sovereignty, run and liquidity vulnerabilities, and potential credit disintermediation.”










This has become an increasingly popular refrain among many central banks and banking organizations worldwide, including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)—an international financial institution of central banks that fosters international monetary and financial cooperation while serving as a bank for central banks.

In its Annual Economic Report 2025, the BIS issued a stark warning about stablecoins, highlighting their potential to undermine monetary sovereignty, transparency issues, and the risk of capital flight from emerging economies.

Such concerns have only been heightened by another bumper year for the stablecoin space. According to recent research by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, the transaction volume of stablecoins reached record highs in 2025. By August 2025, stablecoins had reached their highest-ever annual transaction volume, rising 83% between July 2024 and July 2025, and exceeding $4 trillion in transaction volume between January 2025 and July 2025.

In its December report, the RBI argued that introducing stablecoins can create new channels for financial stability risks, particularly during periods of market stress, and that it is “vital that jurisdictions carefully assess the attendant risks and determine policy responses appropriate to its financial system.”

Despite the RBI's stablecoin skepticism, the government of India hinted in its recent Economic Survey 2025-2026 that it may provide backing for the space through regulation.

This seeming disconnect between the central bank and the country's lawmakers over whether to back stablecoins or CBDC is representative of an ongoing global debate, in which battle lines are being drawn, with the world's two superpowers on either side.

China or US approach?

When it comes to supporting CBDCs or stablecoins, it increasingly appears that for many, it is an either-or situation. The technologies are not—in principle—mutually exclusive, but they do compete in the same space, i.e., as a digital, stable, blockchain-based alternative to the national currency and payment method of choice.

On the one hand, you have the central bank-issued, backed, and controlled CBDC, the most direct translation of a fiat currency into a digital form. On the other hand, you have privately issued stablecoins; free of the negative associations that come with a state-monitored digital currency, but without the steady, guiding hand of a central bank and reliant on the fortunes and management of an opaque—sometimes even decentralized—private company.

This already tense rivalry for the future of mass payment systems has been given further significance by the world's two leading economies, the U.S. and China, which appear to be taking on the roles of opposing champions for the two sides of the debate.

In mainland China, cryptocurrency transactions and exchanges were effectively banned by regulation in September 2017. This prohibition, which includes stablecoins, remains in place to this day.

However, in 2019, the government began an official pilot for a digital yuan CBDC, also known as the e-CHY. Since then, the digital yuan has become one of the most advanced and widely used CBDCs in the world. As of November, the government had processed more than 3.4 billion transactions worth nearly 16.7 trillion yuan ($2.38 trillion).

In contrast, the U.S. is staunchly anti-CBDC, with the prevailing view amongst lawmakers being that it could be misused as a tool of state surveillance and oppression. U.S. critics of CBDCs often point to China's digital yuan as a cautionary tale “we must avoid a CBDC, lest we become a totalitarian surveillance state like communist China”. To this end, one of President Trump's first acts upon taking office for a second time, in January 2025, was to sign an executive order banning CBDCs in the U.S.

In keeping with its free-market-above-all principles, the U.S. has instead thrown its weight behind private-sector U.S. dollar-issued stablecoins. In June, Trump signed into law the long-awaited ‘GENIUS Act' to provide regulatory certainty and support for the domestic U.S. stablecoin sector.

In terms of where other countries fall in this debate, the Atlantic Council's CBDC tracker currently identifies 81 jurisdictions exploring or developing a retail CBDC, with 38 pilots already launched. Among these are major economies, including those in Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia, Brazil, Japan, India, and the U.S.'s two bordering neighbors, Mexico and Canada.

This suggests that Trump and co. may be losing the argument when it comes to CBDCs. Yet, the booming stablecoin space appears unaffected by these developments, which in turn suggests that maybe the two monetary technologies could coexist after all.

The People's Bank of China has officially transitioned its central bank digital currency (e-CNY) into a new era of “digital deposit money” as of January 1, 2026. Under an ambitious new action plan, the central bank has authorized ten major commercial institutions—including Tencent's WeBank and Alibaba-affiliated MYbank—to begin paying interest on verified digital yuan balances. This policy shift represents a fundamental departure from the original 2014 vision of the e-CNY as a purely digital substitute for physical cash, which traditionally carries no yield. By allowing banks to offer an annual interest rate of approximately 0.05% on digital wallet holdings, the PBOC aims to revive stagnant adoption rates and deepen the integration of the digital yuan into the nation's formal asset-liability management systems. This move makes China the first major global economy to position its CBDC as a competitive, interest-bearing alternative to traditional savings accounts.

The new framework formally reclassifies digital yuan balances from “M0” (physical currency) to “M1” deposit-like liabilities, a technical shift with profound implications for the Chinese banking sector. For the first time, e-CNY balances held in real-name verified wallets will be treated as commercial bank liabilities, meaning they are now included in reserve requirement calculations and, most importantly, covered by China's national deposit insurance system. This transition provides a level of financial security for digital yuan holders that was previously reserved for traditional bank accounts, effectively removing the “time value loss” that users suffered when holding non-interest-bearing digital cash. To facilitate this rollout, the ten authorized banks have completed extensive system upgrades to ensure that interest is calculated and credited seamlessly to user wallets, matching the prevailing rates for demand deposits at the country's largest state-owned financial institutions.

By introducing a yield component, the People's Bank of China is making a strategic bid to challenge the dominance of private payment ecosystems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. While these platforms have long controlled the majority of China's cashless transactions, the state-backed digital yuan now offers a unique combination of government-guaranteed security and interest-bearing utility. Beyond domestic retail use, the interest-bearing e-CNY is also being positioned as a foundational tool for the “RMB International Operations Center” in Shanghai. The PBOC intends to leverage this new deposit-like status to attract international trade partners, including upcoming pilots with Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. As the digital yuan becomes a “stress-testable” monetary instrument with clear legal protections and yield potential, China is signaling its intent to lead the global CBDC race, creating a programmable financial infrastructure that bridges the gap between legacy banking and the future of on-chain sovereign settlement.

  Several central banks are pursuing plans to potentially introduce a central bank digital currency. This column uses survey data covering the 11 largest euro area countries to show that many consumers would be open to using a digital euro, primarily – as intended – for transactions rather than as an investment or savings vehicle. This would lead to only a small reallocation of liquidity away from bank deposits. The authors also find that different holding limits would have only a small effect on the composition of households' liquid asset holdings, and that effective communication can play an important role in informing consumers and encouraging adoption.


Several central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), are pursuing plans to potentially introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) alongside physical money. Such plans are being drawn up in the context of a fast changing payment landscape, marked by reduced usage of cash, rising geostrategic considerations, and the rise of fintech (Berg et al. 2024, Cong and Mayer 2025). At the same time, central banks are trying to avoid a potentially destabilising allocation of wealth into central bank digital money. In particular, it might result in financial disintermediation – a move away from traditional bank deposits into central bank digital money – and pose threats to financial stability (e.g. Andolfatto 2021, Ahnert et al. 2023, 2024, Whited et al. 2023, Schilling et al. 2024, Bidder et al. 2024). For this reason, in designing the digital euro, the Eurosystem has included several safeguards in the design of the digital euro design to avoid that it might result in financial disintermediation.
1



In a recent paper (Georgarakos et al. 2025), we attempt to shed light on the potential effects of the prospective introduction of a digital euro and the role it could play in households' financial asset portfolios. First, we document how many consumers are aware of the ECB's plans to potentially introduce a digital euro and whether they would be willing to adopt it. Second, we look at the risks of financial disintermediation during non-crisis times. We do this by showing how the availability of a digital euro would affect households' portfolio allocation choices and how holding limits – i.e. the maximum amount of digital euros that could be held in a digital wallet at any point in time – would influence their choice to reallocate liquid wealth to a digital euro. Third, we demonstrate how effectively communicating the key features of the CBDC to consumers could increase the likelihood that they would adopt it. Throughout, we draw on rich micro-level data from the ECB's Consumer Expectations Survey (CES), covering the 11 largest euro area countries.
2



On 14 July 2021, the Governing Council of the ECB announced the launch of the investigation phase of the digital euro project. According to CES data collected back in 2021, only about 9% of respondents had heard about the digital euro (Ehrmann et al. 2025). But this had increased to around 40% by March 2024, reflecting the ECB's public communication efforts (Figure 1, panel a). In addition, the CES results show that about 45% of all surveyed consumers indicate they would be likely to adopt a digital euro and use it in their daily lives (Figure 1, panel b).

However, consumers' propensity to adopt digital central bank money differs across use cases and is highest for online and in-person retail payments (Figure 1, panel b). Looking at different groups of consumers, we also document substantial differences in their willingness to use a digital euro. For example, younger, higher-income and more educated consumers are more likely to adopt digital central bank money. Among consumers aged 18-34, about 55% said that they would probably use a digital euro for any of the different use cases, and among consumers in the highest income quartile, 53% said they would likely use digital central bank money for any of the use cases. There are also some less pronounced differences across groups of consumers with different levels of education: 48% of consumers who have a bachelor's degree or above would likely use a digital euro compared with 42% of consumers who do not have a bachelor's degree. Overall, the differences in adoption propensity across demographic groups highlight how important it is to consider financial inclusion when designing and introducing digital central bank money.

Figure 1 Awareness of, and willingness to adopt, a digital euro



Another frequently discussed question is how the availability of digital central bank money – an unremunerated, highly liquid, safe asset directly issued by the central bank – might affect consumers' portfolio allocation. In this respect, earlier research by Keister and Sanches (2023) shows a liquidity–safety trade-off, with bank deposits yielding a return but involving default risk, whereas central bank digital money, being risk-free, has the potential to crowd out deposits. Overall, while the introduction of central bank digital money could thus help improve liquidity allocation in the economy, if no safeguards are applied, there is also a risk that it might lead to a shrinkage in the deposit base, an increase in bank funding costs or, in extreme cases, disintermediate banks.

Therefore, a central question arises: how would households adapt their financial asset portfolios following the introduction of digital central bank money? In order to try to answer this question, we asked CES respondents to imagine they had received a windfall of €10,000 (e.g. a bonus, a gift, or a bequest). We then asked consumers to report how they would allocate this unexpected gain in wealth across different assets, including liquid asset holdings like physical cash and digital euros. This approach is in line with recent developments in survey methodology (Stantcheva 2023). Previous studies have used similar scenario questions to examine how consumption responds to hypothetical positive wealth shocks (e.g. Shapiro and Slemrod 2003, Christelis et al. 2025).

Our results indicate that consumers would only allocate on average about 5% of the hypothetical windfall of €10,000 to digital euros (Figure 2). This level of allocation does not significantly crowd out other asset classes. In contrast, consumers would allocate more than half of the windfall to current accounts or savings accounts (53%). They also choose to allocate 12% to physical cash, which is the closest substitute to a digital euro in the sense that both cash and the digital euro are central bank money, with the difference being that cash cannot be used as a substitute when it comes to paying digitally. But the average portfolio share allocated to digital euros exceeds the share allocated to highly risky, alternative digital crypto-assets. These results suggest that, under normal conditions, digital central bank money would act primarily as a transactional asset rather than an investment or savings vehicle. So, the introduction of a digital euro would result in only a small reallocation of liquidity away from retail bank deposits.

One important design feature of a digital euro, aimed at addressing any possible unintended consequences for bank disintermediation, concerns the maximum amount of digital euros that could be held in a digital wallet at any point in time. To assess how such holding limits could affect portfolio allocations, we randomly assigned different possible holding limit values to CES respondents, ranging from €1,000 to €10,000. Subsequently, we asked respondents how much money they would allocate out of their current liquid resources to digital euros, subject to the holding limit they had been randomly assigned. This way, we could estimate the effect of the holding limits on the fraction of consumers' current total liquid resources (e.g. in current/savings bank accounts or in cash) that they would allocate to digital euros. Our results suggest that the size of the holding limit made no noticeable difference to the allocation of current liquid resources to digital euros. These findings are consistent with the view that, under normal conditions, CBDC adoption is unlikely to trigger large-scale financial disintermediation.

Figure 2 Portfolio allocation out of a hypothetical €10,000 wealth shock (share of €10,000)



While 45% of consumers reported in 2024 that they were willing to adopt a digital euro, other consumers reported that they were unlikely to adopt it. This raises the question as to whether central bank communication can contribute to broadening adoption and use. To assess this, we made use of a randomised control trial embedded in the March 2024 CES web survey round. It provided a random sub-group of respondents with an official ECB video, which gave information about the digital euro's key features and potential uses. We could then estimate the effect of this video communication on the likelihood of consumers adopting a digital euro.

We found that the information in the video had sizeable and statistically significant positive effects on the propensity of adoption for each of the four possible uses. For example, it increased the propensity of adoption for offline retail payments by 13 percentage points. In fact, the video communication not only affected adoption propensities among consumers without any prior knowledge, but also among those who had already heard about the CBDC before watching the video. Nonetheless, there is also evidence of habit persistence in payment preferences. Some consumers, even after having watched the video, reported a low propensity of adoption. Additionally, three months later, in June 2024, we asked all CES respondents whether they were aware of the digital euro. As in previous studies (e.g. Coibion et al. 2024), we found evidence that the effect of the information in the video seemed to fade quite quickly.

Understanding the possible future consumer response to the introduction of digital central bank money is an important research and policy priority. In our recent research, we provide several new insights. For example, our results suggest that many consumers would be open to using a digital euro. In addition, under normal conditions and as intended, a digital euro would primarily be used for transactions rather than as an investment or savings vehicle. Accordingly, the introduction of a digital euro is estimated to lead to only a small reallocation of liquidity away from bank deposits. Our findings also suggest that different holding limits from €1,000 up to €10,000 would have quite small and insignificant effects on the composition of households' liquid asset holdings. And last but not least, we find evidence that effective communication can play an important role in informing consumers about this new form of payment – and encouraging them to adopt it.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

As bitcoin BTC$93.235,03 clings to recent gains above $93,000, capital shifts from memecoins to utility tokens, with assets supposedly linked to artificial intelligence (AI) leading the charge.

CoinDesk's Culture and Entertainment Select Index, Metaverse Select Index, 10 Capped ex-Bitcoin Index, and the DeFi Select Index have gained over 4% each over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Meme Select Index was little-changed to negative, pausing its recent rally.

It shows capital rotating into substance, or established sub-sectors with utility, such as DeFi and metaverse, rather than speculative, jokey cryptocurrencies. That's a strong signal for the sustainability of crypto's recent bounce.

Among individual tokens, AI-linked coins have done well in the past 24 hours. For instance, Render Network's RENDER climbed 20%, becoming the best performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Render is a leading decentralized GPU compute platform for applications ranging from 3D rendering to machine learning and generative AI. Smaller AI tokens such as Virtuals Protocol's VIRTUAL token have risen over 6%

Layer-1 blockchain Sui's native coin, SUI$1,8179, has rallied over 15% on expectations of privacy tech, rivalling gains in Provenance Blockchain's HASH token. Payments-focused XRP jumped 10% to its highest in nearly two months, while Solana's sol SOL$137,66 remains locked in a multimonth range despite the recent bounce.

These moves are consistent with the renewed optimism for AI and high-beta tech stocks on Wall Street.

Antonio Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com, said that increased geopolitical tensions and impending economic data, particularly Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, warrant attention.

""Markets remain on alert amid rising geopolitical tensions following the U.S. offensive against Venezuela, a factor that has heightened perceptions of systemic risk and curbed enthusiasm for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies,"" he noted, adding that a weak payrolls figure could influence the Fed's monetary policy and investor risk appetite.

Other analysts said that continued gains in the crypto market depend on bitcoin ETF inflows, which have begun 2026 on a positive note, accumulating over $1 billion in the first two trading days. These inflows need to continue to keep the market bid.

In traditional markets, futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 were little changed, suggesting a cautious open after Monday's gain. The Nasdaq index has been consolidating in a narrowing price range (see Technical Analysis section). The direction in which it is eventually resolves will likely determine the next move and influence the crypto market accordingly. Stay alert!

Cayman Islands-registered Buck Labs has introduced the ""BUCK"" crypto token, positioning it as a yield-bearing “savings coin” aimed at users seeking returns on dollar-denominated crypto holdings without relying on traditional stablecoins.

The token is backed by shares in Strategy (MSTR) shares, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin with nearly 675,000 BTC on its balance sheet. 

BUCK is initially priced at $1 and is designed to distribute rewards currently targeted at around 7% annually, with returns accruing on a minute-by-minute basis, Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Buck Labs, told CoinDesk. BUCK is not marketed as a stablecoin and does not maintain a hard dollar peg, meaning its price may fluctuate based on market conditions.

Rewards distributed to holders are funded indirectly through the foundation's treasury holdings of Strategy's bitcoin-linked perpetual preferred stock, known as STRC, which pays periodic income to the treasury. Strategy and its chairman Michael Saylor are not affiliated with Buck and do not sponsor or endorse the token.

“Every healthy economy needs both a way to spend and a way to save, which is why Buck introduces the SavingsCoin,” said VanderZanden, who previously held leadership roles at Bird, Lyft and Uber. “Stablecoins have become very good at moving money, but Buck is designed for what happens in between, earning rewards on idle capital.

BUCK is structured as a governance token, with holders allowed to vote on reward distribution and other protocol decisions. The company said the token is intended for non-U.S. users initially and is not being offered as a security.

VanderZanden said the product is aimed at users who want predictable crypto-based returns without actively trading. “People want a simple way to earn rewards in crypto without becoming speculators,” he said. “Buck is designed to make saving in crypto more intuitive.”

Buck Labs said the product is designed to complement, rather than replace, existing stablecoins by offering a savings-focused alternative for longer-term holdings.

Morgan Stanley has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot bitcoin BTC$93,235.03 exchange-traded fund (ETF) and solana trust, pushing its digital assets ambitions further.  

The BTC product, called the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, is structured as an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of bitcoin, net of fees and expenses, according to a Form S-1 submitted on Jan. 6. If approved, the fund's shares are expected to list on a national securities exchange under a ticker symbol that has not yet been disclosed.

The bitcoin trust is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and will hold bitcoin directly rather than using derivatives or leverage. Its net asset value will be calculated daily using a designated bitcoin pricing benchmark derived from activity on major spot exchanges. The fund will be passive and will not attempt to trade bitcoin based on market conditions.

Shares will be created and redeemed only in large blocks by authorized participants, either in cash or in kind. Cash transactions will be executed through third-party bitcoin counterparties selected by the sponsor. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares on the secondary market through brokerage accounts.

Morgan Stanley's filing follows the rapid expansion of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market over the past two years. SoSoValue data shows these now have $123 billion in total net assets, equivalent to 6.57% of bitcoin's total market capitalization. Since the start of the year, net inflows to these products have topped $1.1 billion.

Morgan Stanley has also filed a Form S-1 with the SEC for the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, meant to track the price of solana. These funds, as data shows, have grown to more than $1 billion in total net assets, following a total cumulative net inflow of nearly $800 million.

The filings show Morgan Stanley shifting from simply distributing third-party crypto products to building its own in-house vehicles, signaling a deeper, higher-conviction commitment to digital assets.

This pivot is likely driven by the robust economics of the ETF and trust business, underscored by the substantial fee revenue traditional finance firms have generated from spot bitcoin products in a short period. For example, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETFs became the firm's top revenue source in November of last year, according to BlackRock Brazil's director of business development, Cristiano Castro, with allocations nearing $100 billion.

Unlike asset managers such as BlackRock, Morgan Stanley operates a massive wealth management arm with thousands of advisors that opened crypto access to clients in October last year. By leveraging its own ETFs, the bank can vertically integrate these products into its client portfolios, keeping management fees in-house rather than paying them to competitors.

Recent speculation suggests that the Venezuelan regime could hold a secret stash of bitcoin, potentially valued at upwards of $60 billion. But the claim appears to be rooted in conjecture and secondhand reporting, lacking credible onchain evidence tying those funds to state-controlled wallets. As a born and raised Venezuelan who mined bitcoin in the country for years, I don't believe the Venezuelan regime holds a massive secret stash of bitcoin, and I'll explain why.



First, let's break down the allegations. The claims from several articles suggest that the sources for the regime's bitcoin stash were:



1) A large gold sale, swapped for bitcoin in 2018;

2) Oil revenue priced in bitcoin; and

3) Stolen/seized mining equipment.



I do believe, and it has also been reported, that Venezuela received payment for some oil sales in crypto. And I know for a fact that it stole mining equipment — some of it was my family's. I haven't seen credible evidence that the 2018 gold sale was converted into bitcoin, and given what we know about the key players, it's unlikely.





The operation's alleged mastermind, Alex Saab, the current minister of industry and national production, was in U.S. custody from 2020 to 2023. Former President Joe Biden's administration released him back to Venezuela in December 2023 as part of a prisoner exchange. At the time of his release, according to swirling speculation, the amount of BTC he controlled would have been worth an estimated $10-$20 billion.



For context, the Venezuelan Central Bank's listed reserves at the time of his release were ~$9.9 billion, and those official reserves did not include any publicly identified BTC disclosures. If Saab truly controlled ~2X the Venezuelan Central Bank reported reserves before he was released, it certainly doesn't align with the public record. Moreover, Saab spent years in U.S. custody, with limited ability to direct complex financial operations, not to mention the absence of any credible onchain attribution linking wallets of that scale to him or the Venezuelan state.





Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro's regimes have a long and well-documented history of extreme corruption. Venezuela's extreme corruption would not have allowed any meaningful value to accrue to the regime's treasury. There are too many corruption examples to list, but let's focus specifically on SUNACRIP, the supposed crypto regulator set up by the regime. Back in March 2023, there was a scandal involving high-ranking corrupt officials embezzling billions of dollars personally, through irregular oil sales to the state oil company, PDVSA. From 2020-2023, these officials stole an estimated $17.6 billion. In other words, any “profits” above and beyond what PDVSA needs to barely exist have most likely been siphoned into the pockets of corrupt members of the regime.





The regime has a long track record of mismanaging complex operations — even strategic ones like PDVSA. In addition to the thousands of private businesses it expropriated and bankrupted since 1999, it decimated the crown jewel — the state-owned oil company, PDVSA. Between 1999 and today, the regime took PDVSA from a world-class oil production company producing 3.5 million barrels per day, to an anemic operation with a capacity of just 800,000 barrels per day. The regime can't operate effectively, even when it steals or inherits state-of-the-art equipment.



Another reason is the chronic energy shortages ravaging the country. Although Venezuela is rich in oil reserves, the country's electrical infrastructure is in such bad shape that citizens all over the country suffer from programmed blackouts for over four hours each day, sometimes multiple times a day. The country's electrical grid remains fragile due to chronic underinvestment, poor maintenance of infrastructure (especially the Guri Dam hydroelectric complex, which supplies ~70–80% of Venezuela's power), loss of skilled workers from emigration, and reliance on aging systems. This leads to both unplanned outages and deliberate rationing to prevent total collapses.



Unpredictable and unreliable energy sources present challenges when setting up large-scale mining operations in less-than-ideal conditions (remember, these are not pristine data centres we're talking about here — wear and tear on these machines is tough, I've seen it first hand).



In short, I do think there's Bitcoin in Venezuela. It's just not in the hands of the regime.

Major US crypto stocks soared on Monday as the wider crypto market mounted a comeback, with Bitcoin and Ether hitting three-week highs.

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

Major public US crypto companies rallied double-digits on Monday after a crypto market rally that saw major tokens hit multi-week highs.

Crypto infrastructure platform Bakkt (BKKT) led Monday's gains with a nearly 31.5% rise, and climbed nearly 5% after the bell to $15.52. Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company Kindly MD (NAKA) was among the top five largest gainers, closing the day up over 24%.

Crypto mining companies also saw their shares move higher, with American Bitcoin (ABTC) climbing 13.5% to over $2 for the first time in nearly a month.

Hut 8 (HUT), IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) all posted gains of between 13.5% to 12% for the day. All companies have refitted their businesses to support artificial intelligence to take advantage of a major rush for the high-performance computers needed to run the technology.

Crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN), Gemini (GEMI) and Robinhood (HOOD) gained between 7% to 7.5% on Monday as the cryptocurrency market came back to life after a holiday period lull.

In the past 24 hours, the total capitalization of the crypto market has risen by 1.3% to nearly $3.3 trillion, adding to its gains from just over $3 trillion at the start of 2026.

Bitcoin has gained 1.2% in the past day, cooling to $93,800 after hitting a 24-hour high of over $94,600, its highest price since early December. It has now gained over 7% since Jan. 1 as market sentiment continued to improve.

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, hit a daily high of over $3,200, its highest price in over three weeks, while XRP (XRP) soared by nearly 12% on the day to $2.39, its highest since mid-November.

Analysts at the crypto data platform Glassnode said on Monday that behavior in spot crypto markets “shows a meaningful reduction in sell-side aggression,” while volumes had “ expanded modestly, pointing to improving liquidity without signs of speculative excess.”

They added that Bitcoin was “transitioning out of its corrective phase and into a fragile consolidation regime,” and subdued demand on-chain leaves the market “sensitive to volatility and profit-taking risk as it attempts to rebuild higher ground.”

A satellite designed to measure the height of the ocean surface was in the right place at the right time when a powerful earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula sent a tsunami across the Pacific in late July.

The spacecraft, known as the Surface Water Ocean Topography or SWOT satellite, recorded the first high resolution space-based track of a major subduction zone tsunami, according to researchers writing in The Seismic Record.

Instead of a simple wave moving cleanly across the ocean, the satellite data revealed a surprisingly intricate pattern of waves spreading, interacting, and scattering across the basin. Scientists say this detailed view could improve understanding of how tsunamis travel and how they may ultimately affect coastlines.

Combining satellite data with ocean sensors

To better understand the event, Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland and his colleagues combined the satellite observations with measurements from DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys located along the tsunami's path. These deep-ocean sensors helped them refine estimates of the earthquake that triggered the waves.

The July 29 earthquake struck in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone with a magnitude of 8.8, making it the sixth largest earthquake recorded worldwide since 1900.

""I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses,"" said Ruiz-Angulo. ""Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean. There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface.""

A satellite built for water, not disasters

SWOT was launched in December 2022 as a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Its main goal is to deliver the first global survey of Earth's surface water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes.

Ruiz-Angulo said he and co-author Charly de Marez had spent more than two years studying SWOT data to understand everyday ocean features such as small eddies. ""[We] had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami.""

Rethinking how giant tsunamis behave

Because the wavelength of large tsunamis is much longer than the depth of the ocean, scientists have traditionally described them as ""non-dispersive."" In simple terms, this means the wave is expected to travel as a single, stable form rather than breaking into multiple waves that spread out over time.

""The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive,"" Ruiz-Angulo explains.

When the team compared the satellite observations with computer simulations, they found that tsunami models that included dispersion matched the real-world data more closely than traditional models.

""The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run,"" Ruiz-Angulo added. ""This 'extra' variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before.""

A longer earthquake rupture than expected

The researchers also noticed a mismatch between tsunami arrival times predicted by earlier models and the actual measurements recorded by two DART tide gauges. One gauge recorded the tsunami earlier than expected, while the other detected it later.

Using the buoy data in a technique known as inversion, the team reexamined the source of the tsunami. Their analysis suggested the earthquake rupture extended farther south than previously thought and stretched about 400 kilometers -- significantly longer than the 300 kilometers estimated by other models.

""Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip,"" said study co-author Diego Melgar.

Why mixing data matters

Since that 2011 disaster, Melgar's research group and others have worked to better integrate DART buoy data into earthquake and tsunami analyses. However, this approach is still not routine.

Since then, Melgar's lab and others have been working on ways to include DART data in inversions, ""but it is still not always done because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different than the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data. But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible,"" Melgar said.

Improving future tsunami warnings

The Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone has produced some of the largest tsunamis on record, including a devastating event in 1952 triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. That disaster led to the creation of the international tsunami warning system that later issued alerts across the Pacific during the 2025 event.

""With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting,"" Ruiz-Angulo said.

Sleep is a conserved behavior across all animals with a nervous system, ranging from cnidarians to humans. Considering the survival risks, why sleep evolved in basal lineages and what essential benefits it provides to the simple nerve net of nocturnal and diurnal invertebrates remain elusive. We used behavioral criteria to empirically define sleep in the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea andromeda and the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Light and homeostasis were the primary drivers of sleep in C. andromeda, which slept at night and napped at midday in both the laboratory and the natural habitat. In contrast, both the circadian clock and homeostatic processes regulated sleep in N. vectensis, which increased sleep at dawn. Similar to humans, C. andromeda, wild-type (WT) and Clock mutant (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis slept about one-third of the day, irrespective of the daily timing and architecture of sleep, and melatonin promoted sleep in accordance with the species-specific chronotype. Notably, sleep deprivation, ultraviolet radiation, and mutagens increased neuronal DNA damage and sleep pressure, while spontaneous and induced sleep facilitated genome stability in both the diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. These results suggest that DNA damage and cellular stress in simple nerve nets may have driven the evolution of sleep.

Sleep is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved behavioral state prevalent across the animal kingdom, ranging from cnidarians to insects and mammals, suggesting that sleep is a Cambrian metazoan adaptation1,2,3,4,5,6. Sleep deprivation (SD) and disturbances are associated with increased risks for health decline in bilaterian animals7,8. The roles of sleep range from cellular repair and energy restoration to synaptic plasticity9,10,11,12. Nevertheless, the evolution of sleep came with major fitness compromises, such as reduced awareness of the environment and vulnerability to predation, and the fundamental conserved cellular functions of sleep remain elusive1,2,13.

Sleep is defined by behavioral criteria and neuronal activity patterns. In most non-mammalian animals, sleep is characterized solely by distinct behavioral criteria, including consolidated periods of behavioral immobility accompanied by an increased arousal threshold in response to external stimuli and species-specific postures1,2,14,15. Sleep is regulated by the circadian process, which determines sleep timing, and by the homeostatic process, which compensates for SD. The presence of sleep and these regulatory processes in basal and derived nocturnal and diurnal species suggests a common evolutionary origin of sleep regulation16,17.

Sleep plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity: it reduces DNA damage, which accumulates during wakefulness in neurons of flies, fish, and mice18,19,20,21. The causes of DNA damage are diverse and include the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the inadvertent action of nuclear enzymes, and neuronal activity20,22,23. The non-dividing and irreplaceable mature excitable neurons may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. This cell type evolutionarily emerged in basal metazoans24 and may require sleep to facilitate cellular maintenance. Indeed, sleep-like behavior has recently been observed in two diurnal cnidarians, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea and Hydra vulgaris (H. vulgaris)3,4, suggesting that the development of simple nerve nets in cnidarians25,26 coincided with the emergence of sleep.

Cnidarians represent one of the most ancient animal lineages possessing neurons, which extend neurites throughout the endodermal and ectodermal layers, and contain conserved neurotransmitters and neuropeptides27,28. The jellyfish Cassiopea, which lives in obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates, exhibits rhythmic daily activity that peaks during the day4. In contrast, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (N. vectensis), which lacks symbiotic eukaryotes, is considered nocturnal29,30. However, sleep architecture has not been empirically defined in Cassiopea, and sleep has not been characterized in N. vectensis. Thus, the mechanisms that drove the evolution of sleep in these model animals are unknown.

To dissect the origin of animal sleep and its core cellular drivers, we defined and analyzed sleep architecture in Cassiopea andromeda (C. andromeda) and N. vectensis. We found that the light/dark cycle and homeostatic pressure are the primary regulators of sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda, whereas the circadian clock and homeostatic drive are the predominant regulators of sleep in the crepuscular (active at dusk) N. vectensis. Notably, the results demonstrated that the capacity of sleep to relieve neuronal DNA damage is an ancestral trait shared by both symbiotic diurnal and non-symbiotic crepuscular cnidarians. We suggest that sleep may have evolved to enable consolidated periods of neural maintenance.

In Cassiopea, a sleep-like state has been characterized by monitoring the rate of pulsation activity of the jellyfish umbrella, which reduces during the night4. To quantify sleep, it is essential to determine the threshold of the pulsation frequency, which can differentiate sleep from wake behavior. An infrared (IR) camera was used to track the simultaneous behavior of multiple C. andromeda during the day and night (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Pulsation events were determined by monitoring the changes in pixel intensity, which reflected expansion and contraction of the C. andromeda bell diameter (Fig. 1b). Consistent with its diurnal nature, locomotor activity consistently reduced during the night in C. andromeda under 12 h light:12 h dark (LD) conditions with a mean pulsation rate of 36.4 ± 1.6 and 31.9 ± 1.4 pulses/min during the day and night, respectively (mean ± SEM; Fig. 1c, d). The constant pulsing behavior31 precluded the use of quiescence to define sleep in C. andromeda. To identify the arousal threshold distinguishing sleep from wake in C. andromeda, we applied a brief light stimulus at night and measured the response latency (Fig. 1e). A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (Fig. 1g, j). We found that C. andromeda, which pulsed fewer than 37 times per minute (Fig. 1f–h) for more than 3 min (Fig. 1i–k) were slower to respond to the stimulus. Thus, this threshold was used to characterize sleep in C. andromeda. Applying this criterion revealed that the average sleep time increased during the night (63.7%) compared to the day (45.3%) under LD in C. andromeda (Fig. 1l, m). Notably, similar to findings in primates and flies32,33, a midday nap was also observed in C. andromeda (Fig. 1l). The daily average sleep time rhythm was 24.2 h (Fig. 1n). However, rhythmic locomotor activity was abolished under constant darkness (DD) and robustly dampened under constant light (LL) conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). Moreover, under forced desynchrony conditions (6 h L:6 h D:6 h L:6 h D, LDLD), the animals showed a 12.1 h rhythm of locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig. 1e–g). These findings showed that sleep is primarily driven by the light/dark cycle in C. andromeda. To determine whether sleep in C. andromeda is regulated by a homeostatic process, we sleep-deprived the animals for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) using computer-controlled alternating repeated water turbulence at night (Supplementary Movie 2). Following SD, C. andromeda displayed sleep rebound, i.e., sleep-deprived animals slept 1.5-fold more than control animals during the day (Fig. 1o, p). In contrast, SD during the active period (ZT5-11) did not induce sleep rebound (Supplementary Fig. 1k, l). These findings show that sleep is regulated by light and homeostatic drive in the diurnal symbiotic C. andromeda.

To generalize the sleep criteria found in the laboratory to Cassiopea's natural habitat, we monitored the pulsation behavior of wild animals (Supplementary Fig. 1 m) during day and night ( ~ 15 h L: ~9 h D) in shallow water adjacent to the seashore of Key Largo, FL. The findings revealed a strong negative association between the size of Cassiopea and their pulsation rate (Fig. 1q). We therefore normalized the average activity according to the size of each group and showed elevated activity during the day at the sea (Fig. 1r and Supplementary Fig. 1n). Notably, the pulsation threshold used to detect sleep under controlled laboratory conditions (37 pulses/min, Fig. 1f–h) closely matched the average daytime pulse rate observed in the lab (36.4 pulses/min, Fig. 1d). Given this similarity, we approximated the sleep threshold in the field by the average daytime pulse rate, adjusted according to the bell diameter, as a proxy to differentiate sleeping and awake animals. Utilizing this model, we found that the sleep architecture of Cassiopea is similar in the laboratory and the sea. In their natural habitat, the animals primarily sleep at night and nap during midday (Fig. 1s). These results enable the quantification of sleep in various sizes of Cassiopea living in the laboratory and in their natural habitat at sea.

Although rhythmic locomotor activity has been described in N. vectensis29,30,34, sleep was not characterized in sea anemones, including N. vectensis. To detect the state of sleep, we used an IR camera and monitored the behavior of 18 N. vectensis placed individually in three 6-well plate arenas (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Movie 3). We quantified the levels of movement by calculating pixel change above a quiescence threshold, which was set based on MgCl2-paralyzed animals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). We analyzed 6 h bins (Supplementary Fig. 4) but chose 12 h windows (ZT18-6 and ZT6-18) because they encompass the full crepuscular (i.e., active at dusk) behavioral pattern and align with the 12 h light/dark periods used for C. andromeda (Fig. 1m), facilitating cross-species statistics. In contrast to C. andromeda, under LD, N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity (Fig. 2c), which increased between ZT6-ZT18 and decreased between ZT18-ZT6 (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that N. vectensis is a crepuscular animal. Notably, the exposure to a sudden artificial dark-to-light transition transiently induced locomotor activity (ZT0-2, Fig. 2c). This robust response to light was used as a stimulus to identify increased arousal threshold in sleeping animals. During daytime (ZT2), N. vectensis was exposed to various light intensities and showed a negative correlation between the light intensity and response latency (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2f–k). Using the intermediate-intensity light stimulus and optimization algorithm (Fig. 2g), we found a slower response in N. vectensis individuals that were quiescent for more than 8 min prior to the light stimulus (Fig. 2f–h). To validate this arousal threshold, we tested the response to an additional sensory stimulus, i.e., a food cue. Similar to the response to light (Fig. 2f-h), quiescence lasting at least 8 min resulted in a slower response and could differentiate sleep from quiet wakefulness (Fig. 2i–k). Thus, we defined sleep in N. vectensis as a quiescence state of at least 8 min, which is associated with reversible behavior and increased arousal threshold.

This characterization of sleep enabled us to convert mobility data to sleep time (Supplementary Fig. 2a-e). The crepuscular N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity and an average sleep duration of 25 ± 2.3 min during ZT18-ZT6 and 14 ± 1.8 min during ZT6-ZT18, with a sleep period of 23.4 h under LD conditions (mean ± SEM). Similarly, the rhythmic sleep period was 22.5 h under DD (Fig. 2l-n, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that sleep is regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis. To further differentiate between light- and circadian-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep under forced desynchrony (LDLD). While the rhythmic period of locomotor activity was 22.2 h and controlled by the clock, sleep period was 11.7 h (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f, i, j). These results suggest that although sleep is primarily regulated by the circadian clock it can also be modulated by light in N. vectensis. To understand the hierarchy of light- and intrinsic clock-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep in NvClkΔ mutant34 (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis. NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis showed bimodal sleep/wake rhythms (periods of 12.25 h and 25.24 h) under LD and this rhythm was abolished under DD (Fig. 2o–q, Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Under LDLD, the sleep/wake cycle followed the 6 h alternating light/dark rhythm (Supplementary Fig.3k, l). These findings demonstrate that the transcription factor NvClk is essential for maintaining clock-controlled sleep in N. vectensis. To further characterize sleep, we examined species-specific association with posture. Sleep time was monitored in animals displaying closed or open tentacles (Fig. 2r). Although close or open tentacle posture did not strictly differentiate sleep from wake state; i.e. animals with closed tentacles can be awake and vice versa, the closed tentacle N. vectensis slept 2.1-fold more than open tentacles N. vectensis at the peak of the sleep period (ZT23, Fig. 2s). To test whether homeostatic process regulates sleep, we sleep-deprived the N. vectensis for 8 h during sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) using gradual and gentle water exchange once per hour (Supplementary Movie 4). Following SD, sleep-deprived animals slept 1.24-fold more than control animals (Fig. 2t, u), indicating a homeostatic sleep drive. In contrast, control SD during the activity period (ZT8-ZT16) did not induce a sleep rebound (Fig. 2v, w). Altogether, while sleep can be modulated by light, a combination of circadian and homeostatic processes are the primary regulators of sleep in the crepuscular N. vectensis.

The establishment of sleep criteria in two cnidarians, which sleep at different times of the day, enabled us to study species-specific changes in sleep architecture and regulatory mechanisms. The analysis of sleep time revealed nocturnal sleep in C. andromeda, and a crepuscular rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in WT N. vectensis, which was abolished in NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis under constant conditions (Fig. 2). However, total sleep time over 24 h was similar in C. andromeda, WT and NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (Fig. 3a). To determine sleep patterns, we quantified the length and number of sleep bouts during the sleep and wake periods of each species. We found longer sleep bout durations and a higher number of sleep bouts at ZT18-6 compared to ZT6-18, under LD, in both WT (Fig. 3b, c) and NvClkΔ/Δ (Fig. 3d, e) N. vectensis. Similarly, under LD conditions, sleep bout length and the number of sleep bouts increased during the night (ZT12-0) in the diurnal C. andromeda (Fig. 3f, g). Inter-species comparison of sleep architecture revealed that although total sleep time was similar (Fig. 3a), the average sleep bout length was shorter by 2.8 min (Fig. 3h), and the mean number of sleep bouts was approximately two-fold higher (Fig. 3i) in C. andromeda compared to N. vectensis. These results show that, like humans, both cnidarian species spend approximately one-third of their lives sleeping (Fig. 3a). However, sleep is more consolidated in N. vectensis, i.e., longer and less fragmented sleep bouts, compared to C. andromeda.

The presence of circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in cnidarians suggests a common neuroregulatory mechanism. The melatonin hormone is secreted from the pineal gland during the night and mediates rhythmic daily physiological and behavioral processes in vertebrates35,36. However, its role in invertebrates remains poorly understood37,38. We tested the effect of melatonin on sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. While melatonin treatment did not affect sleep during the rest periods of N. vectensis (ZT3) and C. andromeda (ZT13) (Fig. 3j–l, s–u), sleep time, sleep bout duration, and the number of sleep bouts increased during the active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. 3m–o, p–r). These results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role of melatonin in sleep regulation across animals with different chronotypes.

The presence of sleep in cnidarians indicates that sleep evolved independently of the brain. Studies in fish have shown that sleep decreases DNA damage and is essential for the health of single, non-dividing neurons18,19. To investigate cellular factors that might have driven the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians, we monitored DNA damage levels in single cells of N. vectensis and C. andromeda during the sleep/wake cycle and following SD (Fig. 4a–d). We hypothesized that DNA damage would peak and decline following extended wake and sleep, respectively. To identify the time points of maximal and minimal sleep pressure, we calculated the average sleep time over the past 12 h that preceded each time point. Both C. andromeda and N. vectensis were sampled at the end of their wake (ZT11 and ZT17) and sleep (ZT23 and ZT8) phases (Fig. 4a, b), where wake and sleep accumulation peaked (Fig. 4c, d). DNA damage was quantified using immunohistochemical assays with an antibody against the phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a well-established biomarker of cellular response to DNA damage39. The number of nuclear γH2AX foci was quantified in the neuron-enriched mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue40, located adjacent to individual rhopalium of C. andromeda (Fig. 4e, g), and in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)27 N. vectensis (Fig. 4f, h). Under LD, the number of γH2AX foci increased at the end of the wakefulness period in C. andromeda (ZT11) and N. vectensis (ZT17) and reduced at the end of the sleep period in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) (Fig. 4i, j). The opposite timing of DNA damage reduction between C. andromeda and N. vectensis was aligned with their species-specific chronotype and daily timing of sleep. To determine the effect of homeostatic sleep pressure, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were sleep-deprived for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) and 8 h (ZT20-ZT4), respectively. Following SD, the number of γH2AX foci increased in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) and subsequently decreased to baseline levels following sleep recovery in both species (Fig. 4k, l). These results demonstrate that DNA damage accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep in both diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. Furthermore, these findings suggest that decreasing DNA damage during sleep is an evolutionarily conserved cellular function that may have contributed to the emergence of sleep in early metazoans.

The correlation between sleep drive and cellular stress (Fig. 4) raised the possibility that environmental and intrinsic factors, disrupting DNA integrity, promote sleep in cnidarians. UV radiation is a potent DNA damage agent and an ancient pervasive atmospheric stressor impacting marine invertebrates41,42,43. To determine the effect of UV radiation on DNA damage and sleep, we exposed C. andromeda and N. vectensis to 15 min and 60 min, respectively, of UVB radiation44 (312 nm) during the day (ZT8). In C. andromeda and N. vectensis, the number of γH2AX foci increased one hour after UV exposure (Fig. 5a, b, f, g). Subsequently, nighttime and daytime sleep increased in C. andromeda (Fig. 5k, l) and N. vectensis (Fig. 5m, n), respectively. Notably, following sleep recovery, the animals remained viable, and two days later, the levels of DNA damage reduced in C. andromeda (Fig. 5a, b, f, g). These results suggest that UV-mediated induction of DNA damage increases sleep pressure. Since UVB may also affect the behavior of cnidarians in alternative pathways45, we treated N. vectensis with the mutagenic compound Etoposide46. While UVB induces oxidative stress and damage to DNA bases, Etoposide inhibits the topoisomerase II enzyme and stabilizes DNA double-strand break formation. Similar to the effect of UV, Etoposide treatment abruptly increased the number of γH2AX foci (Fig. 5c, h). The animals then increased sleep during the following day and night (Fig. 5o, p), and DNA damage was reduced (Fig. 5c, h). Consistent with these findings, melatonin treatment, which promoted sleep during the species-specific active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. 3m, p), reduced γH2AX foci levels in both species (Fig. 5d, e, i, j). Together, these results show bidirectional interactions between sleep and DNA damage in early divergent lineage. Moreover, these inter-species comparative findings suggest that environmental factors, such as UV radiation and soluble mutagenic compounds, which can induce DNA damage and cellular stress, may have contributed to the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians.

Sleep is a vulnerable behavioral state, yet it is ubiquitous across animal species with a nervous system. This study proposes that sleep is an adaptive solution to the cellular cost of wakefulness. Wakefulness is associated with continuous sensory inputs and activity of irreplaceable neurons, enhanced cellular metabolism, and increased locomotion9,10,11,12. Particularly when combined with exposure to environmental mutagens, extended wakefulness can result in cellular stress. To investigate the evolution of sleep function, we characterized the sleep architecture of two cnidarians: the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. Like humans, both species require a total of approximately 8 h of sleep per day. While sleep is regulated by homeostatic pressure in both species, it is also regulated by the light and the circadian clock in C. andromeda and N. vectensis, respectively. Despite their divergent chronotype, both natural and melatonin-induced sleep reduce DNA damage levels, which increase during wakefulness, in both species. The relationship between sleep and DNA damage is bidirectional, and the induction of DNA damage can promote sleep pressure. Altogether, these findings suggest that sleep evolved to support cellular maintenance and preserve genomic integrity in ancient cnidarians possessing a simple nervous system.

In mammals, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and behavioral criteria are used to define sleep47. In most non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, EEG-based diagnostics are limited, making behavioral criteria the primary method for defining sleep1. Nevertheless, the behavioral sleep criteria have been supported by corresponding changes in neuronal activity in a few non-mammalian animals5,48,49. The recent identification of sleep-like behavior in cnidarians suggests that sleep predates the evolution of centralized nervous systems. Sleep-like states have been documented in Cassiopea4 and H. vulgaris3, and behavioral quiescence was observed in corals and box jellyfish in their natural habitat50,51,52. However, sleep had not previously been identified in the Anthozoans, and a specific arousal threshold was not determined in C. andromeda. Using arousal threshold experiments, we defined sleep as a minimum of 8 min of quiescence state in N. vectensis and 3 min under 37 pulses/min in C. andromeda. Although we observed a correlation between tentacle contraction and sleep in N. vectensis, both closed and open tentacle postures were observed during both sleep and wake states. In addition, C. andromeda maintained low but continuous pulsation activity while sleeping, supporting the idea that sleep cannot be defined solely by immobility or tentacle posture50,53. Likewise, migrating birds and marine mammals can sleep while moving, utilizing unihemispheric sleep54,55.

The quantitative measure of sleep enabled us to monitor sleep in the natural habitat, providing insights into how organisms regulate sleep under ecological conditions. In C. andromeda, we developed a predictive model for sleep duration across different organism sizes in wild populations inhabiting Key Largo, FL. These animals exhibited similar sleep duration and architecture as in controlled laboratory conditions, including short midday naps despite differences in salinity and temperature. These findings suggest that internal, species-specific cellular mechanisms shape the sleep pattern. Accordingly, we characterized the hierarchy of sleep regulatory mechanisms in two cnidarian species adapted to distinct ecological niches. Light and homeostatic drive were the predominant sleep regulatory processes in C. andromeda, while homeostatic drive and the circadian clock control sleep in N. vectensis. The light-dependence regulation may be attributed to the C. andromeda symbiosis with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, because photosynthesis-driven byproducts, such as ROS, increase cellular stress, DNA damage56,57,58,59 and sleep pressure. The rhythmic activity of the symbiotic algae is likely physiologically deficient under constant light or dark conditions, potentially disrupting the light-dependent rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in C. andromeda. In contrast, the sleep/wake cycle is regulated by the clock even under constant environmental conditions in the non-symbiotic and crepuscular N. vectensis. Indeed, oxygen consumption, and possibly also ROS levels, are regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis60, supporting the idea that intrinsic molecular clocks control the timing of sleep in cnidarians lacking photosymbiosis.

The neuroendocrinological mechanisms that regulate sleep in cnidarians is unknown. We showed that despite their opposing chronotypes, melatonin treatment promoted sleep and reduced DNA damage levels in both species during their respective active phases, suggesting a conserved role for this hormone in sleep modulation. Future extended monitoring of sleep for several days may reveal an additional circadian phase-shifting effect of melatonin. Similarly, exogenous melatonin promoted sleep in diurnal species, such as zebrafish61, and reduces locomotor activity and increases sleep in nocturnal species, such as flatworms62 and mice63, respectively. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland and binds to melatonin receptors in vertebrates35,36. However, although endogenous melatonin production was demonstrated in basal metazoans64, the mechanism of action is less understood in invertebrates. In the roundworm C. elegans, melatonin activates a specific potassium channel65, and similar channels may play an evolutionarily conserved role in mediating the sleep effect of melatonin in cnidarians. Future research in cnidarians, including genetic manipulations, may determine the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant, explain the mechanisms underlying its regulation and elucidate how pharmacological melatonin treatment contributes to sleep and DNA damage regulation in both nocturnal and diurnal animals.

In both C. andromeda and N. vectensis, we observed the accumulation of neuronal DNA damage during wakefulness, which was alleviated during sleep, whereas SD impaired this recovery process. These results in simple nerve nets support findings in other evolutionarily derived animals and humans18,20,21,66 and suggest that the balance between DNA damage and repair is insufficient during wakefulness, and sleep provides a consolidated period for efficient cellular maintenance in individual neurons. Across evolution, as the number of neurons and the complexity of neuronal networks increase67, sleep may have evolved to confine unsynchronized cellular maintenance, and coordinate neuronal activity and maintenance across interconnected circuits, ensuring functional stability.

Understanding which homeostatic internal and environmental factors drive sleep in basal animals could shed light on the evolutionary emergence of sleep behavior. In worms, flies, fish, and mice, sleep is necessary to recover from cellular stress, induced by factors such as ROS and UV light8,19,68,69. The symbiotic diurnal C. andromeda inhabits shallow tropical waters and are exposed to high levels of UV radiation70. In accordance, we found that UV exposure increased sleep pressure in C. andromeda. However, a similar effect was observed in the crepuscular N. vectensis, which inhabits estuarine environments with fluctuating light exposure, often burrowing in sediment during the day. Thus, we suggest that a downstream mechanism, i.e., UV-mediated DNA damage, is a homeostatic driver of sleep in cnidarians. Indeed, we showed that Etoposide, a pharmacological inducer of DNA damage, promoted sleep in N. vectensis, suggesting a positive correlation between DNA damage accumulation and sleep pressure across evolution. These findings are supported by our work in zebrafish showing that UV radiation, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nuclear proteins, and neuronal activity can induce DNA damage and promote sleep18,19. Moreover, sleep-dependent reductions in DNA damage have been reported also in flies, mice, and humans20,21,71, and melatonin improved the repair of oxidative DNA damage in night shift workers66.

Cnidarians are emerging as genetically tractable, translucent models for studying evolutionary neuroscience26,72. We showed that sleep supports neuronal recovery in cnidarians. Beyond cellular repair, neuronal health is likely tied to additional sleep functions, such as learning and memory consolidation73. Associate learning has recently been demonstrated in N. vectensis and box jellyfish72,74, and future studies in cnidarians can elucidate how sleep optimizes cellular maintenance and consolidation of memory at the level of single cell within simple nerve nets of live animals. The molecular tools developed in our work and in other cnidarian studies75 offer a unique opportunity to identify conserved sleep-associated cellular markers, which could help characterize sleep at the cellular level. Since sleep has traditionally been classified based on movement and arousal thresholds in invertebrates, uncovering molecular signatures of sleep in cnidarians may help to characterize sleep in additional basal organisms, such as coral colonies, which consist of thousands of interconnected polyps. Whether coral polyps sleep simultaneously or in a coordinated alternating manner remains unknown, but studying their nerve net dynamics could provide clues about the evolutionary origins of local sleep regulation76. Moreover, considering that the interplay between the circadian clock and genomic stability has been shown in non-neuronal mammalian cultured cells, fungi and cyanobacteria77,78,79,80, sleep-like states may have preceded the evolution of neurons, originally evolved to support synchronized and consolidated periods of cellular maintenance.

C. andromeda jellyfish were initially collected from the Gulf of Eilat and later raised and reproduced in the laboratory. The animals were reared in artificial seawater (ASW, OmegaSea, 39-40 ppt) at a 24 °C–25 °C with a pH of 8.1–8.3. A water cooler and heater were used to maintain a constant temperature. A deuterium-depleted water (DDW) compensation system was used to maintain salinity levels. Animals were raised under a 12 h day/12 h night cycle (LD) using 2400 W Metal Halogen 14,000 K light sources providing approximately 100 PPFD at the animal level, located 20 cm above the water surface. The animals were housed and monitored in a 113-liter closed water system equipped with a waste filtration system and a protein skimmer. Waste products were kept close to 0 ppm ammonia, 0 ppb phosphorus, 0 ppm nitrite, and 0 ppm nitrate. C. Andromeda were fed daily with brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii) at noon. Animals with bell diameters of 5-7.5 cm, in a relaxed state, were randomly assigned to each experimental group. The C. Andromeda genotype was validated by sequencing the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene81. Whole genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50), and DNA fragment amplification was performed using the following degenerated primers: Forward: 5'-ACNAAYCAYAAAGATATHGG-3', Reverse: 5'-TGGTGNGCYCANACNATRAANCC-3'.

N. vectensis were raised in ASW (OmegaSea, 12ppt) in a closed system at 17 °C under constant darkness and fed daily with Artemia nauplii at noon. Spawning of gametes and fertilization was performed according to established protocol82. In brief, the temperature was raised to 25 °C for 9 h, and males and females were exposed to strong white light. 3 h later, oocytes were mixed with sperm to enable fertilization. To genotype NvClkΔ mutant and WT N. vectensis, genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50). A fragment of the NvClk gene was amplified using the following primers: forward 5'-ACCCCACTGAGTGACCTCTT-3' and reverse 5'-ATACGCCTGCGCTATACACC-3'. The PCR products were then loaded on a 3% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel supplemented with GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The genotype of each animal was determined based on the size of the PCR products: NvClkΔ/Δ - 120 bp; WT - 100 bp. The gel-based genotyping was confirmed by sequencing in selected animals.

Two modular water systems (Aquazone Ltd, Israel) were designed to monitor the behavior of 9 or 16 jellyfish simultaneously while maintaining controlled light, temperature, and salinity conditions. The systems consisted of 9 or 16 clear perspex chambers of 10 x 10 x 10 cm or 7 x 7 x 10 cm for individual jellyfish, respectively (Fig. 1a). These apparatuses were kept inside a 55 x 50 x 30 cm tank, connected to a waste filtration system, a protein skimmer, a water heater, and a DDW water compensation system. C. andromeda were kept under 12 h of light (five 50 W LED lights providing 100–200 PPFD at the animal level) and 12 h of darkness (LD) and constantly illuminated with low-intensity IR LED lights. Prior to each experiment, C. andromeda were acclimated in the recording system, one individual per chamber, for 2-3 days. An IR camera (Dahua Technology, Hangzhou, China) with an IR filter was used to record mp4 videos at resolution of 1920 × 1200 and 20 frames per second (fps). The mp4 videos were converted to avi files using the FFmpeg software (FFmpeg, Irvington, NJ, USA). MATLAB Version: 9.8.0 (R2020a)83 and a lab-made script were used to determine pulsation behavior. The change in the average pixel intensity was measured for each frame, producing a pulse trace. A rectangular region of interest (ROI) was selected for each jellyfish. The smoothed average pixel intensity was calculated using a Gaussian moving window and was subtracted from the data to control for low-frequency oscillations of the data. Pulsation events were counted using the peak of the pulse trace (Fig. 1b), and the mean activity was analyzed during the first 20 min of each hour along day and night. Sleep architecture was analyzed using the full duration of the first 24 h of the video recording to ensure the continuity of the data. Jellyfish that changed their horizontal to a vertical position or anomalous animals exhibiting pulsing behavior three standard deviations below or above the mean were excluded. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) from the ‘Lomb' library84 on R85 with a p < 0.01 threshold. To assess the change in arousal threshold, the jellyfish were stimulated repeatedly every hour at night (ZT13-ZT19) using a 1 s 100–200 PPFD light pulse. A response was defined as a reduction of 2 standard deviations in the inter-pulse intervals (IPI) compared to the distribution of IPIs before the stimulation, within a time window of 10 s after the stimulus. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. 1g, j). For each candidate threshold (e.g., pulsation rate), responses were split into two groups: below and above the threshold. We then summed all Euclidean distances of these responses from the mean value of their respective groups (i.e., error value). Thus, the behavioral value that optimally divided a group of fast responses and slow responses results in the lowest error value. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated repeatedly with a gentle water pulse using thin tubes connected to a water pump and a computer clock. These 10 min pulses of water were applied every 10 min for 6 h at ZT17-ZT23. Field experiments were conducted in May in the native habitat of Cassiopea at Key Largo, FL. Light intensities ranged between 400-1500 PPFD at a depth of 0.3–1.5 m at the peak of the day, salinity was 31.5 ppt and Temperature was 26.8 °C. The pulsation rate was monitored manually by counting the number of pulses per minute every hour in 30–40 animals during the day and night (total of 662 animals). Subsequently, the diameter of the relaxed bell of each individual was measured.

Locomotor activity of individual N. vectensis was monitored using a custom-made temperature-controlled (20 °C) water system equipped with an IR camera (Dahua, Binjiang District, Hangzhou, China). Animals of similar size (1-2 cm), genetic background, and age were distributed individually into wells of four six-well plates (Fig. 2a) and were subject to alternating white light Illumination with intensity of 17 PPFD (Sylvania Lightning Solution, Wilmington, MA, USA). MATLAB script was generated based on H. vulgaris sleep tracking methodology3 to analyze the locomotor activity and sleep. We measured changes in the pixel value between two consecutive frames at 5 s intervals (Supplementary Fig. 2a-e). Noise was reduced by subtracting the minimum pixel change of the individual. To set the minimum threshold of locomotor activity, pixel changes of MgCl2-treated paralyzed animals were quantified. These changes were considered immobility. The ratio of frames with detectable movements was calculated in a 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement) and defined as quiescence if movement was not detected in more than 50% of the frames per 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement<0.5). To assess the change in arousal threshold, the polyps were stimulated with either light or food. Polyps were stimulated with three different light intensities ( + 5, +50, +500 PPFD, above the 17 PPFD baseline) during the day (ZT10) for 30 min (Supplementary Fig. 2f–k). Food stimulation was performed by application of “Reef Energy Plus” solution (Red Sea, Israel). A response-to-stimulus was defined as 30 s of continuous movement above the threshold. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. 2g, j) as is described for C. andromeda. Sleep durations were summed in hourly bins, and the average and standard errors were calculated for all tested animals. Since N. vectensis showed crepuscular behavior (i.e., active at dusk), we used a data-driven approach to define sleep (ZT18-6) and wake (ZT6-18) periods in a 12 h time window. Sleep architecture data were analyzed using continuous 60 h movies starting at ZT18. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated by gentle water exchange once per hour during their peak of sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) and peak of activity period (ZT8-ZT16; Supplementary Movie 4) and sleep was monitored before and after the SD. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using Fourier analysis-based software LSP with a p < 0.01 threshold. Open or closed posture was manually annotated from a single video frame. Animals were categorized based on the number of tentacles deployed outside of their body. Animals that showed at least two visible tentacles were classified as ‘open'.

For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. In the C. andromeda system, water circulation was terminated one hour prior to melatonin treatment due to the high volume of constant water exchange in the system. Both species were treated with either 100 μM melatonin (diluted in ethanol) or ethanol for control, at ZT3 and ZT13. These time points were selected to correspond to their respective periods of sleep (ZT3 for N. vectensis, ZT13 for C. andromeda) and wakefulness (ZT13 for N. vectensis, ZT3 for C. andromeda) for both species. In C. andromeda, behavior was recorded 30 min before and during melatonin administration. In N. vectensis, behavior was recorded 60 min before and during melatonin treatment. The delta effect (Fig. 3j–u) was calculated by subtracting the mean post-treatment values from the mean pre-treatment values of either melatonin or ethanol treatment. In DNA damage quantification assays, animals were treated with melatonin for 3 h, starting at ZT13 for N. vectensis and ZT3 for C. andromeda at their respective wake period, and were then fixed in 4% PFA. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, three independent rhopalia were dissected from each animal (total of eight animals per Ctl and Mel groups) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. A dark plastic barrier divided and isolated UV-treated animals from controls in the behavioral monitoring systems. For C. andromeda, sleep was recorded for 30 h; for N. vectensis, 42 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were exposed to 312 nm UVB (Spectroline® E-Series UV lamp, 20 cm above the animals): 15 min in C. andromeda and 1 h in N. vectensis. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, UV-treated and control C. andromeda and N. vectensis were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the UV irradiation. All UV assays were performed in two independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and the cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, 2–3 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (11 animals per time point; ZT7, ZT9, ZT7 Day3) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

N. vectensis were habituated for 72 h and entrained to LD cycle in six-well plates. Sleep was recorded during 54 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were treated with 10 μm Etoposide (E1383, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and half with control 0.01% DMSO. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, Etoposide-treated and control animals were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the treatment. Etoposide assays were performed in two independent experiments. The upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells located in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged.

In both species, animals were habituated in their video monitoring system for 72 h and entrained to an LD cycle. SD was applied as described above. To quantify DNA damage, animals were fixed in 4% PFA at each time point. All LD and SD assays were performed in three independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- animal was mounted on a slide, and neurons in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. DNA damage quantification analyses were performed in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons at ZT17, ZT8, and ZT17 Day 2. For C. andromeda, 2-4 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (8-10 animals per time point; ZT11, ZT23, and ZT11 Day 2) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located on the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- and wild type N. vectensis were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 2XPBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. The umbrella tissues of C. andromeda surrounding the rhopalium were sampled and fixed for 5 min in 2% PFA in ASW at room temperature, followed by a 6 h fixation in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. For both species, the tissues were incubated with 2 μg/mL protein kinase (PK) for 10 min, then washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum with 1% DMSO, and diluted in PBS + 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, in N. vectensis, tissues were incubated with a primary antibody: rabbit anti-γH2AX (GTX127342, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) 1:200 dilution and antiDsRED (Living Colors® mCherry Monoclonal mouse Antibody, Clontech, Cat# 632543) 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer for 72 h at 4 °C, while in C. andromeda, tissues were incubated with the rabbit anti-γH2AX 1:200 dilution. Then, for both species, samples were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min. N. vectensis were incubated for 1 h with a goat polyclonal secondary anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 646 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. C. andromeda were incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. Next, both species were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min and the slides were mounted and prepared for imaging and cellular quantification.

All imaging experiments were conducted on fixed dissected tissue mounted on slides in glycerol for both species. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 inverted and a LSM980 upright confocal/two-photon microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with ×63, 1.4 NA objective. γH2AX puncta were automatically counted using an ImageJ macro code utilizing the Analyze Particles built-in ImageJ plugin (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), within DAPI-based ROIs to focus on nuclear signal. Between 10-100 cells were analyzed in each C. andromeda rhopalia and N. vectensis. In addition to DAPI and γH2AX signal, a third channel was used to detect the fluorophore mOrange expressed in the nervous system of tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX) N. vectensis.

The catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers constitutes a recognized synthetic challenge as it is traditionally considered to arise from a non-concerted reaction pathway via formation and recombination of radical pairs. Here we show a catalytic enantioselective solution to this challenge, demonstrating that [1,2]-Wittig products are generated via an alternative reaction cascade to traditional dogma. The developed process employs a chiral bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst to promote an initial enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. A subsequent base-promoted, stereoconvergent, fragmentation–recombination process that proceeds with high enantiospecificity and retention of configuration, formally equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden thermal [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, generates [1,2]-Wittig products in up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio. Supported by extensive quantum chemistry calculations, this chirality transfer process will have broad implications for fundamental stereocontrol in organic transformations.

Sigmatropic rearrangements are useful and reliable atom-economic reactions, with their ability to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds through well-defined and predictable transition states1 making these processes attractive for the synthesis of complex targets2. Among this broad set of reaction processes, [2,3]- and [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangements are of synthetic and mechanistic significance3,4. The rearrangement of allylic ethers under basic reaction conditions typically leads to product mixtures proposed to arise from the thermally allowed concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic Wittig rearrangement, alongside a competitive non-concerted [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement generally thought to arise from homolytic fragmentation of the anionic intermediate to form a geminate radical pair and their subsequent recombination5,6 (Fig. 1a). As representative examples, both Rautenstrauch7 and Baldwin8 have shown that treatment of benzyl allyl ether 1 with nBuLi gives rise to a mixture of [2,3]- and [1,2]-products 2 and 3, respectively, with increased [1,2]-product observed at higher temperatures. Although not widely recognized, sporadic control reactions have demonstrated the feasibility of converting [2,3]-Wittig products to [1,2]-Wittig products (formally via a [1,3]-rearrangement), although the generality, mechanism and configurational consequence have not been established9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The concerted or dissociative (via ionic or radical intermediates) nature of both the [1,2]- and [1,3]-processes has been much debated. For example, Danheiser considered a concerted [1,3]-pathway to account for the inversion observed in the ring expansion of cis-cyclobutanol 416. However, Gajewski17 and Cohen18 both postulated a non-concerted fragmentation pathway via an intermediate allylic anion that accounts for the observed in situ isomerism of cis-4 to trans-6, and that use of enantiomerically pure cis-4 or trans-6 leads to racemic product 5 (Fig. 1b)19. Applying the Woodward–Hoffmann rules indicates that a concerted [1,2]-rearrangement is forbidden, while a thermal [1,3]-rearrangement is symmetry allowed but geometrically challenging, with a suprafacial carbon shift expected to proceed with inversion of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon1. Interestingly, Houk has previously shown that anionic Cope and amino-Cope reactions proceed through a stepwise dissociation–recombination process20, consistent with competitive non-concerted [1,3]-rearrangements observed in related systems21,22. Given the mechanistic ambiguity surrounding these processes the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is a recognized challenge and is currently unknown despite its synthetic potential23.

In this Article, the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is developed (up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)) and is shown to proceed through a cascade process consisting of an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement (up to >99:1 e.r.) promoted by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyst. The resultant tertiary carbinol bearing an α-branched allylic substituent is transformed to the linear [1,2]-Wittig isomeric product with retention of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon (equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement) through a dissociative intramolecular fragmentation–recombination event with high enantiospecificity (Fig. 1c). Substitution reactions that proceed with retention of configuration are rare, although recognized for alcohols via an SNi mechanism that proceeds via contact ion-paired intermediates24,25,26. Traditionally the stereospecificity of nucleophilic substitution processes leads to inversion of configuration in SN2 reaction processes at secondary centres and partial or complete racemization in SN1 processes at tertiary centres. However, recent advances have showcased stereospecific substitution at tertiary and even quaternary centres in which stereochemical information is conferred despite ionization of a substrate27,28,29,30,31,32. In this context, the high enantiospecificity of the observed chirality transfer protocol that leads to [1,2]-products with retention of configuration, while proceeding through an ionic fragmentation and recombination process, holds promise for the elucidation of alternative reaction pathways for generating chiral products with high enantioselectivity.

Building upon the observation that disubstitution at the allylic ether terminus typically leads to increased preference for [1,2]-rearrangement products14, the use of BIMPs as organocatalysts to promote the enantioselective [1,2]-rearrangement process was considered. Originally developed by Dixon, BIMPs have shown widespread use in a plethora of stereoselective transformations33, possessing a Brønsted superbasic iminophosphorane with a hydrogen-bond donor to assert stereocontrol. Rearrangement of an allylic ether upon an oxindole skeleton was chosen, given the prevalence of this motif in natural products and bioactive molecules, as well as expected acidity. Following initial screening of the effect of N-substituent (N-Me, N-Bn, N-trityl), BIMP catalyst, solvent and temperature variation (see Supplementary Information Section 2) using N-trityl-substituted allylic ether 8 and tBu-BIMP catalyst 7 showed that rearrangement to 9 in mesitylene led to selective formation of the [1,2]-product in excellent yield and promising enantioselectivity after 24 h (Fig. 2a; 92:8 e.r.). As [1,2]-Wittig products are traditionally expected to be generated via a radical recombination mechanism, the effect of adding 20 mol% of 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxopiperidinium (4-NHAc-TEMPO) as an additive was probed. Formation of the [1,2]-product was not significantly inhibited, giving 9 in 73% yield and improved 95:5 e.r., with no 4-NHAc-TEMPO adducts observed34. The mass balance consisted of the aldol side product 10 (>95:5 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.), 75:25 e.r.) that was isolated in 5% yield; addition of 1.0 equivalent of 4-NHAc-TEMPO was also tested, affording 9 in a further reduced 59% yield but enhanced 97:3 e.r. Control experiments indicated that taking a 1:1 mixture of allylic ether 8 and N-tritylisatin with tBu-BIMP 7 gave aldol product 10 in 71% yield (>95:5 d.r., 75:25 e.r.), consistent with in situ formation of N-tritylisatin derivative in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO. Further experiments showed that addition of 1.0 equivalent of TEMPO led to 9 in 57% isolated yield (97:3 e.r.) with 10% of TEMPO-allyl adduct (T-a) isolated as well as 11% N-tritylisatin. Intrigued by these observations, in situ temporal reaction analysis monitored consumption of allylic ether 11 (40 mm) upon treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 (20 mol%) to give [1,2]-Wittig product 13 in d8-toluene using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.1). The rearrangement showed a first-order consumption in substrate 11 (which was racemic throughout the reaction process), with a transient mixture of diastereoisomeric [2,3]-rearrangement products 12 detected (δH = 5.15 and 4.87 ppm) that accumulated to a maximum concentration of ≈15 mm and was subsequently transformed into the [1,2]-rearrangement product 13, consistent with 12 being an intermediate in the generation of 13. On a synthetic scale, stopping the reaction of allylic ether 8 after 1 h gave, at 75% conversion, a 63:37 mixture of [2,3]-product 14 and [1,2]-product 9 (96:4 e.r.). Purification gave 14 (89:11 d.r., both diastereoisomers 99:1 e.r.) in 21% yield whose absolute configuration was determined by N-trityl deprotection and subsequent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Information Section 6). The absolute configuration within 9 was confirmed by chemical synthesis (Supplementary Information Section 8.8), indicating stereoconvergence and retention of configuration at C(3) in the rearrangement of diastereoisomers 14 to 9. Separate control experiments validated the [2,3]-rearrangement products 14 as intermediates to the [1,2]-product 9 (Fig. 2c). Treating 14 (89:11 d.r.) with tBu-BIMP 7 and 4-NHAc-TEMPO for 5 h gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 60% yield (99:1 e.r.) alongside 10% of N-tritylisatin, while treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 and TEMPO gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 43% yield (97:3 e.r.) alongside 12% of TEMPO-adduct (T-a) and 15% of N-tritylisatin. Treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 alone gave 9 in 83% yield (96:4 e.r.) with 12% of N-tritylisatin observed, while the use of achiral base 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) on 14 also promoted rearrangement, but to moderate 50% conversion, giving 9 in 36% yield but with high enantioselectivity (96:4 e.r.). This is consistent with DBU or tBu-BIMP 7 acting as a base and not notably influencing enantiospecificity in this [1,3]-rearrangement process. Consistent with this observation, monitoring the conversion of 14 (89:11 d.r.) to 9 upon treatment with racemic or enantiopure BIMP derivatives did not lead to significant rate differences (Supplementary Information Section 5.2) implying no matched and mismatched reactant combinations. Taken together these experiments are consistent with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO leading to enhanced enantiospecificity in the base-promoted stereoconvergent [1,3]-rearrangement. This is consistent with selective fragment trapping within this process leading to enhanced selectivity, with the origin of this phenomenon discussed in ‘Mechanistic analysis'. The [2,3]-product 14 could also be transformed into the [1,2]-Wittig product 9 when heated at 100 °C without the addition of base, albeit with reduced yield (31%) and enantioselectivity (92:8 e.r.). Crossover experiments (Fig. 2d) using a 50:50 mixture of ethers 15 and 16 either with tBu-BIMP 7 alone (conditions a), or with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO (conditions b), resulted in only [1,2]-products 17 and 18, consistent with an intramolecular process in operation, with enhanced product enantioselectivity again observed in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO.

Having identified a viable reaction pathway, the scope of the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig cascade was examined (Table 1). Changing the C(3′)-alkyl substituent from methyl to ethyl was tolerated, giving 19, while using a C(3′)-cyclopropyl-substituted allylic ether as a radical probe generated only [1,2]-rearrangement product 20 (40% yield, 96:4 e.r.) with the cyclopropyl ring intact. Although indicative, the absence of ring-opened products does not exclude a radical mechanism since in-cage carbon–carbon radical recombination (rate constant typically estimated to be >1011 s−1) is considered much faster than ring opening of a cyclopropyl methyl radical (k = 1.3 × 108 s−1)35. Increasing the steric hindrance through incorporation of a C(3′)-phenyl substituent resulted in moderate conversion (Supplementary Information Section 4). This necessitated changing the N-trityl substituent to an N-benzyl for increased reactivity, giving 21 in 61% yield but reduced product enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r.), consistent with screening studies that necessitated N-trityl substitution for optimal enantioselectivity (Supplementary Information Section 2). A limitation of this process showed that both a (Z)-configured allylic ether and a dimethyl terminal allylic ether returned only starting material under the reaction conditions. Variation of the C(3′)-aryl substituent showed that the incorporation of halogens (4-F, 4-Cl and 4-Br), electron-withdrawing (4-CF3) as well as electron-donating (4-Ph, 4-Me, 4-MeO) substituents were tolerated, giving the [1,2]-rearrangement products 13, 18, 22–26 in high yields and enantioselectivity. The incorporation of 3-Me and 2-Me substituents (27, 28) was also tolerated, although with lower yields for the 2-Me-substituted example. In addition, 2-naphthyl-, thien-2-yl- and thiazol-2-yl-substituted ethers all afforded the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products 29–31 in 71% to 82% yields with 93:7 to 94:6 e.r. Substituent variation within the 4-, 5- and 6-positions of the oxindole included the incorporation of halogen (5-F, 5-Cl, 5-I, 6-Br, 6-Cl), electron-withdrawing (5-O2N) and electron-donating (5-Me, 5-MeO) substituents that gave the corresponding products 17, 32–39 in 67% to 80% yield and up to 96:4 e.r. While N-tritylation of 7-chloroisatin was unsuccessful, the N-benzyl analogue was prepared and tested, giving 40 in 81% yield but reduced enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r.).

To further probe the generality of this transformation, the effect of incorporating C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substituents within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. 3a). In contrast to the parent C(3′)-methyl series, treatment of 41 and 43 with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature gave exclusively the corresponding [2,3]-rearrangement products 42 (91:9 d.r., 98:2 e.r.) and 44 (72:28 d.r., 98:2 e.r.) with no formation of the [1,2]-product. To convert these enantioenriched [2,3]-products to the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products increased reaction temperatures (≥100 °C for 42 and 44) and the addition of stoichiometric DBU (1 equiv.) was required. For example, stereoconvergence of the separable diastereoisomers (3S,1′S)- and (3S,1′R)-44 upon treatment with DBU in mesitylene at 120 °C was observed, with both giving (E,S)-[1,2]-Wittig product 45 in 94:6 and 93:7 e.r., respectively. Solvent polarity has a substantial effect upon the enantiospecificity of the [1,3]-rearrangement at these increased reaction temperatures (Supplementary Information Section 3) with highest product enantioselectivity observed in solvents of low polarity (toluene and mesitylene) rather than polar solvents (DMF or MeCN). Rearrangement with retention of configuration is still observed, although addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO does not lead to increased product e.r. in this series (Supplementary Information Section 3). Having demonstrated that high temperatures are required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement of the initially formed [2,3]-products, a telescoped process to allow one-pot access to [1,2]-Wittig products was developed that utilized toluene as a solvent (Fig. 3b). Treatment of a range of allylic ethers with tBu-BIMP 7 promoted enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, which was followed by the addition of DBU (1 equiv.) and heating to between 60 °C and 100 °C. Following this procedure, in the C(3′)-F series, inclusion of Ph-, 4-MeC6H4-, 4-MeOC6H4- and 4-F3CC6H4-substituted allylic ethers, as well as 4-Cl, 5-F, 5-NO2, 5-MeO and 6-Cl substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, giving the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products (46–54) with good to excellent enantioselectivity (91:9 to 97:3 e.r.). In the C(3′)-H series, variation of the aryl substituent within the allylic ether showed that Ph-, 4-MeOC6H4, 4-F3CC6H4, 4-FC6H4, 2-MeOC6H4, 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl substitution, heteroaromatic 3-thienyl and C(2′)-methyl substitution, alongside 4-Cl, 5-OMe and 6-Br substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, allowing the formation of enantioenriched [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement products 45, 55–65 (87:13 to 95:5 e.r.). Notably, lower product yields (41% to 73%) were observed in this one-pot process than noted in Fig. 3, reflecting the propensity for competitive decomposition at the elevated reaction temperatures required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement.

Having demonstrated the scope of this transformation, consideration to the mechanism of this cascade was given. Initial association of tBu-BIMP 7 to substrate I by hydrogen bonding is assumed to direct deprotonation of the allylic ether–BIMP complex II to give III, with subsequent concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement giving IV with high stereoselectivity (Fig. 4a). Protonation and catalyst release gives isolable V. A subsequent base-promoted (tBu-BIMP or DBU), anion-accelerated [1,3]-rearrangement from IV36, which proceeds with retention of configuration at the carbinol centre, generates [1,2]-Wittig product VI. Computational methods were used to gain mechanistic insight into the [2,3]- and [1,3]-rearrangement processes. Eight binding modes between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate were considered (Supplementary Fig. 19) and conformationally searched using CREST (GFN2-xTB; Ar = Ph, X = Me)37,38,39. The lowest energy conformer from each search was then optimized in Gaussian 1640 using ONIOM41,42 to reduce the computational complexity for this large system. The peripheral components of both catalyst and substrate were treated with semi-empirical quantum mechanics and placed in the low layer, while the atoms involved in bond breaking and forming were treated with density functional theory (DFT). Full DFT single point energies were performed on all stationary points (Supplementary Information Section 7). These calculations were conducted on substrate 8 (Ar = Ph, X = Me; Fig. 4a) in the presence of catalyst 7 unless otherwise stated (Fig. 2c). Previous studies have shown that there is good agreement between ONIOM and full DFT calculations for other organocatalytic systems43,44,45,46,47,48,49.

To study the origins of stereoselectivity, transition states (TSs) leading to each of the four possible stereoisomers for the BIMP-catalysed [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement were located (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Consistent with experimental results (Fig. 2c), the calculated lowest energy exo-TS forms the (S,S)-stereoisomer, with the difference in free energy between this and the lowest energy exo-(R,R)-TS (1.57 kcal mol−1; Fig. 4b) resulting in a computed e.r. of 93:750. The diastereomeric ratio computed from the exo-(S,S)- and endo-(S,R)-TS III energies (ΔΔG‡ = 1.16 kcal mol−1) is 86:14. These ratios are consistent with the experimentally observed levels of stereoselectivity in the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. To gain insight into the origins of enantioselectivity, the structures of exo-(S,S)- and exo-(R,R)-TS III were compared, revealing key differences in hydrogen bonding capability between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate. In exo-(S,S)-TS III, three stabilizing NH···O hydrogen bonds from the catalyst to the substrate oxygen atoms are observed, while in exo-(R,R)-TS III, only two NH···O hydrogen bonds are seen alongside an unusual, longer and weaker NH···C interaction with a reacting carbon atom (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 21). The origins of diastereoselectivity can be understood by comparison of exo-(S,S)-TS III and endo-(S,R)-TS III. A shorter distance between the centroids of the allylic aryl substituent and an N-trityl Ph substituent in exo-(S,S)-TS III (4.74 Å) relative to endo-(S,R)-TS III (5.12 Å) is observed, suggesting a more favourable T-shaped π-stacking interaction, leading to the preference for the (S,S)-stereoisomer51 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 22).

Computational analysis subsequently studied the feasibility of a concerted rearrangement or a stepwise fragmentation followed by a recombination process (Fig. 4a) for the onwards reaction of (S,S)-IV (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Although examples of [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements are reported52,53,54,55,56,57,58, despite extensive efforts it was not possible to locate concerted TSs for this [1,3]-rearrangement process, even with constraints between the bond-forming and bond-breaking atoms; some unconstrained attempts resulted in geometries that resembled TS IV (fragmentation). Optimization of fragmentation TSs was possible but attempts to locate a TS that connects the fragment complex and the recombination product were all unsuccessful. An energy scan starting from the recombination product up to a fragment complex (Supplementary Fig. 23) showed no peak in the potential energy surface between 1.6 and 3.5 Å, which suggests that VI forms via a near-barrierless recombination event. Reoptimization of the lowest energy (S,S)-TS IV conformer with unrestricted methods showed no appreciable spin density on any atom, which is consistent with an ionic rather than a homolytic fragmentation.

The lowest energy conformer of (S,S)-IV and (S,S)-TS IV were then reoptimized with Ar = 4-FC6H4, X = Me such that the calculated reaction barrier could be directly compared to that derived from in situ reaction monitoring (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4 and 7.3). The intrinsic reaction coordinate data for the reoptimized 4-FC6H4 TS ((S,S)-TS IVF) is shown in Fig. 4c (for optimized structures of (S,S)-IVF, (S,S)-TS IVF and fragment complex see Supplementary Fig. 24). The computed barrier for the fragmentation step of this [1,3]-rearrangement (ΔG‡comp = 20.97 kcal mol−1) closely matches that derived from kinetic fitting of the reaction profile generated via in situ monitoring of 11→12→13 (ΔG‡exp = 21.90 kcal mol−1; see Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4).

To experimentally probe the validity of this proposed fragmentation–recombination pathway, taking isolated racemic [2,3]-rearrangement products that differed in the electronic effect of C(1′)-aryl substituents with tBu-BIMP 7 showed that inclusion of electron-withdrawing substituents led to enhanced reaction rates. Hammett analysis (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Information Section 5.2) revealed a ρ value of +0.76 when plotted against the substituent constant σ−. Although small, this ρ value is consistent with the build-up of partial negative charge within the rate-limiting TS of the reaction and the proposed anionic fragmentation. Notably, no significant difference in reaction rate was observed when using BIMP catalysts with either racemic or enantioenriched [2,3]-rearrangement products (Supplementary Information Section 5.3). Building on this observation, the effect of incorporating an electron-withdrawing ester substituent at C(3′) within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Information Section 3). Treatment of 66 (R1 = Me) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature promoted initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, leading to [1,2]-product 67 in 55% yield (98:2 e.r.) alongside aldol product 68 (15%, 75:25 d.r., 88:12 e.r.) and N-tritylisatin (7%). Notably, treatment of 69 (R1 = H) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature for 1 h, followed by warming at 40 °C for 2 h led to facile fragmentation, giving [1,2]-product 70 in 48% yield (95:5 e.r.) in conjunction with ethyl crotonate (22% yield) and N-tritylisatin (26%). The generation of ethyl crotonate 71 and N-tritylisatin is consistent with the ester substituent facilitating anionic fragmentation from an initially formed [2,3]-product, with protonation and isomerization giving 71. Building on these observations, the observed [1,3]-rearrangement with retention of configuration and high enantiospecificity is consistent with anionic fragmentation from an alkoxide·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ complex generating an intimate ion pair consisting of an allylic anion and N-tritylisatin·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ (Fig. 4c). Recombination at the terminal allylic position upon the Re-face of the isatin occurs at a faster rate than ion pair dissociation, or conformational change and bond rotation, to allow Si-face addition of the isatin that would lead to reduced product enantioselectivity. Given this anionic fragmentation–recombination mechanism the observation of improved product enantioselectivity on addition of TEMPO derivatives (Fig. 2a) is ascribed to initial single-electron transfer oxidation of an anionic carbanion intermediate by TEMPO as it dissociates from the intimate ion pair, followed by trapping with a second equivalent of TEMPO, consistent with observations by Studer and co-workers alongside others59,60,61,62. Alternative mechanisms involving radical fragmentation and subsequent recombination, or anionic fragmentation and protonation, followed by C-H abstraction by TEMPO and subsequent radical recombination were ruled out (Supplementary Information Section 3).

To conclude, a cascade process that allows the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers has been developed, providing enantioenriched homoallylic tertiary alcohols with high enantioselectivity. Contrary to existing dogma, mechanistic studies and quantum chemistry calculations strongly support a cascade mechanism for this process that involves an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement of the allylic ether catalysed by a chiral tBu-BIMP catalyst. This is followed by a base-promoted anionic fragmentation–recombination pathway (base, tBu-BIMP or DBU) that proceeds with high levels of enantiospecificity even at elevated reaction temperatures. Substitution of the allylic fragment markedly affects the effectiveness of the fragmentation–recombination pathway, with anion-stabilizing ester substituents facilitating fragmentation, and with C(3′)-alkyl substitution leading to enhanced rates of [1,2]-product formation over C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substitution. Given the importance of understanding fundamental reaction processes that lead to stereochemical control, the enantiospecificity observed in this non-concerted pathway will have broader implications for a plethora of other related synthetic transformations.

Typical procedures for the [1,2]-rearrangement cascade at room temperature and upon heating are exemplified below.

The allylic ether substrate 8 (52.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), tBu-BIMP 7 (14.7 mg, 0.02 mmol) and 4-NHAc-TEMPO (4.3 mg, 0.02 mmol) were added to a flame-dried Schlenk tube and the tube was flushed with N2 three times. Mesitylene (2 ml, 0.05 M) was added through the septum under a positive pressure of N2. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h until completion as indicated by thin-layer chromatography analysis. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product, which was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent hexane:EtOAc = 4:1→3:1) to afford 9 (38.0 mg, 73%) as a colourless amorphous solid. The e.r. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALCEL OD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 7.0 min, retention time (major) =8.7 min; 5:95 e.r.).

The allylic ether substrate 43 (101.5 mg, 1.0 equiv.) and tBu-BIMP 7 (14.8 mg, 10 mol%) were added to a vial before the addition of toluene (4 ml, 0.05 M). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, then DBU (28 μl, 1.0 equiv.) was added, and the mixture was then heated to 100 °C and stirred for 16 h, then quenched by addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl and diluted with EtOAc. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent 80:20→75:25 petrol:EtOAc) to afford 45 (58 mg, 57%) as a yellow amorphous solid. The e.r. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALPAK AD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 12.5 min, retention time (major) =14.6 min; 5:95 e.r.).

Assessing drug–target engagement in living cells is essential for verifying the activity of pharmacological agents. Traditional binding assays often overlook key factors such as permeability, intracellular distribution and complex formation that influence target occupancy in cells. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based probes enable direct, quantitative assessment of small-molecule binding to proteins in live, intact cells. BRET provides sensitive detection of target engagement across a wide range of target classes, including less-tractable proteins in membrane compartments. Compared to other existing methods, BRET offers quantification of drug occupancy at steady state and open system regimens. Recent innovations in this platform have expanded its utility beyond occupancy confirmation to include applications in polypharmacology and mechanism-of-action studies. Here, we provide an updated perspective on BRET target engagement assays as versatile tools for chemical biology and early-stage drug discovery.

Insufficient functional T cell persistence impedes therapeutic success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies. Here we performed a CAR-adapted base-editing screen of PIK3CD, a key regulator of T cell function, metabolism and fate. We identified point mutations that beneficially modulate CAR T cell profiles in 4-1BBz and 28z CAR T cells, respectively. We found that point mutations with differing effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) signaling activity were advantageous in distinct CAR contexts: The PI3Kδ-activating substitution E81K enhanced proliferation, metabolic fitness and effector function of 4-1BBz CARs, promoting long-term functional persistence and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, the PI3Kδ-attenuating substitution L32P improved T cell memory formation and functionality of 28z CAR T cells. Together, our approach of rational optimization of activation-dependent signaling through targeted allelic reprogramming (ROADSTAR) illustrates the importance of CAR design-specific fine-tuning of intrinsic T cell signaling and demonstrates the potential of base editing for next-generation cellular therapies.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are an effective treatment option against refractory or relapsed B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma1,2,3,4. US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR designs incorporate CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory molecules fused to the intracellular CD3z chain (‘28z' or ‘BBz') to reprogram T cell metabolism, function and phenotypic properties2,5. Despite high initial response rates in persons with hematological malignancies, CAR-mediated therapeutic efficacy is insufficient in a substantial number of persons and response rates against solid tumors are poor6,7,8,9,10.

Inherent T cell characteristics critically determine the therapeutic potency and clinical responses of CAR therapies11,12,13. In line with the pivotal role of signaling strength in T cell biology, the signaling domains incorporated in the CAR design thereby critically affect the characteristics and function of the cell product14,15,16,17,18. Furthermore, introduction of single-nucleotide mutations in the genome by CRISPR base editing can positively and negatively tune effector T cell responses19,20,21. To enable potent CAR T cell efficacy in vivo, we hypothesized that it may be crucial to modulate T cell activity in consideration of the unique signaling activities imparted by the CAR itself. Prototypic 28z-based CARs are associated with high effector function and a more rapid T cell expansion relative to BBz-based CARs but are more prone to T cell exhaustion and demonstrate reduced persistence in vivo2,22. These differences have been linked to the engagement of noncanonical NF-κB that promotes oxidative phosphorylation and improved memory formation in BBz CAR T cells and the PI3K–AKT pathway that fosters aerobic glycolysis and differentiation into an effector phenotype in the context of 28z CARs5,23.

Recent bioengineering strategies have leveraged T cell signaling modulation to advance CAR therapies. We and others have focused on the attenuation of CAR-mediated signaling strength to prevent early differentiation and exhaustion in 28z CAR T cells17,24. Conversely, approaches to augment signaling strength to boost T cell activation have been beneficial for BBz-based CAR T cells15,25. Other approaches involve the overexpression of complementary DNA (cDNA) or gene disruption to transcriptionally, epigenetically and/or metabolically rewire CAR T cell profiles25,26,27,28. However, these methods do not allow precisely calibrating the activation of downstream genes and pathways and uncoupling signaling from endogenous positive and negative feedback regulation.

We hypothesized that precision T cell engineering by rational optimization of activation-dependent signaling through targeted allelic reprogramming (ROADSTAR) would result in enhanced and optimized CAR T cell therapies.

Herein, we performed a CRISPR base-editing screen in the p110δ adaptor-binding domain (ABD) of PIK3CD (NCBI gene ID 5293) to identify point mutations resulting in functional improvement of prototypic 1928z and 19BBz CAR T cells. We identified specific mutations in this regulatory domain of p110δ that were enriched under repetitive antigen stimulation in either CAR design. Base-editing hits were associated with contrasting effects on PI3K–AKT signaling strength in 28z relative to BBz CAR T cells, thereby conferring favorable attributes to each CAR product while preserving their ascribed beneficial properties. The PI3Kδ-activating substitution E81K resulted in long-term functional persistence of BBz CAR T cells without evidence of malignant transformation and was associated with superior tumor control of hematological and solid tumors in vivo. Conversely, the substitution L32P attenuated PI3Kδ signaling and altered 28z CAR T cell properties toward favorable memory features, leading to enhanced survival in a metastatic neuroblastoma model in vivo. Together, these data nominate the induction of targeted point mutations in CAR T cells as an effective way to endogenously fine-tune signaling strength for enhanced long-term antitumor activity in vivo and underscore the importance of CAR-adapted precision engineering to unleash the full potential of CAR therapies.

Costimulation provided by CD28 activates PI3K–AKT signaling and drives effector functions in T cells, whereas 4-1BB-mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling promotes T cell survival (Fig. 1a)29,30,31. Cognizant of the key role of PI3K–AKT signaling in shaping (CAR) T cell fate and metabolism32,33, we sought to explore whether alteration of PI3K signaling strength could provide therapeutic benefit for CAR T cells. Phosphorylated (p)AKT (at residue S473) levels revealed marked differences in signaling strength upon antigen stimulation between 28z and BBz CAR T cells, with high pathway activity in 28z and moderate pAKT levels in BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 1b). In lymphocytes, PI3K signaling strength is mainly regulated by PI3Kδ, which is composed of the catalytic subunit p110δ (encoded by the gene PIK3CD) and the regulatory subunit p85 (encoded by the gene PIK3R1)34. We hypothesized that incorporation of single-point mutations in the ABD of PIK3CD—the domain that regulates the interaction of the catalytic subunit p110δ with the regulatory subunit p85—can be leveraged to calibrate PI3K–AKT signaling activity in CAR T cells.

We first established conditions to efficiently induce point mutations in primary human CAR T cells using the cytosine base editor (CBE; AncBE4max)35 and adenine base editor (ABE; ABEmax)35. The simultaneous delivery of CBE mRNA with a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the T cell receptor β chain (TRBC1 and TRBC2) by inducing a premature stop codon resulted in an effective disruption of the endogenous TRBC locus in CAR T cells. This led to a loss of cell-surface CD3 expression, enabling a fast and facile flow-cytometry-based readout that served as a reference for assessing editing efficiencies (Fig. 1c)36. This method yielded editing efficiencies of up to 75% and established a reliable basis for the implementation of our ROADSTAR platform (Fig. 1d), integrating a pooled base-editing screen to systematically evaluate the role of induced point mutations in the ABD of PIK3CD within CAR T cells.

We designed an sgRNA library of n = 34 sgRNAs predicted to induce a single-amino-acid change in the ABD of PIK3CD (https://bedict.forone.red/#/per-base) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and included different control sgRNAs to guide cutoff values for determining hits and to calibrate results of the screen. An RASA2-targeting sgRNA served as a positive control given its role as a signaling checkpoint whose ablation enhances 1928z CAR T cell activity37,38. In addition, two sgRNAs predicted to result in a functional loss of CD19, which is absent in T cells, served as ‘neutral' controls. To restrict gene editing to CAR-positive cells in the screening setup, we generated a combined CD19-specific CAR sgRNA γ-retroviral vector (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and confirmed efficient editing in this system after transfection of the cells with the respective base editor mRNA by assessing TRBC knockout (KO) efficiencies in primary CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, we transduced T cells of two individual healthy donors with the sgRNA library containing 1928z or 19BBz CAR constructs followed by electroporation with the respective base editor mRNA (Fig. 1d). Base-edited 1928z and 19BBz CAR T cell pools were evaluated in an in vitro CAR T cell ‘stress test' with repetitive exposure to CD19-expressing Nalm6 leukemia cells (Fig. 1d). Abundance of each point mutation was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) before exposure of CAR T cells to the target cells and after repeated tumor stimulations, allowing us to determine individual edits that provide a functional advantage to CAR T cells through proliferative competition under antigen stimulation (Fig. 1d). As expected, the abundance of point mutations resulting in CD19 KO did not significantly change during the 3-week coculture assay and the point mutation conferring a loss of RASA2 was enriched in the context of 1928z CAR T cells. Importantly, results were consistent across both donors, confirming the robustness of our screening approach (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e).

In 19BBz CAR T cells, an E81K mutant showed the highest enrichment over the 3-week assay (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1d,f). In 1928z CAR T cells, an L32P mutant was most strongly enriched after repetitive tumor stimulations (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1e,g). Interestingly, the most highly enriched substitution within each CAR setting showed the strongest differential enrichment when comparing 1928z and 19BBz CARs (Fig. 1g), underscoring the difference in underlying signaling patterns afforded by the relevant costimulatory domains.

To predict potential functional consequences of the identified substitutions, we used the published crystal structure of PI3Kδ and overlaid the wild-type (WT) amino acid sequence with the respective virtually mutated sequences (Fig. 1h). The biochemical properties suggest that the insertion of the structural rigid proline instead of leucine might result in conformational changes that potentially affect the interaction site of the catalytic and the regulatory subunit of PI3Kδ located next to the substitution position 32 (Fig. 1h). The E81K substitution results in a charge reversal as glutamate is replaced by lysine. The proximity to other positively charged residues in the linker region next to E81 potentially results in notable structural changes, suggesting relevant effects on the interaction of p110δ with p85 and, subsequently, on the levels of PI3Kδ activity (Fig. 1h).

To evaluate the effect of the most enriched base edits on CAR T cell biology, we first confirmed successful editing induced by coelectroporation of T cells with base editor mRNA and the respective synthetic sgRNA followed by retroviral CAR transduction. This approach yielded high editing efficiencies, typically exceeding 50% for the E81K substitution in 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Editing efficiencies for the L32P substitution in 1928z CAR T cells were typically around 30% and single-cell analysis revealed a mixture of clones harboring either monoallelic or biallelic edits (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Importantly, haplotype analysis did not reveal consistent enrichment of additional mutations co-occurring with the respective top hits E81K or L32P across donors, supporting on-target specificity and functional relevance of the identified top hits (Extended Data Fig. 1f–i).

To evaluate the effects of the L32P and E81K substitutions on PI3K–AKT signaling activity, we assessed the levels of pAKT (at residue T308) in edited CAR T cells upon antigen encounter. Induction of the E81K substitution resulted in a notable increase in pAKT in 19BBz CAR T cells but not to the extent of 1928z CAR T cells (Fig. 1i,j). Conversely, the L32P point mutant dampened the signaling response in 1928z CAR T cells as indicated by reduced pAKT levels (Fig. 1i,j).

Given the intermediate activation of the PI3K pathway in E81K-edited 19BBz CARs as compared to control 19BBz and 1928z CAR T cells, we examined effects on downstream signaling. Primary E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells showed increased phosphorylation of PI3K–AKT effectors relative to controls without reaching the levels achieved in 1928z CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). These results were independently validated in CAR T cells generated from a SUP-T1 single-cell clone engineered to carry a homozygous E81K substitution and from patient-derived T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Notably, increased pAKT induced by E81K was only detected upon antigen exposure of CAR T cells while basal pAKT activity remained similar to controls (Extended Data Fig. 2e), indicating that the E81K edit enhances signaling capacities only upon antigen stimulation. Other key signaling pathways in T cell activation such as the MAPK–ERK pathway remained unaffected by the E81K edit (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

Consistent with these findings, the E81K substitution resulted in an increased fraction of CD69+ BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 2a) and in enhanced differentiation to an effector memory T cell state (Fig. 2b). These changes were associated with a considerably increased antigen-dependent proliferation capacity and a significantly enhanced cytolytic activity of E81K-edited relative to control 19BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Transcriptional profiles confirmed upregulation of key genes related to cytokine production, effector function, proliferation and cell cycle in E81K-edited compared to mock BBz CAR T cells and indicated enhanced metabolic fitness induced by the E81K substitution (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Furthermore, the greater signaling response of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells was associated with improved sensitivity to low antigen levels, resulting in superior proliferation and killing in antigen-low tumor settings (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k), a known limitation of prototypic 19BBz CARs25,39.

Data are representative of n = 2 biologically independent donors.

To expand the applicability of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells, we assessed their antitumor activity across multiple disease models. The E81K substitution enhanced BBz CAR functionality against a broad range of targets and malignancies, including hematological and solid tumors. This benefit was observed in CAR T cells generated from both healthy donors and heavily pretreated patients with cancer, underscoring the translational potential of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a–h).

The improved functionality of BBz-based CAR T cells relied on the endogenous modulation of PI3K signaling as exogenous cDNA-mediated overexpression of p110δ impaired antitumor activity of 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3i), highlighting the importance of precisely balancing PI3K signaling in CAR T cells.

To further delineate CAR T cell effector function at the single-cell level, we performed live-cell imaging of E81K-edited or control L1CAM-BBz CAR T cells in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel cocultures with endogenously L1CAM-expressing Sh-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells (Extended Data Fig. 3j). E81K-edited CAR T cells required fewer and shorter interactions with target cells to induce apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l), resulting in substantially higher and faster induction of target cell apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 3m). Additionally, long-term time-lapse microscopy revealed an improved migratory phenotype of base-edited CAR T cells demonstrating increased speed (Extended Data Fig. 3n). Altogether, these studies indicate that E81K-edited CAR T cells are more efficient in tumor cell killing, reinforcing their overall increased functionality and resulting in improved tumor control relative to nonedited CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3o,p).

To test whether these enhanced phenotypic and functional properties of E81K-edited CAR T cells translate into superior tumor control in vivo, we turned to the well-established preclinical Nalm6 leukemia mouse model (Fig. 2d). To prevent graft-versus-host disease and enable long-term monitoring of mice, we additionally applied base editing to induce TRBC KO in E81K-edited and mock CAR T cells. E81K-edited 19BBz CAR T cells elicited enhanced tumor control compared to control CAR T cells and could induce long-term remissions in mice, resulting in significantly improved survival (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Given recent concerns of toxicity or malignant transformation40, we performed in-depth safety analyses of E81K-edited CAR T cells. Long-term culture of E81K-modified 19BBz CARs without or with cytokine support did not show aberrant cell growth in the absence of antigen stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Likewise, mice treated with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells exhibited no signs of morbidity or changes in weight in long-term follow up studies (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Furthermore, necropsies of treated mice 66 days after CAR T cell infusion did not identify aberrant T cell numbers, infiltration or morphology and verified intact organ structures and cellular architectures (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Flow cytometric analyses confirmed similar T cell numbers between E81K-modified and control CAR T cells across different tissues including liver, lung, kidney and brain (Extended Data Fig. 4e) and liver enzymes remained unaffected in mice treated with E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). Lastly, serum cytokine measurements did not indicate any cytokine release syndrome-associated signatures induced by E81K-edited CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Taken together, there were no signs of lymphomagenesis or increased side effects associated with the improved functional persistence of E81K-modified CAR T cells.

We next assessed CAR T cell attributes 16 days after CAR injection into Nalm6-bearing mice. Mice injected with E81K-mutant CAR T cells displayed significantly higher CAR T cell numbers in peripheral blood and spleen and a similar albeit nonsignificant trend in bone marrow (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). E81K-modified CAR T cells showed low coexpression of canonical exhaustion-associated markers PD1, LAG3 and TIM3 in vivo (Fig. 2h,i) and a similar percentage of senescence-associated CD57+ T cells relative to control 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d), indicating that E81K does not promote T cell dysfunction in BBz CAR T cells.

Corroborating our in vitro findings from CAR T cells of healthy donors and of patients with cancer (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5e), the E81K substitution favored an increased presence of effector memory T cells in both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cell subsets in vivo (Fig. 2j). To assess the role of the induced effector memory population regarding the proliferative capacity of PI3K altered or WT CAR T cell subtypes, we sorted naive, central memory, effector memory and effector T cells using flow cytometry and subjected E81K-edited and control 19BBz CAR T cells generated from each subset to repetitive antigen stimulation with Nalm6 cells. We found that E81K-mutant effector memory CAR T cells outperformed all other T cell subsets and each subset of unmodified 19BBz CARs, validating their superior antigen-dependent expansion potential (Fig. 2k).

To assess the long-term functionality of E81K-modified BBz CAR T cells, we performed repetitive stimulations with hematological or solid tumors and found that E81K-mutant CAR T cells retained their robust cytotoxic advantage and sustained higher levels of effector cytokine responses even after several rounds of tumor exposure (Extended Data Figs. 5f–k and 6a–c). Consistent with the sustained functionality, E81K-edited CAR T cells derived from healthy donors or patients with cancer exhibited no increased expression of exhaustion or senescence markers after repetitive antigen stimulations (Extended Data Figs. 6d–f). Profiling of transcriptional changes confirmed the heightened effector state of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5k) and indicated reduced T cell dysfunction mediated by the transcription factor FOXO3 (ref. 41) (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), a main driver of 4-1BB-based CAR T cell impairment42.

To delineate whether in vivo persisting E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells maintain effective antitumor responses, we isolated CAR T cells from the spleen of treated mice and reexposed them to Nalm6 cells ex vivo. Strikingly, the retrieved E81K-mutant 19BBz CAR T cells outperformed control CAR T cells in their cytolytic capacities (Extended Data Fig. 6i). The observations of increased antitumor activity of persisting E81K-modified CAR T cells were concordant with enhanced IFNγ levels in the blood of mice 16–18 days after treatment with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6j).

To confirm the improved functional persistence of E81K-edited CAR T cells, we used a model of tumor relapse after initial response, which remains a major challenge in CAR T cell therapy43. To mimic this clinical scenario, we selected a setting in which both E81K-edited and control 19BBz CAR T cells induced full remission after initial CAR T cell infusion and rechallenged the mice with three consecutive rounds of Nalm6 injections at late time points (days 88, 103 and 117 after initial Nalm6 injection) (Fig. 3a). While all mice harboring control CAR T cells developed tumor relapses shortly after Nalm6 rechallenge, all E81K-mutant 19BBz CAR T cells were able to control tumor rechallenges (Fig. 3b), resulting in significantly improved survival (Extended Data Fig. 6k). Together, these data show that E81K-mutant CAR T cells retain their functional capacity long-term, thereby outperforming prototypic BBz CAR T cells.

Given the great challenge in enhancing CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors, we evaluated B7H3-BBz CAR T cells with or without the E81K substitution at stress test doses in a xenograft model of metastatic Sh-Sy5y neuroblastoma endogenously expressing B7H3/CD276 (ref. 44) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6l). E81K-modified B7H3-BBz CAR T cells demonstrated superior tumor control, resulting in significantly prolonged survival of treated mice (Fig. 3d,e). This therapeutic benefit was associated with an augmented CAR T cell-to-tumor ratio in the tumor-bearing liver (Fig. 3f). Consistent with our findings in hematological tumors, E81K-modified CAR T cells favored the presence of effector memory cells in the liver, leading to a higher effector memory CAR T cell-to-tumor cell ratio (Fig. 3g) while preventing elevated expression of exhaustion or senescence markers in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 6m,n).

In summary, the E81K substitution enhances the functional persistence of BBz CAR T cells without increasing safety concerns, reinforcing their high therapeutic potential.

To identify underlying mechanisms resulting in improved functional persistence of E81K-mutant BBz CAR T cells, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on sorted antigen-stimulated 19BBz CAR T cells with and without E81K substitution. Unsupervised clustering was followed by integration into n = 8 transcriptionally distinct clusters (Supplementary Tables 1–8) on the basis of selected marker gene expression. While we observed that CD4+ T cells are generally enriched in the E81K context, we identified two clusters of particular relevance when comparing the two conditions (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7): a cytotoxic CD4+ T cell cluster enriched in E81K-modified CAR T cells and a metabolically active CD4+ cluster uniquely enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells but nearly absent in their unmodified counterparts. Moreover, E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells were depleted in a CD4+ cluster with high expression of exhaustion-related genes NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, PDCD1 and LAG3, indicative of an exhaustion-like phenotype (Fig. 4a–d). Consistent with these findings, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing CD19 CAR T cells to exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells45 revealed transcriptional similarities of the exhaustion-like CD4⁺ T cell cluster to HA CAR T cells. In contrast, the CD4⁺ clusters enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells more closely correlated with the transcriptional profile of functional CD19 CAR T cells (Fig. 4e).

Unmodified (mock) or E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (TRBC KO) from one healthy donor were sorted after two antigen stimulations with Nalm6 tumor cells and subsequently subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. a, UMAP embedding of all analyzed cells.

Top-ranked pathways are labeled. Transcriptomic data were used from experiment shown in a,b. Metabolic analysis is shown in Extended Data Fig. 8e–g (hypergeometric testing). h, Cellular ion counts of NADH across E81K-modified and 19BBz control CAR T cells after second Nalm6 tumor stimulation measured by mass spectrometry (n = 3 biologically independent healthy donors; mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test). i, OCR traces as measured by seahorse mitochondrial stress test for TRBC-KO control 19BBz (mock) and E81K-edited 19BBz CAR T cells after exposure to three repeated stimulations with Nalm6 cells. Lines mark the addition of oligomycin (2 μM), FCCP (1 μM) and rotenone + antimycin A (R + A; 0.5 μM) (mean of n = 5 technical replicates for one representative T cell donor of three donors). j, Average basal OCR, maximal OCR and spare respiratory capacity levels in seahorse mitochondrial stress test (n = 3 biologically independent T cell donors; mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test).

Concordant with our findings of increased effector function, E81K-modified CAR T cells displayed enhanced cytotoxic signatures characterized by high expression of effector genes including granzymes and perforin, and showed a specific enrichment of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c)46.

The metabolically active CD4⁺ T cell cluster highly enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells displayed increased glycolytic activity (Fig. 4f). These findings were supported by an overall heightened expression of glycolysis-related genes and increased glucose uptake in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b,d,e). Parallel metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed altered intracellular metabolite levels in E81K-edited CAR T cells with a pronounced increase in NADH levels (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8f–i). Together, these findings indicate an overall favorable metabolic capacity induced by the E81K substitution in BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b,d–i).

Considering the pivotal role of metabolic fitness in sustaining long-term T cell functionality, we conducted a real-time metabolic flux analysis of E81K-edited versus mock CAR T cells following repeated tumor antigen exposure. E81K-mutant CAR T cells showed higher basal and maximal oxygen consumption, a significantly increased spare respiratory capacity (Fig. 4i,j) and a higher spare glycolytic capacity (Extended Data Fig. 8j,k). This improved CAR T cell fitness was accompanied by an increased mitochondrial mass of E81K-mutant CAR T cells relative to their unedited counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8l). Taken together, transcriptional and metabolic analyses indicate that the E81K substitution enhances cytolytic capacity and metabolic fitness of BBz CAR T cells while mitigating T cell exhaustion.

Given the beneficial properties conferred upon BBz CAR T cells by the E81K substitution, we next sought to assess its role in context of the 28z CAR design. Similar to our findings in BBz CAR T cells, induction of E81K in 1928z CARs boosted CD69 expression relative to unedited controls, reinforcing mutation-induced changes in T cell activation levels (Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, E81K editing in 28z CAR T cells was associated with augmented expression of exhaustion-related markers (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and the inability to enhance proliferative capacity and cytolytic properties (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). We observed similar albeit not statistically significant trends in T cells expressing high tonic-signaling B7H3-specific CARs following introduction of the E81K alteration (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Together, these results demonstrate that the E81K substitution confers functional benefits specifically in the context of 4-1BB-based CARs but not in the CD28 costimulation-based CAR framework, underscoring the need for signaling modulation tailored to the respective CAR design.

Therefore, we selected the top hit (L32P) in 28z CAR T cells on the basis of our initial screening results and investigated the phenotypical and functional consequences resulting from this substitution. In accordance with attenuated PI3K signaling mediated by the L32P substitution (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9g), we observed decreased levels of T cell activation in unstimulated L32P-edited 1928z and antigen-stimulated L32P-edited CD8+ 19BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9h). In contrast to 19BBz CAR T cells that did not benefit from the L32P substitution (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j), L32P-mutant 1928z CAR T cells showed considerably increased antigen-dependent proliferation potential and retained the high effector function attributed to the 28z CAR design (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9k–n). In line with these observations, L32P-mutant 1928z CARs exhibited a less differentiated T cell state as indicated by an increased proportion of central memory T cells compared to mock-edited 1928z CAR T cells (Fig. 5c).

a, CD69 expression levels in mock 1928z as compared to L32P-modified 1928z CAR T cells determined by flow cytometry without further antigen stimulation (n = 11 biologically independent donors, mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test). b, n-fold CAR T cell expansion for L32P-edited relative to unmodified 1928z CAR T cells 7 days after one (day 7), two (day 14) and three (day 21) stimulation(s) with Nalm6 cells (two-sided one-sample t-test; n = 5 biologically independent donors, mean ± s.d.). c, Fold enrichment of the central memory (CD62L+CD45RA−) population in L32P-edited 1928z relative to mock 1928z CAR T cells within the CD8+ (left) and CD4+ (right) CAR+ compartment. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test (n = 9 biologically independent donors). d–f, Luciferase-expressing Sh-Sy5y cells were i.v. injected into NSG mice followed by i.v. administration of UT T cells or B7H3-28z CAR T cells with or without L32P substitution. d, Experimental timeline. e, Bioluminescence imaging of Sh-Sy5y-bearing mice (representative of f) treated with UT, mock B7H3-28z and L32P-edited B7H3-28z CAR T cells at the indicated time points (ventral view). f, Survival of the cohort (L32P B7H3-28z: n = 9, mock B7H3-28z: n = 9 mice, UT: n = 4 mice per group; T cells from two biologically unrelated healthy donors; two-sided Mantel–Cox test). g, Data from the liver of mice (n = 5) treated as shown in (d) and collected 10 days after injection of either mock B7H3-28z or L32P-modified B7H3-28z CAR T cells. Absolute count of SCM CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells in spleen and blood (n = 5 mice per group, mean ± s.d.; two-sided unpaired Student's t-test).

We next evaluated L32P-edited B7H3-28z CAR T cells in the challenging context of a solid tumor model in vivo. We found that L32P-mutant B7H3-28z CAR T cells significantly improved overall survival of mice in a metastatic neuroblastoma model compared to B7H3-28z controls (Fig. 5d–f). Consistent with our previous findings, the enhanced tumor control was associated with a less differentiated T cell phenotype, as indicated by a significantly increased stem-cell-like memory (SCM) T cell pool in L32P-edited compared to mock B7H3-28z CAR T cells on day 10 after injection (Fig. 5g).

Overall, these findings underscore the distinct role of PI3K–AKT signaling in BBz and 28z CAR T cell biology and highlight both the technological and the biological advances of our ROADSTAR approach. Targeted induction of point mutations by base editing enables precise calibration of signaling strength for each CAR design, enabling refined cell products with enhanced therapeutic potency.

Herein, we develop ROADSTAR to fine-tune endogenous PI3K–AKT signaling in CAR T cells through introduction of targeted point mutations. This base-editing screening platform revealed distinct point mutations in the regulatory ABD of p110δ that yield calibrated signaling activities tailored to either 28z-based or BBz-based CAR designs, resulting in favorable phenotypic, metabolic and functional T cell properties.

BBz CAR T cells showed highest enrichment for the PI3K-activating E81K substitution. Intriguingly, this substitution has been reported in persons with activated PI3Kδ syndrome, an autosomal dominant immune deficiency caused by an increased activity of the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway in immune cells19,47,48,49. While these clinical data bolster our findings of greater PI3K–AKT pathway activity induced by E81K, we found that the functional consequences for T cells are contrasting in the context of BBz CAR T cells. Activating PI3Kδ germline alterations foster early T cell differentiation at the expense of memory formation, which ultimately drives T cell exhaustion and senescence, thereby impairing immune responses19,47,48,50. In contrast, E81K-mutant BBz CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity upon repeated antigen exposures across different tumor entities in vitro and improved therapeutic efficacy against established hematological and solid tumors in vivo without driving T cell dysfunction.

Thus, the increased PI3K–AKT signaling activity in E81K-modified CAR T cells resulted in enhanced effector function while preserving the beneficial memory features ascribed to this CAR design. This suggests that 4-1BB costimulation incorporated in the CAR design promotes memory formation in a nonredundant way to PI3K signaling.

Mechanistically, metabolic and single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed improved metabolic capacities of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells associated with increased spare respiratory capacity and mitochondrial fitness after repetitive antigen exposures—features that have been linked to improved T cell functionality28,46,51.

The additional signaling capacity conferred by the E81K substitution was not beneficial in the context of 28z CAR T cells. Instead, the L32P substitution identified as the top hit in 28z CAR T cells resulted in diminished PI3K–AKT signaling capacity, thereby limiting early T cell differentiation and activation profiles in 28z CAR T cells while simultaneously enhancing their proliferative capacity. These desirable attributes of L32P-mutant 28z CAR T cells culminated in superior control of a metastatic solid tumor in vivo.

One concern of activating PIK3CD point mutations is the potential of malignant transformation. Among over 67,000 individuals reported in cBioPortal, no cases of T cell leukemias harboring L32P or E81K substitutions have been reported. Likewise, there are no described T cell leukemias arising in persons with E81K substitutions, suggesting safety advantages compared to CRISPR–Cas-mediated KO of tumor suppressor genes or overexpression of mutations that have been implicated in T cell malignancies52,53. In accordance, our long-term in vivo experiments did not reveal any signs of toxicities or malignant transformation in mice treated with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells.

This work highlights ROADSTAR as a strategy to modulate T cell intrinsic signaling pathway activity by targeted base edits, enabling differential signaling capacities tailored to the specific CAR design. This strategy differs from previous work focused on changes in the CAR construct itself and provides a notable advantage compared to genetic KO or exogenous overexpression by enabling precise calibration of signaling activation levels and preserving positive and negative feedback regulation15,17,25,53,54. Notably, our study emphasizes the importance of the underlying T cell biology imparted by the relevant CAR design in determining the beneficial nature of a point mutation to unleash full therapeutic potential. Previous studies identified PIK3CD variants capable of modulating T cell activity through base-editing screens in untransduced T cells21,55. However, such approaches that do not account for CAR design-specific signaling effects might select for highly activating mutations that, when combined with additional signaling provided in a CAR context, could risk inducing T cell overstimulation, hyperproliferation or dysfunction.

Overall, ROADSTAR enabled the identification of distinct point mutations induced by base editing that confer functional advantage and favorable T cell profiles to 28z and BBz CARs by calibrating endogenous signaling strength. These insights pave the way for more effective cellular cancer immunotherapies while simultaneously advancing our understanding of CAR T cell biology.

Cell lines used were luciferase-expressing and GFP-expressing Nalm6 (M.S., Columbia University), Kelly, SK-N-AS and Sh-Sy5y (University Children's Hospital Tübingen) and Daudi (kindly provided by D. Sonanini, University Hospital Tübingen). Cells were PCR-tested for Mycoplasma and found to be negative. SUP-T1 (S. Hailfinger, University Hospital Münster), Sh-Sy5y, Kelly and Daudi cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) with L-glutamine, 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Nalm6 cells were additionally supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1× nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (all Gibco). SK-N-AS were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 1× NEAA.

Fresh blood products from healthy deidentified volunteers were obtained from Zentrum für klinische Transfusionsmedizin, Tübingen. Samples from pretreated participants with cancer were isolated from 60–81-year-old individuals suffering from different cancer entities including sarcoma, lung cancer and breast cancer after several rounds of chemotherapy. Samples from pretreated participants with tumors were obtained from the Medical Department, University Hospital Tübingen. All blood samples were handled following the ethical and safety procedures approved by the ethic commission of the University of Tübingen (783/2023BO2, 846/2020BO2). Informed consent was obtained from the participants. All samples of human origin were destroyed after the analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood products and T cells were subsequently isolated using human Pan T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-5359). T cells were activated at a cell-to-bead-ratio of 1:1 with human T activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, 11161D) in the presence of 5 ng ml−1 IL-7 and IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-095-363 and 130-095-765). Cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells per ml in X-Vivo15 (Lonza, BEBP02-061Q), which was supplemented with 5% human AB-positive serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

pCMV-ABEmax (Addgene, 112094) and pCMV-AncBE4max (Addgenes, 112095) were used as templates. IVT was performed using the T7MEGAscript kit (Thermo Fisher, AMB13345). The plasmids were linearized through AgeI-HF, followed by IVT according to manufacturer's instructions. Transcripts were capped with the CleanCapAG (Tebubio, N-7113) and subjected to poly(A) tailing (Thermo Fisher, AM1350) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA was purified through overnight LiCl precipitation and mRNA was stored at −150 °C.

Base-editing sgRNAs (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10) were cloned into the previously described SFGγ retroviral 19BBz and 1928z CAR plasmids (M.S., Columbia University)17,39,56 under a hU6 promoter. CAR constructs coexpressed truncated LNGFR. Single-chain variable fragment sequences against CD22 (EP2912061B1), B7H3 (WO2017044699A1) and L1CAM (US20210085719A1) were cloned into the SFG-19BBz and SFG-1928z vectors using standard molecular biology techniques. Plasmids were used for retrovirus production as previously described17. H29 packaging cells were provided by M.S. (Columbia University) and 293Vec-RD114 packaging cells were provided by BioVec Pharma57. The PI3Kδ amino acid sequence was obtained from UniProt (O00329) and the respective nucleotide sequence was cloned into the SFG-19BBz or SFG-1928z vector, replacing truncated LNGFR. For ABD screening, T cells were transduced with the retroviral pools to express either 1928z or 19BBz CARs and the sgRNA library. Forty-eight hours after transduction, 2 × 106 T cells were resuspended in P3 primary cell buffer (Lonza) and electroporated with 10 µg of the respective base editor mRNA using Lonza Nucleofector device (EC115 program). Edited CAR T cell pools were subjected to weekly Nalm6 stimulations (effector-to-target ratio (E:T) 2:1) for a total of three stimulations. Genomic DNA was purified using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) from start-point and end-point samples and edited loci were amplified by PCR using NGS 5′ Illumina specific 30-bp partial adaptors. For PIK3CD, exons 1 and 2 spanning the screened p110δ ABD were amplified; for CD19 and RASA2, regions surrounding the respective sgRNA binding sites were targeted. Amplicons were sequenced by AmpliconEZ targeted amplicon deep sequencing (Azenta). Data analysis was carried out using the public Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org/). Adaptor removal and quality trimming were performed using the TrimGalore application with a threshold Phred-score of 25 (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to the reference sequences around the amplified loci using the BWA-MEM2 alignment algorithm58 and variants were called using the LoFreq variant caller application59. Mutations that were represented under 0.4% at the assay start point were excluded from further analysis. Mutational prevalence was normalized to the CAR T cell rate and analyzed as the fold change (FC) compared to start-point prevalence.

Haplotype analysis was performed by extracting reads harboring specific nucleotide substitutions corresponding to the amino acid changes L32P or E81K. Therefore, we implemented a custom filtering pipeline using pysam library (version 0.21.0; https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)60. Reads containing the respective codon-altering variants were isolated and subsequently reanalyzed to identify co-occurring mutations within the same sequencing reads.

T cells were isolated and stimulated as described above. Then, 48 h after, 3 × 106 T cells were resuspended in 100 µl of buffer T and electroporated with 10 µg of mRNA and 5 µg of each synthetic sgRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) resuspended in IDTE buffer (Integrated DNA Technologies, 11-05-01-05) at 1,400 V (three pulses, 10 ms) using the Neon electroporator device. Mock-edited T cells were electroporated with scrambled sgRNA (GCACTACCAGAGCTAACTCA); TRBC1/2 KO and E81K and L32P substitutions were induced by use of sgRNA sequences CCCACCAGCTCAGCTCCACG (AncBE4max), GCTCTTGCTGCTCCGCTGTC (AncBE4max) and AAGTTCAGGTAGACCCCTGT (ABEmax), respectively. Cells were rested in antibiotic-free X-Vivo15 supplemented with cytokines for 24 h and transduced with retroviral supernatant in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) with 10% FBS supplemented with cytokines by centrifugation on retronectin-coated (Takara, T110A) plates (300g, 1 h, 34 °C). CAR T cells with TRBC1/2 KO were enriched with human CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-043).

Base-editing efficiency was routinely assessed by Sanger sequencing followed by analysis with EditR61 default settings (https://moriaritylab.shinyapps.io/editr_v10/).

Substitutions co-occuring with L32P and E81K were analyzed using AmpliconEZ targeted amplicon deep sequencing (Azenta) as described above.

SUP-T1s were electroporated at 1,400 V (three pulses, 10 ms) using the Neon electroporator device, seeded in a single-cell suspension and sequenced for homozygous E81K substitution.

First, 7 days after transduction, unstimulated CAR T cells were single-cell-sorted on the basis of LNGFR expression using a MA900 multiapplication cell sorter (Sony). Single-cell DNA was isolated and amplified using REPLI-g single-cell kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, amplified DNA was used for PIK3CD exon 1 PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing.

CAR T cells (LNGFR+) were weekly stimulated with target cells in RPMI-1640 + FBS without cytokines (E:T = 2:1, unless otherwise indicated).

NOD/SCID/Il2rγ-null male and female mice (6–9 weeks old; Charles River, strain code 614, NSG) were used for experiments. All mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions with a housing temperature of 22 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity and a 12-h dark–light cycle. All ethical regulations and animal use guidelines were followed. Mouse protocols were approved by the Regierungspräsidium Tübingen and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University (R02/22G, R03/22G, R05/23G and no. 20220178). A total of 0.5 × 106 luciferase–GFP-expressing Nalm6 or Sh-Sy5y cells were administered by tail-vein injection followed by intravenous (i.v.) injection of 3 × 106 19BBz and 1 × 106 (B7H3-BBz) or 0.5 × 106 (B7H3-28z) CAR T cells 4 days later, respectively. Tumor rechallenge experiments were performed by repetitive i.v. injection of 1 × 106 Nalm6 cells at the indicated time points. Tumor-bearing mice were killed according to signs of morbidity, based on approved scoring sheets involving evaluation of face grimace, posture, weight loss (>20%), respiration, activity, social behavior and grooming. Tumor-free mice that had to be killed for unknown reasons were excluded. For assessment of tumor burden, mice were intraperitoneally administered 150 mg kg−1 D-luciferin potassium salt (GoldBio, LUCK-1g) dissolved in sterile PBS for 10 min, followed by imaging under isoflurane anesthesia62. Bioluminescence imaging was performed on the IVIS Lumina III system (PerkinElmer) and signal intensity was quantified using Living Image analysis software (version 4.7.4; PerkinElmer) as total flux (photons per s) from consistent regions of interest. To reduce spillover during bioluminescence imaging, we imaged treatment groups together whenever possible.

Ex vivo cytotoxicity was assessed through the generation of single-cell suspensions from spleen, followed by overnight incubation in RPMI-1640 + FBS. In vitro generated or ex vivo obtained CAR+ effectors were cocultured with the respective target cells in triplicate at the indicated E:T ratios in 96-well plates with 2 × 104 target cells per well. Maximal luciferase expression was determined using only target cells; Triton X-100-treated cells were used to assess background levels. After 18 h of incubation, 100 μl of luciferase substrate (D-luciferin; Goldbio) was directly added to each well. Emission was detected and lysis was calculated as (1 − Emsample/Emmax) × 100.

Anti-L1CAM-BBz CAR T cells were used after twice-weekly stimulations with Sh-Sy5y (E:T = 2:1). H2B–mGFP-expressing Sh-Sy5y cells were subconfluently seeded in a black 96-well imaging plate and were overlaid with a 3D collagen gel (PureCol, concentration: 1.7 mg ml−1) containing the respective preactivated CAR T cells stained with CellTracker Red CMTPX dye (Thermo Fisher, C34552). After polymerization, T cell dynamics were recorded by time-lapse bright-field microscopy (frame rate = 55 s) for 42–45 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The 2 × 2 mosaic images were obtained with an epifluorescence microscope (LeicaMicrosystems, Thunder 3D Assay) with hardware-based auto focus control using a Leica ×20 (numerical aperture: 0.95) air objective and computationally merged using the Leica LasX software. Whole-well end-point images were acquired after 4 days using a Tecan SparkCyto. Images were split and segmented by StarDist (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_30, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9093435); apoptotic cells were excluded and living cells were counted using FIJI. E:T cell interactions were quantified by automatic analysis based on vicinity. For speed quantification, T cells that could be followed for >30 min were included in the statistical analysis. Cells were segmented and tracked using TrackMate FIJI plug-in63 with Stardist segmentation and LAP Tracker tracking64. T cell analysis was performed using R Studio based on celltrackR65 and the work package (https://github.com/juliaquach02/cellcontacts) to detect E:T cell contacts. An interaction or contact was defined as three frames (155 s) and a maximum distance of 7 µm between T cell and tumor cell. Apoptotic events and T cell contacts until tumor cell apoptosis were quantified by manual analysis. Data were evaluated on the original image set.

Cell-surface staining of single-cell suspensions was performed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature.

Mitochondrial mass was determined by incubation with 10 nM MitoTracker orange CMTMRos (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by cell-surface staining.

For assessment of intracellular protein levels, effector and target cells were cocultured (E:T = 1:1, 4 h, 37 °C) in the presence of 3 µg ml−1 brefeldin A and 2 µM monensin (both Tonbobio), followed by viability and surface staining in PBS for 25 min. Cells were fixed with IC fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 20 min at room temperature. Intracellular staining was performed in 1× permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C.

For glucose uptake experiments, cells were analyzed after final stimulation with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Cells were washed and resuspended in glucose-free RPMI-1640 + FBS supplemented with 100 µg ml−1 2-NBD-glucose (Abcam, ab146200) to a cell concentration of 3 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS and stained extracellularly.

For phosphoflow analysis, cells were seeded in cytokine-free RPMI-1640 for 2 h and subsequently stimulated with Nalm6 cells for at an (E:T = 1:1). After fixation with 100 µl of warm 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, cells were washed and permeabilized in 300 µl of 90% ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice. Subsequently, cells were incubated with phosphoantibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed and stained with secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature.

For measurement of antigen surface levels, Quantum Simply Cellular antimouse IgG (Bangs Laboratories) was performed and calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For CAR T cell sorts, unstimulated CAR T cells were sorted on a MA900 multiapplication cell sorter (Sony, 100-µm chip). LNGFR+ CAR T cells were sorted for indicated CAR T cell subsets (naive, CD45RA+CD62L+; central memory, CD45RA−CD62L+; effector memory, CD45RA−CD62L−; effector, CD45RA+CD62L−).

Samples obtained from in vivo experiments were blocked using mouse FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-575) in addition to the CAR and surface staining. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated microtainer and washed with cold FACS buffer. FACS lysis solution (BD, 349202) was added to lyse red blood cells. CountBright absolute counting beads (Invitrogen) were added to the samples before acquisition. The gating strategy for in vivo samples is exemplarily shown in Extended Data Fig. 10. In all experiments involving TRBC1/2 KO, the CAR+ cells for subsequent analysis were determined as the proportion of CD3− T cells.

Flow cytometry and western blot antibodies and reagents are reported as Supplementary Tables 11 and 12. All samples were acquired on a five-laser Cytek Aurora spectral cytometer with automated compensation calculation. Fluorescence − 1 controls were acquired for accurate gating. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (version 10.8.0).

For immunoblotting, SUP-T1 or T cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per ml in fresh RPMI-1640 + FBS. Cells were either left untreated or incubated with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and spun down (300g, 5 min, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in supplemented RIPA buffer (protease inhibitor (Roche), NaF, Na4P2O7 and Na3VO4) and incubated for 15 min on ice with repetitive vigorous mixing. Protein concentration was measured using BioRad protein assay. Then, 40–60 µg of protein lysate was loaded onto 10% Tris–glycine SDS Gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA or milk in TBST; thereafter, primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight and secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature.

First, 19BBz CAR T cells carrying either a TRBC1/2 stop mutation and/or the E81K base edit were stimulated twice with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Then, 48 h after the last stimulation, living CAR T cells were single-cell-sorted (LNGFR+CD3−) and single-cell sequenced (CeGaT). Cell count and viability (>90%) were determined using a Cellaca MX cell counter (Revvity). The scRNA-seq library was prepared using Chromium NextGEM single-cell 3′ kit, version 3.1 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cell suspension was loaded into a Chromium NextGEM ChipG aiming for a cell recovery of 10,000 cells per sample. For cDNA amplification, 11 PCR cycles were used and the final sample index PCR was performed with 12 cycles. Libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq X Plus 1.5B flow cell (mean reads per cell: 19BBz TRBC, 113,977; 19BBz E81K, 121,606).

Demultiplexing of the sequencing reads was performed with bcl2fastq (version 2.20). For each sample, FASTQ files generated with bcl2fastq were subsequently processed with the Cell Ranger software (version 7.1.0) provided by 10x Genomics.

Processing and analysis of scRNA-seq data were performed with Scanpy (version 1.11.1)66. Genes with <20 total counts and cells with >100,000 total or 10% mitochondrial gene counts, <2,000 distinct genes or 10% ribosomal gene counts were filtered out. The gene expression matrix was normalized to the median of total counts per cell, log-transformed and scaled per gene. The 2,000 most highly variable genes were determined with the ‘seurat_v3' method on the basis of raw counts67. Scaled expression of these highly variable genes was used to compute a principal component analysis and a neighborhood graph with 30 nearest neighbors was constructed on the basis of 50 principal components using cosine similarity. Leiden clustering (resolution 1.0) was performed and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding was computed with default parameters for visualization.

For cell type annotation, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Leiden clusters were determined using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on log-normalized counts with the Scanpy function ‘rank_genes_groups' (ref. 66). Overrepresentation analysis of differentially upregulated genes for each cluster (false-discovery-rate-corrected P value < 0.05, log2FC > 0.5) and GSEA68 based on differential expression scores were performed using GSEApy (version 1.1.8)69 with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, Gene Ontology biological process, MSigDB Hallmark, MSigDB C7 immunologic signature and additional exhaustion-related gene sets45 to aid with functional annotations. Clusters with similar marker gene expression profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7c) were aggregated into functional cell types. Gene module expression46 was scored using the Scanpy function ‘score_genes' (ref. 66) on the basis of log-normalized counts.

First, 19BBz CAR T cells with a TRBC1/2 stop mutation and/or E81K substitution were twice stimulated with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Then, 24 h after last stimulation, the absence of Nalm6 cells was controlled by flow analysis and 1 × 10−7 to 1.2 × 10−7 CAR T cells were thoroughly washed followed by quenching with 400 µl of ice-cold methanol (≥99.9%) and storage at −80 °C. Metabolite extraction was performed on ice using a two-phase extraction with methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether and H2O as previously described70. Liquid chromatography (LC)–mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed using a chromatography system coupled to a timsTOF Pro2 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a vacuum-insulated pressure-heated electrospray ionization source (Bruker Daltonics). Hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC) was performed using a BEH amide column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm; Waters). To manually assess signal linearity, a pooled quality control sample was injected (0.25–5 µl). Mass and ion mobility were recalibrated using sodium formate and Agilent's ESIS tuning solution per run. The MS analysis for nontargeted metabolomics was performed using parallel accumulation serial fragmentation mode with data-dependent MS/MS acquisition and trapped ion mobility spectrometry stepping, following the four-dimensional (4D) metabolomics standard method in TimsControl software (Bruker Daltonics). HILIC was run in both ionization modes; reverse phase LC was run in negative mode only.

Raw data were processed in MetaboScape 2025b using the T-ReX 4D algorithm and matched to commercial and in-house target lists and libraries (Bruker HMDB 2.0, METLIN-CCS, PNNL, IROA MSMLS). Metabolite identification followed Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 2 criteria (m/z deviation < 2.0 ppm, mSigma < 20, MS/MS score < 900 or collision cross-section deviation < 1%). Features had to be ≥3× blank, detected in ≥5 samples and have ≥1,500 ion counts and ≥125 4D points. Recursive extraction and quality-control-based batch correction were applied.

Data preprocessing and further statistical processing were performed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0. Missing values were imputed as one fifth of the minimum positive value, normalized by probabilistic quotient normalization, log10-transformed and merged across HILIC and RP modes. Redundant features were retained from the method with fewer missing values and higher intensity. Samples were run in five technical replicates unless stated otherwise. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance and the ward.D2 linkage method. Joint transcriptomics from overall scRNA analysis and metabolomic pathway analysis was conducted using the MetaboAnalyst 6.0. For this analysis, 222 upregulated genes (adjusted P value < 0.05, FC > 1) and 27 upregulated metabolites (P value < 0.05 in at least one donor) were included. Pathway enrichment was assessed using hypergeometric testing and pathway topology was evaluated on the basis of betweenness centrality.

Absolute NADH levels of CAR T cells were measured 24 h after second antigen stimulation using a NAD+/NADH assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK460) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Metabolic profiling was measured using a flux analyzer (Seahorse XF Pro, Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 × 105 T cells per well were seeded in 5–8 replicates in 180 µl of Seahorse XF RPMI medium (Agilent) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM D-glucose in poly(D-lysine)-coated 96-well microplates. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, mitochondrial respiration analysis was performed using the Seahorse XF cell mito stress test kit (Agilent, 103015-100) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Basal oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) before oligomycin treatment and after rotenone + antimycin A treatment. Maximal oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference of the OCR after rotenone + antimycin A treatment and after FCCP treatment. Basal and maximal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was defined as the ECAR measured before and after oligomycin addition. Spare respiratory capacity and spare ECAR were defined as the difference between maximal and basal oxygen consumption and ECAR, respectively.

For cytokine quantification, the LEGENDplex human essential immune response panel (BioLegend) was performed according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Data analysis was performed according to manufacturer's instructions using the LEGENDplex data analysis software. In brief, serum samples from mice were collected on day 16 and used both undiluted and in a 1:100 dilution for the assay. For in vitro experiments, CAR T cells and target cells were cocultured (24 h, E:T = 1:1). All measurements were performed in duplicates.

CAR T cells were harvested either unstimulated or after twice-weekly stimulations with Nalm6. Then, 4 days after the last stimulation, no Nalm6 cells were detectable in the culture as determined by flow cytometry. All cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and RNA was directly extracted using the RNeasy mini kit with RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Quality control, read mapping and counting were performed using the Nextflow-based nf-core/rnaseq (version 3.12.0) pipeline (https://nf-co.re/rnaseq). Quality control assessment of the raw data was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.9) and RSeQC (version 3.0.1). Reads were mapped to the reference genome (GRCh38) using the STAR aligner (version 2.6.1d)71. Quantification of raw gene expression was performed with Salmon (version 1.10.1)72 and downstream analysis was performed with the Nextflow-based rnadeseq (version 2.2.0) pipeline (https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/rnadeseq). This workflow integrates DESeq2 (version 1.40.2)73 for differential expression analysis used in the R language (version 4.3.1). Genes with an adjusted P value ≤ 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. The DEG lists were obtained from simple pairwise comparisons extracted from a linear model. The DEG lists, together with their associated log2FC were fed into gprofiler2 for pathway enrichment analysis. The gene selection for the comparative analysis between 19BBz CAR T cells with and without the E81K substitution in Extended Data Fig. 6h was based on the FOXO3-dependent gene set reported by Litvak et al.41 (Fig. 1a). Specifically, the top 30 genes upregulated in FOXO3-KO versus WT conditions and expressed across both human and murine species were selected for further analysis. For the GSEA, fgsea (version 1.28.0)71 was used to run the analysis on the output of DESeq2. The reference gene list used included two custom gene sets and MSigDB (version 7.2) Hallmark gene sets.

All tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. For histology 3–5 µm-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The histologic samples were analyzed by an experienced pathologist (L.Q.-M.). All samples were scanned with the Ventana DP200 (Roche) and processed with the Image Viewer MFC Application. Final image preparation was performed with Adobe Photoshop 2024.

Any additional statistical analyses not detailed above were conducted using Prism 7 (GraphPad). Mouse condition and survival were observed by an operator who was blinded to treatment groups in addition to the main investigator who was not blind to group allocation. Tumor burden was measured by a blinded operator; analysis of data was not performed in blinded fashion. No data were excluded throughout the studies. No blinding was performed for in vitro experiments. No statistical sample size was predetermined. Mice were randomly allocated to the respective groups after ensuring similar tumor burden. Comparisons between two groups were conducted using two-sided Student's t-tests. When normality could not be assumed (Shapiro–Wilk test), the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was applied for paired data. For values normalized to their respective control, two-sided one-sample t-tests were used if the data were normally distributed; otherwise, a two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test was applied. For comparing multiple groups, we applied one-way analysis of variance. For in vivo experiments, overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and survival differences between groups were assessed with the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Specific statistical tests used are detailed in the corresponding figure legends. Scientific illustrations were generated by J. Zenker with BioRender.com drafts.

The expansion of ancestrally diverse genetic cohorts has altered the landscape of complex disease genetics. Differences in linkage disequilibrium across populations have improved fine-mapping and the identification of target genes — key steps for translating findings from genome-wide association studies into biological understanding. Whilst there is widespread sharing of genetic architecture across ancestries, loci that display heterogeneity in causal genetic effects across populations can offer unique biological insights. Here, we review how ancestral and global diversity shape genetic discoveries. As we advance towards global precision medicine, integrating genomic data with diverse environmental and social factors will be crucial to account for population-specific contexts that can influence disease risk or treatment response.

Science evolves, and so should its vocabulary. One term that has lingered for far too long is ‘seminal'. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word originates from the Latin sēminālis, meaning “relating to seed”, often “the seed or semen of men”. Therefore, describing a paper or discovery as seminal implicitly aligns ‘groundbreaking' with ‘male'.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","‘Industry' Takes on the Age Verification Wars","https://www.wired.com/story/hbo-industry-season-4-age-verification/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT","

When they decided to take on age verification in their latest season, Industry cocreators Konrad Kay and Mickey Down didn't anticipate the issue would become such a political football.

“It was in the ether of British politics, but it wasn't front and center when we started writing the scripts or shooting it, and then it really flared up as a kind of front-page-of-BBC topic of conversation,” Kay says.

Season 4 of HBO's sexy and darkly funny financial drama, premiering Sunday, continues Industry's expansion beyond the cutthroat world of investment banking into tech, porn, age verification, and politics. As the season begins, there's fighting amongst the top brass at Tender, a fintech company that's recently gone public, over whether or not to continue processing payments for Siren, an adult platform akin to OnlyFans. While Siren and other gambling and porn companies make up a good chunk of Tender's revenue, some Tender executives are spooked by threats of sweeping new age-verification laws and anti-porn rhetoric coming from the UK's Labour Party and feel there's more to be gained by cleaning up their act.

In reality, the UK's Online Safety Act requiring people to verify their ages before they can view porn and other restricted content, came into effect in July 2025, long after Kay and Down came up with the storyline for Industry's most recent season. Still, it's had similar impacts to those felt by Siren. Pornhub's UK traffic dropped by almost 80 percent in light of the regulations and it's facing similar challenges in the US, where half of states have enacted age verification laws. In December, members of Congress considered 19 bills aimed at protecting children and teens online, though critics have said some of them are unconstitutional.

“It's kind of shown how fragile free speech absolutism is,” says Down, describing the “wildly different” opinions on the issue, from puritanism even within liberal enclaves to a censorious “shut everything down” approach from conservatives.

While Industry has been a bit of a sleeper hit for HBO, it finally seemed to break through during Season 3, with its viewership for the premiere up 60 percent compared to Season 2's premiere. Season 4 builds off that momentum very effectively, and feels more prescient than ever.

“We've got the OnlyFans piece and then we've got the fintech piece, and then we've got the fraud piece,” Kay says. But then, “in the back half of the season, we got the ascendant face of authoritarianism in the UK and the US.”

The new season spends more time with junior banker and part-time OnlyFans model Sweetpea Golightly, who keeps her face out of her adult content, but who nonetheless has her identity exposed without her consent. It's a more nuanced look at what happens to modern online sex workers, who often get portrayed on TV in far more black-and-white terms.

“She started Season 3 being like, I'm an empowered woman. I have this OnlyFans account. I never leave money on the table. In Season 4, we're looking at what it looks like when that begins to shift,” Down says. “It can be empowering and exploitative.”

In fact, almost every character in Industry is both empowering and exploitative, depending on the circumstances. And while the latest season is particularly newsy, the most enjoyable part of the show can be watching them peel back those complicated, and often unsavory layers.

Last season followed publishing heiress Yasmin, played by Marisa Abela, as she dealt with the fallout of her Epstein-like father's disappearance—for which she was arguably partly responsible—and contended with the extent of his abuse. Despite having been subjected to his predatory nature since childhood, Yasmin also uses other women around her, a pattern that continues in Season 4, as she navigates her new marriage with old money aristocrat turned failed tech bro, Sir Henry Muck (Kit Harington).

“If she is Eve, she's bitten the apple and she knows that men can and will exploit women, and for a long time she has tried to deny that part of herself,” Abela explains. But having gone through major failures with work, friendship, and romance, she feels “she's not got that many lives left.” If she wants to win, she thinks, she'll need to play by her father's rules.

While Succession was a clear satire of the ultra rich, Industry feels murkier, and at times even aspirational. Even the liberal cocaine use depicted can feel glamorous, or at least cool, until it's not.

Down and Kay met at Oxford and worked at banks in London. They know first-hand the addictive nature of wealth and power. Blowing lines, while true to those circles, is also one of Industry's core metaphors.

“Our show is, in some ways, a celebration of this world, and also a kind of polemic against it. You have to seduce people into wanting something to show them that actually wanting it is maybe detrimental to their character and personality and to their life,” Down says. “Cocaine is just that in a nutshell.”

Rattling off other finance-based hits like The Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short, he notes that typically the first couple of acts—filled with sex, drugs, and money— make finance “look cool.” But inevitably, there's a “come-to-God moment where you realize it's actually hollow.”

That reckoning is well underway in Industry's latest season, but unlike in real life, it's a lot of fun to watch.

When my dog sniffs at certain spots on our morning walk, my daughter calls it “checking her pee-mails.” Yes, the animal kingdom has it right: Urine conveys a wealth of health information, and by analyzing it, you can access critical data about your body without having to wear a fitness tracker 24/7 or get stuck with needles.

Over the past few months, I've been inundated by a steady stream of urine trackers, of which Vivoo's smart toilet is the latest. The smart sensor debuted at CES 2026 and went on sale this week. It costs a relatively affordable $99 and clips inside the basin of any toilet.

When you're ready to do your business, connect the sensor to its companion mobile app using Bluetooth. The sensor collects a sample for testing and uses optical sensors that measure your pee's specific gravity. An onboard processing unit then uses proprietary algorithms to let you know if you're hydrated or not. Most importantly, the gadget uses antibacterial components, has antifungal nanotechnology, is designed for more than 1,000 uses, and is fully no-touch.

I've been spending more time with my toilet lately than I have since I potty trained my kids. I recently tested the Withings U-Scan, which at $380 is a much pricier and more premium-looking urine analysis device. There are two versions: The Nutrio checks for ketone levels, hydration status, and urine acidity (basically, for diabetes), and the Calci checks for calcium content in your urine, which is an early indicator that you may have kidney stones.

Like the smart toilet, the U-Scan opens and uses a cartridge to take samples of the pee. That means it's not totally waterproof, and you do have to aim when you go, which necessitated some fun and necessary conversations about placement with my husband. Also, you have to take it out of the toilet to clean and charge it when you change the cartridge, which is every month or so. Helpfully, the cartridge replacements come with a pair of rubber gloves.

Still, that's a much better and safer process than what happens with the Kohler Dekoda, which was also announced last year. It's basically a toilet bowl camera; it takes pictures of whatever you deposit in your toilet and uses AI to analyze it and give you recommendations on your gut health. Only, it turned out that the end-to-end encrypted camera was not actually end-to-end encrypted. Also, it costs $599.

Vivoo's urine tracker attaches to the basin of nearly any toilet.

A little over a decade ago, the idea someone might want to track what is happening in their toilet was so universally gross that Adult Swim parodied the concept. But now, we're not only tracking our steps and heartbeats but also testing our blood and our spit. The idea of keeping tabs on what's going into our toilets just doesn't seem that weird anymore.

“Urine color is a subjective visual cue that can vary significantly based on lighting conditions, diet, supplements, and environmental factors,” Vivoo cofounder Miray Tayfun said when I asked her why I just wouldn't use my two hydration sensors that are in my head (i.e., my eyes). “Because of this variability, color alone may not consistently reflect hydration-related changes.”

Urine tests are also a part of a routine health checkup, especially if you're pregnant, older, or prediabetic. Like direct-access blood testing, commercially available urine tests may help some people bridge the gaps in our health care system, and Tayfun noted that Vivoo will probably expand the platform. (The company already has an affordable pee strip test.)

Setting all that aside, if you aren't already checking on a preexisting health condition, you probably don't need to spend that much time on the toilet. But at the very least, as gross as it may be to sterilize a U-Scan, it's less scary than having to prick needles under my skin to learn about what might be brewing inside me. Pee is easier. And it's free, and everywhere! Just ask my dog.

Donald Trump is hardly the first US president to look south and conquer. Over the last century, no fewer than a dozen of Trump's predecessors embraced the belief that democracy and profit in Latin America were only one successful coup d'état away. But the particular strain of imperial ambition that Trump appears to have set loose with this weekend's raid in Venezuela appears simultaneously to be deeply atavistic and uniquely Trumpian. And it's one that doesn't look set to die down anytime soon.

It took only a few hours, following the US military's daring seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, for Trump's rationale to shift from hand-waving about democracy and fighting narcotics toward taking control of that nation's vast oil reserves. “We're in charge,” Trump told reporters. “We're going to run everything. We're going to run it—fix it.” And even before Maduro appeared in a New York City courtroom Monday, Trump had begun to celebrate what he's calling his “Donroe Doctrine,” explicitly threatening a half-dozen other nations, from Colombia and Cuba to Mexico and Denmark's Greenland, in a talk with reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

As much as it may seem like we're heading into a new, dangerous, and destabilizing period of Donald Trump's authoritarian regime—his actions in Venezuela appear illegal under both international law and US law and happened without any congressional consultation—it's important to recognize and understand some context. The history of the region—and, more importantly, of how Donald Trump himself operates, how he seems caught in the mindset of 1980s America—make clear that Trump may be embarking on what may someday be viewed as the last war of the 20th century. In fact, there are three main principles that help explain where the US finds itself just days into a new year—principles that make clear how, despite how shocking Saturday morning's breaking news alerts turned out to be, this moment is actually quite unsurprising:

For a century, the two chief hallmarks of US meddling in Latin America have been short-term tactical military success and long-term strategic failure. These two themes are, in fact, deep, venal strands of America's political DNA. Case in point: Long, long before he was indicted for his role in the Watergate burglary and meddling in the 1972 presidential election, E. Howard Hunt spent his career as one of the CIA's best overthrowers of governments.

In the early 1950s, the powerful United Fruit Company feared the land reforms Guatemala's democratically elected Jacobo Árbenz might implement and convinced the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that the new Central American leader might embrace communism. The CIA, founded in 1947, was relatively new to the business of meddling in Central and South America, but the US certainly was not—among other expeditions, it had occupied Nicaragua on and off from 1912 to 1933, invaded and occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, and occupied Cuba from 1906 to 1909 and then returned from 1917 to 1922, to protect US-owned sugar plantations.

Hunt was a decidedly middling spy, stationed in Mexico City—where he'd helped recruit another would-be junior officer, William F. Buckley, Jr.—but his career got a big boost when he helped lay the groundwork for overthrowing Árbenz. “What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops,” Hunt said, decades later. It was one of the only successful CIA-backed coups of the 1950s, so Hunt was a natural to include when the agency began planning the Bay of Pigs invasion.

A major (and eventually fatal) difference from previous efforts across the 20th century was that in seeking to overthrow the Castro regime, the government relied this time not on the Marines but on an army of Cuban exiles: Hunt was placed in charge of creating the provisional government, friendly to the US, that would take over once the CIA-trained invasion force overthrew Fidel Castro. That invasion, just weeks into the presidency of John F. Kennedy, failed spectacularly—more than a hundred freedom fighters died on the beaches when US air support didn't materialize, and within days, 1,200 were captured and surrendered, leading to hundreds more executions.

President Kennedy displays the combat flag of the Cuban landing brigade and declares to an audience of 40,000 that it “will be returned to this brigade in a free Havana.” The force was quickly stopped by Castro's army during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

The debacle, though, hardly slowed the CIA's appetite for overthrowing governments in Central and South America. In 1961, the CIA supplied the weapons to murder the leader of the Dominican Republic. That same year, it helped a coup in Ecuador—then, unhappy when the new leader turned out to be even less friendly to the US than the one who had been overthrown, backed a different junta in another coup in 1963.

In the years that followed, the CIA backed other coups—including in Brazil (1964) and Chile (1973)—and dabbled with supporting other armed military uprisings and right-wing rebels across the region (see the Iran-Contra scandal). Most administrations wanted to go even further than they did; Reagan's secretary of state Alexander Haig pleaded to invade Cuba, telling Reagan, “You just give me the word. I'll turn that fucking island into a parking lot.”

In almost every case of US intervention throughout the western hemisphere, what followed the US meddling was worse than what came before. Chile's democratically elected Salvador Allende, for instance, was replaced by the brutal 17-year military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. (And that's all before you get to this century's examples overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan.) After the US offered tacit support for a 1976 coup in Argentina, overthrowing Isabel Perón, a brutal military ruled for decades and perfected horrors like throwing dissidents out of helicopters into the ocean.

The region's instability and authoritarian regimes were aided by elite training from the US military. The Defense Department trained tens of thousands of Latin American military, intelligence, and law enforcement at its infamous School of the Americas in Georgia; many went on to be accused of terrible human rights abuses, including alumni who, according to a Duke scholar's investigation, went on to be “dictators, death squad operatives, and assassins,” including Manuel Noriega himself, Bolivian dictator Hugo Banzer Suárez, Haitian dictator Raoul Cedras, Pinochet's secret police leader, and even the general who this weekend was Maduro's defense minister, among other so-called “Hall of Shamers.”

For decades the US and president after president justified these interventions and political support for dictatorships through the lens of the Cold War—arguing that supporting terrible regimes was better than allowing the risk they might fall to communism. Indeed, ironically, it's the very strength, dominance, and exquisite skill of the US military and intelligence community to achieve their tactical victories that make such interventions look so much more alluring than they should be to presidents, from Eisenhower to Reagan to Trump. You can almost always win the short term—depose, overthrow, or kidnap the leader—and then the long term is a gamble.

But the unintended long-term consequences of these actions have ricocheted through American domestic politics for decades. Indeed, their second- and third-order effects have done more to shape US politics today than most Americans understand.

There have been obvious links: For instance, it was while planning the Bay of Pigs operation that Hunt met the four Cubans he would later recruit to burglarize the Watergate. And less obvious ones: Most notably, the US meddling in places like the so-called “Northern Triangle” of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador unleashed destabilizing forces that contributed to waves of migration northward to the US border—millions of would-be immigrants whose arrival in the US over the last decade has exacerbated nativist fears and helped power Donald Trump first to the presidency in 2016 and then back to the White House in 2024. Many of them were driven north as climate change and deforestation affected agriculture and caused the collapse of local farms and economies; some of that destabilizing deforestation, in places like Guatemala, came after the military burned highland regions to remove the remote sanctuaries of rebel groups. As Jonathan Blitzer outlines in his award-winning study of Latin American immigration and the US, Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here, after El Salvador's civil war in the 1980s—a war Reagan once called “the front line of the battle that is really aimed … at us,” more than a quarter of that country's population ended up living as refugees in the United States.

Which brings us to:

Back in November, in the midst of a fall campaign by the US military to conduct lethal strikes on what it described as drug-smuggling boats—strikes that ultimately killed more than 100 people and were by almost any international standard illegal—I interviewed Ambassador John Bolton at the Texas Tribune Festival. Bolton, the hawkish neoconservative who was Trump's longest-serving White House national security adviser during his first term, had advocated for regime change in Venezuela for years and worked in the first term to support opposition efforts to overthrow Maduro. He told me, “I think that our failure to overthrow Maduro in the first term was our greatest failure.” (Some of those efforts were stunningly ham-handed, as a WIRED investigation by Zach Dorfman later uncovered.)

But Bolton said he nonetheless has been puzzled by how poorly Trump laid the groundwork over recent months for operations against Maduro. The boat strikes came with no effort to build support with Congress or even develop deep partnerships with the Venezuelan opposition. (Indeed, over the weekend Trump casually dismissed the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who beat Trump out this fall for the Nobel Peace Prize—and, according to The Washington Post, may have been sidelined precisely because of that.) “There's just no comprehension, I think, of what it takes to replace the Maduro regime,” Bolton said.

The problem, Bolton explained, is that Donald Trump doesn't think past the next step. The veteran Washington operator—who was a key architect of the Iraq War—explained that the hardest thing for him to wrap his head around when he began working in the White House was that Donald Trump has no set worldview nor policy positions in the traditional sense. Everything was transactional and ephemeral.

“He doesn't do grand strategy,” Bolton told me. “It is very hard for people to understand. It was very hard for me to understand, because you think in government that's what it's about—policy is what you do. That's not what Donald Trump does. Therefore, when people talk about a Trump doctrine in international affairs, it's a complete fantasy to think that there's any coherence to it at all. It's all through the prism of what benefits Donald Trump … He wanted to do what he wanted to do.”

Trump views everything as how he must win the next news cycle and rarely thinks beyond that. The fact that there doesn't appear to be any plan for what happens today, this week, and next month in Venezuela isn't an accident—that lack of the plan is a feature of Trump's governing style, not a bug. Which brings us to:

There's a theory among some pundits that Donald Trump's brain is stuck in the 1980s and early '90s—that his formative years as a real estate tycoon in New York in the go-go Reagan years calcified his worldview, his politics, his icons (like when he cites Lee Iacocca as a god of business), his definition of success (gilded gold everywhere), and his policies (pro-tariffs). Even his “Make America Great Again” slogan was originally used by Ronald Reagan.

Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States.

That stuck-in-'80s worldview is why Donald Trump's operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and topple his government makes more sense if you think of it less as a 21st-century conflict and more as a retro, nostalgic effort—the last war of the 20th century.

We know what the wars of the future look like: In Ukraine, drones are revolutionizing the battlefield, and the US military is attempting to retool to fight nimbly in the Pacific, if China ever decides to invade Taiwan. The Venezuelan operation, codenamed Absolute Resolve and which killed scores of people on the ground in Venezuela, has drawn immediate comparisons to the US invasion of Panama in 1989, Operation Just Cause, which captured dictator Manuel Noriega. Noriega—who had been backed by the CIA before the US turned on him—was, like Maduro, brought to stand trial in the US, where his detention and prosecution were led by Robert Mueller and Bill Barr, then top leaders of George H. W. Bush's Justice Department.

US troops patrol Panama City during 1989's Operation Just Cause, which concluded with the surrender of Manuel Noriega.

But the world has changed—and Donald Trump doesn't seem to have thought through the next steps, leading to a deep irony: The US went to war for oil that it's not clear anyone really wants. Trump, with his 1980s mindset, continues to embrace gas-guzzling engines, throws bromides toward the coal industry, and u-turns US government policy away from supporting solar energy, while the rest of the world is moving rapidly away from needing fossil fuels at all. Renewable energy has been growing at nearly 30 percent annually in recent years, and in the first half of 2025, actually produced more energy than coal worldwide for the first time. China is adopting renewables rapidly—it added in 2025 roughly more solar and wind capacity, about 360 gigawatts, than the US has in total—such that it's on track actually to cut its carbon emissions, even as its growth continues. Energy costs worldwide are dropping so quickly that Australia announced in November that everyone will get three free hours of electricity every day starting this year.

Invading a country for its oil at the start of 2026 may one day seem as anachronistic as the US push in the 1800s to secure dozens of tiny islands rich with bird guano, a key ingredient for early agricultural fertilizers—and yet history teaches us that the world turns and empires rise and fall on what modern gamers would call “side quests.” After all, as Daniel Immerwahr outlines in his book How to Hide an Empire, the push to claim guano-crusted rocks around the world laid the legal groundwork for the first time for the United States to expand globally beyond the North American continent. Within a few years, we were invading Latin America on the regular.

In Trump's short-term-is-everything thinking, winning access to oil today still screams profit. One thing that should really worry Americans—and people around the world—is that Trump in his second term has been quite blunt about what he wants. After a first term where many pundits hand-waved about taking Trump “seriously but not literally,” a key point of his second term has been that Washington and the global community need to take him seriously and literally. In that sense, the fact that the podcaster wife of Trump's key aide Stephen Miller posted on X a photo of Greenland bedecked in red, white, and blue should be seen as less a joke and more a DEFCON 1 alert for Europe.

This $7,200,000 check from the United States to USSR is for the purchase of Alaska on March 30, 1867.

Greenland and Venezuela, after all, share at least one troubling commonality: They possess stores of natural riches that the oligarchs around Trump want to access and profit from. It's been centuries—since Andrew Johnson's purchase of Alaska, really—since any US president has looked north for conquest. But Trump's appetite is clearly larger—and won't be satiated by merely repeating the foreign policy follies of his 20th-century predecessors.

Indeed, for an administration that is building its defining legacy around upsetting the world order for the short-term opportunity to enrich an inner circle of family, cronies, and hangers-on—what WIRED called last summer the “the enshittification of American power”—Venezuela's oil and Greenland's rare earths look more the same than different. And the oil companies and tech broligarchs coveting them probably have more in common with the 20th century's United Fruit Company and sugar barons than they think.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Margaret Atwood on Doomscrolling: ‘I Want to Keep Up With the Latest Doom'","https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-margaret-atwood/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

Margaret Atwood has spent most of her 86 years writing prolifically across subjects and genres, from speculative fiction to poetry to children's books—often plumbing the depths of her own relationships and experiences to do so. But it's only now that the celebrated writer is putting her own life to paper. In her recently published memoir, Book of Lives, Atwood chronicles everything from her youth in the Canadian wilderness, to her early professional years toiling in relative obscurity, to the various grudges and score settling she's finally able to undertake freely—since the people involved, she notes, are now largely dead.

Of course, Atwood long ago ascended from being defined merely as a writer. She has become, particularly since her dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale experienced a timely resurgence during the first Trump administration, something of a sociocultural and political expert, asked to opine on everything from dictatorships to reproductive rights to social media. Her takes, it must be said, are often very smart and very good. They're also, as I learned during a lengthy and expansive conversation with Atwood for The Big Interview podcast, still decidedly reassuring: In a 2023 interview with WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs, Atwood said that she was still optimistic about the United States. Despite everything that's happened thus far during Trump 2.0, she tells me her stance hasn't changed.

As a Canadian myself, the child of a writer, and someone who doesn't believe in god, interviewing Margaret Atwood is probably as close as I'll get to having a truly religious experience. Atwood was sharp, hilarious, and generous with her time—even leaving her landline phone off the hook when it wouldn't stop ringing—as we talked about the merits of jumping from gig to gig, the ins and outs of political resistance, doomscrolling, and much, much more. Here's our conversation.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Margaret Atwood, welcome to The Big Interview.

MARGARET ATWOOD: Thank you very much.

Thank you for being here. Now, we always start these conversations with some very quick questions, like a warm-up for your brain. Are you ready?

I'm always ready.

Typewriter or computer?

Right now, computer.

Spiritually though.

Spiritually, typewriter.

Pierre Trudeau or Justin Trudeau?

Oh, whoa. Woo. What a question. That is very loaded. Do I get a choice of neither?

Yes. Neither is an option.

OK.

You elect neither?

Unfortunately, I cannot elect “neither” because nobody's called that. But I don't belong to a political party and I usually vote on the basis of what the person is likely to do.

Fair enough. What is the best and worst part of literary fame?

The best part of literary fame is you don't have to work for a university and you can't get fired.

Love that.

The worst part is selfies.

Are you often asked for selfies?

In very odd places, such as the ladies' washroom. Do I allow selfies? We're not gonna go there because then I'll get just so many more requests for them.

OK. If Gilead took over Canada, which province would rebel first?

Quebec?

I thought you would say Quebec or Alberta.

Yeah, either one. I mean, you can have both if you want. I don't know about Alberta. They've had some pretty, um, Gilead signs recently.

You're not wrong. For those unfamiliar with Albertan politics, I would describe it as the most Texas of the provinces.

But not very Texas. I think it's another one of those places that's very divided between rural and urban.

That makes sense. If you could live for one year inside any book, which book would you live inside?

Do we want peace and quiet or excitement?

Well, that's up to you, but excitement.

Well, and you have to say whether you'd be the maid, whether you'd be the central character. It's pretty specific. It's like a past life. People who think they've had past lives, they're never a ditch digger. They're always Cleopatra. So any book that I would like to live inside, well now, what a question … For peace and quiet, Anne of Green Gables.

Well, that sounds lovely. I think we can do that.

Yes, it's before World War I, no bad things had happened. No bad 20th-century things had happened yet.

What is a misconception about you that you secretly enjoy?

I think I would offer up the rumor that was going around in about 1960, 1970, that I dressed up in pre-revolutionary French court dress, including the wig, and prowled the streets of Toronto at night in this getup.

Why would you be doing that?

I don't know, nor do I know where this rumor came from, but it was a rumor.

That's a really good one.

The only thing I can suspect is that the rumor was supposing I'd been alive since 1780, and was still wearing the same outfit while looking for my prey.

Name something humans will still be arguing about in a hundred years.

Gender.

I like that. Now, let's go back to the beginning because we are, of course, here on the occasion of you publishing a book all about your 86 years on earth, which I just finished reading over the weekend. It was a remarkable book. You wrote your first story at 6 years old. You say there wasn't much else to do in the Canadian wilderness. I, as a Canadian, am inclined to agree …

No, only when it's raining. You have to put “when it's raining.” When it's not raining, there's lots of other things to do.

Fair. I think what was particularly interesting to me, and what I didn't know about your history, was that you spent very large portions of your childhood in a very remote part outside of Ottawa …

Much further north than that. So up north in the Canadian boreal forest, either up the Ottawa River on the Quebec side or over in Sault Saint Marie, which is, as you know, at the eastern end of Lake Superior. What was I doing there? My dad was a forest entomologist, and those were the months, after the ice went out, until after it froze, until it was freezing up, that's when insects are active and can be studied. Then in the winters we would be in a city where he would write up his research.

So you are spending months and months at a time in the wilderness. How did that shape you as an adult?

Be prepared to improvise 'cause things break, right? You can't call the repair person 'cause you don't have a phone. There isn't one. So be prepared to improvise. Never throw out a bendy piece of wire. You will need one. Just saying. If you wanna get lost in the woods, come with me.

My dad, in addition to being a scientist, was also what I call one of the old bushy guys. So one of the old woodsman-type of people that used to be fairly common in Canada, but probably aren't anymore.

I mean, you see them on the streets of Toronto. They have big beards and flannel shirts, but they're cosplaying …

Uh, those are not …

No, I know. They're called hipsters now. The other piece that surprised me, although it shouldn't have been surprising, was how many years, decades, you spent in what sounded like relative financial precarity. You don't just fast-forward to having written dozens and dozens of books.

No, not at all. No writer does.

So you got a job at a marketing research firm. After leaving Harvard, you jumped from gig to gig. You were a lecturer, a teacher, a writer in residence, while you were publishing these early books. Lots of people, I think now more than ever, jump from gig to gig. That's the economy that we live in. Would you rather have hunkered down writing books or was there real value for you, in hindsight, in moving from role to role to role?

I think it's very valuable, particularly if you're writing novels, to have some kind of experience of how people actually live when they're not at quote, “creative writing school,” which didn't exist when I was doing those things.

I did have a poet, an older known female poet, say to me very early on, in about 1961, “If you want to be a writer, you have to drive a truck.”

Good luck with that as a woman.

Yeah, good luck with that as a short female in the 1960s. It wasn't possible, but translating that into other things, like other types of jobs, I think that's right.

When did you realize, or was it a realization at all, that your own life and those experiences, and the people you met and your parents and so on and so forth, would be a source of storytelling and characters and inspiration? Did that happen organically?

I think organically, for sure. My parents were both big storytellers. My mother told a lot of stories about her family, which was extended and eccentric and from Nova Scotia. It was the norm in those days to have an extended eccentric family if you were from Nova Scotia. She had lots of stories about her youth, which took place before motor cars and television or any of those things, and were pretty interesting and funny. My dad was funny, too, but his stories were about other things. They were usually about horrifying adventures he'd had in the backwoods.

I don't think it was so much about the material that they were telling as the fact that they were telling it. Stories don't have to be about dwarves and Cinderellas, they can be about people you've known.

I noticed in the book that you refer to your dreams more than once. There are a few very moving passages about your parents dying in particular. It is a very poorly understood field. Scientists don't know why we dream. It is a great medical mystery. How do you think about dreams and dreaming, and what is their significance to you?

It is a universally shared human characteristic. And we suspect it also happens among dogs.

I have two dogs and they definitely dream. They're moving. They're making little yipping noises. It's wild.

It's an interesting area, and lots of cultures have been very attentive to their dreams. But in general, and you know this yourself, you have dreams that are just kind of taking out the trash and little bits of this and that, and other ones that appear to you to be quite significant.

So why do those ones appear to be quite significant? Because they connect with something that's going on in your life. If you have a problem, let's say it's a creative problem, let's say it's a scientific problem, and you go to sleep, you often have the answer when you wake up because your brain has been working away at it.

So going to sleep or going for a walk are often helpful when you're waiting for answers to come out of left field.

Do you write your dreams down?

I have done, I've written some of them down, and people have said also that if you keep a dream journal, you're likely to remember them better in the morning.

I noticed that you recalled one dream in the book from when you were 13, a nightmare that you had. I thought to myself, “She either wrote that down or she has a really frighteningly good long-term memory.”

I have a frighteningly good long-term memory. Sorry.

I'm very impressed.

My brother said after reading my memoir—he's a man of very few words—he said, “You seem to have an unusually detailed memory.”

I mean, he's correct. I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning.

Well, that's different. I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning, but you remember things of significance, not just what you did yesterday morning. Not what you had for breakfast. It's things that stand out. So catastrophes, things that are very funny, stupid things you did.

You have had a remarkable career, and in many respects, an unlikely one. As we've talked about already, it's not easy to make even a basic living as a writer. Do you think you would make it as a writer if you were in your twenties today instead of 60 years ago? What would be different today?

Well, a lot of things would be different, but it's a meaningless question because I would be quite a different person at 20. Then I remind you that pantyhose had not even been invented when I was 20. It was the dark ages.

But when you look at young writers …

First of all, in Canada anyway, when I was 20, there was not very much competition. Because only a lunatic would've chosen to be a writer. There were a lot of lunatics in the bohemian underground writing community at that time.

These were not the most able of people. I was quite abnormal amongst them. I wasn't an alcoholic. I wasn't a drug addict, and I didn't want to commit suicide. So what business have you got being a writer? So now it's been more professionalized, I think, through lots of advice, seminars, and creative writing schools and people saying, “Here's what you have to do and this is how it works.” We didn't have a clue. Not one single clue. I didn't know what an agent was. I had no idea what should be in a book contract or any of those things.

So, it's more professionalized and more respectable. So more people think they're gonna go into it, right? They get a certain amount of flim-flam shoved their way. You know, you're gonna write a first novel and you're gonna get a six-figure advance and then you'll be famous. And that doesn't happen very often.

Or, let's put it another way. We were in Ireland at a bed and breakfast and we had a very good breakfast and we said to the man, “This is a really good breakfast.” He said, “I used to be a chef.” And we said, “Oh, where were you a chef?” He named the restaurant. And we said, “Oh, what a coincidence. We had dinner there last night.” Pause. “How was the dinner?” We said, “Well, we thought it was pretty good.” Pause. “Anyone can cook a good dinner once.”

You have a hit with a book. Now do it again. Then do it again, and do it again.

Exceedingly unlikely.

It happens, but not to everybody who decides to do that. Whereas with a lawyer, you're usually bound to get some kind of a job.

Yes, as my dad reminded me many times.

It's very risky. It's gambling. There's a lot of luck involved, and also a lot of persistence because you have to keep doing it.

There's only four ways of surviving as an artist: Have money or marry money. People have done that. Have a patron, and that includes the Pope, the Canada Council, and everything in between. Have a job that is not related to writing, a job in the other world. Like T.S. Eliot worked in a bank. Or go to the market. So that means selling your books and living off the proceeds. Very few writers can do that in North America.

Did you ever seriously contemplate moving to the United States earlier in your career?

When I was at Harvard, it was quite tempting. Not that I would get hired by Harvard because Harvard didn't hire women in the English department at that time, but I got a letter from the Canadian government and it said, “We certainly hope you'll come back to Canada because we really need you.”

Oh wow. That's a nice letter to get.

I think so. I wonder how many people get letters like that now.

You're the first I've ever heard of.

So situated generationally, born in 1939, wartime baby, low birth rate, following the Depression, low birth rate, followed by the post-war baby boom. People could see this wave of babies washing towards them and they knew they didn't have enough people to fill the jobs to service those babies. So people of my generation were in demand.

It wasn't a question of whether we would have a job, it was a question of what kind of job we would have.

So did the letter do it?

Certainly inclined me in that direction, plus the fact that my student visa was gonna run out.

I ask because for me growing up in Canada, the prevailing wisdom was, Well, if you wanna go big, you go to the United States.

That was the prevailing opinion. And people did say that to me, but they said, “If you want to be a writer, you need to leave.”

I want to ask you about The Handmaid's Tale. Your name at this point is practically synonymous with prescient, whether you like that or not. One aspect I'm curious about, though, is technology in the book. Technology was not a key part of it, right? The Eyes are actual human beings. People are punished in these antiquated ways. There is no mass surveillance apparatus the way there is in the United States today. Even in 1985 when you were writing it, certainly there was a degree of government surveillance …

Yeah, but you'd have to get into somebody's apartment and rig them up, and bug it.

Sure. You would've had to bug it.

Yes, there were those things, but there were no cell phones. There was no internet. I think it segues OK today because those women would not be allowed access to those things anyway. As for a dark car driving by, you don't know what's in it. You know that you're being surveilled, but you don't know how.

Was that a concerted decision in writing the book, or was it simply a matter of writing in a way that reflected your context?

We had credit cards, and that certainly makes it into the book because what better way to make women go back into the home than cut off their jobs and credit cards? Which is what's happening now in the United States. There's actually a movement afoot to make it impossible for women to have credit cards in their own names. That law was not changed until 1974.

Obviously the piece around reproductive rights and reproductive freedom is incredibly salient today and has been, unfortunately, for several years. When you were writing the book in the eighties, did you sense a backlash to a woman's right to choose? Was that a conversation that you were aware was happening?

I think there is a backlash against women's rights in general, beginning with the election of Ronald Reagan and the rise of the so-called religious right as a political force in the United States. And I did keep a scrapbook of what people were saying. Newspaper clippings. Remember them? No, you don't.

I was born in ‘86, so …

Yeah, just at the edge of newspaper clippings. So they were saying that women belong in the home and they were certainly pushing back against a woman's right to choose. The ‘70s had been pretty game-changing for women in North America. So there was a reaction to that in the ‘80s. That's one of the reasons I wrote the book, because what people say they would like to do if they got power, because I think they will actually do it.

Right.

Some people say, “It's just words. They don't really mean it.” I always think they do mean it. Then I think, how would you go about it on a practical level? So here's all these women running around like gerbils having credit cards and jobs and money and apartments of their own. How would you get them back into a male-dominated, controlled space?

Well, you wrote a bit of a playbook.

But it's not new. It's not my playbook. It's what people have done over time.

Sure. What was so interesting to us, among other things that WIRED is covering in this most recent federal election, was that the playbook had been written.

Oh yeah.

It was out there. You could go see what they were going to do.

Yep.

He just says these crazy things. They would never actually … It's like, no, no. Take it literally, it's right here. You can read what they're gonna do.

Yes. So the other thing was, I believe in the Bible, literally. I guess they've never read it.

Right?

Which part of it do you believe literally? Are we going to follow the lifestyles of some of the people in it, because they're pretty severe and weird. So, in The Handmaid's Tale, the Handmaids are in the Rachel and Leah story in the Bible. That's why I put that quote at the front.

I'm curious about your take on the saga of the lonely young man. I ask because it feels like, at least to me, and I think to a lot of us sitting here, the con there is so much concern and conversation around young men online. It has, I think, eclipsed so many conversations around gender recently. It feels like women are increasingly excluded from those conversations. We're spending a lot of time wondering what to do about the plight of the man when there's a lot that we could be talking about on both sides. I'm wondering what you make of that, or where you think that comes from.

It's real.

Well, it is real. Sure.

But you're wondering why people are talking about it. Well, they didn't for quite a long time. In fact, they pretty much ignored it. You could see where it was going because here came all of these young men who were told they were bad and nobody wanted to listen to them anymore. It was no longer the days of going steady in the ‘50s. That shows up in statistics, how many women are succeeding at university and how many men are dropping out. Because obviously they don't feel welcome. They feel directionless. They don't know why they're doing all of this. They don't get a lot of, “Hey, you're great.” They get a lot of “shut up” and “we don't wanna hear your opinions.”

So, they congregate in bunches and worship Jordan Peterson because they feel, as young folks say now, they feel seen.

It's a crisis. There used to be organizations that they joined. They joined ROTC; they joined the military in the summers. They joined the Boy Scouts before it got such a bad rep. There was some direction for that sort of energy. But what's filling that now? What can a male young person do to feel valued by society and not like a total failure?

Well, yes, they can participate in Jordan Peterson discussion groups.

But that's not a very stable platform.

But if society is not taking the voices of young men seriously and we are increasingly suppressing the voices and the success of women, I would argue…

Yes.

Whose voices do you think are being taken seriously?

Exactly. Well, I think you're probably better placed to answer that question than I am. But every time Elon Musk opens his mouth, people take that seriously. So I would say tech bro billionaires are taken seriously. Who else? I don't know. Are we gonna count, quote, “influencers”? I think a lot of podcasters have pretty devoted followings. But again, it's very fractured.

I think you just nailed it, though, and I'm actually working through this while we talk. Everyone takes someone's voice seriously. But it is a fractured ecosystem. So we are all looking to a different source of truth.

Yeah, that's true. And that happened at the end of the 19th century with the literary community, which had been pretty monolithic in the middle of that century. By the end of it, it was pretty divided up. So I think anytime you introduce a new communications technology, you're gonna get a lot of disruption. Let me just mention the Gutenberg press followed by 300 years of sectarian religious warfare.

When WIRED's Kate Knibbs interviewed you a few years ago, you said “I am not counting the United States out.”

No, and I'm still not.

You know, everybody wants a little bit of hope.

Well, first of all, Canadians shouldn't be mad at Americans.

Well, you tell that to my dad's wife.

All Americans didn't do this.

Well, she's not mad at me. There are just many people in my life in Canada who don't want to come to the United States anymore.

They're scared.

Yeah. It's hard.

Yeah, especially with this new thing that you have to bring five years of social media information…

Disqualifying for many, many people.

So yeah, they're scared, they're apprehensive, and they don't want to take the chance. That's not the same as being mad at all American people, which is just stupid.

Of course. I have actually been surprised in the last year at how little resistance, relatively speaking, we are seeing in the United States. You know, employees at the big tech companies that we cover at WIRED, they have essentially been silenced.

They don't wanna be fired.

They don't wanna be fired. The executives running those companies are having fancy palace dinners with the president of the United States. Everyday Americans are protesting here and there. We've seen some really substantial protests at times, but what would a revolutionary moment in this country look like?

First of all, the resistance is visible in the polls, which I'm sure you're tracking.

Yeah. Of course.

They've been going down, down, down, down, down. So if you're afraid of getting fired and don't want the death threats and all the rest of it because you spoke out in public, you can express your opinion at the ballot box and in an anonymous poll. We are seeing that, we are seeing all those Democrats that got elected, and we're seeing the polls going down. So, it's there. But again, you have to understand that ordinary people are not billionaires and they have jobs.

A truly revolutionary moment would be like the French Revolution over a span of two or three years, which started out, as all these things do, they all start out as utopian visions. Things are gonna be so much better if only we … fill in the blank. Then you end up with Stalin. So, I'm not sure you really want that kind of revolution, which usually says tear it all down. So I'm not sure that you really want the terror.

No, I don't. For my family, for myself, what I want is for people to show up at the midterms and then show up in 2028 and for there to be a peaceful transition of power.

Well, I think that's quite likely to happen right now, as to the midterms, because the economic policies that we have been seeing have not been successful.

Surprise, surprise.

That's where it hits people: in the pocket book. If you look at revolutions through the ages, they usually start by being about money.

Yeah.

And in unequal distributions of power and wealth. I've thought for a little while that things were getting way too top heavy in that country and dangerously close to 1792.

Well, one challenge here is that the midterms don't solve for the grotesque wealth disparities that we now see in the United States.

No, they don't, but they may at least not increase them.

I want to ask you, speaking of power, and the consolidation of power in Big Tech, about artificial intelligence. That is a subject about which I know very little, except that it's a crap poet and a pretty bad imitator of me.

You've written about this. You wrote for The Atlantic, “What concerns me is the idea that an author's voice and mind are replicable.” I mean, that is one of many concerns about artificial intelligence. When you read about this, when you read about AI art or AI in writing, where do you sit on the notion that AI can be a useful and productive tool in the creation of works of art?

It's like absolutely every other human tool that we have ever come up with, including fire and language. So it has good news, it has bad news. It's got stupid consequences that nobody was thinking about and they're all like that. Name one, and that is what you will see.

Do you use it?

For what?

Anything—brainstorming, managing your calendar?

No, probably because I don't know how.

Do you give a shit about learning at this point?

I don't know. I mean, the thing is, anytime you sign on to any of those things, they're getting a lot of data on you.

They sure are.

They're gonna bombard you with crap. So my problem at the moment is not adding another one is getting rid of some of the ones that I have. You may have noticed that if you unsubscribe, it has no effect.

How much time do you spend online? What is your relationship to the internet? People like me spend, you know, most of our waking hours online.

Do you?

I mean, yeah.

What do you do for fun?

What do I do?

Yeah.

I run, I hang out with my daughter. I read. I cook.

OK. So you're not spending all of your life online?

Well, my job exists on the internet. My phone, I'm holding it up right now, is tethered to my body.

Well, I'm not different in that respect. I also use my phone to keep in touch with people, usually with text messages. I do a lot of doomscrolling.

You're a doomscroller.

I want to keep up with the latest doom.

You gotta, if you wanna sleep at night, you better be doomscrolling. That's what I say.

Do you?

No, I mean, I'm kidding. It's awful. My husband will be up till two in the morning looking at horrible headlines.

What you should tell him is “go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, it will be the same.” You don't have to do it at night.

So when do you doomscroll?

At night.

When I was rereading this interview you did in 2023 with WIRED you talked about a technology that you actually invented yourself.

I'm putting quote marks around “invented,” because it's quite a stupid story.

I would love to hear the story.

So the story is this: Back in the early 2000s, I was looking at the publishing sector and I was seeing a couple of things. One was that publishers only ever sent authors on tours to cities that reported to the New York Times lists. So that meant that a lot of cities were being excluded. They just never got any author visits, and a lot of authors were being excluded because their publishers were making the determination that it wasn't worth their investment to send them to these other cities.

So a lot of people just weren't being given tools for promoting their own books. So what we invented at first was supposed to be a service to the book business. What it was, and here's when I put quotation marks around it, I thought that the FedEx person who was coming with the package that you signed for, I thought the signature was flying through the air and turning into ink somewhere else, but it wasn't. So I said “Oh goody, we can sign books with this.” Actually no, you can't. So I asked some of my more tech-savvy, and I have to say younger, friends. And they took a look and there wasn't anything like that. The closest thing was long-distance surgery.

So nobody had invented anything that could scribble and you wouldn't wanna scribble on a body with a knife anyway, I don't think.

Most of us would not, no.

Not in a positive way.

No.

So we set about inventing this thing. It was going to be a remote book-signing technology. This is before any of the stuff that we currently use for it existed. So we were putting together bits that did exist, like video cams, and there was only one signing tablet that you could get at that time. We were sticking them all together. Then we needed to make something that would accommodate a book on the other end.

It had to have a lift, because books have a thickness; it had to be able to move up and down. The idea was that people could give interviews in remote places and then sign the person's book. We did invent it. It took some bizarre twists and turns along the way. I think one of our models involved something that looked like an LP disc with a little pen in the bottom. It was very accurate and it was very fast, but it was too fast. So it broke off and flew across the room.

Oh no.

Not cutting off anybody's head, but it might have. So with all of these things, you have to have something that's accurate that can be made inexpensive enough so people can actually use it. And is attractive enough some people will wish to use it and that they can see a use for it. Well, the book business didn't really grasp the beauty of the concept. But I said to one of my board members, “Frank, what else do you think this might be good for?” And he said, “Everything.”

You can go onto the internet and look up Syngrafii, or you can look up iinked and you can see that we are now in the super secure absolutely accurate, long distance, digital and ink signature business.

Are you still actively in that business?

Yes.

It's a great side hustle.

It's what?

It's a great side hustle.

It's a very interesting side hustle because we've seen it evolve over the years. The interesting thing is, because book collectors when we were first doing it were so extremely picky about it being absolutely accurate, one of them said, “I want the skin flakes on the paper.”

They weren't gonna accept signatures that weren't the real person's signature. So what we invented is something that will replicate any marks you make, and you can now do it on your phone. There weren't any phones when we started. You can do it on your computer screen. And our physical version that we started with, that we thought would become obsolete, it's now having an increased demand because people are becoming more distrustful of digital. It's so hackable.

The analog revolution.

Well, there is that. Some of that is happening.

Yeah, for sure.

Talking to young people, they're into vinyl LPs and things like that. These new phones that you can't do anything smart on. It's just a phone.

I am all for it.

How revolutionary, “Hey, this is a phone that doesn't do anything. I'm getting one!”

I know we only have a few minutes left, and I want to ask you about the book. I don't want to give anything away, but I finished it, and—I'm gonna be very honest with you here—I left wondering whether you would ever publish anything again. I also ended the book feeling like you are, if I may say this, thinking about your own death.

Oh, I think about my own death all the time, don't you?

I do, but it reads as maybe more imminent than how I think about death.

No. It's not imminent.

Well, no, let's not plan on that.

[But] not in the far distant future.

Do you plan to keep writing?

You don't plan to keep writing.

You just do.

You keep writing and then you can make plans about that. But you actually don't control whether any of your fantastically brilliant ideas is going to turn into a book. You have to discover that through the process of doing it.

Do you think about your legacy, about how you're remembered and talked about? Do you care?

I don't care.

You don't care at all.

No, because I'm not gonna be here. Also, looking at the lives of writers, usually they die, then there's a little flurry of interest in their work, then they go down, and then there might be a revival, but it usually follows the same trajectory. And it is generational, so you know “Oh, my mom read that. Ick.”

So it usually does that thing of going down and then if you're lucky it comes up again. But it's not gonna be your luck, it's gonna be your estate's luck.

To me, I think something I've always appreciated about writing and about books is there is a permanence to that. Maybe a more fleeting permanence than I'm willing to admit, or want to admit.

More chancey, a chance-ier permanence.

Yeah. By which you mean maybe it sticks …

By which I mean there were a lot more Greek classical plays than we have, and we know about them, they existed, but we don't have any copies anymore.

So ultimately it's too much to worry about, and what do we care when we're dead?

What would I do about it? I can't control the future, contrary to popular opinion. So it's one of those things of why worry because you can't do anything about it anyway.

This brings me to the perfect place to end, which is with this short game I'm gonna force you to play.

You think you're gonna force me to do something?

I'm gonna try. The short game I'm going to politely request you to play is called Control, Alt, Delete. So, what piece of technology would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change? And what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the earth if given the opportunity?

Oh, that's interesting. So the first one is, what one would I like to be able to control?

Yeah.

Do I get atomic bombs?

Yes.

OK, I'll choose that. Well, I would do nothing with them, but I would be in control of that nothing. I would be in control of whether anything got done with them or not. So if they're all under my control, the world would be safe from them.

OK. What would you alter? What would you wanna change?

What would I want to change? OK. I think I would like to change the very nasty turn that social media took after that initial period when it was fun. Because it was fun at first.

It was.

And now it's not so much fun.

Nope.

So I think parts of it are still fun, but you have to really limit what you're accessing, because the rest of it is not fun at all.

What was the third part?

Delete.

What would I delete? Do I get a large swath of it?

Yes. Go big or go home.

That's so tempting. It's so tempting and it's so beset with traps: There was a golden age and we could go back to that if only we got rid of name-your-thing-to-get-rid-of. So, I'd really probably have to think about that. But let's say we should start with the problems besetting humanity and dial back from there. How about that?

A methodical strategic approach.

So then it would be the automobile.

Wow. OK.

Because we have a problem with oil addiction, as you know.

Yes.

We also have a problem with urban expansion beyond the ability to make those bases interesting, vibrant, and safe. What allows those spaces to be so big is rapid transportation.

Cars.

So, I might do that. I might go back as far as choo-choo trains.

I like this.

But then we would be stuck with a lot of horses and then we have a horse poop problem. How would this work?

Yeah. You don't get to choose.

Well, it probably takes us into the age of steampunk to a certain extent. You know, dial it back and see if it turns out a bit differently.

An invite-only AMD fireside chat for industry analysts last month had a refreshing vibe, signaling a company that no longer thinks in product silos. It framed AMD as a three-pillar business spanning data center, end-user products, and embedded.

That matters because AI is no longer a single market; it is a stack and a deployment pattern. The most interesting line in the discussion may have been the simplest framing of where AI lives across that stack: cloud is for scale, edge is for immediacy, devices for intimacy.

That is a creative way to describe how AMD has evolved over the past several years, and certainly in 2025, into a company that can credibly sell compute from training clusters to inference at the edge to on-device AI PCs.

In the late 1990s and much of the 2000s, AMD often looked poised to invent great products, only to struggle with execution at the pace and consistency the market demanded. There were persistent execution gaps, missed windows, and uneven platform follow-through — just ask Compaq or Dell during that era. The market's skepticism was palpable, as I can attest firsthand, having worked at Compaq and Dell during AMD's dark days.

Today, the tone is different. Not because the competition eased, but because AMD's culture since the arrival of CEO Lisa Su has been far more disciplined in roadmaps, partnerships, and sustained delivery.

One reason the conversation landed is that AMD is openly describing the “how,” not just the “what.”

AMD SVP and GM of Adaptive and Embedded Computing, Salil Raje, put it plainly: AMD “was not traditionally a software company,” but has “turned our attention to software” with ROCm and an explicit push to be “more open source friendly” so the developer community can work with it at scale.

That represents a subtle but massive shift from the old AMD. The old playbook leaned on a sound chip and hoped the ecosystem would follow. AI has taught the entire industry that the ecosystem must be engineered, funded, and obsessively supported. AMD is now talking like a company that understands that rule.

During the call, Raje said AMD was trying to make ROCm feel less like a data center-only toolkit and more like a unifying layer across its portfolio.

In one section on local AI workflows, the speaker describes ROCm as a “unified stack” that is “primarily composed of open-source software,” spanning “low-level kernels to high-level end user applications,” and intended to accelerate workloads “seamlessly between our cloud infrastructure, data center, and personal devices.”

That is the right ambition. It is also where AMD still has something to prove. Nvidia has years of developer muscle memory behind CUDA. AMD has real momentum, but the market will ultimately judge ROCm on the last-mile details: installation friction, framework parity, model zoo maturity — the breadth, quality, and production readiness of supported models — performance stability, and the speed of fixes when something breaks.



AMD highlights recent ROCm performance gains and broader platform support, underscoring progress while leaving last-mile execution as the real test.

Still, AMD's 2025 announcements show a company moving from a component vendor to an infrastructure participant, which is what AI data centers demand.

2025 was a transformative year for AMD, particularly in its strategic alliances. Significant partnerships were formed that could shape the future of AI infrastructure, most notably the company's pact with OpenAI and HPE on the Helios rack-scale architecture.

The OpenAI deal is especially notable. AMD and OpenAI entered a multiyear agreement under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt of Instinct MI450 GPUs in the second half of 2026, and will include joint technical work to align roadmaps. On the commercial side, AMD also issued OpenAI a warrant tied to deployment and scaling milestones, which signals both commitment and accountability.

Then there is the cloud scaling narrative, which increasingly reads like “rack scale, not just GPU.” For example, Oracle plans to launch a publicly available AI supercluster powered by 50,000 Instinct MI450 Series GPUs in Q3 2026, using the Helios rack architecture with next-gen EPYC Venice CPUs and Pensando Vulcano networking.

Vultr, which provides affordable, high-performance virtual private servers (VPS) for developers and businesses, plans to build a 50 MW AI supercluster in Ohio, powered by 24,000 Instinct MI355X GPUs, with plans to integrate MI450 and Helios.

Furthermore, AMD expanded its collaboration with HPE around Helios, promising high-bandwidth, low-latency rack-scale connectivity. This is the fundamental shift from a legacy bread-and-butter processor company to an AI data center contender. It is not a single GPU. It is CPU, GPU, networking, systems design, and software.

AMD is also using the embedded story to remind us that AI's next growth wave will not remain confined to hyperscale data centers.

Raje described AMD's ability to go “from cloud to edge to endpoints” and paired it with a major market claim: an AI infrastructure TAM of “about a trillion dollars in 2030,” with expectations to grow that market at an 80% CAGR over the next three to five years. He then pivoted to embedded and physical AI, arguing that the next inflection is “when the AI moves from the cloud to the physical world,” with billions of devices and a $200 billion TAM by 2035.

The embedded group's design-win cadence is presented as evidence of customer trust and long-term visibility, including approximately $16 billion in design wins in 2025.

Whether you accept every number, the strategic point remains sound: the company is trying to be relevant in every layer of AI deployment, not just the glamorous training clusters.

So where do AMD's CES plans fit in this bigger AI progress story?

Though this may come across as less than enthusiastic, AMD's CES announcements appeared to be a continuation of its current playbook rather than a surprise pivot.

ROCm 7.2 arrives this month for Radeon and Ryzen on Windows and Linux, with new support for Ryzen AI 400 processors and integrations like Comfy UI.



AMD's ROCm 7.2 update, announced at CES 2026, reflects continued software execution across Ryzen and Radeon platforms rather than a disruptive platform shift.

In gaming, AMD says it is expanding the Ryzen 9000 X3D portfolio and pushing FSR Redstone across its RX 9000 Series cards, with claims such as “up to 4.7x” performance in a ray tracing example. That will keep AMD highly visible in gaming and reinforce a strength that has been in AMD's DNA for years.

But frankly, these announcements feel largely incremental, reflecting execution against an established roadmap rather than a step-change moment.

Realistically, companies that want that magical “CES moment” that resets the whole industry's expectations typically need either a brand-new platform or a new ecosystem announcement.

What AMD announced at CES is undeniably important and will indeed sell real units. It just does not appear to change the competitive physics overnight. The bigger AMD AI story, the one that could change physics, is happening in the data center partnerships and rack-scale systems that start to land in 2026.

That leads to the balanced outlook I see for 2026.

On the upside, AMD has positioned itself to participate in the next phase of AI infrastructure buildout in a way it could not have a few years ago. The OpenAI deployment begins in the second half of 2026. Oracle targets Q3 2026 for its MI450-powered supercluster. The Humain joint venture targets a first phase planned for 2026 as part of a longer 1 GW roadmap. These are not small experiments. They are system-scale bets.

On the risk side, 2026 is when execution becomes visible, and visibility cuts both ways. The real tests are straightforward:

Still, I'm confronted with this nagging question after taking in what AMD has accomplished in 2025 and as it turns its sights on 2026: Is AMD trying to win AI by building the best single chip, or by creating the most adoptable platform?

Discussions with AMD executives, up and down the company's command chain, suggest the latter. It talks about “AI factories,” rack-scale solutions like Helios, and software that spans cloud to personal devices.

In my view, that is precisely the right lesson from AMD's own history. In the rougher years, AMD often needed a breakout product to compensate for weaker platform gravity. Under Lisa Su's leadership, the company has increasingly built durable systems around its silicon. Its 2025 partnership list reads like a continuation of that strategy.

If 2026 delivers on the first wave of these deployments, AMD will look less like an alternative supplier and more like a structural part of the AI data center market. If it stumbles — which I do not expect — the market will not be patient, because AI customers do not buy on hope. They buy predictable outcomes.

AMD's stellar performance in 2025 suggests it understands that reality. More than any single benchmark chart, that understanding is the clearest sign of how far the company has come — and how decisively it has moved beyond the execution woes of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Dell's CES 2026 product announcements read like a company choosing clarity over experimentation. Jeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman and chief operating officer, set the tone early when he admitted the PC business had drifted, and then put a stake in the ground publicly: “We've got a bit off course in our PC business, and the accumulated impact is we've underperformed getting back to our roots, getting back to the basics.”

That is not just rhetoric. You can see the “going back to basics” theme echoed across three very different product families: Alienware, UltraSharp, and XPS. Dell is widening the top of the funnel in gaming, sharpening its leadership in professional monitors, and restoring a premium laptop identity that customers already understand.

The PC market entering 2026 still feels uneven. Dell has called out a lagging Windows upgrade cycle, slow CPU transitions, and AI expectations that have not fully materialized into consistent demand.

In that context, focus becomes a competitive weapon. Dell is treating consumer and gaming as core, not “nice to have,” and signaling that the proof will come from actual products, not promises.

That matters because CES announcements often drift into the ether. The Dell news feels more like portfolio construction. It is trying to cover more price points, with clearer product intent, and less ambiguity about where “premium” starts and ends.

The headline move is straightforward. Dell is reestablishing the XPS lineup with all-new XPS 14 and XPS 16 systems, and is previewing the return of the XPS 13 later in 2026.

However, the bigger story is branding. Dell has a long history of sterling engineering, thoughtful design, and reliable execution. Its inconsistency has often shown up in naming, segmentation, and how clearly it signals “best” to the market.

Clarke acknowledged that directly with a line that likely drew nods from more than a few longtime observers: “We didn't listen to you. You were right on branding.”



The latest Dell XPS lineup features a thin, minimalist design aimed at modern productivity workflows.

I hypothesize that bringing back XPS is also about recovering margin. Alienware can serve creators and power users, but many premium buyers are not gamers and do not want the aesthetic, even when the hardware fits. Without XPS as a premium anchor, those customers tend to trade down within the Dell lineup or shop another brand that signals premium more clearly. Either way, Dell faces unnecessary pressure on gross margins and forfeits potential ASP lift.

XPS permits Dell to charge for craftsmanship. It also gives premium buyers a simple story they can repeat to themselves in one word.

There is also a nostalgia-and-excitement angle that Dell likely understands well. When XPS launched in the early 2000s, it created genuine buzz and helped redefine what “premium” could mean in the Windows ecosystem. I can say that personally because I was the executive who launched the XPS brand on desktops, and it was a remarkable success that raised overall consumer desktop ASPs and margins.

Dell may be trying to rekindle that same emotional energy at a time when PC demand needs new reasons to accelerate.

Dell's XPS blog almost spells out the reset. The company says it rebuilt the laptops from the ground up, with refined interfaces, optimized performance, and claims of the “best battery life in the industry.”

The design cues reinforce that XPS is meant to stand apart again. For the first time, the XPS logo sits on the front cover, a change fans and reviewers had requested for years. This attribute is a minor detail with big implications. It turns XPS back into a statement rather than just a SKU.

What really signals “going back to basics,” though, is Dell's willingness to revisit usability decisions. Dell is bringing back the traditional function row, adding subtle etching around the active touchpad area, and optimizing key travel and tactile feedback for faster, more accurate typing. These are the kinds of choices that matter every hour you are on the machine.

Dell is also building a premium story that includes longevity. The XPS line now includes easy-to-remove keyboards and modular USB-C ports, designed to simplify repairs and extend device life. In a premium tier, repairability is becoming part of the value proposition, not a footnote.

Under the hood, Dell is leaning into Intel Core Ultra Series 3 and Intel Arc integrated graphics with 12 Xe cores, while claiming meaningful jumps in AI and graphics performance versus the prior generation. It also ties premium mobility to specific engineering decisions, such as thinner designs and lighter weight, with the XPS 14 and XPS 16 measuring 14.6mm thick.

Dell is not ignoring battery life, either. The company is emphasizing battery claims, including up to 27 hours of Netflix streaming and more than 40 hours of local video playback. It also points to smart power management for the LCD option, including a variable refresh rate that can drop to 1Hz for static content and ramp up to 120Hz as needed. That is the practical side of innovation, where XPS has historically won.

Clarke's CES roundup quote pulls this together in a single promise: “XPS is back, better than ever, with a complete redesign that delivers exceptional craftsmanship in our thinnest, lightest form factors yet.”

Alienware is widening its reach, and Dell is being explicit about why. The company plans to effectively double the breadth of its laptop lineup, including two new classes later in 2026: an ultra-slim gaming laptop around 17mm thick, and a new entry-level notebook at significantly lower price points.

That is classic portfolio logic and management. Premium gaming stays premium, but Alienware no longer forces customers into one narrow definition of who the brand is for. It is building an on-ramp and also acknowledging a growing set of hybrid buyers who game, create, and work on a single system.

On the near-term hardware side, Dell is promoting display and silicon bona fides. Alienware is debuting anti-glare OLED displays on the 16 Area 51 and 16X Aurora laptops, and bringing Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors to those systems, along with the Alienware 18 Area 51. On desktop, the Area 51 configuration moves to AMD's Ryzen 9850X3D with 3D V Cache.

Alienware's back-to-basics pivot takes its own form: more choice, clearer segmentation, a premium halo that remains intact, and a broader audience that can now enter the brand without having to justify a flagship purchase.

If XPS is about premium identity and Alienware is about breadth, UltraSharp is about staying the default choice for serious work.

Dell is launching two “world first” UltraSharp monitors: a 52-inch curved 6K IPS Black ultrawide aimed at high-multitasking professionals, and a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor built for color-critical creative work.

The 52-inch model is positioned as a replacement for messy multi-monitor setups, with productivity and comfort as the primary selling points. Dell highlights a 6K resolution at 129 PPI and a 120Hz refresh rate, with an emphasis on eye comfort, including reduced blue light and an ambient light sensor. It also supports up to 4 PCs and includes KVM functionality, allowing users to control multiple systems with a single keyboard and mouse.

Then there is connectivity. Dell relies on a single Thunderbolt 4 cable for up to 140W of power delivery, a setup meant to simplify desks and reduce friction in daily workflows.

The 32-inch 4K QD-OLED model targets a different kind of professional. Dell positions it as a CES Innovation Award honoree and the first commercial DisplayHDR True Black 500 QD-OLED monitor with Anti-Glare Low Reflectance technology. It also emphasizes out-of-the-box accuracy, including a Delta E of less than 1 and 99% DCI-P3 coverage. For creators, Dell highlights built-in calibration and advanced color control features, including an integrated colorimeter and 3D LUT support.



Dell's UltraSharp 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor underscores the company's focus on professional, color-accurate displays for creative and enterprise workflows.

The point here is that Dell is not chasing a fad. It is reinforcing that UltraSharp is still where professionals go when their work depends on what they see.

If you combine the three portfolios, a clear strategy emerges:

Through it all, Dell keeps returning to the same theme. It is “going back to basics.” Not by doing less, but by making the lineup easier to understand, easier to buy, and easier to justify at premium prices.

In a market where PC demand still needs cleaner triggers, that kind of discipline can be the difference between a decent product year and a true turnaround year. Kudos to Dell for self-correcting. I suspect its core customer base and shareholders will be eternally thankful.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Washington State Ferries is taking an initial step toward offering public Wi-Fi service at ferry terminals and aboard vessels.

The agency issued a report in December proposing a limited Wi-Fi pilot at a single terminal — Bremerton — and on a single vessel, the M/V Chimacum.

The effort is driven by state legislation passed last year directing the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to deploy a Wi-Fi pilot within existing resources and report on viability, costs, and potential free or fee-based models.

Washington State Ferries (WSF), which operates under WSDOT, is working through the procurement process for a vendor for the pilot program, according to a spokesperson. The program is limited in scope and any expansion or continuation would be subject to direction from lawmakers, the spokesperson noted. 

The report estimates that the pilot could cost between $100,000 and $150,000, which includes equipment, installation, and minimal vendor support for the pilot period. WSF estimates that expanding public Wi-Fi across terminals and vessels statewide would likely require a multi-million-dollar capital investment, along with ongoing annual operating and maintenance costs in the seven-figure range. 

WSF currently provides no public internet service anywhere in its ferry system. The report references a private-sector attempt to offer Wi-Fi in the late 2000s that ultimately failed due to high infrastructure costs and insufficient revenue. WSF previously partnered with wireless networking company Boingo on a fee-based Wi-Fi service in 2008, but that ended in 2016. 

The new pilot could determine whether modern networking technology and vendor models change that equation. WSF plans to measure how many passengers actually use Wi-Fi, how much bandwidth they consume, service reliability, and what kind of staffing and vendor support is required to keep the system running.

Final costs for a potential broader rollout would depend on factors such as how many terminals and vessels are covered, the level of bandwidth provided, and whether service is free, paid, or a mix of both.

If WSF proceeds as planned, the pilot would move forward in 2026, with installation in the spring, and an operational test period running from May through August, according to the report. WSF would analyze the data in late summer and deliver findings and recommendations in September 2026.

The agency flagged several risks, including cybersecurity requirements, potential strain on staff resources, infrastructure limitations on older vessels and terminals, and the challenge of managing passenger expectations for a temporary test program. Any public Wi-Fi network would need to be fully segmented from ferry operational systems and comply with state IT security and accessibility standards.

Digital Biotechnologies Inc., a new Seattle-based subsidiary of publicly traded immune medicine company Adaptive Biotechnologies, has raised fresh cash as part of an initial closing of a Series A investment round.

The round could total up to $15 million, according to a recent regulatory filing from Adaptive.

Digital Biotechnologies is developing DNA sequencing technology. A spokesperson for Adaptive said the startup is “adjacent” to Adaptive's current strategic focus on immune medicine and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing. 

“We are proud to have supported their journey to date and look forward to seeing their continued progress in the coming years with this new financing in place,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Adaptive will own nearly half of the company when the latest funding round is completed.

Digital Biotechnologies works out of Adaptive's headquarters in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. The spokesperson declined to provide more details about the company's leadership or website.

A recent job posting notes that Digital Biotechnologies is working on a “clinical sequencing instrument.” From the posting: 

Present methods for high-throughput sequencing are not suitable for many clinical applications, as all current NGS platforms lack the combination of high accuracy, rapid turnaround time, and low cost that would lead to robust clinical utility. In collaboration with academic and industry scientists across the country, Digital Biotechnologies is engineering the first solid-state sequencer with the specifications necessary for a widely applicable clinical sequencing instrument.

The startup appears to leverage Adaptive's immune medicine expertise and IP with a dedicated engineering and product organization focused on hardware. 

Jason Bielas, a longtime professor at the University of Washington and leader at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, is a co-founder of Digital Biotechnologies. The company has a handful of other employees, according to LinkedIn. 

Adaptive plans to consolidate the company's financial results in its own earnings reports.

Founded in 2009 by brothers Chad and Harlan Robins, Adaptive develops immune system-related products for diagnosis and monitoring of cancer and other diseases. The company, which spun out of the Fred Hutch, went public in 2019. 

Chad Robins still leads the company as CEO. Harlan Robins is chief scientific officer. Adaptive employs more than 600 people, according to LinkedIn. 

Adaptive's stock is up more than 120% over the past 12 months. Shares spiked more than 50% in November after the company topped third quarter expectations, reporting $94 million in overall revenue, fueled by growth in its MRD business.

Adaptive last month entered into two autoimmune-related agreements with Pfizer, including one focused on rheumatoid arthritis that could be worth up to $890 million.

The company agreed to terminate a deal with Genentech last year. That deal, originally announced in 2019, had $2 billion in potential value.

Meta is pausing its plans to sell its Ray-Ban Display glasses outside the U.S. due to “unprecedented demand and limited supply,” the company said on Tuesday. Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.

“Since launching last fall, we've seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we've decided to pause our planned international expansion.”

Meta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.

Unveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.

At CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.

Meta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.

The magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.

After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.

Key components of Sparc's magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS' co-founder and CEO. “It'll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”

When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It's the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.

To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.

To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia's Omniverse libraries.

That won't be CFS' first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They'll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we'll be constantly comparing them to each other.”

The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.

Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company's first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. 

Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.

Amazon's augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.

Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.

Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn't specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.

And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app's Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.

Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon's Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company's Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren't in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.

Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.

For people who subscribe to Amazon's Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.

The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone. 

As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.

The semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.

These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction.

This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.

Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company's recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.

“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”

AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.

“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”

PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.

The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.

Robot vacuum maker Narwal unveiled its new set of smart vacuum cleaners at the Consumer Electronics Show with AI-powered features such as monitoring pets, finding valuable objects, and notifying users about misplaced toys.

The company said that its new flagship Flow 2 robot vacuum has a rounded design and easy-lift tanks for better cleaning. The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.

Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. 

The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.

Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2's design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.

Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.

The problem reddit has is the celebration of it's doomerism, even in the small hobby subs the vibe is still present.

As for environment degradation in general, just because prior predictions were wrong doesn't mean the biosphere isn't still headed in the wrong direction for sustainability. Maybe we have the right governance and economics to adapt in time, but that's not a guarantee.Being positive about everything seems like a really privileged position. It also maintains the status quo. If you're Ukrainian, how positive would you feel about your country's future? How positive is Europe about NATO and it's future with the US right about now. How are Canadians feeling about their neighbor to the South? Are they confident future US elections will self-correct?Maybe over the long term it all works itself out and human progress continues to the stars or whatever. Or maybe we're going to be part of a Great Filter intelligent species face because of short sightedness and powerful technologies they unleash. Or maybe we'll just muddle along with some gains and then losses. Civilizations rise and fall, we really don't know how positive the future will be.

So? You have to do that because it takes one toxic person to poison the well. HN is aggressively moderated to get rid of articles and opinions that don't belong too. Without it, it would be just a constant stream of self-promotion and politics.The point is that someone (the moderators) worked to nourish a positive culture and it worked. HN didn't and it shows. I don't think that negativity is necessary to keep the forum interesting. Especially given that HN's negativity really isn't all that insightful. A lot of negative takes are bad, and many of them are written without reading the article, or by cherrypicking a single sentence and attacking that.

You don't get tech without negativity. And honestly HN is very tame compared to most forums when it comes to the deeply negative.The problem with maintaining (only) positivity in tech is you turn into $large_companies marketing department. We have to step up and say security flaws exist. That companies outright lie. That some idea (when it comes to programming) are objectively bad.Hence why the OP is here on the thread talking about what negativity means in this particular case, because it also counts criticism.

When I was still visiting Reddit my subreddit list was short and focused on a few hobbies and tech topics. Even those subreddits had become overtaken with cynical doomerism and toxic responses to everything. For a while I could still get some value out of select comments, but eventually everyone who wanted real discussion gave up and left. Now even when interesting or helpful topics get posted it's like the commenters are sharks circling and waiting for any opportunity to bring doom and gloom to any subject.

Engagement means money. Even if this is bait content then you get rewarded (on TikTok, X, YouTube, you directly get cash).Even here controversy is indirectly rewarded here because it creates engagement, and there is practically no downsides if you upset anyone;You get points for every answer that someone does to your comment, and the downvotes you get on your own comments don't offset the gained points.These points have real utility to make money indirectly: the more points you have, the more credibility you have on this platform and capacity to push a story.[...]and it helps to bootstrap your project or grab new customers for free (at most 1 day of writing the bot script).Let's say, you want to launch a new Juicero, and nobody knows about it yet, it's great to be able to push it on the homepage of HN, otherwise nobody is going to notice.

The absolute key feature is the domain experts, not the karma. Any time any subject comes up, someone appears that knows everything about the subject and lives in the field. It's the single best thing about HN by a million miles.

reply

I remember a guy that had millions just because on any reddit AMA asked ""tits or ass?""

reply

You're right about reddit karma though. One of the good things about HN is that throwaway joke posts like that are downvoted/flagged/otherwise discouraged. I can guess the top comment for any given Reddit comment section with like 90% accuracy just because it's going to be the most obvious joke possible based on the submission title, and Reddit users love upvoting those for some reason.

At the end, just saying that the best way to increase engagement is to increase bait / rage. Ironically that increases retention on the platforms too, so they don't need peace, if there are juicy flame wars.

Seems like the downsides are about the same as in other forums. It depends on if your account is anonymous or not.> You get points for every answer that someone does to your comment, and the downvotes you get on your own comments don't offset the gained points.I don't think that's right. You don't get points for replies, you get points for upvotes. And downvotes you get also affect your overall karma, though you don't seemingly have an upper bound on upvotes but I have read there is a lower bound of -4. An upvote on a submission seems to also be worth less than an upvote on a comment, though I'm not sure of the ratio (half? one third?).> These points have real utility to make money indirectly: the more points you have, the more credibility you have on this platform and capacity to push a story.I don't think that's right either. Once you can downvote and flag (500 karma?), more points don't give you anything extra. Personally I rarely check someone's points, only when viewing comment history or trying to identify spammers and other obvious bad actors.> This is why I am collecting points on all my fake accounts, because once I have collected enough karma points, I can upvote my startup speech on Hackernews using these shadow accounts.HN has voting ring detection. Though I can't speak for how effective it is.

I would tend to think that this goes naturally:you get boosted by a circle of people you know, and who wants you to succeed, because if you succeed they will get money), so there is the incentive in some way.but it's still plausible that getting a boost on HN is part of the package (but I am not sure it is needed, because of this natural push that you get from let's say 100 people around you).What you said about capitalism is true, I noticed it too, and it sounds even strange to me, as we are literally on a board that is initiated by a capitalist fund.

I posted what I thought was an interesting video of Lebron James doing a weightlifting drill, (with much lighter weight than a competitive lifter) and commenters jumped all the way up my ass about it being off topic, but also how Lebron has terrible weightlifting technique. No compelling discussion about weightlifting for elite athletes in other sports was had...

For the most part I pinned it down to casual engagement from non hobbyists introduced noise and anti information at scale.For example in r/cars a site that talks about vehicles the vast majority of commenters do not own, comments become about the “simualacra” of having an exotic (comparing specs debating reviews etc). Where as Ferrari chat forum is about the utilitarian ins and outs of actually owning one (financing, maintence, dealer issues etc).This seems to apply to all hobby forums when grow in popularity to the point where engagement rewards contributions from non hobbiests over real ones.My final takeaway was that the nature of the internet being a simulation inherently rewards non real content over real.  (Fake news is inherent to the internet) And karmic systems specifically reconstruct and enforce that simualacra.

I recently bought a pair of boots from a reputable brand.  So I of course checked out the subreddit for the brand and while many posts are good and the community is receptive to questions but posts by weirdos with like a dozen+ pairs of $300+ boots dominate the discussion.Can these people actually afford like $5000 worth of boots and all the accessories they come with it?  Maybe.  Maybe we're all participating in their shopping addiction when they post pictures of their stairs covered in boots.Either way there's something unsettlingly unnatural about their posts, and I don't mean in an astroturfing sort of way.

On the neutral category: the model outputs continuous scores from 0 to 1, so neutrality does exist around 0.5. The bimodal distribution with peaks at roughly 0.0 and 0.95 reflects how HN users tend toward strong evaluative positions. Three-class models could provide additional perspective, and that's worth exploring in future work.Also love your meta-observation. Imo your comment is critical, substantive, and engaging. By sentiment metrics it's ""negative,"" but functionally it's high-quality discourse. But that's exactly how I read the data: HN's negativity is constructive critique that drives engagement, not hostility.

It's a matter of perspective. The OP is a negative post. You are negative about it. Therefore, you have made a positive post.

reply

But posting something positive and getting slammed in the comments? That's depressing. So the barrier to posting something positive seems higher.

reply

This is addressed in OPs post. The vast majority of the 'negativity' I encounter on HN is technical critique rather than criticism or toxicity. I've found HN to arguably be one of the least toxic communities.

BTW even being the least toxic leaves the bar still pretty low, if you ask me.

I am active on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Tumblr but not X.  On all of those platforms I am selective about who I follow (e.g. said anything about Trump in the last 20 posts I won't follow you,  posted an image with angry text in it,  I won't follow you) and quick with the block button.  In the case of the first two I get a feed which is really cozy,  the third has way too much AI slop (fake cat videos!) which would get the smackdown on the other too.I really enjoy sharing photos on that kind of platform as well as the kind of links I post to HN.  I did have an image that was a breakout hit the other day which got me a burst of follows and it was really depressing that 95%-ish of those new followers are people who are apoplectic about #uspol.  There are just so many of those people and they post so much and they always say the same things and I find it emotionally contagious.I am bothered less by the right wing equivalent of those people because I don't go on X,  I live in one of the most liberal towns in America.  They bother me less because I can easily dismiss the people who are bleating ""free speech"",  ""free speech"", ""freespeech"" as NPC minions of Peter Thiel [1] whereas I agree with the followers of Heather Cox Richardson about the problem but think their solution is so wrong and actually destructive to their cause that they are effectively working for the Koch Organization for free and for me that stings.[1] ... although I know I shouldn't.

Deep technical critique often can't be in the comments, in my opinion. Unless you're an expert, setting up the environment, doing the experiments and presenting the data is an entire article on it's own. It would probably be healthier if people did that, rather than typing out a quick comment.Then there are topics like how AI will influence society in general, that's a multi-year sociology study, before being able to say anything with just a hint of accuracy. Warnings based on sentiment and anecdotes will always register as negative.There are some articles that have 200+ comments, in those cases whatever you have to say has probably already been posted, but people like to vent their frustrations, sometimes it helps to type out your thoughts, even if no one will read them.

To be frank, a large portion of HNers just aren't qualified for that and never will be, and a growing proportion exhibit bot-like behavior. The fact that a bot account for ""The Register"" operated undetected on HN for 3 years and accumulated 66k karma until I and one other commenter decided to call it out highlights issues with this community.I personally think stricter moderation of tone (maybe in an automated manner), a stricter delineation on the kinds of topics being posted to HN, and a complete overhaul of the now 17 year old HN guidelines is now in order.HN used to be a platform where ICs and decisionmakers could anonymously have a water cooler conversation or a discussion but leave with changed impression. Over the past few years, it has exhibited hallmarks of becoming a more combative forum with users exhibiting Reddit-like behavior and oftentimes sharing articles from a handful of Reddit subs. Without a significant revamp, HN will lose it's signal-to-noise ratio which differentiated it.Already, most YC founders prefer to use BookFace over HN and more experienced technical ICs are looking to lobsters.

Pace could be driven by the rapidity with which posts fall off the front page or with which comments expand so new comments are far down the list.I'd turn that around and say the observation that negative comments are upvoted shows that HN readers value them.I'll admit we could use more steelmanning when critiquing.

That being said, pessimism/optimism is a false dichotomy. The reason is that both are willful attitudes of expectation on an emotional spectrum rather than rationally grounded and sober assessments of reality. The wise path is prudent (I don't mean ""cautious""; I mean the classic virtue [0]). Prudence is rational. You can't be better than rational (genuinely rational; believing you are rational is not the same as being rational).[0] https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm

In addition, comments do not show the points accumulated so there's no way you can know how many points a comment gets, only posts.

To clarify on the second point: I am not analyzing individual comment scores (which, as you noted, are hidden). The metric refers to post points relative to comment growth/volume.

I'm recalibrating my own behavior to upvote more.Is it the desired behavior of HN that silent upvotes are for agreement? (Instead of a positive comment that doesn't add substantially to the discourse?)

Something I've been experimenting with here is writing smaller comments that serve as an invitation for someone to write an equally lengthy or longer comment in reply.If the accept the implicit invitation then we can have a longer conversation. It has had moderate success.

As with most things, the devil's in the details. There are plenty of ways to express criticism without descending to personal attacks. I've also noticed that when the cynicism/criticism-o-meter runs too high, there's almost always a top-level meta comment complaining about the complaining.Personally I'd rather someone tell me I have a piece of food stuck in my teeth than shower me with praise.

reply

You're also right that HN's moderation probably removes hostile content quickly (which is why I prefer this platform to other roptions tbh). So the negativity we observe is mostly substantive critique rather than personal attacks.That said, I'd push back a bit on whether this makes the finding less interesting. If anything, the opposite seems true. The fact that HN's ""negativity"" is constructive criticism, and that this criticism correlates with 27% higher engagement, tells us something about how technical communities value critical analysis over promotional framing. The classifier limitation is real (also see my other replies), but the engagement correlation holds whether we call it ""negative sentiment"" or ""evaluative critique.""I'll add a limitations section to make the terminology clearer: ""negative sentiment"" as used here means evaluative criticism detected by SST-2-trained models, not personal attacks or toxic comments. Thanks for your feedback!

> ... we observe extreme inequality in attention distribution. The Gini coefficient of 0.89 places HN among the most unequal attention economies documented in the literature. For comparison, Zhu & Lerman (2016) reported Gini co-efficients of 0.68–0.86 across Twitter metrics. ... The bottom 80% of posts [on HN] receive less than 10% of total upvotes. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5910263)This could probably be explained by HN's unique exposure mechanism. Every post starts on /newest and unless it gets picked up by the smaller group of users who browse /newest, it never reaches the front page where the main audience is. In most forums/subreddits by contrast a new post (unless it gets flagged as spam) usually gets some baseline exposure with the main audience before it sinks. On HN the main audience is downstream of an early gate and missing that gate is close to being effectively invisible. IMO this fact alone could probably explain why ""attention inequality"" seems more extreme on HN.

Given that, it seems that there is basically zero agreement between DistilBERT and the other models..... In fact even worse they disagree to the extreme with some saying the most positive score is the most negative score.... (even acounting for the inverted scale in results 2-6).

reply

For HN titles, which tend to be evaluative and critical, I assumed DistilBERT's framing fits better than the alternatives. But the disagreement between models actually shows that ""sentiment"" is task-dependent rather than some universal measure. I'll add a methodology section in the revision to clarify why this model was chosen.

reply

It would be interesting to see some of the comments that seem to be polar oposites in sentiments between the models. So ones where they are the most positive sentiment by one model but the most negative by another to analyse the cases where they disagree the most on their definition of sentiment.

Rather a lot of what is said in any given social circle has to do with complaining.  It's very common for people to point out something that is viewed as bad by everyone.  Then the group commiserates and bonds over that.  Even though an AI might consider such complaints negative, there might be a positive effect on people feeling heard and supported by a like-minded group.For this reason, I'd take OP's results with a modicum of salt.  Human interaction doesn't have to be all rainbows and unicorns to have a positive psychological impact.  As with in-person interactions, I suspect a significant portion of what OP's LLM's described as negative might just be humans bonding through complaint among peers.

In my neighborhood an electrical power outage is news; but yet another day of consistent electrical power supply is not news. But taking a step back, I think it is noteworthy! It makes my life better every day, and compared to the vast sweep of human history, it's a huge positive anomaly. My life is full of stuff like this, as I suspect the lives are of many HNers.I say this because while I do value news reporting and knowing what's wrong or could be better, I also try hard to maintain this broader awareness of what's (still) positive and going well. Even if its consistency makes it seem unremarkable on short time scales like the daily news cycle.

We need to do something and are actively working on it. The challenge is to distinguish thoughtful critique from negativity-venting. The former is fine, the latter is lame. Unfortunately HN has too much of the latter.I believe it has to do with macro trends in society at large and on the internet, which we can't expect to be immune from—but also with the community here getting older. That scares and worries me, because HN won't survive over the long haul if new cohorts of users don't keep showing up. Along with that, there seems to be increased waves of jadedness, bitterness, and cynicism that use this place as a dumping ground for bad feelings.*That's a nasty dynamic, since the more it happens, the more it encourages more of it to happen. Meanwhile, people who don't enjoy jaded, bitter, and denunciatory rhetoric are just incentivized to leave: a classic vicious circle.This is why we added the following to https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html last year: Don't be curmudgeonly.

I recall there being studies on financial loss vs gain, and that financial losses seem to effect emotions about 4x more than wins, so for an actual balanced algorithm, it would seem that positive posts should be boosted about 4-5x to have any chance of being surfaced on a modern social network. Given what we know about human psychology, sentiment boosts really should be a thing. Is anyone working on that?

Hmm... Technical critiques are very different from truly negative comments. I'm not sure they should be lumped together. Technical critiques are often interesting and useful.In my experience, truly negative comments which don't meet the guidelines rarely appear on HN, and when they do appear, they tend to disappear very, very quickly, thanks to the moderators.

You could measure in two ways:1) raw score for the post. Look at the distribution of total scores and remove the low scoring posts. I personally think this will remove more negative posts than positive.

Inquisitive posts, of course, can largely look for question marks.I think a lot of this boils down to ""tone is hard to decipher in text.""  And is a large part of why so many of us default to assuming an aggressive tone from others.  (Though, my personal pet idea there is that people are largely afraid to use questions more.)

I would expect most comments on HN to be critical and argumentative, but that isn't negativity. Being dismissive without good reason, or actually saying mean things (violates rules) would be clear negativity. But disagreement and questioning things, is part of how we all learn and share information. Matter of fact, the fastest way to learn things (as the meme goes) is to state something obviously incorrect and let people disagree with you, and show you a better way.In the few years I've been on HN, it's been very rare to see an actual negative comment that isn't simply someone having a sincere opinion different from someone else, and not getting flagged or downvoted-heavily.Would the author view this comment as negative, or would they see it as inquisitive? Because I'm not even criticizing anything the OP said or did, I'm genuinely wondering.

The central knowledge shared is that knowledge behaves like germs and can spread. Those that play on emotions spread better, and among the thought germs that spread based on emotions, the ones that play on anger spread the best.Worst yet: There are anger based thought germs which live in symbiosis and harmony even if they cause conflict among the humans who hold that germs.

> It's human nature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias. Everyone does it, but we perceive other people as doing it more than we do, which is itself a variation of the bias.
You can even see it in the title of the OP, in the word ""overwhelmingly"". That's excessive: the negative bias is noticeable, but if you look closely, it's not overwhelming. (To make up some numbers, it's more like 60-40, not 90-10.)However, it often feels as if it is overwhelming; in fact, one or two datapoints, plus negativity bias, are enough to create just such a feeling. The feeling gets expressed in ways that trigger similar feelings in other people, so we end up with a positive* feedback loop.The interesting question is, what factors mitigate this? how do we dampen negativity bias? or, how do we get negative feedback into our positive feedback loop of negative affect? That must also be happening all the time, or we'd be in a ""war of all against all"", which isn't the case, though (again) it may feel like it.* ['positive' in the sense of increasing; a positive loop of negative affect!]https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40430263

What if 65% of what's being discussed is stupid or evil? Then 65% negativity would seem to be proportionate. What if 80% of what's posted is stupid? Or 20%?That's the only way you can really make this number meaningful. You can't just look at the number and read in some undisciplined interpretation.(And frankly, consider this. Suppose person A makes a claim. Now suppose person B agrees with that claim and person C disagrees with that claim. Who is more likely to respond? If B agrees and has nothing to add, no additional depth or insight to provide, then there is no reason for a followup comment. An upvote suffices. But if C disagrees, then there's something to contradict and a reason to followup with an explanation of why there is disagreement.)

-----1) I do not understand in any way the sentiment that discussion should ideally consist of people agreeing with and encouraging each other.The reason I speak with people is either to inform or learn. If I'm informing, this is not really a discussion. I'm just telling people something that they may not know. There are two ways to learn: one is to listen and not speak, which is the mirror of the above. The way to learn through speaking is that somebody says something, I dispute or question that thing, and that person shows me why I'm wrong.So the way to learn while speaking is that someone says something, I say something negative about that thing, and then that person says something negative about the negative thing I've just said.Friends and family are what you need, not the empty, uninformed, ritualistic, and above all socially-pressured positive comment of strangers.-----2) Following up on the first point (which is mainly a personal observation), it's important to say (although completely unsurprising and obvious) that negativity is relative. On HN (or reddit, or any comment site), the first post or OP is assigned positivity.A great example is this very OP, which is an accusation of negativity on Hacker News, which with no context is quite obviously a post with negative sentiment. The way you would grade reactions to it in a vacuum would say that other posts disputing its conclusions are positive.Its methodology, however, requires that the posts disputing it be graded as negative: ""Criticism of technology, skepticism toward announcements, complaints about industry practices, frustration with APIs."" What are the OPs that contain these posts? Links to technologies and technology advocates, announcements, recommendations of particular practices, descriptions of APIs.Accusations of negativity and tone policing are always content-free social control. If I set my point of view as positive and uplifting (while posting about how HN and reddit and social media are evil poison promulgated by evil people who should be physically stopped to save civilization), I can silence dispute through calling the mods rather than through discussion.The more indefensible my position is, the more I will prefer the sort of ""discussion"" where I say something, other people dispute it, and I accuse them of being negative people with implications of bad faith and possibly psychological unsoundness.

I'm playing Trepang2 right now. They used AI to write some of the messages found on papers and devices in the game. Finding them, or even reading them, has no bearing on the gameplay. They just help contribute to the lore and offer better insight into the world. I think there's some fun unlockables for finding them all. They found a way to add value to the game without drawing too much developer focus away from critical tasks (adding new levels and fixing bugs).Same with marketing materials. As long as the marketing doesn't misrepresent the game, I don't think it's a big deal that they used AI to make a 2D pixel art drawing in the poster for a 3D game. It's something else entirely if they used AI generated 3D characters in marketing materials for a 2D pixel art game. I think developers need to be careful when using AI, they have to ask themselves if the generated content either misrepresents the game or dilutes the creativity.

Then it does ... something with that information.From the promo it almost looked as if that data was fed to an LLM that could then generate an audio response that fits to the play scene. Something like ""You are a <Lego Star Wars minifigure>. You are <sitting> in a <vehicle: air plane>. The vehicle is <turning along the Z axis>. What do you say?"" (Where the stuff inside the brackets is inferred from the nearby beacons and the rest would be a fixed prompt template)But that would require the bricks to have an internet connection, and I have no idea if that's the case.

It shouldn't be hard to print pieces that can snap together. In all kinds of colors and all kinds of forms.I imagine the adventure of printing new pieces would be a fun thing for the kids and the parents. And when the kids are old enough, they can print pieces on their own. And a bit later design pieces on their own.Would there be any downside to this approach?

I have some news for you. Lego piece tolerance is nuts. I think it is down to 2 micrometers. You can't achieve that in consumer 3d printers.Now, you can make something that kinda works like lego but it wont have the structural integrity for advanced builds.

I've seen probably 10s, ranging from amateur-who-just-unpacked-their-printer to acquaintance who runs a business doing 3D printed products, and none of them come close to the experience of lego bricks, so far I'm not sure I'd actually call it ""work"". Stack 10 of these ""custom"" lego bricks and place them next to another stack of 10, and they almost certainly won't be as aligned as proper lego bricks, not to mention the whole thing will fall apart a lot easier.

Deposit accounts at most banks pay you less than that, so it's unclear why you'd want gift cards to pay that much. Not to mention that turning gift cards into essentially bank accounts is going to create even more issues. Remember how we have to remind people how paypal isn't a bank? Or how would you calculate income taxes from the interest?

reply

Sell a product for $7 but only allow ""recharge"" in $5 increments. It pretty much guarantees that you will have tons of accounts with random dollar amounts laying around in them, never to be used. Even for regular gift cards, the counter party would be beholden to honoring them at their full value, as they should.Besides, nothing it stopping you from rolling monthly treasuries and using those as a bank. Something people with enough money to exploit this proposed ""gift card bank"" would almost surely already be aware of.

According to Gallup [1], only 47% of US Americans thought that immigration should decrease in 2020. That number had held more or less steady since at least 2000. But it grew steadily over Biden's term, reaching 88% in 2024. This, I believe, is a reflection of how the democrats shifted their rhetoric to be ""tough on immigration"". And it handed Trump a populace that was primed to be more susceptible than ever to his much more aggressive immigration rhetoric.Of course, this is just a small part of a much bigger picture, but I don't exactly think it helped.[1] https://news.gallup.com/poll/692522/surge-concern-immigratio...

I've seen this dude described as an ""islamo-communist"" more than once in different countries' medias (not fringe medias).  I presume ""islamist"" because muslim, and ""communist"" because he's left of the center-right. You can't really talk with these people anyways, they're too far gone

Mamdani seems very proud to be a socialist and you get a taste of it where he says ""...the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment"" and ""..we have to continue to elect more socialists and we have to ensure that we are unapologetic about our socialism"", etc.  He is very clear about his beliefs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7HDuoJ0MQ

For an US perspective, yes. From an European perspective... him and Bernie are center-left, if not centrist. The Overton window is positioned much more towards the authoritarian right in the US than it is here - although the huge amounts of American and Russian funding towards far-right parties have been shifting the window here as well for about a decade.

I suppose part of the problem is that training a model on publicly available C++ isn't going to be great because syntactically broken code gets posted to the web all the time, along with suboptimal solutions.  I recall a talk saying that functional languages are better for agents because the code published publicly is formally correct.

And why we're predicting what's next for the technology in 2026 anyway. 

This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

Sometimes AI feels like a niche topic to write about, but then the holidays happen, and I hear relatives of all ages talking about cases of chatbot-induced psychosis, blaming rising electricity prices on data centers, and asking whether kids should have unfettered access to AI. It's everywhere, in other words. And people are alarmed.

Inevitably, these conversations take a turn: AI is having all these ripple effects now, but if the technology gets better, what happens next? That's usually when they look at me, expecting a forecast of either doom or hope. 

I probably disappoint, if only because predictions for AI are getting harder and harder to make. 

Despite that, MIT Technology Review has, I must say, a pretty excellent track record of making sense of where AI is headed. We've just published a sharp list of predictions for what's next in 2026 (where you can read my thoughts on the legal battles surrounding AI), and the predictions on last year's list all came to fruition. But every holiday season, it gets harder and harder to work out the impact AI will have. That's mostly because of three big unanswered questions.

For one, we don't know if large language models will continue getting incrementally smarter in the near future. Since this particular technology is what underpins nearly all the excitement and anxiety in AI right now, powering everything from AI companions to customer service agents, its slowdown would be a pretty huge deal. Such a big deal, in fact, that we devoted a whole slate of stories in December to what a new post-AI-hype era might look like. 

Number two, AI is pretty abysmally unpopular among the general public. Here's just one example: Nearly a year ago, OpenAI's Sam Altman stood next to President Trump to excitedly announce a $500 billion project to build data centers across the US in order to train larger and larger AI models. The pair either did not guess or did not care that many Americans would staunchly oppose having such data centers built in their communities. A year later, Big Tech is waging an uphill battle to win over public opinion and keep on building. Can it win? 

The response from lawmakers to all this frustration is terribly confused. Trump has pleased Big Tech CEOs by moving to make AI regulation a federal rather than a state issue, and tech companies are now hoping to codify this into law. But the crowd that wants to protect kids from chatbots ranges from progressive lawmakers in California to the increasingly Trump-aligned Federal Trade Commission, each with distinct motives and approaches. Will they be able to put aside their differences and rein AI firms in? 

If the gloomy holiday dinner table conversation gets this far, someone will say: Hey, isn't AI being used for objectively good things? Making people healthier, unearthing scientific discoveries, better understanding climate change?

Well, sort of. Machine learning, an older form of AI, has long been used in all sorts of scientific research. One branch, called deep learning, forms part of AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning tool for protein prediction that has transformed biology. Image recognition models are getting better at identifying cancerous cells. 

But the track record for chatbots built atop newer large language models is more modest. Technologies like ChatGPT are quite good at analyzing large swathes of research to summarize what's already been discovered. But some high-profile reports that these sorts of AI models had made a genuine discovery, like solving a previously unsolved mathematics problem, were bogus. They can assist doctors with diagnoses, but they can also encourage people to diagnose their own health problems without consulting doctors, sometimes with disastrous results. 

This time next year, we'll probably have better answers to my family's questions, and we'll have a bunch of entirely new questions too. In the meantime, be sure to read our full piece forecasting what will happen this year, featuring predictions from the whole AI team.

 

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Eighty years after total war transformed the continent, European countries are making big bets on new instruments of annihilation.

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers of the 4th Light Brigade, also known as the Black Rats, descended upon the damp forests of Estonia's eastern territories. They had rushed in from Yorkshire by air, sea, rail, and road. Once there, the Rats joined 14,000 other troops at the front line, dug in, and waited for the distant rumble of enemy armor. 

The deployment was part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog, intended to test the alliance's capacity to react to a large Russian incursion. Naturally, it featured some of NATO's heaviest weaponry: 69-ton battle tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and truck-mounted rocket launchers capable of firing supersonic missiles. 

But according to British Army tacticians, it was the 4th Brigade that brought the biggest knife to the fight—and strictly speaking, it wasn't even a physical weapon. The Rats were backed up by an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” conceived under the name Project ASGARD. 

The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain. 

Say a reconnaissance drone spots a tank hiding in a copse. In conventional operations, the soldier operating that drone would pass the intelligence through a centralized command chain of officers, the brains of the mission, who would collectively decide whether to shoot at it. 

But a targeting web operates more like an octopus, whose neurons reach every extremity, allowing each of its tentacles to operate autonomously while also working collaboratively toward a central set of goals. 

During Hedgehog, the drones over Estonia traced wide orbits. They scanned the ground below with advanced object recognition systems. If one of them spied that hidden tank, it would transmit its image and location directly to nearby shooters—an artillery cannon, for example. Or another tank. Or an armed loitering munition drone sitting on a catapult, ready for launch. 

The soldiers responsible for each weapon interfaced with the targeting web by means of Samsung smartphones. Once alerted to the detected target, the drone crew merely had to thumb a dropdown menu on the screen—which lists the available targeting options based on factors such as their pKill, which stands for “probability of kill”—for the drone to whip off into the sky and trace an all but irreversible course to its unsuspecting mark. 

Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. “The Russians are knocking on the door,” says Sven Weizenegger, the head of the German military's Cyber Innovation Hub. Strategists and policymakers are counting on increasingly automated battlefield gadgetry to keep them from bursting through. 

“AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and mass-­deployed drones have become decisive on the battlefield,” says Angelica Tikk, head of the Innovation Department at the Estonian Ministry of Defense. For a small state like Estonia, Tikk says, such technologies “allow us to punch above our weight.”

“Mass-deployed,” in this case, is very much the operative term. Ukraine scaled up its drone production for its war against Russia from 2.2 million in 2024 to 4.5 million in 2025. EU defense and space commissioner Andrius Kubilius has estimated that in the event of a wider war with Russia the EU will need three million drones annually just to hold down Lithuania, a country of some 2.9 million people that's about the size of West Virginia. 

Projects like ASGARD would take these figures and multiply them with the other key variable of warfare: speed. British officials claim that the targeting web's kill chain, from the first detection of a target to strike decision, could take less than a minute. As a result, a press release noted, the system “will make the army 10 times more lethal over the next 10 years.” It is slated to be completed by 2027. Germany's armed forces plan to deploy their own targeting web, Uranos KI, as early as 2026. 

The working theory behind these initiatives is that the right mix of lethal drones—conceived by a new crop of tech firms, sprinted to the front lines with uncommon haste, and guided to their targets by algorithmic networks—will deliver Europe an overwhelming victory in the event of an outright war. Or better yet, it will give the continent such a wide advantage that nobody would think to attack it in the first place, an effect that Eric Slesinger, a Madrid-based venture capitalist focused on defense startups, describes as “brutal, guns-and-steel, feel-it-in-your-gut deterrence.” 

But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. The costs of actually winning a massive drone war are likely to be more than just financial. The human toll of these technologies would extend far behind the front lines, fundamentally transforming how the European Union—from its outset, a project of peace—lives, fights, and dies. And even then, victory would be far from assured. 

If anything, Europe could be laying its hand on a perpetual hair trigger that nobody can afford for it to pull. 

Twenty companies participated in Project ASGARD. They range from eager startups, flush with VC backing, to defense giants like General Dynamics. Each contender could play an important role in Europe's future. But no firm among them has more tightly captured the current European military zeitgeist than Helsing, which provided both drones and AI for the project. 

Founded in 2021 by a theoretical physicist, a former McKinsey partner, and a biologist turned video-game developer, with an early investment of €100 million (then about $115 million) from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Helsing has quickly risen to the apex of Europe's new defense tech ecosystem. 

The Munich-based company has an established presence in Europe's major capitals, staffed by a deep bench of former government and military officials. Buoyed by a series of high-profile government contracts and partnerships, along with additional rounds of funding, the company catapulted to a $12 billion valuation last June. It is now Europe's most valuable defense startup by a wide margin, and the one that would be most likely to find itself at the tip of the spear if Europe's new cold war were to suddenly turn hot. 

Originally, the company made military software. But it has recently expanded its offerings to include physical weapons such as AI-assisted missile drones and uncrewed autonomous fighter jets. 

In part, this reflects a shift in European demand. In March 2025, the European Commission called for a “once-in-a-generation surge in European defence investment,” citing drones and AI as two of seven priority investment areas for a new initiative that will unlock almost a trillion dollars for weapons over the coming years. Germany alone has allocated nearly $12 billion to build its drone arsenal.  

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that.”

But in equal measure, the company is looking to shape Europe's military-industrial posture. In conventional weapons programs in Europe, governments tell companies what to build through a rigid contracting process. Helsing flips that process on its head. Like a growing number of new defense firms, it is guided by what Antoine Bordes, its chief scientist, describes as “a more traditional tech-startup muscle.”

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that,” says Bordes, who was previously a leader in AI research at Meta. Government officials across Europe have proved receptive to the model, calling for agile contracting instruments that allow militaries to more easily open their pocketbooks when a company comes to them with an idea.

Helsing's pitch deck for the future of European defense bristles with weapons that will operate across land, air, sea, and space. In the highest reaches of Helsing's imagined battlefield, a constellation of reconnaissance satellites, which the company is collaborating on with Loft Orbital, will “detect, identify and classify military assets worldwide.” 

Lower down, the company's HF-1 and HX-2 loitering munition drones—so called because they combine the functions of a small reconnaissance drone and a missile—can stalk the skies for long periods before zeroing in on their targets. To date, the company has publicly disclosed orders for around 10,000 airframes to be delivered to Ukraine. It won't say how many have been deployed, although it told Bloomberg in April that its drones had been used in dozens of successful missions in the conflict. 

At sea, the company envisions battalions of drone mini-subs that can plunge as deep as 3,000 feet and rove for 90 days without human control, serving as a hidden guard watch for maritime incursions. 

Helsing's newest offering, the Europa, is a four-and-a-half-ton fighter jet with no human pilot on board. In a set of moody promo pictures released in 2025, the drone has the profile of an upturned boning knife. Carrying hundreds of pounds of weaponry, it is meant to charge deep into heavily defended airspace, flying under the command of a human pilot much farther away (like Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick if his costars were robots and he were safely beyond the range of enemy anti-aircraft missiles). Helsing says that the Europa, which resembles designs offered by a number of other firms, is engineered to be “mass-producible.”

Linking all these elements together is Altra, the company's so-called “­recce-strike software platform,” which served as part of the collective brain in the ASGARD trials. It's the key piece. “These kill webs are competitive in attack and defense,” says General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command, who recently coauthored a major Ministry of Defense modernization plan that champions the deterrent effect of autonomous targeting webs. Barrons invited me to imagine Russian leaders contemplating a possible incursion into Narva in eastern Estonia. “If they've done a reasonable job,” he said, referring to NATO, “Russia knows not to do that … that little incursion—it will never get there. It'll be destroyed the minute it sets foot across the border.” 

With a targeting web in place, a medley of missiles, drones, and artillery could coordinate across borders and domains to hit anything that moves. On its product page for Altra, Helsing notes that the system is capable of orchestrating “saturation attacks,” a military tactic for breaching an adversary's defenses with a barrage of synchronized weapon strikes. The goal of the technology, a Helsing VP named Simon Brünjes explained in a speech to an Israeli defense convention in 2024, is “lethality that deters effectively.” 

To put it a bit less delicately, the idea is to show any potential aggressors that Europe is capable, if provoked, of absolutely losing its shit. The US Navy is working to establish a similar capacity for defending Taiwan with hordes of autonomous drones that rain down on Chinese vessels in coordinated volleys. The admirals have their own name for the result such swarms are intended to achieve: “hellscape.”

The biggest obstacle to achieving the full effect of saturation attacks is not the technology. It's the human element. “A million drones are great, but you're going to need a million people,” says Richard Drake, head of the European branch of Anduril, which builds a product range similar to Helsing's and also participated in ASGARD.

Drake says the kill chain in a system like ASGARD “can all be done autonomously.” But for now, “there is a human in the loop making those final decisions.” Government rules require it. Echoing the stance of most other European states, Estonia's Tikk told me, “We also insist that human control is maintained over decisions related to the use of lethal force.” 

Helsing's drones in Ukraine use object recognition to detect targets, which the operator reviews before approving a strike. The aircraft operate without human control only once they enter their “terminal guidance” phase, about half a mile from their target. Some locally produced drones employ similar “last mile” autonomy. This hands-free strike mode is said to have a hit rate in the range of 75%, according to research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (A Helsing spokesperson said that the company uses “multiple visual aids” to mitigate “potential difficulties” in target recognition during terminal guidance.) 

That doesn't quite make them killer robots. But it suggests that the barriers to full lethal autonomy are no longer necessarily technical. Helsing's Brünjes has reportedly said its strike drones can “technically” perform missions without human control, though the company does not support full autonomy. Bordes declined to say whether the company's fielded drones can be switched into a fully autonomous mode in the event that a government changes its policy midway through a conflict. 

Either way, the company could loosen the loop in the coming years. Helsing's AI team in Paris, led by Bordes, is working to enable a single human to oversee multiple HX-2 drones in flight simultaneously. Anduril is developing a similar “one-to-many” system in which a single operator could marshal a fleet of 10 or more drones at a time, Drake says. 

In such swarms a human is technically still involved, but that person's capacity to decide upon the actions of any single drone is diminished, especially if the drones are coordinating to saturate a wide area. (In a statement, a Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review, “We do not and will not build technology where a machine makes the final decision.”)

“The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later.”

Like other projects in its portfolio, Helsing's research on swarming HX-2s is not intended for a current government contract but, rather, to anticipate future ones. “We feel that this needs to be done, and done properly, because this is what we need,” Bordes told me. 

To be sure, this thinking is not happening in a vacuum. The push toward autonomy in Ukraine is largely driven by advances in jamming technologies, which disrupt the links between drones and their operators. Russia has reportedly been upgrading its strike drones with sharper autonomous target recognition, as well as modems that enable them to communicate among themselves in a sort of proto-swarm. In October, it conducted a test of an autonomous torpedo said to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads powerful enough to create tsunamis. 

Governments are well aware that if Europe's only response to such challenges is to further automate its own lethality, the result could be a race with no winners. “The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later,” UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz has warned. 

And yet officials are struggling to imagine an alternative. “If you don't have the people, then you can't control so many drones,” says Weizenegger, of the German Cyber Innovation Hub. “So therefore you need swarming technologies in place—you know, autonomous systems.” 

“It sounds very harsh,” he says, referring to the idea of removing the human from the loop. “But it's about winning or losing. There are only these two options. There is no third option.” 

In its pitches, Helsing often emphasizes a sense of dire urgency. “We don't know when we could be attacked,” one executive said at a technology summit in Berlin in September 2025. “Are we ready to fight tonight in the Baltics? The answer is no.” 

The company boasts that it has a singular capacity to fix that. In September 2024 it embarked on a project to develop an AI agent capable of controlling fighter aircraft. By May of the following year the agent was operating a Swedish Gripen E jet in tests over the Baltic Sea. The company calls such timelines “Helsing speed.” The Europa combat jet drone is slated to be ready by 2029.

European governments have adopted a similar fixation with haste. “We need to fast-track,” says Weizenegger. “If we start testing in 2029, it's probably too late.” Last February, announcing that Denmark would increase defense spending by 50 billion kroner ($7 billion), Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference, “If we can't get the best equipment, buy the next best. There's only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.” 

That same month, Helsing announced that it will establish a network of “resilience factories” across Europe—dispersed and secret—to churn out drones at a wartime clip. The network will be put to its first real test in the coming months, when the German government finalizes a planned €300 million order for 12,000 Helsing HX-2s to equip an armored brigade stationed in Lithuania. 

The company says that its first factory, somewhere in southern Germany, can produce 1,000 drones a month—or roughly six drones an hour, assuming a respectable 40-hour European work week. At that pace, it would fill Germany's order in a year. In reality, though, it could take longer. As of last summer, the facility was operating at less than half its capacity because of staffing shortages. (A company spokesperson did not respond to questions about its current production capacity and declined to provide information on how many drones it has produced to date.)

It will take a lot of factories for Europe to fully arm up. When Helsing unveiled its resilience factory project, one of its founders, Torsten Reil, wrote on LinkedIn that “100,000 HX-2 strike drones would deter a land invasion of Europe once and for all.” Helsing now says that Germany alone should maintain a store of 200,000 HX-2s to tide it over for the first two months of a Russian invasion. 

Even if Europe can surge its capacity to such levels, not everyone is convinced that massed drones are a winning pitch. While drones now account for somewhere between 70% and 80% of all combat casualties in Ukraine, “they're not determining outcomes on the battlefield,” says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, drones have brought the conflict to a grinding stalemate, leading to what a team of American, British, and French air force officers have called “a Somme in the sky.” 

This dynamic has led to remarkable advances in drone communications and autonomy. But each breakthrough is quickly met with a countermeasure. In some areas where jamming has made wireless communication particularly difficult, pilots control their drones using long spools of fiber-­optic filament. In turn, their opponents have engineered rotating barbed wire traps to snare the filaments as they drag along the ground, as well as drone interceptors that can knock the unjammable drones out of the sky. 

“If you produce millions of drones right now, they will become obsolete in maybe a year or half a year,” says Kateryna Bondar, a former Ukrainian government advisor. “So it doesn't make sense to produce them, stockpile, and wait for attack.”

Nor is AI necessarily up to the task of piloting so many drones, despite industry claims to the contrary. Bohdan Sas, a founder of the Ukrainian drone company Buntar Aerospace, told me that he finds it amusing when Western companies claim to have achieved “super-fancy recognition and target acquisition on some target in testing,” only to reveal that the test site was “an open field and a target in the center.” 

“It's not really how it works in reality,” Sas says. “In reality, everything is really well hidden.” (A Helsing spokesperson said, “Our target recognition technology has proven itself on the battlefield hundreds of times.”)

Zachary Kallenborn, a research associate at the University of Oxford, told me that in Ukraine, Russian forces have been known to deactivate the autonomous functionalities of their Lancet loitering munitions. In real-world conditions, he says, AI can fail—“And so what happens if you have 100,000 drones operating that way?”

In September, while reporting this story, I visited Corbera, a town perched on a rocky outcrop among the limestone hills of Terra Alta in western Catalonia. In the late summer of 1938, Corbera was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War. 

The site is just as much a reminder of past horrors as it is a warning of future ones. The town was repeatedly targeted by German and Italian aircraft, a breakthrough technology that was, at the time, roughly as novel as modern drones are to us today. Military planners who led the Spanish campaigns famously used the raids to perfect the technology's destructive potential. 

For the last four years, Ukraine has served a similar role as Europe's living laboratory of carnage. According to Bondar, some Ukrainian units have begun charging Western companies a fee to operate their drones in battle. In return, the companies receive reams of real-world data that can't be replicated on a test range.

 “We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is.”

What this data doesn't show is the mess that the technology leaves behind. In Ukraine, drones now account for more civilian casualties than any other weapon. A United Nations human rights commission recently concluded that Russia has used drones “with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population”—a crime against humanity—along a 185-mile stretch of the Dnipro River. One local resident told investigators, “We are hit every day. Drones fly at any time—morning, evening, day or night, constantly.” The commission also sought to investigate Russian allegations of Ukrainian drone attacks on civilians but was not granted sufficient access to make a determination.  

A European drone war would invite similar tragedies on a much grander scale. Tens of millions of people live within drone-strike range of Europe's eastern border with Russia. Today's ethical calculus could change. At a media event last summer, Helsing's Brünjes told reporters that in Ukraine, “we want a human to be making the decision” in lethal strikes. But in “a full-scale war with China or Russia,” he said, “it's a different question.” 

In the scenario of an incursion into Narva, Richard Barrons told me that Russia should also know that once its initial attack is repelled, NATO would use long-range missiles and jet drones—abetted by the same targeting webs—to immediately retaliate deep within Russian territory. Such talk may be bluster. The point of deterrence is, after all, to stave off war with the mere threat of unbearable violence. But it can leave little room for deescalation in the event of an actual fight. Could one be sure that Russia, which recently lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons, would stand down? “The mindset that these kinds of systems are now being rolled out in is one where we're not imagining off-ramps,” says Richard Moyes, the director of ​Article 36, a British nonprofit focused on the protection of civilians in conflict. 

To this day, Corbera's old center lies in ruins. The crumbled homes sit desolate of life but for the fig trees struggling up through the rubble and the odd skink that scurries across a splintered beam. Walking through the wasteland, I was taken by how much it resembles any other war zone. It could have been Tigray, or Khartoum. Or Gaza, a living hellscape where AI targeting tools played a central role in accelerating Israel's cataclysmic bombing campaign. What particular innovation wrought such misery seemed almost beside the point. 

“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is,” Barrons told me, a couple of weeks after I was in Corbera. “I think on planet Helsing and Anduril,” he went on, “they're not really fighting, in many respects. And it's a different mindset.” 

A Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review that the company “was founded to provide democracies with technology built in Europe essential for credible deterrence, and to ensure this technology is developed in line with tight ethical standards.” He went on to say that “ethically built autonomous systems are limiting noncombatant casualties more effectively than any previous category of weapon.”

Would such a claim, if true, bear out in a gloves-off war between major powers? “I would be extraordinarily cautious of anyone who says, ‘Yeah, 100% this is how the future of autonomous warfare looks,'” Kallenborn told me. And yet, there are some certainties we can count on. Every weapon, no matter how smart, carries within it a variation of the same story. “Lethality” means what it says. The only difference is how quickly—and how massively—that story comes to its sad, definitive end.

Asus decided it's not giving up on a mobile gaming machine with more than one screen. At CES 2026, the company announced a new version of the ROG Zephyrus Duo that doubles the amount of 16-inch screen real estate you get on a typical laptop by—well—adding an extra OLED screen on an extra-large hinge.

There are actually two separate notes of inspiration to ROG's latest off-the-wall design. The first ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 from 2022 included an awkward 14.1-inch secondary panel that rose at an angle from the main display. This form factor scrunched the size of the keyboard and mousepad. Instead, the new Duo takes inspiration from the Asus Zenbook Duo with that laptop's hinged dual 14-inch screens and a keyboard that magnetically attaches to the bottom portion. The Zephyrus Duo includes the same slash lighting feature as the Zephyrus G14 and G16 laptops. However, the dual 16-inch screens offer some interesting new use cases for gaming or working on the go.

Like the Zenbook Duo, users can position the laptop with the screens vertically or else use the built-in kickstand to show the two displays on top of each other. That could be especially handy for mobile workers who can't get anything done without an additional display. Windows 11 doesn't allow for more than one full-screen game to run at once, which is a particular detriment to this device. However, Asus showed off their laptop running with the game mirrored on two screens at once with the laptop folded like a tent. If you're playing a co-op game, that may mean the two players don't have to hunch around a single small laptop display.

The new Zephyrus Duo arrives at the same time as a revised Zenbook Duo. The latter features a more seamless hinge that limits the amount of screen bezel. The Zephyrus is a larger, more capable device, mandating a larger and more pronounced mechanism. The Zephyrus' two 3K, 120Hz OLED displays will be enough for most gaming needs, but as for performance, it will be an interesting mix. The dual-screened laptop features a “next-gen Intel Core Ultra” processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU. Before you get excited, this is still a thin device. That limits the TGP, or total graphics power, to a bare 135W.

Whether this new Zephyrus model makes the cut will depend more on how it can perform with two screens running compared to only one. Battery life on all gaming laptops is already an issue, and it will be worse when trying to display two screens at once. Otherwise, Kojima fans may be more interested in a new version of the ROG Flow Z13, one that's inspired by Death Stranding 2: On a Beach. The limited edition gaming tablet/laptop hybrid still uses the same AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU that's proved so good for gaming, but it also sports a new expanded keyboard cover and a rear vent grill that will look striking even if you don't know what “Ludens” refers to.

The Alienware Area-51 was the kind of laptop that gets you excited to game. It felt great on the fingertips thanks to its mechanical keyboard with Cherry Ultra switches. It looked the part—like it had fallen off a UFO fuselage and was glowing with vibrant otherworldly energy through its bottom panel glass window. Its extraterrestrial design was unfortunately hampered by a dull IPS LCD screen. Dell's gaming brand may have come back to make amends. However, a revised screen—plus the skyrocketing cost of RAM—will likely demand a heftier price tag.

The new version of the Alienware 16 Area-51 for 2026 will sport an OLED panel at the same 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and 240Hz refresh rate as the previous model. This display will claim a 0.2ms response time and 120% DCI-P3 color gamut, typical of organic light-emitting diode screens. The new gaming laptop promises HDR True Black 500 certification as well as a peak of 620 nits of brightness in HDR. No, it's not the brightest display available. If you're not already aware, OLED displays offer far better contrast and black levels than other LCD-based screens. There are more modern, updated OLED screens coming to CES 2026, which promote better brightness overall.

Alienware promises the screen will have an anti-glare protector to keep the surface from reflecting too much light. Take the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i as an example of ultra-bright shiny displays that will reflect practically everything when not playing in a dim interior. The tradeoff with most anti-glare screens is a less vibrant picture. Indeed, every Alienware laptop is getting an OLED option. This includes the 16X Aurora, which will also pack a similar 240Hz panel.

There likely won't be any 18-inch OLED version, unfortunately. Alienware told Gizmodo that there aren't enough 18-inch OLED panels available to make the laptop cost-effective. Either way, the 16-inch will support the top-end Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors. The 2025 version of the 16-inch Area-51 topped out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, one step short of the highest-end 285HX, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU. The system also carried 32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM. That memory spec will likely become an issue for consumers in 2026, considering the spiking price of RAM across the board.

Dell has previously told Gizmodo that it will take “targeted pricing action when necessary” due to the spiking cost of memory. Already, the company has increased prices for corporate clients, according to a report from Business Insider. AI data centers are demanding so much high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that the semiconductor makers who are responsible for today's consumer-level RAM are shifting their focus—causing a massive shortage in memory across RAM and storage options.

Which is why consumers may be more enticed by the cheaper options. Dell's gaming brand may also have an “entry level” as well as an “ultra-slim gaming laptop” that's only around 17mm thick. I saw it in person, though Alienware was adamant I didn't take any photos of the laptop in its pre-production, relatively simplistic body. That new form factor will come in 14- and 16-inch sizes and will still support an Nvidia GPU as well as “next-gen” Intel CPUs, which could be one of the new Panther Lake variations. We can expect these laptops are meant to compete against today's 14- and 16-inch Razer Blade laptops.

No matter what, expect that laptops will cost more, but for now we can think about what may come in the future.

Intel and Qualcomm are both coming to CES 2026, beating the drum hard for their next-gen lightweight laptop CPUs. Meanwhile, AMD is slipping into the party through the back door with its usual laid-back swagger, showcasing a range of new CPUs for laptops, desktops, and gaming-specific devices. The first on the list is the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series that you'll find in a metric ton of laptops at this year's showcase.

The AI 400 series, like 2024's 300 series, is designed to power this generation of Copilot+ PCs. They're running on Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture and top out with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 475 with a 12-core, 24-thread configuration. The CPU hits a 5.2GHz boost clock, and AMD promised this CPU should be slightly better at multitasking than the previous generation. The new chip's GPU isn't packing any of the most recent RDNA 4 GPU architecture (which means no official access to AMD's Redstone upscaler), but instead includes 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores with a 3.1 GHz boost clock.

The highest-end CPU also comes with an NPU that hits 60 TOPS, which stands for trillions of operations per second. It's a derived value that only vaguely approximates AI processing capabilities, so you really shouldn't spend too much time comparing it to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2's 80 TOPS NPU. Most chips you'll see in laptops will max out with the Ryzen AI 7 450, an 8-core CPU with a 5.1GHz clock speed and 24MB cache with only a 50 TOPS NPU.

Overall, it's a subdued update to one of AMD's most prevalent CPUs. AMD promises these latest x86 chips will allow for “multi-day” battery life, though the exact numbers will depend on each laptop spec. We can already guess a majority of these chips will make their way inside this year's slate of lightweight notebooks. However, the real dark horse of 2026 could be the Ryzen AI+ Max series. There are even more of the company's high-end APUs (accelerated processing units) that are stressing GPU performance beyond what you normally expect from a single chip.

That includes the new Ryzen AI Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The lower-end chip is an eight-core, 16-thread chip that also manages to pack in the 40 graphics compute units (AMD's version of core clusters) found in the top-end Ryzen AI Max+ 395. We've had plenty of experience with that APU thanks to the Framework Desktop and other devices like the Asus ROG Flow Z13. The graphics capabilities of that chip proved extra enticing. That's why I asked AMD if the 388 was engineered for gaming.

“The 388 is an eight-core chip that's really targeted for gamers,” AMD's senior VP of client business Rahul Tikoo told Gizmodo during a virtual briefing. AMD implied there will indeed be more gaming-related products featuring these (hopefully) cheaper Max chips throughout 2026. The APU could be an enticing prospect for handheld gaming PCs or other lightweight designs. We can't help but imagine some kind of Steam Machine-like device running with these specs for gaming at 1440p and 4K.

As for high-end gaming desktops, AMD also has an update to what we already called the best CPU of 2025. Just as earlier leaks suggested, AMD is pushing an update to the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D with a Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The new chip uses the same layered 3D cache and eight-core Zen 5 CPU architecture, but it also has an upgraded 5.6GHz boost clock compared to 5.2GHz. That may not be such a major upgrade, though either way it will still likely be better than any other Intel- or AMD-made alternative for gaming.

AMD promises the 9850X3D pushes better performance in games upwards of 32% or 27% in titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, respectively. Is that so much better than the 9800X3D? Probably not, but if you're looking for the best possible CPU for your gaming rig, it'll probably be this one.

You already know everything you need to about what's happening inside Intel's latest laptop chips. Intel Core Ultra Series 3, aka Panther Lake, promises to offer strong performance plus a solid battery life. Now, we finally know which chips are going in which laptops, and I can already tell you you want one with the higher-end graphics capabilities.

There are a heap of different chips for various price points. The top-end Panther Lake chip is the Intel Core Ultra 388H, a 16-core CPU with a max performance core frequency of 5.1GHz. This chip will indeed sport the new Intel Arc B390 graphics with 12 of Intel's newfangled Xe3 GPU cores. Just a reminder, Panther Lake will support Wi-Fi 7 standard but not Thunderbolt 5. There will be laptops with these chips available for preorder starting Jan. 6, so pay attention to Gizmodo's CES coverage for all the specifics on that front.

In either case, Intel promises Core Ultra Series 3 will offer 60% better CPU performance over the previous-gen Lunar Lake chips. Intel also claimed laptops with these chips could get seven hours of battery life using UL Procyon Battery Life benchmarks and nine hours in a Microsoft Teams chat.

The other big upgrade this time around is the GPU capabilities. The chips are using a die-to-die bridge, allowing the chipmaker to scale up the graphics processor. The highest-end Intel chips will receive 12 Xe3 GPU cores. Sure, that means it will offer stronger gaming performance compared to a last-gen AMD chip, but Intel went as far as to claim it could manage over 50 fps in Battlefield 6 with “Overkill” graphics settings. That's only with the help of a revised XeSS upscaler. The updated XeSS 3 also has multi-frame generation capabilities, if you really don't mind the thought of playing games with so-called “fake frames.”

Intel is betting its latest chips are going to offer the secret sauce for mobile gaming. Now it's hoping to dethrone AMD on handheld PCs. Just as the company previously promised last year, Intel promised we'll see some new pint-sized gaming devices sporting Panther Lake sometime later this year.

Google TV, the operating system mainly serving the successor devices to Google's defunct Chromecast line of products, is far from ubiquitous when you compare it to the overwhelmingly more popular Roku operating system and Samsung's Tizen, but for what it's worth, GTV is the one trying the hardest to shoehorn AI into the user experience. And an upcoming change announced Monday at CES will bring image and video generation via Google Gemini's Nano Banana text-to-image model family to your TV.

Like anything announced at CES, the implied promise is that people will want to use this, and the suite of features being described here is, I have to admit, intriguing. 

There are some AI assistant features mentioned in this announcement, but since the advantage Google TV has over most smart TV operating systems is that it's connected to your Google account, the most interesting new change is that Gemini will be able to search your library on Google Photos, and apply the Nano Banana features you may have already futzed around with on your smartphone, but from the comfort of your couch this time. This means adding uncanny effects to your family photos via the Photos Remix feature, and the ability to, according to Google's press release about the update “transform memories into cinematic immersive slideshows.” 

This next ability is listed separately in Google's press release, even though it sounds a bit like the first: “Use Nano Banana and Veo to reimagine your personal photos or create original media directly on your TV.” 

As photos accompanying the announcement make clear, much of what's on offer here is designed to, well, get TV viewers to watch a slop generator.

In one image, Google AI Premium users are invited to create videos. Another shows the actual video creation interface, which has what look like Pixar-style animated sample videos with suggested prompts like, “Fluff fish swimming on coral reefs made with squishy yarn.” There's a popup at the bottom of this menu with the text, “Describe your video…” Below that is instructional text about pressing and holding the mic button on your remote to talk.

It all paints a picture of an activity you're meant to enjoy in your living room: the “generate videos of our family members” game, perhaps. But the window dressing is more wholesome and kid-oriented than Sora's more brainrot-forward approach to user-generated video.

Anecdotally, most people I know who tried Sora had their curiosity slaked after a few days on the app, and don't really revisit it. I can see that being a problem with generating custom videos on Google TV as well. But there is, at the very least, something novel about messing around with AI while curled up with the dog and a bowl of popcorn. 

 

Google's release says these features will come to certain TCL devices first, and will expand to the rest of the Google TV universe “over the coming months.”

Hyundai is not claiming that robots will take over the world, or save mankind, but on Monday at CES it may have just cracked a load-bearing pillar of investor confidence in Elon Musk and Tesla. 

Hyundai simply makes way, way, way, more cars than Tesla. Over the last three years, Hyundai sold roughly 7 million cars per year globally, while Tesla hovered around 1.8 million sales per year over that same period.

What makes Tesla, not Hyundai, the darling of Wall Street isn't the company's present day output, but the business narratives that make investors want to buy in with the expectation of an exit that will make them a fortune. Specifically, that narrative stems in part from Elon Musk's promise of a self-driving car future in which, he claims, Tesla will crush Waymo. But perhaps more importantly, it comes from Musk's claim that his Optimus line of robots is so powerful, they might end poverty, become the “biggest product of all time,” and generate “infinite” revenue.

But Tesla's line of robots has a lot to prove in a short time. It was less than five years ago that Elon Musk said he was revealing a robot prototype, but it turned out to actually be a person in a lycra bodysuit, and the whole thing was a sort of awkward, you-can't-laugh-at-me-if-I'm-laughing-too fake joke. 

Hyundai, by contrast, owns Boston Dynamics, a company three decades old, and one that pioneered the creepy, quadrupedal and then bipedal robots that used to go viral and make people make the same “kill it with fire” joke over and over. Boston Dynamics absolutely wrote the book on present-day robots. 

So with that in mind, watch the head of the Atlas program at Boston Dynamics, Zachary Jackowski, hype his robot, and keep in mind that he knows his competitor is Elon Musk:

He claims that while that thing moving around is just a research prototype, his company has been “hard at work on making the actual product version of Atlas,” and that it's going to be “the best and actually simplest robot that we have ever built.” It's going to be, he claims, water resistant, and able to endure temperatures as cold as minus 4 and as hot as 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Jackowski claims Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are putting together, the “most complete dataset in the world to train humanoid skills in manufacturing,” and that the car side of the company will soon be both using and manufacturing these things in “a new robotics factory capable of producing 30,000 Atlas robots a year.”

This is all, of course, just hype. There's no way to know what's purely meant to soothe uneasy investors and board members who are eager to slash labor costs, and what's meant to attract the attention of businesses who are thinking of becoming humanoid robot customers. 

Meanwhile, Elon Musk will only get the complete version of his famous trillion-dollar pay package if he deploys 1 million Optimus robots, so it's pretty clear what's motivating him. Nonetheless, he's pushed back the start date for Optimus robots, which, back in 2024, were supposed to be doing work in Tesla factories in 2025, and available for purchase by other companies in 2026. But Musk's claims about applications for his robots keep expanding. In November of last year he compared Optimus robots to having a “personal C-3PO/R2-D2.”

If you're reading this, Tesla probably doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, but Hyundai shouldn't either. It's a Chaebol, meaning it's one of the colossal, scandal-prone companies with troubling ties to that country's government. When it comes to creating armies of robots with the potential to crush labor power and generate “infinite” revenue, the question is not whether you should root for a company like Tesla or one like Hyundai. It's which company's outlandish narrative do you find more plausible?

AMD says the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D will live side-by-side, but the gap between them looks very small.

AMD has made a “refined” version of its Ryzen 7 9800X3D – currently the best gaming CPU you can buy – official. The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D is the “new fastest gaming processor,” says AMD, with a 400 MHz boost in clock speed over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the same 120W TDP. Overall, AMD claims the Ryzen 7 9850X3D leads its predecessor by up to 7% in games, but despite such a small gap, the company says the two chips will coexist in its lineup moving forward.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D doesn't feature any architectural changes compared to the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with AMD describing its improvements “primarily” as a frequency bump. It carries the same eight Zen 5 cores and 16 threads, just clocked higher. The new chip can reach boost clocks of up to 5.6 GHz using the same 120W thermal design as the original model.

The chip also comes with the same 104MB of total cache as its predecessor, 96MB of which is located in the shared L3 cache from which X3D chips get their name. Like the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D uses AMD's second-gen 3D V-Cache that places the SRAM chunk under the compute die instead of on top, giving the core complex direct access to the IHS to ease cooling.

This second-gen X3D design is what allowed the original Ryzen 7 9800X3D to come with official support for multiplier-based overclocking, which is the major hurdle the Ryzen 7 9850X3D faces. With decent thermal headroom on the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D, a moderate overclock is possible on most chips with adequate access to cooling. We'll have to see if that headroom is enough to make up the gap between the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

 




The Ryzen 7 9850X3D supports the same overclocking features as the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D, so you might be able to push it even higher – assuming there's enough thermal headroom to do so. You'll be able to access one-click overclocking with Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO), as well as use Curve Optimizer and Curve Shaper. AMD supports traditional multiplier-based overclocking on the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, too.

 




 




AMD broadly claims the Ryzen 7 9850X3D leads the Ryzen 7 9800X3D by 7% at 1080p, but according to AMD's own data, you shouldn't expect a major bump in most games. In Battlefield 6, for instance, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D offers no advantage, and it leads only marginally in F1 25.

Despite the 7% uplift claims AMD made in a meeting with the press, the real-world average may be even lower. As you can see from AMD's test data, the largest gains come from esports titles like Counter-Strike 2 and Rainbow Six Siege that are especially sensitive to frequency. In other titles, the lead shrinks to a <5% window, with some games posting identical results.

 




The story is similar in productivity applications, with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D posting the largest leads in frequency-dependent benchmarks like the single-thread tests in Cinebench R24 and Geekbench 6.

 




For competitive comparisons, AMD claims an average lead of 27% with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D at 1080p over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. That's a smaller lead than expected, as our own CPU benchmark hierarchy currently has the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D sitting 38% ahead of the Core Ultra 9 285K at 1080p. It's a reminder – though one surprisingly from AMD's own data – that although 3D V-Cache is very impressive, the benefits of additional cache vary from game to game.

Although AMD's claims about competitive performance are likely to hold up, the bigger question is how the Ryzen 7 9850X3D will manage to find a foothold with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D still available. Ultimately, it will depend on how prices shake out once the chip is available.

 




The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is the fourth X3D chip AMD has released this generation, crowding an already dense lineup even further. Although the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming, and the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X3D earned an elusive Editor's Choice badge in our review due to its prime mixture of gaming and productivity performance, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D didn't fare as well. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D, with its close proximity to the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D, may also struggle.

AMD hasn't shared pricing details for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D yet, but it says the chip will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. Although AMD hasn't provided a more specific release date, Alienware revealed that a version of the Area-51 Desktop will arrive in February with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

In this generation, AMD raised the price of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with the chip launching at $479 compared to the $449 the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D released at. You can find the Ryzen 7 9800X3D for around $450 now, so hopefully the Ryzen 7 9850X3D will create downward pressure on prices for its current model. It's hard to say until AMD reveals the MSRP of its latest X3D CPU, however.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D slots into existing Socket AM5 motherboards. If you're socketing the chip into an existing AM5 motherboard, make sure to grab the BIOS image with the latest AGESA before installation. Both 600- and 800-series motherboards support the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, but if you're using a 600-series board, double-check the compatibility for your specific motherboard. Although the Ryzen 7 9850X3D will technically work with Socket AM5 motherboards with an A-series chipset or the B840 chipset, those chipsets don't support CPU overclocking.

Also, keyboards made of (literal) stone.

Mechanical keyboard maker Keychron is going all in on wireless with its new Q Ultra series — which will have ZMK (rather than QMK) firmware — launched Monday at CES 2026. The Q Ultra series will be, according to Keychron, the ""first mass-produced ZMK mechanical keyboard series of its kind, offering up to 660 hours of battery life in 8K polling rate in wireless mode."" Yes, you read that correctly — 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate, thanks to the ZMK firmware. ZMK is, like QMK, open source — but it uses a different license (the MIT license), and is developed with wireless keyboards in mind (QMK doesn't natively support any wireless microcontrollers; QMK-based wireless keyboards like Keychron's Q1 HE or the Wobkey Rainy 75 Pro use dual- or hybrid microcontrollers, and still need to be wired for configuration). Anyway, all this to say that ZMK is (much) more power-efficient than QMK, as evidenced by the fact that Keychron's upcoming Q Series will have 660-hour, 8K polling rate battery life.

It's not just the firmware that's improved, of course. The Q Series will also feature Keychron's new Silk POM switches, which the company says is made from a new material that ""delivers a richer sound and improved typing feel favored by typing enthusiasts."" The keyboards will also have full aluminum bodies with layered acoustic foams and double-gasket structures for improved typing sound and feel, and double-shot PBT keycaps in a KSA profile. You'll be able to get that ultra-high 8K polling rate over both the wireless and wired connections. The Q Ultra series, launched today, comes in three layouts: the Q6 Ultra (100-percent / full-size), the Q3 Ultra (TKL), and the Q1 Ultra (75-percent). The Q6 Ultra retails for $239.99 and the Q3 and Q1 Ultra both retail for $229.99.

Keychron is also updating its V Series with new V Ultra models, which have the same improvements seen in the Q Ultra series — up to 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate thanks to the ZMK firmware, updated switches to Keychron's Silk POM switches, as well as a new 1MB Flash microcontroller. The V5, V3, and V1 Ultra all have both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity (and wired), and will be available later this month. The V5 Ultra (96-percent layout) will retail for $119.99, while the V3 Ultra (80-percent TKL layout) and the V1 Ultra (75-percent layout) will both retail for $114.99.

 




Finally, Keychron also announced a few fancy special edition luxury keyboards that are (literally) rock-solid. The Keychron K2 HE Resin and the Keychron K2 HE Concrete will both launch this Feb. — both are 75-percent layout boards with Hall Effect magnetic switches and 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity. And yes, they are made of resin and concrete.

 




The Q1 HE 8K Marble Version will launch in April 2026, and will feature an 8K polling rate and Hall Effect magnetic switches (also a 75-percent layout), and will be made out of marble (only the case, it seems — looks like the keycaps are still going to be double-shot PBT). No word on pricing for these, but I'm sure they will not be cheap.

Building your own homelab has just become more expensive


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The humble Raspberry Pi, the perennial leader of the low-power, single-board computing (SBC) world, has hit a price parity with its rival, the Intel N100-based mini PCs. An investigation by Jeff Geerling, which we've independently confirmed, shows that pricing for Pi's is now within just a few cents with a similarly configured board from brands like GMKTec. Why does this matter? Hobbyists and homelab builders had a great 2024 / 2025 which saw low prices for their DIY setups.

If you've been keeping a close eye on the PC hardware market of late, you'll have noticed prices only going one way: upward. Flash memory costs, along with tariff uncertainties last year, have forced mini PC manufacturers and retailers to raise prices across the board. As Geerling explains, an explosion in homelab builds using $100-150 mini PCs made those same PCs a better, or certainly cheaper, alternative to current-gen Raspberry Pi 5s which when bundled up with NVMe HATs, NVMe drives, cases etc, retailed for over $200 last year.

Now, the tables have turned. Geerling, who compared the prices of a GMKTec mini PC versus a Raspberry Pi 5 kit in March 2025, found in his updated investigation that the GMKTec machine he considered in his first investigation is now more expensive (albeit by only a few cents). Both systems feature 16GB RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, but given current market conditions, systems like these aren't be sold as cheaply as they were last year.

Our own comparison of rival mini PCs, based on Amazon's current pricing whilst compared with Camelcamelcamel's historical data, shows that this isn't just a brand-specific issue. For instance, the Beelink S13 with the refreshed Intel N150 CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $269, from as low as $168.99 in August 2025.

Meanwhile the Acemagic V1, with similar specs, is available for $217.54, up from $158 in August 2025, or $180 in January 2025. Geekom does offer an N100 mini PC costing $199.99 that hasn't seen a price change on Amazon in the last year, but with only 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. The Raspberry Pi is also not immune to the upward pricing trend. The cost of a Raspberry Pi has changed in recent months, and Raspberry Pi introduced a 1GB Pi 5 in order to keep a low $45 price point. A Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM is now $145, $25 more expensive than in early 2025.The cost of additional components, such as the SSD, have all added to the cost of creating your own DIY homelab.

This now leaves prospective homelab builders with three variables to consider: overall cost, power usage, and performance. Intel mini PCs are more powerful than the Raspberry Pi, even if the Pi 5 did offer a significant speed boost over the Pi 4, as our Pi 5 review explains. However, the Raspberry Pi continues to be the superior option if you're looking for the lowest power draw, even compared to the otherwise power-efficient Intel N100 and refreshed N150 mini PCs on sale.

Geerling believes that, as a result of these price rises, repurposing old hardware will be the “theme” for this new year, and one that will save you far more money, given the alternatives. This might be the status quo for some time, too. There's no end in sight for the price shocks affecting the market, with memory manufacturers warning that the crisis has only just started, and could roll on for years to come.

LEGO's Smart Brick turns 25 patents and a standard 2x4 piece into a self-contained embedded system complete with LEDs, a speaker, and a tiny, 4.1mm ASIC.

At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Lego pulled the wraps off a familiar-looking product that behaves like a small computer. The new Smart Play platform centers on a standard 2x4 LEGO brick that packs processing, sensing, audio, wireless networking, and charging into a form factor that can still snap into a model. Tied to a March 1 retail launch, the Smart Brick debuts in three Star Wars sets, with pre-orders opening January 9.

Under the plastic, Lego has built what is effectively a mixed-signal embedded system. The company says the core is a custom 4.1mm ASIC with integrated sensors, RGB LEDs, a tiny speaker, and a radio stack. Power comes from an internal rechargeable battery that charges inductively, designed so the brick can be topped up even when buried inside a build.

Interestingly, Lego says that the brick understands its surroundings. Instead of cameras or optical tracking, Lego is using near-field magnetic sensing. ‘Smart Tags' embedded in tiles and minifigures carry unique IDs that the brick reads through copper coils. Those same coils enable relative positioning, letting multiple bricks detect distance and orientation to one another. Lego calls the resulting wireless mesh BrickNet, a low-latency network that allows two models to recognize when they are facing off or interacting without an intermediary.

Audio is handled in a similar manner. Rather than storing large sound files, Lego says the Smart Brick generates effects in real time, based on prompts from SMART Minifigures and Tags, thereby keeping memory requirements low and avoiding the need for constant updates just to add new clips. “By breaking down just a few sounds to their most basic principles, you can actually carefully adjust their frequencies and amplitude to create drastically different end results,” a deep divereads. Lego calls this a “synthetic soundscape” and, all in all, it's a very hardware-first solution to a problem most smart toys solve with a requisite app.

 




For launch, the Smart Brick appears in three all-in-one Star Wars sets ranging from 473 to 962 pieces, priced between $70 and $160 — expensive, no doubt, even for Lego. Each uses the brick to trigger music, sound effects, and interactive behavior based on how the model is handled. Importantly, Lego has been clear about what the platform does not include: there is no camera, no voice recording, and no cloud-dependent AI layer. The radio link is encrypted, and firmware updates are handled through a companion app rather than an always-on connection.

This isn't the first time that Lego has added electronics to a toy, but Smart Brick does represent a first in terms of how compact and self-sufficient this implementation is. It's essentially a computer designed to disappear into the plastic, doing just enough sensing and processing to make a model feel reactive without the need to drag a tablet into the room. For a company built on tolerances measured in fractions of a millimeter, hiding a complete system inside a brick is incredibly on-brand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Heart health: Should you get your B12 from diet or supplements?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diet-vs-supplements-which-b12-form-is-better-for-health","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 07:07:30 GMT","

Vitamin B12 is important for several things, including proper formation of red blood cells and central nervous system function. The vitamin comes from animal sources, but can be added to plant sources, too. 

Vitamin B12 is available in natural and synthetic forms, and a recent comprehensive review discusses the two, as well as how vitamin B12 relates to different health conditions, like megaloblastic anemia.

The review was published in Cureus. 

The review begins by discussing critical functions of vitamin B12 and what conditions might occur when someone does not get enough vitamin B12. For example, vitamin B12 plays a role in DNA synthesis and cellular metabolism.

Vitamin B12 may also affect symptoms of depression. When someone does not have enough vitamin B12, one condition that may result is megaloblastic anemia, which involves abnormal red blood cells. 

Most often, a vitamin B12 deficiency occurs due to problems with absorption or with the body's use of the vitamin. Vitamin B12 can come from natural sources or be added to food. One particular food that is very high in the vitamin is beef liver. 

The recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 is 2.4 micrograms (mcg), with slightly higher amounts recommended during pregnancy and lactation. 

Some people at higher risk for vitamin B12 deficiency include those with certain digestive tract conditions that affect vitamin B12 absorption, as well as older adults and people following vegetarian or vegan diets. 

The cause of deficiency can vary. For example, it can be because of certain conditions like Crohn's disease, and levels may also be affected by certain medications. 

The review further discusses vitamin B12 deficiency and absorption of the vitamin. 

Someone with a vitamin B12 deficiency may present with anemia or muscle weakness. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency are vast, but can include weight loss and numbness. It is critical to treat vitamin B12 deficiency, because serious conditions like paralysis could result. 

When someone eats food with vitamin B12, it is bound to proteins. It must be removed from these proteins so a specific portion of the small intestine can absorb it. A number of key components are involved in this vitamin B12 absorption, such as pancreatic enzymes. 

Next, the review authors discuss their research methods to identify important literature on the topic of vitamin B12. The final comprehensive review included twenty-one articles. The authors' inclusion timeframe was from 1999 to 2024. 

As noted in this review, vitamin B12 is “also known as cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosyl cobalamin.” 

According to one cited study, vitamin B12 ultimately becomes a cobalamin molecule that is then “transformed into two active forms in cells, methylcobalamin and adenosyl cobalamin.” 

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12, while methylcobalamin is a natural form of the vitamin. To use cyanocobalamin, the body first has to break it down into cyanide and cobalamin and then change the vitamin B12 into active forms it can actually use, which might not be possible for some people. 

The evidence suggests that methylcobalamin is a slightly better form of vitamin B12. 

For example, animal studies show that cyanocobalamin is excreted at higher levels than methylcobalamin, suggesting better storage of cobalamins when the natural form of methylcobalamin is consumed. 

Review author, doctor of osteopathic medicine and Lifestyle Medicine Physician Christopher R. Behringer, explained to Medical News Today that “After review, methylcobalamin may be preferable in many scenarios as methylcobalamin may be more bioavailable and better retained than cyanocobalamin, whether through dietary absorption or supplementation.”

Non-review author Edward Hosbach, DO, FACOFP, a rural family physician for over 35 years, also noted the following about this review to MNT: 

“This article is a good reminder of how insidious B12 deficiency can present. Though urgency, route, medical availability and cost can be factors in replacement decisions, the natural active form methylcobalamin could provide some advantages.” 

However, this review also notes that natural and synthetic forms of vitamin B12 can both help raise vitamin B12 levels when there are deficiencies. 

Evidence further suggests that methylcobalamin may be the best form of supplementation for people who have megaloblastic anemia. 

The authors explain that this form skips over several absorption steps so that more is available for the body to use, and that this form can also convert to a molecule called S-adenosylmethionine that is important for many metabolic pathways and autophagy. 

They emphasize that doctors should first test absorption levels of B12 to decide on the best medication route. 

Next, researchers discuss infection and vitamin B12, noting its critical role in red blood cell production and how evidence suggests even red blood cells play a role in the immune response. 

Vitamin B12 also affects aspects of immune function, like helping to increase types of white blood cells. Methyl-B12 treatment, when there is a B12 deficiency, may ultimately help increase immunity. 

The data also supports that vitamin B12 may “help fight viral infections.” When it comes to people with SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that vitamin B12 supplementation could be helpful alongside other COVID-19 treatments to help with certain symptoms, although there is some mixed data. 

Still, the review suggests it may be a good idea for doctors to check B12 levels when people have infections.

The authors explain that this work is a literature review and thus mainly relies on information that has already been published. As such, they note it is a challenge to “control for bias across studies or account for population-specific differences.” 

Additionally, this review could have missed important information, and there are only three study authors, which could have impacted the outcomes. Any included articles had limitations. For example, some of the research was from non-human studies, which have a limited application to people.

There is a need for greater research in this area.

Behringer noted the following regarding future research needs: “Larger studies need to be done comparing B12 forms, especially in patients with chronic illness, malabsorption, advanced age, or genetic variants affecting metabolism.”

“Long-term clinical outcomes and symptoms need to be prioritized not just serum levels. Key open questions include whether supplementation changes long-term clinical endpoints especially when comparing supplementation delivery and formulation. [Finally,] prophylaxis in high-risk groups may warrant further study,” he added.

The researchers highlight that vitamin B12 plays a critical role in several functions, and certain populations, like older adults, may require supplementation to get enough vitamin B12. 

They further highlight methylcobalamin as perhaps the best form of vitamin B12 and encourage screening in groups who are at risk for deficiency. They suggest that finding and addressing deficiencies early could help prevent long-term neuro- and blood-related complications. 

Non-review author Aaron Chapa, DC, doctor of chiropractic, alternative clinical nutrition practitioner, and founder of Living Well Clinical Nutrition Center, noted the following: 

“This review adds clarity by showing that vitamin B12 works at a cellular and systems level, not just as a simple supplement. It reinforces that B12 supports DNA repair and ongoing cell renewal, helps regulate homocysteine, which affects heart and blood vessel health, plays a role in immune cell activity and immune balance, supports nerve insulation and signaling, influencing memory, mood, and coordination, [and it] is involved in liver function and metabolic pathways.”

People who are concerned about their vitamin B12 levels can discuss it with their doctors. From here, they can see if supplementation or dietary changes may be helpful.

The overall risk for adverse ocular effects from bisphosphonate therapy appears to be low, with events including dry eyes, cornea and ocular surface inflammation, and, rarely, uveitis. Patients who received intravenous bisphosphonates had a higher risk for ocular events than those who received oral therapy, and experiencing an ocular adverse effect was associated with an increased risk for osteonecrosis.

“Though the overall risk of ocular side effects was low, the proportion of patients with adverse effects continued to increase with continued bisphosphonate treatment,” the researchers reported.

The study was led by Samuel H. Kim, of the Medical Scientist Training Program at Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California. It was published online on December 26, 2025, in Eye.

The study relied on standard diagnosis codes and prescription data for classification, which may have led to patient misclassification or exclusion. Patients receiving ocular care outside the TriNetX system could have been missed in the analysis. The study could not evaluate the effects of discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy or characterize the longitudinal course of adverse effects. 

The study received support from the E. Matilda Ziegler Foundation for the Blind and Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc. One author reported receiving grant support from the National Eye Institute. Another author disclosed serving in consulting/advisory roles and conducting research for multiple pharmaceutical companies.

Among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), statin initiation was associated with reductions in the risks for all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular disease (CVD) regardless of their predicted short-term cardiovascular risk, according to the results of a large cohort study.

In addition, there was little or no increase in myopathy or liver dysfunction, although myalgia was more frequent with statin initiations than with nonstatin initiators.

“We anticipated benefit in higher-risk patients, but the consistency of benefit across all strata, including low-risk individuals, was striking,” said lead author Eric Yuk Fai Wan, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care and Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy at the University of Hong Kong in Hong Kong, China.

“Even modest absolute risk reductions in low-risk patients are clinically meaningful, especially given the excellent safety profile,” he told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The first author is Vincent Ka Chun Yan, PhD, also of the University of Hong Kong.

“Clinicians should consider statins for most adults with T2D, not only those at high risk, particularly if LDL [low-density lipoprotein] cholesterol is elevated,” Wan advised. “Long-term adherence is essential as benefits emerge after several years. Shared decision-making remains key, but the risk-benefit balance strongly favors statin use.”

The cohort study, using the IQVIA Medical Research Data UK database, included more than 4.5 million adults aged 25-84 years with a diagnosis of T2D between 2005 and 2016 and no baseline history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, myopathy, liver disease, rheumatic heart disease, schizophrenia, or cancer.

The adults were stratified into one of four groups based on their baseline QRISK3 score for predicted 10-year CVD risk: low (< 10%), intermediate (10%-19%), high (20%-29%), or very high (≥ 30%). After 1:4 propensity score matching to reduce confounding, 64,589, 117,630, 101,262, and 135,067 individuals in each group, respectively, were included in the study. Approximately 20% of each group initiated statins at baseline.

Over a median follow-up of 81 months for statin initiators and 75 months for nonstatin initiators in the intent-to-treat analysis, there were a total of 6858 and 32,606 deaths from any cause and 5682 and 26,677 major cardiovascular events among statin users and nonusers, respectively.

Statin initiation was associated with 10-year absolute risk reductions for all-cause mortality of 0.53%, 1.88%, 2.74%, and 4.30% for those in the low, intermediate, high, and very high groups, respectively. All were statistically significant.

For major CVD, the 10-year risk reductions were 0.83%, 2.14%, 2.59%, and 4.57%, respectively. Here, all but the reduction in the lowest QRISK3 score group were statistically significant.

There was no detectable difference in the risk for myopathy or liver dysfunction by statin use. Findings were mostly consistent among all age, sex, and baseline LDL cholesterol groups and by baseline statin intensity. However, among the lowest baseline CVD risk group, reductions in all-cause mortality and major CVD with statin use were only significant among those with baseline LDL cholesterol ≥ 2.6 mmol/L.

Findings of the per-protocol analysis taking into account the 30% who discontinued statin therapy and 15% who initiated statins after the trial began without an indication were generally consistent but of greater magnitude. Here, there were also no differences in myopathy or liver function. However, there was a small increased risk for myopathy in patients in the two lowest baseline QRISK3 score groups when the myopathy definition included muscle pain.

Asked to comment, Naveed Sattar, MBChB, PhD, professor of cardiometabolic medicine and honorary consultant at the School of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, told Medscape Medical News that the paper was “well conducted,” but “as it is observational in nature, the possibility of residual confounding remains.”

Sattar also pointed out that “the findings are broadly consistent with evidence from randomized trials. The observation that risk is also reduced in individuals with T2D and a cardiovascular risk below 10% aligns with meta-analyses of statin trials in those at lower cardiovascular risk conducted largely in nondiabetes populations.”

Guidelines on statin use for people with T2D vary. In 2018, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommended statin therapy for all adults aged 40-75 years with diabetes regardless of the 10-year risk for CVD. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommended reducing LDL cholesterol in those with T2D at high or very high risk.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and US Preventive Services Task Force recommend statins for people with T2D who have a predicted 10-year CVD risk of 10% or higher.

Wan told Medscape Medical News, “Our findings support a more inclusive approach to statin therapy in T2D and may prompt guideline committees to reconsider rigid risk thresholds. While practice change often requires replication in other populations, our results provide strong real-world evidence that could influence future updates.”

Sattar commented, “These results are not unexpected as statins are well established to lower major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk in both individuals with and those without diabetes by similar amounts for a given LDL cholesterol reduction. The present results will therefore not change current guidelines, though as statins are now so cheap, and safe their use could be argued in those at progressively lower risk levels.”

“There is a broader perspective to consider. Efforts to reduce MACE in T2D and related conditions must be accompanied by interventions that address obesity. Without such action, more people will live longer with multiple chronic conditions, resulting in greater suffering and escalating healthcare costs across high-income countries,” he added.

“The same challenges will inevitably affect low- and middle-income countries as obesity prevalence rises globally. Therefore, a far greater focus on holistic care, particularly prioritizing obesity management, must become a central component of cardiometabolic disease prevention and treatment strategies.”

The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Excellent Young Scientists Fund. Fan received research grants from the Health Bureau; the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Narcotics Division; Security Bureau; and the Social Welfare Department, Labour and Welfare Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR and National Natural Science Foundation of China. He reported serving as member of Core Team for Expert Group on Drug Registration of Pharmacy and Poisons Board and being the director of Advanced Data Analytics for Medical Science Limited.

Sattar reported receiving consulting, advisory, funding grants, and/or speaking/lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Hanmi Pharmaceutical, Janssen, Menarini Ricerche, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, and Sanofi.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

I am frustrated as I talk to you as the summer comes to an end. We saw a huge surge again this year in tick-related emergency room visits for tick bites causing Lyme disease. This year was so bad that Stony Brook Southampton Hospital out on Long Island, a real epicenter of Lyme, opened a special hospital to do nothing but treat people with tick bites and Lyme disease. 

Now, this ailment is not met with the same intensity all around the country. There are certain regions, such as East, Northeast, and the Midwest, that really have bad incidence of Lyme. What has me so irritated is that I recently went to the vet and got my dog a shot for Lyme disease. That animal shot has been around for, I don't know, 20 years, but we're not using it — for reasons I don't understand — in humans.

It's way past time to get a vaccine for humans approved based on the animal work that's been done in terms of getting a safe and fairly effective vaccine for our pets. These vaccines aren't perfect, but they're about 75% effective. They have some mild side effects, but they're very safe. They're preventing a miserable and awfully disabling disease. 

Because there was limited demand, GlaxoSmithKline (then, SmithKline Beecham), the company that had the vaccine, withdrew it. They just didn't have enough sales. They did for dogs; they didn't for people. 

Look, to put it very simply, it is time, I believe, for the federal government to go back to Glaxo and say that we have 20 years of experience with Lyme disease vaccine in animals. It's proven pretty good. It's proven very safe. Why don't you release your proprietary interest in the approved human vaccine and let somebody make it? I noticed that Pfizer is developing a vaccine for Lyme disease. Let's fast-track it. 

I know that we're somewhat tired of Lyme disease and people think there are many other things to worry about, but it's a major problem. It really makes people sick. It really disables people. It has long-term consequences for some. We have a vaccine and it was approved. It's being used in our animals. Could we please move it along and get it into human arms? 

I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Thanks for watching.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

In patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who were in endoscopic remission, achieving intestinal ultrasound (IUS) transmural healing was associated with decreased risks for CD relapse, hospitalization, and perianal complications. Absence of transmural healing was associated with relapse.

Intestinal ultrasound transmural healing “could become a new target in CD patients, reflecting a broader shift from endoscopic remission toward objective measures of deeper remission,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Clara Yzet, PhD, Amiens University Hospital, Amiens, France. It was published online in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics.

The study was limited by the lack of centralized reading for endoscopies and IUS. Only patients with mucosal healing were included.

The study did not report any specific funding. Two authors reported receiving consultant and lecture fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

The use of combined hormonal birth control was associated with a reduced risk for major adverse cardiovascular events in women with or without depression or anxiety. This protective effect did not extend to those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

“In this cohort study of 31,824 women enrolled in large, hospital-based biobank, we found preliminary evidence that hormonal contraceptive use contributed to the impact of specific stress-related psychopathologies — namely, PTSD — on adverse cardiovascular outcomes,” the investigators reported.

This study was led by Jordan L. Thomas, PhD, of Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System in Boston. It was published online on January 02, 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

This study used diagnostic codes, which may have misdiagnosed the conditions. Severity, course, and timing of contraceptives were not captured. The cohort was mostly White, non‑Hispanic patients from Boston, which limited generalizability.

Several authors reported receiving funding from multiple organizations including the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and the National Institutes of Health. Some authors reported receiving personal fees, grants, and/or having stocks in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare companies including Amissa Health, Boston Scientific, and GE Healthcare.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) was associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), including those with brain metastases.

“Since most evidence comes from retrospective studies, our findings should be interpreted as a summary of current data rather than clinical guidance,” the study authors wrote. Ongoing clinical trials, including RAPTOR and TREASURE, they added, are expected to clarify the role of cTRT in chemoimmunotherapy regimens for patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

The study, led by Dominik Wróbel, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland, was published online in Radiotherapy and Oncology.

Radiotherapy was predominantly administered to patients who responded to initial chemoimmunotherapy, whereas those with early progression were typically excluded, potentially biasing outcomes in favor of cTRT. Institutional discretion and multidisciplinary decision-making introduced selection bias. Baseline characteristics varied between patients receiving cTRT and those not receiving it.

The study did not receive any funding. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Young competitive cyclists showed greater left ventricular enlargement and exercise‑related ECG changes than master cyclists; however, right ventricular size was similar, and weekly training hours were the main predictor of left ventricular size.

""[The study] results suggest that, despite lifelong training exposure, masters cyclists demonstrate attenuated LV [left ventricular] remodeling compared with younger cyclists, who show greater LV dilation and a higher prevalence of eccentric hypertrophy,"" the authors wrote.

""Significant structural changes in older athletes should therefore prompt careful evaluation for underlying pathology,"" they added.

This study was led by Irene Juanes, University Hospital of Araba, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. It was published online on December 26, 2025, in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

The cross‑sectional design of this study precluded any cause‑effect relationships. Participants were mostly Caucasian men, which limited generalisability. Researchers excluded individuals with cardiovascular risk factors and did not have controls for training intensity and regimens.

Twins who started metformin had a 40% lower risk for being diagnosed with incident osteoarthritis over an 11-year follow-up period than their untreated co-twins.

“Our study indicates that there may be favorable effects of metformin on incident OA [osteoarthritis] diagnoses, at least when OA is diagnosed in specialist care and when we compare to individuals with no treatment,” the authors of the study wrote.

“[The study] observations point to the need of studying BMI-reducing interventions in a general population, with the aim to lower the incidence of OA,” they added.

The study was led by Karin Magnusson, PhD, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. It was published online on December 18, 2025, in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage.

Researchers could not adjust for baseline diabetes because primary care diagnoses were missing. Osteoarthritis was likely undercounted because only specialist records were used. Certain confounding factors such as diet or physical activity may have remained unaccounted for.

The study received funding from multiple sources, including the Greta and Johan Kock Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, and the Osterlund Foundation. One author reported having served as a consultant to Grünenthal Sweden AB and Key2Compliance AB. Another author disclosed being associate editor for statistics in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage.

Over half of the primiparous women experienced urinary incontinence (UI) 5-10 years after delivery. Compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery was less frequently linked with the development of UI. A family history of UI and the presence of chronic diseases or comorbidities were associated with a higher likelihood of developing UI.

""In middle-aged, non-menopausal women without prior urinary incontinence, the onset of UI in the years following childbirth is associated with a history of vaginal delivery, maternal family antecedents, and the presence of chronic diseases or comorbidities,"" wrote the authors of the study.""Therefore, given the high prevalence and significant impact on quality of life observed, we recommend implementing preventive measures with strong evidence before the onset of age-related biological changes, including menopause,"" they added.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a WHO-designated multidrug-resistant pathogen, causes severe hospital infections. With no vaccine against it, this study aims to design a multi-epitope vaccine to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics.

The researchers have screened the full proteome (5,563 proteins) to identify non-human homologous, stable, non-allergenic, adhesive, and immunogenic proteins. Furthermore, shortlisted proteins (Probable coat protein A of bacteriophage Pf1, alkaline phosphatase L, and a secreted protein) were evaluated for B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes.

Six multi-epitope constructs (DV1–DV6) with different adjuvants were designed, followed by structural validation and assessment through docking with TLR2/TLR4 and molecular dynamics simulation studies. Among them, DV5 (HBHA-conserved adjuvant) showed the strongest receptor interactions, high stability, and 98.47 % predicted global HLA coverage. Hence, our results conclude that DV5 is a promising multi-epitope vaccine candidate against P. aeruginosa, utilizing reverse vaccinology in combating MDR pathogens.

The construct included antigenic, nontoxic, non-allergenic epitopes with adjuvants to enhance immune response. It showed favorable physicochemical properties, stable immune receptor interactions, and broad HLA coverage.DV5 emerged as the most promising candidate for experimental validation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study compares H1N1 and COVID-19 spread across metropolitan areas in the U.S.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260105/Study-compares-H1N1-and-COVID-19-spread-across-metropolitan-areas-in-the-US.aspx","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 02:56:00 GMT","

Public health researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health used computer modeling to reconstruct how the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the U.S. The findings highlight the rapid spread of pandemic respiratory pathogens and the challenges of early outbreak containment. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to comprehensively compare the spatial transmission of the last two respiratory pandemics in the U.S. at the metropolitan scale. 

In the U.S., the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic was responsible for 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has so far led to 1.2 million confirmed deaths.

The researchers set out understand the geographic spread of the two pandemics to inform strategies to prevent future pandemics. They applied detailed data on the dynamics of the two infectious diseases to a computer model to simulate their spread using known patterns of air travel and commuting, as well as potential superspreading events. They focused on over three hundred metropolitan areas in the U.S.

In the simulations, both pandemics were widely circulating in most of the metro areas within weeks, before government interventions or early case detection. While the specific transmission pathways across locations were different for the last two pandemics, the spatial expansion was driven by several shared transmission hubs such as the New York and Atlanta metropolitan areas. Their spread was largely driven by air travel rather than commuting, though random dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, which makes it hard to predict where the outbreaks will happen in real time.

The rapid and uncertain spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu and 2020 COVID-19 pandemics underscores the challenges for timely detection and control. Expanding wastewater surveillance coverage coupled with effective infection control could potentially slow the initial spread of future pandemics."" 

Sen Pei, PhD, study's senior author, assistant professor of environmental health sciences, Columbia Mailman School

 Many studies have pointed to the benefits of wastewater surveillance programs. The new study further underscores the benefit of expanding wastewater surveillance for pandemic preparedness.

Beyond reconstructing the historical spread of the last two pandemics, the study also provides a generalizable framework to infer early epidemic dynamics that may be applied to other pathogens. While mobility, particularly air travel, is a key driver of pandemic spread, the researchers caution that other factors also play a role, including community demographics, school schedules, winter holidays, and weather conditions.

The study's first author is Renquan Zhang, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China. Additional authors include Rui Deng and Sitong Liu, Dalian University of Technology; Qing Yao and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University; Bryan T. Grenfell, Princeton; and Cécile Viboud, National Institutes of Health.

For more than a decade, Jeffrey Shaman and colleagues, including Sen Pei, have developed and refined methods to understand and simulate the spread of infectious diseases, including the flu, COVID-19, and others. Their real-time forecasts anticipate the rate and geographic spread of an outbreak, as well as the timing of its peak, to guide public health responses.

Shaman and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of SK Analytics. Other authors declare no competing interests.

In a new study published in Liver Research, a team of researchers in China discovered that nicotinic acid-a common form of vitamin B3-can dramatically reduce liver damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a major complication in liver surgery and transplantation.

Hepatic IRI occurs when blood flow is temporarily cut off and then restored-common during liver resection or transplant-triggering oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. While antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have shown some benefit, effective clinical therapies remain limited.""

Jia Yao, senior author

The team's findings demonstrate that nicotinic acid matches or even exceeds NAC's protective effects by targeting the root cause: damaged mitochondria. In experiments using both mice and primary hepatocytes, pretreatment with nicotinic acid markedly lowered markers of liver injury (ALT, AST, LDH), suppressed inflammation, and reduced cell death driven by ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death.

Notably, nicotinic acid markedly restored mitochondrial quality. ""It did not just act as an antioxidant-it actively promoted mitophagy (the cleanup of broken mitochondria) and mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new ones),"" says Yao. ""This dual action stabilized the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, boosted ATP production, and rebalanced cellular redox status.""

The authors noted that given its safety, low cost, and widespread availability, nicotinic acid could be rapidly translated into clinical use-potentially improving outcomes for patients undergoing liver surgery. Human trials are now being planned to confirm these benefits in real-world settings.

A research team from the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) has uncovered a key biological mechanism that explains how exercise maintain strong bones, paving the way for novel treatments for osteoporosis and bone loss in people who are unable to engage. By identifying a protein that acts as the body's 'exercise sensor', the research has opened the door to the development of drugs that mimic the effects of physical activity, offering hope for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, bedridden patients and those with chronic illnesses who face a high risk of fractures. The research findings were published in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy.

'Osteoporosis and age-related bone loss affect millions worldwide, often leaving elderly and bedridden patients vulnerable to fractures and loss of independence,' said Professor Xu Aimin, Director of the State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Chair Professor in the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed, who led the study. 'Current treatments rely heavily on physical activity, which many patients simply cannot perform. We need to understand how our bones get stronger when we move or exercise before we can find a way to replicate the benefits of exercise at the molecular level. This study is a critical step towards that goal.'

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 suffer a fracture due to weak bones. In Hong Kong, the problem is significant as the population ages, with 45% of women and 13% of men aged 65 and above affected by osteoporosis. Osteoporosis-related fractures cause significant pain and disability, severely impacting quality of life and independence, while placing a heavy healthcare and economic burden on the society.

Ageing involves the natural weakening of bones, which become less dense and more porous. Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow have the potential to develop into either fat cells or bone tissue. These stem cells are highly sensitive to external factors, like exercise and pressure. During the ageing process, they tend to differentiate into fat cells. As fat cells continue to accumulate in the bone marrow, it reduces the space available for healthy bone tissue, further compromising bone strength and creating a cycle of bone deterioration that is difficult to reverse with current treatments.

Using mouse models and human stem cells, the researchers identified a special 'switch', called Piezo1, which is a protein on the surface of mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow. This switch acts like an exercise sensor, detecting mechanical signals from physical activity that helps keep bones strong and preventing them from becoming frail as we age. In the mice model, when the Piezo1 protein was activated by physical activity, it reduced fat accumulation in the bone marrow and encouraged the formation of new bone. Conversely, when this protein is missing, it triggers signals that cause stem cells to accumulate fat, leading to increased bone loss. The absence of Piezo1 also promotes the release of certain pro-inflammatory signals (Ccl2 and lipocalin-2), making stem cells more likely to convert into fat cells, which hinders bone formation. Blocking these signals can help restore bone health.

'We have essentially decoded how the body converts movement into stronger bones,' said Professor Xu Aimin. 'We have identified the molecular exercise sensor, Piezo1, and the signalling pathways it controls. This gives us a clear target for intervention. By activating the Piezo1 pathway, we can mimic the benefits of exercise, effectively tricking the body into thinking it is exercising, even in the absence of movement.'

Dr. Wang Baile, Research Assistant Professor from the same department, who co-led the research, added, 'This discovery is especially meaningful for older individuals and patients who cannot exercise due to frailty, injury or chronic illness. Our findings open the door to developing ""exercise mimetics"" - drugs that chemically activate the Piezo1 pathway to help maintain bone mass and support independence.'

'This offers a promising strategy beyond traditional physical therapy,' remarked Professor Eric Honoré, Team Leader at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, French National Centre for Scientific Research, who co-led the research. 'In the future, we could potentially provide the biological benefits of exercise through targeted treatments, thereby slowing bone loss in vulnerable groups such as the bedridden patients or those with limited mobility, and substantially reducing their risk of fractures.'

The research team is now working to translate these findings into clinical applications, with the goal of developing new treatments to preserve bone health and improve the quality of life for an aging population and those confined to bed.

Every year, millions of infants and children undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the world. Sevoflurane is a commonly used pediatric anesthetic. Its exposure during brain development has been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and cause cognitive dysfunction in animal models. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Normal neurogenesis constitutes the neurobiological foundation for higher-order brain functions, such as learning and memory. Lipid metabolism is crucial for the regulation of neurogenesis.

""Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) is a key molecule in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and PPARα serves as the principal regulatory factor of CPT1a. However, the potential alterations in FAO mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/CPT1a pathway in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) following sevoflurane exposure, and its potential role in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive dysfunction, remain unclear.

NSPCs, NE-4C cells, and postnatal day 7 rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 hours. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify whether sevoflurane exposure inhibits neurogenesis. The Morris water maze was employed to explore whether sevoflurane exposure impairs cognitive function. Untargeted lipidomics, FAOBlue staining, RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, CPT1a enzyme activity assay, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to validate the impact of sevoflurane exposure on FAO in NSPCs. Octanoate pretreatment, CPT1a overexpression, PPARα agonist palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and FAO substrate carnitine pretreatment were collectively employed to reveal the role of FAO and PPARα in NSPCs on sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment.

Sevoflurane exposure inhibited neurogenesis and impaired cognitive function. In NSPCs, sevoflurane exposure caused extensive changes in lipid metabolism intermediates, inhibited the mRNA expression of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), acyl-CoA oxidase 3 (ACOX3), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase beta subunit (HADHB), CPT1a, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short-chain (ACADS), and solute carrier family 22 member 5 (SLC22A5), suppressed FAO activity, and decreased the protein expression and activity of CPT1a. Enhancing FAO activity in NSPCs attenuated sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis impairment. Overexpression of CPT1a rescued sevoflurane-induced inhibition of FAO activity and neurogenesis in NE-4C cells. Besides, sevoflurane exposure reduced the expression levels of PPARα in the nuclei of NSPCs and hippocampal tissue. Pretreatment with PEA increased the nuclear content of PPARα and the expression of CPT1a in NSPCs and the rat hippocampus after sevoflurane exposure. Moreover, pretreatment with PEA or the CPT1a substrate carnitine rescued the sevoflurane-induced decrease of FAO activity in NSPCs, inhibition of neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and the cognitive impairment.

Previous work has not investigated whether or how FAO participates in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive decline. Our study showed that sevoflurane inhibited neurogenesis and impaired cognitive function likely by inhibiting FAO in NSPCs through the PPARα/CPT1a pathway.This study reveals a new potential mechanism of sevoflurane neurodevelopmental toxicity. Future research is needed to clarify the role of FAO in NSPCs in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment, and to explore the mechanisms that execute this FAO-dependent effect.

An antibody activates the immune system's cellular and cytoplasmic defence to combat a pathogen. This occurs via interactions of the Fc (CH2-CH3) region to activate three effector function pathways and impacts half-life of antibody (Figure 1). These can be modulated via several Fc mutations to achieve bespoke effects, specific to project needs.

A recent study published in the medical journal Gut has revealed a novel cancer-promoting mechanism of Streptococcus anginosus (Sa). The research shows that methionine metabolites produced by this bacterium can significantly contribute to the development of gastric cancer.

This finding deepens the understanding of the gut microbiome's role in cancer and opens new paths for microbiota-targeted prevention strategies.

Gastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer globally, predominantly affecting East Asia (especially China, Japan, Korea) and Eastern Europe. Understanding its multifactorial causes is critical for developing effective prevention strategies.

Etiology-based prevention is a cornerstone of effective disease control. Helicobacter pylori (Hp), the first prokaryote identified as carcinogenic to humans, was classified as a Group I carcinogen by the WHO in 2017. Beyond Hp, the stomach hosts various microbes, and growing evidence links certain species to increased gastric cancer risk. This microbial association has become a key focus in cancer research. In 2022, a multi-center cohort study revealed a strong positive association between stool Sa abundance and the risk of gastric cancer. Later, a study published in Cell, a Chinese team uncovered the carcinogenic mechanism of Sa in mouse models.

Academician of the CAS Fang Jingyuan and his team at Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, with BGI Genomics, show that Sa-derived methionine metabolites promote gastric cancer with multiple approaches. They successfully isolated Sa strains from tumor tissues and confirmed their tumor-promoting effects.

Methionine is an essential amino acid for humans. Previous studies have reported that methionine can promote the growth of various cancer cells. Mechanistically, methionine enhances the expression of MAT2A and increases its transport into cells. This process supplies energy to tumor cells and promotes their growth.

Metagenomic analysis revealed that Sa is enriched in the gut microbiota of gastric cancer patients, alongside a significant increase in the methionine biosynthesis pathway. A strong positive correlation was observed between Sa abundance and methionine levels (Figure 1). Metabolomic analysis further confirmed higher levels of methionine-related metabolites in tumor tissues.

Despite growing interest in microbial contributions to cancer, pinpointing causative bacterial strains remains a major challenge due to high species and strain-level diversity. To address this, the researchers successfully isolated and cultured three Sa strains directly from gastric tumor samples. These strains were tested and confirmed to possess methionine synthesis capabilities, alongside notable tumor-promoting effects in both mouse models and gastric cancer cell lines.

To further validate these findings, comparative genomic analysis confirmed the presence of the metE gene, essential for methionine biosynthesis, in all Sa strains (Figure 2). This includes strains from the Shenzhen BGI Human Gut and Oral Microbiota Repository.

This study reveals a clear link between microbial metabolism and tumor growth, highlighting bacteria-derived methionine as a key driver. Sa may serve as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target for gastric cancer. The isolated clinical strains provide a foundation for deeper research into its diversity and pathogenicity, supporting more precise prevention strategies.

Dr. Zhou Chengbei and Dr. Zhao Licong and Dr. Yu Jingchen from Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Research Scientist Dr. Qin Youwen from BGI Genomics, and Wenxi Li, a master's graduate from BGI Education Center (supervised by Professor Zou Yuanqiang), are co-first authors of the study. Dr. Qin Youwen and Professor Fang Jingyuan (member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) from Renji Hospital are co-corresponding authors.

By uncovering how Sa reprograms host metabolism, this study highlights the critical role of microbial metabolites in cancer development. The isolated clinical strains lay a foundation for deeper exploration of Sa diversity and pathogenicity. It offers new directions for precision prevention and control of gastric cancer.

The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation today revealed compelling new research pointing to major healthcare access challenges and financial burdens disproportionately affecting young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The national survey, conducted by the Foundation, assessed healthcare and financial experiences across three groups: young adults aged 18-25, adults aged 26-64, and caregivers of pediatric patients under 18.

The findings, published today in Crohn's & Colitis 360, are based on responses from over 1,700 IBD patients and caregivers.

Key findings:

The goal of the survey was to assess the state of access to care for patients with IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and affects approximately 1 in 100 Americans. The study was conducted as an online survey of IBD patients and their caregivers in the United States from February to June 2023.

These numbers demonstrate a clear gap in support and guidance for young adults as they transition from pediatric care and begin managing their own health insurance. The data show that not only are younger patients at greater risk of having to jump through insurance hoops to access essential medications, they also face substantial financial pressure-often working extra jobs just to afford care.""

Laura Wingate, Chief Education, Support & Advocacy Officer, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation

""The research highlights a need for targeted educational resources, improved insurance navigation assistance, and policy attention to mitigate the unique challenges faced by young adults with IBD,"" said the study's lead author, Ross Maltz, MD, pediatric gastroenterologist, Nationwide Children's Hospital.

The Foundation is calling on partners, advocates, and the broader healthcare community to help amplify these findings and promote equitable access to care for all age groups.

A new study shows that where older adults live may matter more than age itself when it comes to maintaining the strength needed for everyday movements like standing up, pointing to neighborhood disadvantage as a hidden driver of mobility decline.

Study: Neighborhood Deprivation Associated with Impaired Sit-to-Stand Performance in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis with Clinical Implications. Image credit: aijiro/Shutterstock.com

A study published in the journal Healthcare links neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation to poorer mobility outcomes in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults.

Mobility, defined as the ability of an individual to move safely and independently, is a key determinant of overall well-being in older adults. A gradual decline in mobility with age significantly affects an individual's ability to perform daily-life activities and engage in social interactions.

Neighborhood-level socioeconomic status is a significant factor influencing mobility. Existing evidence indicates that living in socioeconomically deprived areas increases the risk of various health adversities, chronic diseases, functional disability, and mortality.

Given the increasing socioeconomic health inequalities in recent decades, researchers from Auburn University, USA, conducted a study to explore the relationship between neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantages and mobility outcomes in aging populations.

The study included a total of 110 community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults. Participants' mobility was assessed using the Instrumented Timed Up and Go (iTUG) test and the Instrumented Five Times Sit-to-Stand (i5TSTS) test.

The iTUG test measures postural transitions that are important for daily life activities. Longer time taking during postural transitions is associated with increased risks of falls, disability, and mortality in older adults.

The i5TSTS test measures lower limb strength, which is essential for transitioning from sitting to standing position. A longer time taken during the sitting-to-standing transition is associated with an increased risk of falls and a reduced ability of older adults to independently perform daily life activities.

Neighborhood-level socioeconomic status was measured using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which captures various domains of socioeconomic disadvantage, including income, education, employment, and housing conditions within a neighborhood.

The study found significant variations in lower limb strength and sitting-to-standing transition duration between areas with diverse socioeconomic status. Specifically, participants from more disadvantaged areas exhibited poorer performance in the sitting-to-standing transition test.

Regarding postural transition durations, the study found no significant differences across the ADI groups for overall iTUG duration. However, the sit-to-stand phase of the postural transition test showed a significant association with neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantages.

Other iTUG components, such as walking speed and turning, showed no consistent or robust associations with socioeconomic deprivation, although turning performance demonstrated marginal significance in some unadjusted analyses.

The study reveals that older adults from socioeconomically deprived areas experience significantly reduced lower limb strength and function. A similar negative impact of area-level socioeconomic disadvantage has been observed on the ability of older adults to rise from a seated position (sit-to-stand phase).

The observed selective impact on the sit-to-stand phase of postural transitions, which primarily depends on the lower limb strength, highlights condition-specific susceptibility of older adults to logistic, capital, and other resources that characterize disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Regarding other phases of postural transitions, such as walking speed and turning, the study did not find a consistent, adjusted, significant impact of socioeconomic disadvantages. This finding suggests that these postural aspects may be more resilient to neighborhood-level influences or rely on different physiological systems.

Overall, these observations indicate that socioeconomic deprivation of a given region does not affect all mobility domains equally. Instead, it has a direct influence on muscle-dependent postural transitions.

Multiple factors related to socioeconomic disadvantage, including lack of physical activity resources, nutritional inadequacies, chronic stress, and inaccessibility to the healthcare system, can collectively contribute to the observed reduction in mobility outcomes.

The lack of safe walking paths, adequate lighting, and age-appropriate exercise equipment can potentially restrict older adults from regularly performing walking or other outdoor exercises. Limited transportation access further restricts their ability to reach available resources. Such physical inactivity can contribute to observed disparities in sit-to-stand performance.      

Similarly, nutritional deprivation, such as inaccessibility to affordable, nutrient-dense foods and the easy availability of fast-food outlets and convenience stores, can lead to protein, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies, resulting in the deterioration of muscle mass, strength, and function.

Socioeconomic deprivation is frequently associated with chronic health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease. All these diseases can potentially impair muscle functions and reduce mobility, especially in sit-to-stand movements. These chronic conditions require regular medical care, which is also inaccessible or available in poor quality in socioeconomically deprived areas, further deteriorating mobility outcomes.

Overall, the study observations have implications for developing targeted interventions, such as sit-to-stand interventions. Implementing mobility screening at community health fairs and primary care clinics in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas would be helpful in identifying at-risk populations.

Prioritizing investments for developing infrastructure in deprived areas, such as outdoor fitness equipment, benches, and safe walking paths, would be another strategy to improve mobility and overall well-being in older adults.

Due to the cross-sectional design, the study was unable to determine the causality of the observed associations. It remains uncertain whether the observed reduction in mobility outcomes is caused by current neighborhood conditions or due to long-term exposure to disadvantaged environments. Future research tracking changes in both neighborhood characteristics and mobility measures over time would provide stronger evidence for causal associations.

A new review of randomized trials shows that while ChatGPT-style AI can improve education and trust in digestive care, hard evidence from real patients remains in short supply. 

Study: Randomized controlled trials evaluating large language models in digestive diseases: a scoping review. Image credit: Pixel-Shot/Shutterstock.com

A new scoping review published in Gastroenterology & Endoscopy examines how randomized controlled trials are being used to test large language models, such as ChatGPT, in the diagnosis and management of digestive diseases, revealing both early promise and significant evidence gaps.

Digestive disorders cause disease and even death for billions of people around the world. Their diagnosis often follows a long and complex path, and treatment is similarly intricate, integrating clinical, imaging, and tissue-level data obtained through biopsy. Artificial intelligence (AI) could shorten this period and streamline the process, potentially improving accuracy and enhancing patient communication.   

Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are a type of AI that processes vast volumes of text data to produce human-like language outputs. Since the public release of ChatGPT in late 2022, LLMs have made extensive inroads into all forms of communication.

In healthcare, LLMs may help impart medical education and enhance the speed and quality of diagnosis, patient education, and treatment. They could also make documentation and administrative tasks easier.  

However, LLMs currently suffer from potentially dangerous flaws, including hallucinations, incoherent or inaccurate text, and unreliable outputs; the use of biased algorithms leading to inequitable decision-making; and issues related to data privacy and security. This makes it all the more important to prove that their use in healthcare is safe and useful for actual patient outcomes or that it provides better, less expensive, and safer healthcare.

Unlike the case with medical education or technical tasks like classification, hard evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is required to evaluate the contribution of LLMs to actual patient care.

The current study is a scoping review of RCTs assessing the use of LLMs in the diagnosis and treatment of digestive disorders using actual patient data and examining the performance of specified tasks by specific LLMs or algorithms, along with the type of trial design and the kind of results reported. In contrast, most earlier studies stopped with examining the role of LLMs in improving medical knowledge in this field, such as the score achieved on medical licensing examination questions.

The study included 14 RCTs, either ongoing or published, of which only four involved real patients. The trials largely took place in China and the United States, and were mostly confined to single centers, with a median sample size of 258. Most dealt only with gastrointestinal diseases, and several with hepatobiliary conditions.

The outcome most often measured related to managing the patient's care, with several focusing on the patient experience or on professional competence.

The study found that a variety of models were used in this field, both general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT and those designed for a specific domain. The latter included ScreenTalk, an AI application designed to promote colorectal cancer screening among individuals whose first-degree relatives had the condition, and the Voice-Assisted Remote Symptom Monitoring System (VARSMS), which helps patients undergoing surgery for gut cancers during their postoperative period.

Domain-specific LLMS may outperform general-purpose heavyweight models, such as GPT-4, in certain areas, notably those that do not involve answering (especially open-ended) questions or require summary generation or data simplification.

This could lead to the development of more specific, computationally efficient, medical LLMs for each task rather than increasingly powerful general-purpose models. Even now, multimodal LLMs that make use of many different sources and types of patient data are being evaluated through RCTs to provide more well-rounded recommendations, promoting precision medicine.

The most frequently encountered study design compared LLM-assisted care with unassisted approaches in terms of the selected outcome. A few compared clinician care or routine clinical care with LLM-assisted care. Most ongoing trials focused on patient education and clinical decision-making.

The researchers found that LLMs were mostly used to help make clinical decisions and to educate patients. In an ongoing trial, an LLM called GutGPT was developed to assist in the care of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

This was used to generate care recommendations based on accepted guidelines. To achieve this, it combined modeling to estimate patient risk with LLM-based guidance on clinical decisions.

This was tested in a two-phase RCT. The interim results were included in the current study. Overall, LLMs improved patient trust and acceptance of healthcare technology and enhanced medical understanding of educational content.

NLP was mainly used to answer questions. Further study should identify the utility of these tools for the other tasks.

The small number of studies on this topic, coupled with the preliminary nature of many of them, limits generalizability and relevance, emphasizing the need for future research. Additionally, several RCTs did not report following established reporting guidelines.

Bias risk was assessed to be significant due to randomization flaws, failure to follow protocol, imperfect outcome measurements, and result reporting bias.

However, prior studies suggest that RCTs are key to identifying the real value of LLMs in medicine. Beyond simply offering medical education and answering questions, they could also handle tasks such as evaluating participants' knowledge, summarizing documents, drafting responses, or identifying topics that require further research.

Future RCTs to evaluate medical LLM use should address questions about how LLM performance is to be systematically measured, when an LLM-based intervention is appropriate, broadening the scope of LLMs in digestive disorders, reducing bias, ensuring proper ethical and regulatory approvals, and the availability of real patient outcomes.

The optimal scenario is one where both patients and providers are satisfied, while workload is reduced and clinical outcomes are improved.

LLMs hold promise for the management of digestive diseases. This assumption should be validated by international multicenter RCTs that focus on actual patient outcomes.

The maternal microbiome and immune system have both independent and synergistic effects on fetal brain health - changes in the mother's immune system have been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. A new study, published today in Nature Neuroscience, expands our understanding of this ""gut-immune axis"" by mapping the impact of stressors during pregnancy – namely changes in the microbiome and activation of the immune system - on the neuroimmune landscape of the developing fetal brain.

The research team, led by Brian Kalish, MD, Physician in Medicine in the Division of Newborn Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital, discovered notable sex-specific responses, including vulnerability for a specific immune pathway in the male brain that could be a potential target for early intervention.

Our study establishes a detailed spatial transcriptomic resource of immune gene networks during a critical window of embryonic brain development. Unlike previous atlases focused on the adult brain, our dataset captures dynamic immune signaling interactions at a stage when the brain is highly vulnerable.""

Brian Kalish, MD, Physician in Medicine, Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital

The team integrated in situ spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) with single cell RNA-seq data. This dual-modality approach enabled them to (1) create a developmental cell atlas of immune gene expression in the embryonic mouse brain during mid- and late-gestation; (2) map the spatial location of neurodevelopmental-relevant genes in the developing brain; (3) reveal sex-specific responses of the developing brain to maternal gut-immune disruptions; (4) nominate a specific pathway – known as the CXCL12/CXCR7 signaling pathway - as an important mediator of abnormal neural differentiation.

""As a neonatologist, this work adds to our understanding early-life environmental factors that may impact neurodevelopmental potential and lends insights for potential interventions"", added Kalish.

This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Sophie O'Neil, Kyle Thompson, Rita Pereira, Emily Russell and Stuart McElroy and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with BioAscent Discovery Ltd and University of Glasgow.

Multiple HEK-293T cell lines stably expressing human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors were generated at BioAscent via cationic lipid-mediated transfection and Hygromycin B selection. Receptor expression levels were quantified in all clones by RT-qPCR, and three clones per receptor were progressed, based on a range of expression levels (Figure 1), for full pharmacological characterisation using intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation FLIPR (Figure 2) and xCELLigence label-free impedance (Figure 3) assays.



Figure 1. Quantification of 5-HT2A/5-HT2B receptor expression by RT-qPCR. 10 ng of cDNA was used for qPCR with PowerUpTM SYBR Green Master Mix. Transcript levels were normalised to GAPDH and expressed relative to the lowest expressing clone using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Mean triplicate expression data ± SEM is shown. (n=3/N=3).

Figure 4. 5-HT2 receptor agonists show expression-dependent potency and efficacy profiles at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. Agonist DRCs were normalised to DMSO (min control) and 10 μM 5-HT (max control) and plotted for 5-HT2A (A) and 5-HT2B (B) stable cell clones. Mean duplicate data from three independent runs (n=2/N=3) is shown ± SEM. Mean agonist potencies (pEC50) and mean Emax ± SEM are tabulated for each clone. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Sophie O'Neil et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.



Figure 5. 5-HT2 agonists produce positive dose-dependent impedance responses. Normalised cell index traces (A, C) from 5-HT2A Clone #1 following stimulation with 5-HT (A) and Psilocin (C). Normalised cell index values were converted to ‘% Impedance Response' relative to the baseline and 10 μM 5-HT responses, and plotted as dose-response curves for 5-HT2A Clones #1 and #2 (B; 5-HT, D; Psilocin). Image Credit: Image courtesy of Sophie O'Neil et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.



Figure 6. The 5-HT2A inverse agonist, Volinanserin, produces a negative dose-dependent impedance response in 5-HT2A clones with high receptor reserves. Normalised cell index traces from 5-HT2A Clone #1 (A), Clone #2 (B) and Clone #3 (C) following pretreatment with Volinanserin. Baseline normalised cell index values for all three clones were plotted against Volinanserin concentration, to generate inverse agonist dose-response curves (D) at the peak negative impedance response.

We show that differences in receptor levels significantly alters the pharmacological profiles of 5-HT2A/2B ligands across different assay technologies. Failure to account for receptor density/reserves may lead to underestimation of partial agonism/inverse agonism and off-target toxicity in pre-clinical screens, especially for CNS-active compounds like psilocin/norpsilocin. These findings underscore the necessity to incorporate multiple physiologically-relevant models and assay approaches into pre-clinical drug safety/efficacy profiling, to ensure accurate predictions of clinical outcomes.

One of the most popular kits in U.S. men's national team history may be returning for the 2026 World Cup.

According to a leak from Footy Headlines, the USMNT will utilize a red and white striped jersey for the tournament on home soil next summer.

The Nike kit is reminiscent of the team's “Waldo” jersey, which was U.S. Soccer's primary kit from 2012 until 2014. It has remained a fan-favorite in the intervening years, with many calling for its return.

The new design is a slight departure from the previous look, with a wavy stripe pattern replacing the straight horizontal stripes.

A navy Nike swoosh is on the left side of the jersey with the U.S. Soccer crest on the right.

The jersey is also a callback to the primary kit from the 1994 World Cup, the last time the USMNT served as the tournament's host. That kit also used a red and white striped pattern, but with vertical stripes instead of horizontal.

The U.S. women's national team would also wear the new jersey along with the men's team. The new primary kit is set to be released in early 2026.

The new kit could become a huge hit with the USMNT set to serve as co-host of the World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.

Mauricio Pochettino's side has been drawn in Group D along with Australia, Paraguay and a European team yet to be determined.

United States forward Timothy Weah (21) dribbles the ball against England during the first half of a group stage match during the 2022 World Cup at Al Bayt Stadium on Nov. 25, 2022.

Diego Luna of the United States dribbles the ball up the filed against Uruguay during the second half of a international friendly match at Raymond James Stadium on Nov. 18, 2025 in Tampa, Florida.

The soccer jersey designers over at Nike have a difficult job, especially when it comes to the U.S. men's national team. Compared to national teams like Argentina, Croatia and the Netherlands, the USMNT lacks an iconic look to build every design around.

The design with the most potential, though, to serve as the USMNT's identifying look came in 2012 with the ""Waldo"" kits. But despite fans clamoring for Nike to bring back the distinctive design, Nike has intentionally avoided just that.

Well, Nike may have finally listened to the fans.

With the U.S. set to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico, there has been plenty of curiosity around the yet-to-be-released USMNT kits. And on Monday night, we got our first possible look at what that design will be. Say it with me now: The Waldo's are back!

In an article from the jersey-tracking site FootyHeadlines — which has a solid track record on accurate jersey leaks — the USMNT is expected to bring back a variation of the Waldo jersey design.

This version would have more of a wavy stripe pattern as opposed to straight horizontal stripes, and the white would be more of an off-white cream color than true white. The image that FootyHeadlines got a hold of also happened to be the USWNT kit with the four stars above the badge. But traditionally, the men's and women's teams share jersey designs in men's World Cup years.

It's neither confirmed nor official yet, but the leaked design had USMNT fans happy with Nike for the first time in years.","{'href': 'https://ftw.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

With the same steely gaze he wore as he patrolled midfields during an illustrious career spanning nearly two decades, Michael Bradley sat eagerly and excitedly as he took questions as the New York Red Bulls' newest head coach.

Though Monday was Bradley's introductory press conference, he has long been at work preparing for this role. The former U.S. men's national team captain has been ever-present at the Red Bulls' training facility and, from afar, it's easy to forget he's planning training sessions and not preparing to take part in them.

In fact, when head of sport Julian de Guzman peered through the glass windows at RBNY's training facility to see someone running wind sprints on the practice field, he wondered which player it was — only to take a closer look and see it was his 38-year-old head coach.

“An individual like Michael doesn't come around very often,” de Guzman told the media on Monday.

De Guzman and the Red Bull hierarchy had no reservations over whether Bradley was ready for this job or not. Bradley took over as Red Bulls II head coach this summer, joining midseason and helping continue the development of young players. All he did was lead the team to the MLS Next Pro Cup title.

Bradley didn't hesitate to seize the opportunity, either.

“How in the world could you say no?” Bradley asked as he broke his seriousness with a smile.

“Like anything in life, you can ask yourself certain questions,” Bradley continued. “‘Is it the right time? Am I ready? What about this, what about that?' Well, certain things come and you have to go for it. This one took me about half a second to realize I'm going for this one.”

Bradley, who began his playing career with the franchise when it was still the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, retired as a player at the end of the 2023 season. In his final years with Toronto FC, Bradley sat in on many coaches' meetings under Greg Vanney. He has long known he wanted to go into coaching after he hung up his boots and many viewed him as an extension of the coaching staff on the field, even in his younger days, such was his pedigree, soccer intellect and leadership.

Upon retiring, his early days in coaching included an assistant stint for his dad, Bob Bradley, at Stabaek in Norway, and a brief guest stint under Jesse Marsch with the Canadian national team. Now, he has a team and a job to call his own.

“This guy is here to win,” de Guzman said. “Everybody feeds off of that. That creates culture. This is the person you want every day in the building. It makes you enjoy and love your job.”

Bradley's age won't be abnormal in this league, either. Minnesota United's Eric Ramsay (34), St. Louis City's Yoann Damet (35) and the Colorado Rapids' Matt Wells (37) are all younger. The tides of global soccer continue to evolve, and younger coaches at clubs big and small are getting first-team chances.

A fresh voice and perspective are welcomed in Harrison, N.J., where the club parted ways with manager Sandro Schwarz after failing to make the postseason last year for the first time since 2009. The tactics will get a refresh under Bradley, too.

Just as he implemented during his time with RBNY II, Bradley plans to change the team's typically narrow, pressing- and transition-based system to one that values possession a bit more and plays wider, particularly with the use of wingers.

The prototypical Red Bull global-style energy will still be there, but the club wants to evolve its game model.

“It's easy to sit up here and talk about it on January 5, but this is the fun part now,” Bradley said. “Taking the ideas we have in our heads and bring them to life.”

That undertaking won't happen overnight.

The roster is at a place of transition, though the Red Bulls are doing what they can to create flexibility. Key departures to headline the offseason include Carlos Coronel, Lewis Morgan, Peter Stroud, Sean Nealis, Kyle Duncan and Alexander Hack. So far, just two senior players have arrived — Cade Cowell and Justin Che.

More changes will come this month and next. It's a process, but the Red Bulls are fully stuck into this task, from de Guzman to Bradley and everyone inside the building.

“To be trusted as the person to lead this club going forward, it's a huge honor and something that I am going to commit my absolute life to,” Bradley said. “To make sure we are able to put a team on the field our fans are proud of, to represent our club, this community, in a way where everybody who comes into this stadium feels a part of.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","EXCL: Inside Chelsea: The truth about the project","https://siphillipstalkschelsea.substack.com/p/inside-chelsea-the-truth-about-the?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:59:30 GMT","

Recently, I had the opportunity to sit down with Chelsea's Sporting Leadership Team to discuss the club's project, raise concerns, and gain a clearer understanding of the long-term strategy. I hope this article provides insight into Chelsea's inner workings and explains why I remain positive about where the club can go, if execution is right.

The key concerns I highlighted were:

A youth-focused recruitment strategy leading to inconsistent performances

Inexperience across the club

Gaps within the squad

Whether the project can realistically deliver major trophies

Whether Chelsea's ambition is to win titles or simply secure top-four finishes

First, it was important to understand where this strategy comes from and why Chelsea believe it is necessary. The club recognises that there are around five European teams that are effectively impossible to compete with directly on a financial level, due to differences in overall revenue, stadium income, and state ownership - PSG, Bayern, Barca, Real Madrid and Man City.

Attempting to compete in the same way long-term would leave Chelsea vulnerable. In truth, that way of working was already showing signs of strain under Roman Abramovich. While successful in cups, Chelsea's league form fluctuated significantly. The club last won the Premier League in 2016/17, and across the remaining seasons under Roman, Chelsea averaged a fourth-place finish, around 25 points off the title pace.

In truth, Chelsea have not yet found the right balance between the two, resulting in inconsistent performances and a significant number of dropped points from winning positions. While the youthfulness of the squad has played a role in this, it is far from the only factor. Enzo Maresca's limited ability to influence games from the bench also contributed to these issues.

Chelsea understand that knockout competitions like the FA Cup, League Cup, or even the Champions League can be won with favourable draws and timely form. Look at the Club World Cup in the summer for example! The true litmus test, however, is the league. You cannot fluke a 38-game season. You must be consistently elite.

This reality drove the decision to commit to a full rebuild: lowering the average squad age, restructuring wages, and building a sustainable future, while still remaining competitive in the present.

Importantly, the minimum expectation at Chelsea has not changed. Champions League qualification every season remains the baseline. Much of the rebuilding work has now been completed, and the current squad should be capable of finishing in the top five this season and beyond.

That does not mean Chelsea will stop investing. Rather, a significant amount of groundwork has already been laid.

It is also worth noting that Chelsea have not been operating freely in the transfer market. PSR restrictions during 2024, alongside UEFA sanctions last season, limited flexibility. Those UEFA issues have now been navigated, and upcoming changes to PSR rules should offer greater room to manoeuvre.

This should not be interpreted as a radical shift in strategy, but it will provide more freedom moving forward.

Chelsea's next challenge is closing the gap to the teams above and then competing consistently for the Premier League and Champions League. Crucially, the club wants to sustain that level once reached, rather than spike and fall away again.

A comparison can be made with Arsenal's recent rise, though Chelsea's aim is to finish the job rather than fall short.

Everything Chelsea do is framed for the long-term benefit. The club does not want to mortgage its future for short-term optics. That does not mean Chelsea will never sign older players or those without resale value, but such deals must make sense holistically. There is no under-23s-only rule.

To date, under this sporting leadership, the right opportunity has not yet presented itself.

Take Antoine Semenyo as an example. A £65m fee plus wages exceeding £200k per week would significantly disrupt the wage structure without materially changing Chelsea's performance this season. However, if in the future a player represents the missing piece in a title push, the club would not hesitate to act.

One key takeaway from the meeting was the level of self-reflection and accountability within the club. Despite media portrayals, the sporting team is under immense pressure to deliver, but is also protected and empowered to make decisions aligned with the club's long-term interests.

Without this structure, clubs end up making reckless win-now decisions that cause long-term damage.

Examples include signing injury-prone strikers for £125m when also signing high-potential options with Isak and Ekitike, or committing massive fees and wages to forwards who are not elite and difficult to sell. Players such as Havertz or Gyökeres on £250k per week or more restrict resale markets to only a handful of clubs worldwide.

Another thing I want to point out is they know they haven't been perfect, they know they have made mistakes and they have processes in place to ensure the same mistakes aren't made.

There is little value in dwelling on Maresca now that he has departed. However, it is clear that the relationship had broken down, and change was necessary.

Outside of other issues, as I stated on The Blues Feed, Chelsea should be the destination, not a stepping stone. If a manager or player is openly flirting with other clubs, they should be moved on. Full commitment is non-negotiable.

Contrary to some reports, Chelsea categorically deny influencing team selection beyond player welfare and injury prevention. The club's medical and performance teams, among the best in football, provide recommendations based on injury risk and conditioning.

Final decisions remain with the manager. If a player is cleared for only 45 minutes, the manager decides whether that time comes from the start or the bench.

Greater transparency around this process may have avoided fan backlash in situations such as Cole Palmer's substitution. Had supporters known he could not complete 90 minutes, the reaction may have been different.

Claims that Maresca was not consulted on transfers are simply false. He approved all summer signings and was actively involved throughout the process.

While he did want a centre-back, he was unwilling to sanction departures to create space, and no suitable option emerged following the pursuit of Dean Huijsen. Liverpool found themselves in a similar position.

Chelsea's recruitment model is a partnership. There are no manager-only or club-only signings. Both approaches fail long-term.

Liam is not an unknown quantity to Chelsea. The club has known him for years, and he has worked within the structure for 18 months. He has longstanding relationships within the sporting team.

He is described as hardworking, humble, intelligent, and articulate, someone the players and fans are likely to connect with. His track record shows consistent overperformance and strong player development.

Tactically, he has already impressed against elite coaches such as Luis Enrique and Oliver Glasner. With the youngest squads in Europe, it will be fascinating to see what he can achieve with improved player quality and tougher opposition.

The obvious question is whether he is ready for the pressure of the Chelsea job. Only time will tell, but from a personality and leadership standpoint, the signs are encouraging.

Chelsea are expected to pursue another elite attacking option this summer, which explains the earlier enquiry for Semenyo before deciding not to proceed.

The club is also aware that it lacks physicality relative to rivals and will look to address this, without sacrificing technical quality, in upcoming windows.

Centre-back and striker remain areas of monitoring, with pathways also being considered for players already owned by the club, including Josh Acheampong, Mamadou Sarr, Aaron Anselmino, Emanuel Emegha, and Dastan Satpayev.

As mentioned at the start, I entered this process with concerns. Many of those have been addressed, and I feel more confident about Chelsea's long-term direction. One thing is very clear to me is throughout the club, there is a passion for us to succeed and a real togetherness which we saw in the 1-1 draw with City. Every single player, coach and director all pulled together in the time of uncertainty to ensure on the field results weren't effected.

One thing someone said to me really stuck with me as i have felt like this as a Chelsea time for a very long time. We are at WAR with every other club in the Premier League and Europe to achieve the goals we want to.`

This all said, the proof will come through execution and the results we get. Strategy alone guarantees nothing.

Hopefully, this article has provided clarity and reassurance. Let us know your thoughts on the piece, and your feelings about Chelsea's direction, in the comments below.

A note by myself, Simon Phillips.

I was at this meeting with Danny and Luke, and one thing I will add is also contrary to belief, members of this sporting team hold a very good footballing knowledge and are VERY passionate about the club - there is no doubts around how hard they work and how obsessed they are with this club.

I have obviously not been as positive on the ownership on X over the last week or so as Danny is being here. But I did get a lot of encouragement from meeting them, as well as from reading back on the points that Danny has articulated superbly here. What I am doing is staying open to everything. I've never doubted their ambition, even if my emotions as a fan first can boil over sometimes. But although it seems like gloom and doom right now and I do think that fans have been right to take action and makes their voices heard, there are many things to be encouraged about. Time will tell on it all, as Danny says. For me, this summer and what happens, as I've written in an article this week, is CRUCIAL.

Simon Phillips

thanks for bringing this insight guys... you guys are top!

however some of the biggest concerns regarding the 'hierarchy' have not been addressed by them and there is alot of contradiction in their responses.

- they say they want to buy high potential players and compete financially as they cant keep up with the 5 clubs mentioned above. Then why have they signed players like Gittens, Mudryk, Jorgensen, Felix, KDH, Disasi and a few others... who are avg players at best and cost us a fortune. They are neither 'high potential' nor 'bargains'. Its funny they cite financial differences between the clubs but at the same time have blown away 2bn and only have Palmer and Caicedo to show are unqualified successes. We have the most expensive squad in the history of football... surely if you want to close the gap you make better decisions both on the sporting side and the financial side. What THEY are saying is just a contradiction.

- wage structure: Its good to have one but there is no way in the world you can miss out on players like Olise, Etikite and then spend the same money (in terms of fee and wages) on more avg players. The squad is worse off and you have dug a hole financially. Will the make exceptions for players like Reece who is on high wages and our most important player?

- The market freedom and PSR issues are of their own making. Overpaying for so many players will have an impact....

- closing the gap on the top teams require that you improve the squad window by window.... they have done the exact 'OPPOSITE' of that.

- how can they say they have alignment with managers on recruitment and want to address the physicality issue when 'THEY' have made this squad! Any fan will know the physicality issue in the PL.. these guys came from PL and ignored all that. They have built a squad in such a way that the manager will be pretty much forced to play with a 10 when maybe a 3 man midfield is a better option for the league. Poch asked for physicality in the midfield and he was shown the door for questioning them.

- another thing to add... they talk a great deal about data and scouting. How come most of their signings are from their previous clubs or the ones that their previous clubs targeted. Seems more of a case of 'who the SDs' know rather then what is needed to make the squad better.

As I said you have done a great job reaching out to them and raising some concerns but 'THEIR' response are full of contradictions and damage control exercise.

Kudos on getting the discussion and interesting to read, but I'm a little bit cynical simply because it's easy to think a lot of this is just PR spin to say what the fans want to hear...

Was the stadium brought up? Because that to me is the most important issue facing the club. Oh, and were questions asked about why we're leaving millions on the table each year with the front of shirt sponsor situation?

Women's sport continues its rapid rise on the global stage, and football has just reached another landmark moment.

FIFA has confirmed that the inaugural Women's Club World Cup will take place in January 2028, marking a major step forward in the professionalisation and global recognition of the women's game.

The tournament, initially planned for 2026, was postponed to allow leagues, clubs and players time to prepare and ease pressure on the demanding playing calendar.

FIFA says the revised timeline will ensure the competition launches on a solid footing, with meaningful participation from clubs worldwide.

The Women's Club World Cup will bring together 16 of the best women's club teams globally. Six teams will compete in a preliminary play-in round, with three advancing to the group stage.

They will be joined by 13 other qualified clubs to form four groups of four, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the knockout rounds.

In terms of representation, the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North America) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations will each receive two automatic places, while UEFA (Europe) will have five slots, reflecting the depth and competitiveness of women's football in Europe.

While host nation details have not yet been confirmed, the tournament will be staged mid-season for Europe's major leagues, including the Women's Super League.

The announcement builds on growing momentum in women's football. Alongside the Club World Cup, FIFA has also introduced the Women's Champions Cup, featuring the six continental champions from UEFA, CAF, AFC, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).

The semi-finals are being held at Brentford Stadium in England, with the final and third-place play-off at Arsenal Stadium, England, in January 2026.

For fans, players and young girls dreaming of playing at the highest level, it's great to see that women's sport is no longer on the sidelines.

Gab Marcotti analyzes Group B consisting of Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and the winner of UEFA Playoff A. (1:10)

Canada manager Jesse Marsch said star player Alphonso Davies is excited to be playing again and is ready to have a key role in the 2026 World Cup, having suffered a long-term injury last year.

Davies, 25, is one of the quickest players in the world, but tore a ligament and sustained other damage in his right knee while playing for Canada against the United States in a Concacaf Nations League third-place game in March.

After nine months out, the left back made his return to action on Dec. 9 for club side Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League, and Marsch is keen to have him involved in Canada's buildup to the summer's World Cup.

""Alphonso got himself healthy before the winter break, played some good minutes in certain matches,"" he told ESPN. ""Now, after a two-week break, he's back at it again, and has like a new preseason to build himself up.

""I think that this is an ideal situation in terms of getting him back to 100% in top form, without risk, lowering the risk of potential injuries. We're monitoring all the guys [in the Canada squad] who have had long-term injuries, and trying to communicate with them and with their clubs to be on the cautious side of their return-to-play protocols.

""I think Alphonso is poised. If you talk to him right now, mentally and physically he's regenerated and excited. That's what happens a lot of times when you're out for a long time; more than anything you're just so excited to be playing football again. That's definitely where he's at.""

Canada take on Guatemala in a friendly on Jan. 18, before their pre-tournament plans are revealed. But Marsch has high hopes for the summer.

""Alphonso just came back and five of our other most-important defenders are injured right now,"" he said. ""A lot of the tournament will come down to how healthy we are, how fit we are. But we have an explosive team.

""One of the reasons why I came to Canada was because I knew that there was an explosive team; a team that I could imagine playing the kind of football that I like to teach. We'll have plenty of challenges along the way, but I think we've grown a lot into the football that we want to play. I think the identity has been solidified and the confidence has grown.

""We do believe that we have a team that can perform well against good opponents and in tournament.""

Still, Canada (27th in the latest FIFA world rankings) won't have an easy time of things, having been paired in a group alongside Switzerland (17), Qatar (54) and one of the UEFA playoff qualifiers (either Italy/ Wales/Northern Ireland/Bosnia & Herzegovina).

""The biggest takeaway [from the draw] for me is, depending upon who comes out of the European group, we could wind up having the toughest group in the tournament,"" Marsch said. ""You knew that the level of difficulty of the groups wasn't going to be what they were in the past. So even the group of death takes on a different kind of connotation, I think, with the new format.

""[But] let's say Italy makes it through, then Italy would be considered like a Pot One team. Switzerland would be Pot Two. Qatar would be Pot Three. So in the end, and as a host nation, it's almost like we're Pot Four instead of Pot One, right?

""So in that sense, it's not ideal. But at the same time, we like our team. The World Cup is not supposed to be easy regardless of who we get.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Donald Trump has issued fresh warnings to countries hours after capturing Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.

Trump approved and oversaw the airstrikes on Venezuela before American troops captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the presidential palace in Caracas.

The United States accused Maduro of criminal activities, including narco-terrorism charges.

World Cup

Declan Rice is a byword for consistency with Arsenal and England Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images

As we enter a World Cup year, England manager Thomas Tuchel will have a clear idea of the squad he wants to take to North America. He may indeed know the core of his ideal starting XI to face Croatia on June 17 in Arlington, Texas.

Depending on injuries, captain Harry Kane is a certainty and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford will be No 1. Declan Rice's form for Arsenal this season has also made him one of the first names on the teamsheet.

Rice has been the epitome of consistency under Mikel Arteta and a driving force in Arsenal's Premier League title challenges. Tuchel will hope he can do likewise for England in their bid to win a first World Cup on foreign soil.

Rice built his reputation as a defensive midfielder at West Ham United. His form prompted a £100million move to Arsenal in 2023, yet recently he has been playing more of an attacking role for club and country.

In an era obsessed with systems and players being tagged in very specific roles, Rice has become a throwback to midfielders of old. A box-to-box, all-action midfielder who is effective in both penalty areas.

Historically, England have often possessed players who boast a knack of timing their runs to score goals. After Bryan Robson and David Platt in the 1980s and 1990s came Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes at the turn of the century. Successive managers were unable to solve the conundrum of how to accommodate the trio in the same side.

At Bournemouth on Saturday, Rice showed he could become that type of player for Tuchel's England.

His four goals this season take him to within one of Leandro Trossard and Viktor Gyokeres as Arsenal's top scorers this season, and his three assists put him only behind Trossard (four).

Rice is revelling in getting forward and he ranks fourth for Arsenal in total shots on goal (27) and shots on target (10).

He is also Arsenal's second-highest chance creator with 32, just behind Bukayo Saka's 37, and he has created the most big chances (nine) — golden opportunities to score that are expected to be taken — than any of his colleagues.

His tally of 142 line-breaking passes — a pass that is played between the line of defenders and pushes the team closer to the opposition goal — is also the highest, with Martin  Zubimendi (133) second.

His greater attacking output doesn't mean he has relinquished his defensive duties, either. His 33 tackles are the second highest behind Jurrien Timber (46) and his 18 interceptions are second only to Zubimendi's 24. Rice has also regained possession for his side in the middle third 50 times, and 96 times across the entire pitch, the highest of any Arsenal player.

Given the freedom, Rice is extremely effective in open play, but he has played a significant role for Arsenal from set pieces too.

One of Arsenal's many strengths in recent seasons is their effectiveness at set pieces. As one of the key takers of corners and free kicks, Rice's delivery has been vital to that.

Arsenal top the Premier League list for the most goals from set plays this season (17) — 14 when excluding penalties — the most in the Premier League. 

Rice has created 12 chances from set pieces, which is the seventh-highest in the league, but the most by an Arsenal player. 

“Declan Rice is unbelievable,” defender Gabriel told Amazon Prime after Arsenal's 4-0 Champions League victory against Atletico Madrid in October.

“I'm watching Arsenal and every time they get a corner, my head is in my hands,” former Liverpool defender and pundit Jamie Carragher said in October on the Sky Sports Premier League Podcast.

“I've never seen anything like this before in football. I think the whole football world feels every time they get a corner, they're going to score a goal.”

Rice has forged a promising partnership with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson for England, with the latter providing the holding platform that allows Rice to break forward.

Anderson has also created one more chance than Rice this season from his set-piece deliveries, giving Tuchel even more options. Set pieces could be a defining factor in the tournament this summer.

Rice has also been robust this season. He has made 27 appearances in the Premier League, Champions League and League Cup, starting 22 matches. He overcame a knee injury to face Bournemouth and showed no signs of the knock hindering his performance. He scored twice in a league game for the first time in his career.

With Arsenal still involved in four competitions and competition likely to be long and as gruelling as ever, the only concern for Tuchel will come after the season. Despite his all-action style, any fatigue could be overcome by the buoyancy of what promises to be a memorable campaign for the Premier League leaders.

And, like Arteta, Tuchel knows he can rely on Rice to drive others on and off the pitch.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Le Professeur', faith in youth and trusting the process: What should Chelsea expect from new manager Liam Rosenior?","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/what-should-chelsea-expect-from-new-manager-liam-rosenior/blt845eb290b9c95fa9","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

There's a nostalgic feel to Chelsea's sudden firing of a manager and the mad scramble to bring in a successor midway through a season. The difference on this occasion is they are not a team stacked with world-class players in pursuit of the Premier League title, rather a middling assembly of young starlets with little hope of immediate success.

When Roman Abramovich ran Chelsea, they were a force to be reckoned with. There wasn't a price they wouldn't pay to get what they wanted. The club still have wealthy owners, but even with the restrictions posed by the Premier League's PSR and UEFA's FFP, their ambitions are a little different.

Everything that comes out of Chelsea suggests they are building for the long term, not the here and now. Results only matter to a certain extent rather than dictating policy. It is about the development and progress of their assets which is key.

That's why BlueCo have decided to take the head coach of their second club, Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, and place him in charge of their favourite child. Liam Rosenior, the 41-year-old Englishman who was hired in 2024 to replace Patrick Vieira, will now have the chance to succeed Enzo Maresca at Stamford Bridge.

Most English football fans who remember Rosenior will know him as a defender who spent his playing career flitting between the Premier League and Championship, turning to punditry before taking up coaching in the second tier. But what is he going to bring to Chelsea as their new head coach?

When Rosenior was added to Sky Sports' rotating cast of pundits in 2018, he combined it with the assistant manager's job for Brighton's Under-23s (because what good is a Chelsea hire in 2026 without having some experience with the Seagulls on your CV, right?...). A year later, he was appointed as a 'specialist first-team coach' on Phillip Cocu's staff at Derby.

The Rams described Rosenior's strengths in detail during their statement announcing his arrival: ""Rosenior's position on the first-team staff will, as well as working with players on the training ground with a particular emphasis on individual development of emerging young talent, see him play a prominent role in pre-match opposition analysis with the scouting and analysis departments. He will also be well-placed to provide advice and guidance from his own playing career, the vast majority of which was played in the Premier League and Championship, to help manage the extensive number and scheduling challenges presented across the campaign.""

Cocu left Derby in 2020, and Rosenior then served as assistant to new boss Wayne Rooney, who hung up his boots to take his first steps into management. The two worked in tandem excellently, with Rooney laid back in his approach and Rosenior often prowling the edge of the technical area with tactical instructions.

""He's taken chances, and hopefully that pays off because I think Liam is as good a coach as I've ever worked with,"" Rooney said on the BBC's 'Wayne Rooney Show' on Monday. ""His detail, how he approaches the day-to-day, he's as good as I've worked with.

""Liam was so important for me. He was incredible in his coaching ability. I was more of the manager and dealing with players and everything. So I learned a lot from him from that point of view and then I think he's done a great job as a whole.""

Rosenior's first full-time role as a head coach came at Championship side Hull City, whom he led to a seventh-placed finish in 2023-24 and who were widely seen to have punched above their weight. In that time, he leant heavily on the use of young players, including current Chelsea striker Liam Delap, former Liverpool midfielders Tyler Morton and Fabio Carvalho, and defender Jacob Greaves, who was sold to Ipswich Town at the end of that season for an initial £15 million.

Since the summer of 2024, Rosenior has been head coach of Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Their squad this season is the youngest in France's top-flight, with its average age of 22.6 almost a whole year younger than the next team on that particular leaderboard (Auxerre at 23.5). Though this is part of BlueCo's wider sporting project, and seen in France as supporting Chelsea more than anything else, developing youngsters is clearly part of Rosenior's own philosophy too. The hope is he will bring a level of maturity to a dressing room which has a severe on-pitch disciplinary problem.

""Am I a manager or a coach? I'm both,"" Rosenior told ITV. ""Coaching is educating, coaching is wanting to improve players on a technical and tactical level. Management is making sure that you have a strong culture, that your players have rules and regulations, and you manage them in the right way. In English, 'manage', if you split the two words, is 'man' and 'age'. You're aging men.""

One of Chelsea fans' main criticisms of Maresca was his tactical inflexibility. They would usually set up in a 4-2-3-1, with at least one full-back inverted to create overloads in midfield. Bar the odd wrinkle here and there, his Blues were predictable and susceptible to dry performances against low blocks. They needed yards of space in front of them in order to make chances and score goals at will.

Rosenior, like Maresca, wants his teams to play from the back, irrespective of opponent and situation, with options almost always available across the pitch. He often speaks of 'bravery' on the ball and wants his players to be 'all in'. That could prove irksome to a Stamford Bridge crowd which prefers faster-pace football, even if that means less possession and having to sit in on occasion. There won't be much patience in these home games, particularly if Chelsea's defenders continue to make glaring errors on the ball.

For most of 2025-26, Rosenior, nicknamed 'Le Professeur', has lined Strasbourg up in a fluid 3-4-3 system, with pacy 6'5 striker Emmanuel Emegha, who will join Chelsea this summer, leading the line as captain when fit. They average the seventh-highest average possession in Ligue 1 with 52.9 percent, and are capable of breaking down teams both when dominant and playing in transition. Strasbourg are also known to play more orthodox four-at-the-back formations too, and it's no guarantee Rosenior will stick with only one system as the ill-fated Ruben Amorim did at Manchester United.

Despite Strasbourg's youth, Rosenior has matured many of their best players. Last season, Chelsea loanee Andrey Santos announced himself as one of Ligue 1's finest talents before returning to Maresca's first-team squad for this campaign. Even with the club acting as a feeder to Chelsea and fans protesting against this, Strasbourg's players and head coach have risen above the noise, securing a return to Europe for this season, where they beat Crystal Palace and finished first in the league phase of the Conference League.

One of Strasbourg's major scalps under Rosenior came back in October when they held European champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-3 draw at Parc des Princes. Remarkably, the visitors were great value for their 3-1 lead at one point.

For over an hour in the French capital, Strasbourg were the better team. They stuck to their principles and tried to outplay the hosts, looking to beat an aggressive press wherever possible and dictate the game in their own way. It nearly got them all three points, but they had to settle for one.

""I was impressed with Liam's work,"" PSG boss Luis Enrique said post-match of Rosenior. ""I knew the match would be difficult. We started well showing superiority with and without the ball, but the end of first half was poor. We improved after the break and the final stages were very positive. My first impression is that Strasbourg is one of the best teams in Ligue 1, in the way they play.""

As with any and every manager, Rosenior has his flaws and isn't perfect. Strasbourg's main criticisms this season have been losing steam late in games, while the squad was pretty drained by the time they reached France's winter break.

When Strasbourg's suffocating intensity is successful, it's fantastic to watch. But when opponents get to grips with it, they're vulnerable. There have been many times where their youthful enthusiasm has got the better of them, and immature heads have been allowed to drop. The go-to strategy doesn't usually change, with the French press questioning whether Rosenior has a 'plan B' during games as the tide turns against him.

Rosenior's Strasbourg tend to struggle on the roadwithout the backing of their passionate Stade de la Meinau home crowd. The flip-side to that is obviously his teams can make their own stadium a fortress, but at a club like Chelsea, that is expected as a given.

There will almost inevitably be a match featuring some humiliation in passing out from the back. There should equally be team goals which are a joy to watch. It's a risk-reward system that Rosenior lives and dies by. How he will fare in the pressure cooker of one of the world's biggest clubs remains to be seen.

Rosenior, born down the road in Wandsworth, becomes Chelsea's second-ever Black head coach, following in the footsteps of the great Ruud Gullit. At a time when so many Black coaches, let alone Black British coaches, are struggling to be considered for the game's elite jobs, it's a triumph that Rosenior has made it here.

Chelsea as a club have a long and complicated history with racism dating back decades. In more recent times, they have actively sought to make amends and clean up an image that once tarnished them. In 2023, they commissioned a documentary called 'Blue Is The Colour', diving into how fans from different backgrounds see the issue.

The modern history of Chelsea has been written by plenty of Black players. Xaymaca Awoyungbo, the brains behind the documentary, told The Athletic: ""I've definitely felt welcome (at Chelsea). The experiences of the people in the documentary are real but, like one of the fans at the end of it says, we had players like (Didier) Drogba, (Michael) Essien, Mikel (John Obi) who showed a different image of Chelsea. I never felt like, 'Do I belong here?'. It was more the history that made me feel unsure. Personally, going to games was never a problem (in that sense).""

Paul Canoville was Chelsea's first-ever Black player during the 1980s, and though he received racist abuse at the time, he has dedicated a large chunk of his life to his namesake foundation and is seen as a key voice in the club's battle against discrimination. Canoville told the Daily Telegraph: ""What really strikes me about Liam is he grew up and played not far from here (Chelsea), he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation, working with young people every day. There's a real alignment there, no?

""When kids see someone like Liam managing their club, someone who looks like them, who's from their ends, who comes from a family that fights for what's right... that's powerful, man. That's hope. That's showing them the path is there.""

The Chelsea gig in the BlueCo era is looking an increasingly unstable one. Thomas Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 little over 12 months on from winning the Champions League. His sought-after successor, Graham Potter, didn't even last until the end of that season. Mauricio Pochettino at least got a whole year before the two parties mutually agreed to part ways. Maresca was admired and hired because of his mix of mentality and tactical nous, but it seems from the outside looking in that he got too big for his boots.

This is why the club are taking a chance on Rosenior. They are obviously aware of his work at Strasbourg, but this is a massive leap from one job to another. A more sensible operation would be looking at the same pool as Manchester United are right now.

If Rosenior succeeds, he will run the same risk as Maresca, expected to remain one part of a whole rather than allowing himself to grow and take more authority. If he fails, then the club and its sporting directors will have failed. This appointment is more of a risk than any that have come before under this ownership. They should be careful what they wish.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Winners and losers from Man Utd's decision to sack Ruben Amorim: Clean slate for Kobbie Mainoo, but Mason Mount & Amad Diallo in real danger of losing starting roles","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/winners-and-losers-man-utd-sack-ruben-amorim-kobbie-mainoo-mason-mount-amad-diallo/blt738cad57938b9329","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

In an interview with The Business podcast released on October 9, Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe vowed that Ruben Amorim would get ""three years to demonstrate he is a great coach"", while stressing the need for patience in the club's ""long-term plan"". Yet here we are, barely three months later, and Amorim has been unceremoniously kicked out of Old Trafford, with United having communicated their belief that ""it is the right time to make a change"" in order to ""give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish"".

It is a remarkable U-turn, but not an unexpected one. Results were poor throughout Amorim's 14-month tenure, but a sequence of only three wins from the last 11 Premier League games put him under severe pressure, with crucial points dropped from winning positions against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham, West Ham, Bournemouth and rock-bottom Wolves.

Still, Amorim may have been granted a stay of execution had he not vented his frustration with the board before and after United's latest draw away at Leeds. The Portuguese hinted at opposition to his much-maligned 3-4-3 formation and a lack of financial backing to sign the players needed to make the system work optimally, concluding with the angry declaration: ""In every department, the scouting department, the sporting director [Jason Wilcox] needs to do his job, and I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.""

After seemingly being told there would be no January reinforcements, that was an understandable reaction from Amorim, but an ill-advised one that did not come from a position of power. Although the former Sporting CP boss fixed the toxic dressing room culture that ran rampant under previous United managers and implemented a more fluid playing style, he also turned his back on many of the club's historical values, including giving priority to academy stars, attacking with width and taking risks.

Any signs of progress were rendered moot by Amorim's baffling decision-making, particularly during games, and he departs with the worst Premier League win record of any manager in United's history (32 percent). Amorim is a charismatic, honest manager who demands the highest standards, but he was too stubborn and one-dimensional to succeed at the highest level of English football.

The only way is up for the Red Devils, surely, now that the squad has been unshackled. Some players will immediately benefit from Amorim's departure, either by being reinstated to the line up or a favoured position, with Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher stepping up to lead the first team on an interim basis until a successor is found. However, Amorim also had his favourites, and a few of them are facing uncertain futures now that their main cheerleader is gone.

GOAL runs through the biggest winners and losers from United's decision to sack Amorim...

Kobbie Mainoo will not look back on 2025 with any fondness. The United academy graduate only started eight Premier League games, all in the second half of last season, and had been reduced to a bit-part role under Amorim this term, despite the team's struggles for consistency.

With Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes serving as the first-choice holding midfield duo, Mainoo has had to make do with cameo appearances, often in the final 20 minutes, leaving him little chance to make any meaningful impact. That led to a backlash from the United faithful (including his brother) and England fans hoping to see Mainoo at next summer's World Cup, but Amorim refused to bow to public opinion.

""I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in],"" Amorim said in December. ""I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't.""

As a consequence, Mainoo has been strongly linked with a January loan move to Napoli, where his former team-mates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund are flying, but it would be a major shock if he were to leave now. The 20-year-old will likely start with a clean slate when the next manager comes in, and it's safe to say they won't be wed to a 3-4-3, so he should be thrust straight back into regular action, once he recovers from a calf injury.

It's been a real shame to see Mainoo's development stall given his immense talent, but we can expect a swift resurgence because he will have a point to prove after outlasting Amorim.

Mason Mount is one of the few players who made any significant improvement at United on Amorim's watch, after a miserable, injury-plagued start to his Old Trafford career. The former Chelsea man regained full fitness at the back end of last season and has made 16 appearances for the Red Devils to date in 2025-26, registering four goal contributions, with his standout display coming in the 4-1 win at Wolves on December 8.

Mount scored United's third goal and was deservedly given the Player of the Match award for his industry in the final third, with Amorim heaping praise on him after the final whistle: ""He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me. It's a guy that leads by the example. It doesn't matter the situation, Mason Mount is always the same thing - training, talking, dealing with people around Carrington. That is not easy, so he's a very, very good player.""

Amorim always insisted that Mount was the ideal fit for his system, with two No.10 slots available, but he barely got a look-in under the previous boss, Erik ten Hag, who deployed traditional wingers. The 26-year-old could find himself back to square one again in a more expansive set-up, with the main roles on the flanks likely to go to summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.

Mount is versatile enough to operate in a deeper midfield role, but it's not his forte, and it has been reported that part of the pitch will be bolstered in the summer. As a squad player, he still has plenty to offer, but it's difficult to see Mount ever reaching the heights he did at Chelsea again if he stays at Old Trafford.

Bruno Fernandes has been United's best player this season, as he was in each of his previous six campaigns in Manchester. But the club captain's exploits over the past five months have been especially remarkable because he's been playing out of position.

To accommodate Cunha and Mbeumo, Amorim shifted Fernandes into a No.6 berth, where he has still delivered a combined 12 goals and assists in 17 Premier League games, more than any other United player in 2025-26. Despite playing in front of the defence, the Portugal international has the third-highest expected assist (xA) total in the division (4.1), and ranks first for key passes with 51, 15 more than his nearest challengers Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka.

Fernandes is also in the top 10 for ball recoveries, which shows he has put in the defensive work required for his new position. It's a superhuman effort, which goes some way to explaining why he suffered a rare hamstring injury against Aston Villa that has kept him out of United's last three fixtures.

But it made no sense for United's greatest source of creativity to be shouldering so much responsibility at both ends. Fernandes is, and always has been, a natural No.10 who causes the most damage when he's close to goal. That is where he will be restored when the post-Amorim era begins, and the Red Devils will be much better for it.

Amorim also forced Amad Diallo to adapt to an unnatural role, at right-wing back, and like Fernandes, he fared admirably. The Ivory Coast international has chipped in with five Premier League goal involvements this term and forged a deadly partnership with Mbeumo, constantly switching positions with the ex-Brentford star to get in behind defences.

Amad has also put in a lot of hard work off the ball, but that only stretches so far given his attack-minded tendencies and slight physical frame. The 23-year-old has been frequently caught too high up the pitch when the ball is turned over and United have conceded a lot of goals at the far post because he's not strong or tall enough to compete for crosses.

But at least he was playing. That might not be the case now that Amorim's baffling tactical blueprint is likely to be ditched for one that includes a back four. A reversion to the 4-2-3-1 shape Ten Hag favoured seems most obvious, which would see Benjamin Sesko, Fernandes, Cunha and Mbeumo complete United's front four, and Casemiro and Mainoo pair up in the double pivot.

Amad will be praying that the new coaching regime goes for a 4-3-3 instead, which might see him deployed behind Mbeumo once again. But in that instance, a midfield three containing a combination of Fernandes, Casemiro, Mainoo, Mount and Manuel Ugarte would give United a better balance, and generating more clean sheets has to be a priority given the team only recorded two across their last 20 Premier League games.

It's an unfair situation for Amad, who has been up there with Fernandes as United's most reliable performer in recent years, but when he returns from the Africa Cup of Nations, it may only be to a seat on the bench.

Ratcliffe and the INEOS group deserve all the criticism that comes their way after Amorim's turbulent reign. The Portuguese was the new United regime's first appointment after they were given control of footballing operations by the Glazer family, and they had tunnel vision after finally deciding to dismiss Ten Hag in October 2024, despite reports that Liverpool and West Ham both passed on Amorim due to concerns over how he would adjust to the Premier League.

Dan Ashworth also had his doubts. United welcomed Ashworth to the club that July after a lengthy gardening leave period at Newcastle, with Ratcliffe hailing him as ""one of the best sporting directors in the world"", but he left after just five months, and the head coach issue was one of the main reasons for his exit.

According to The Athletic, Ashworth put forward Eddie Howe, Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Graham Potter as potential replacements for Ten Hag, but Ratcliffe urged him to look beyond people he knew and wanted a more 'dynamic' appointment. United CEO Omar Berrada pushed for Amorim and Ratcliffe took an instant liking to the former Benfica midfielder in initial meetings, eventually signing off on his arrival.

That's despite Ashworth expressing doubts over whether Amorim's rigid 3-4-3 formation would aid the club's long-term recruitment strategy, as reported by The Guardian. He knew that United didn't have the players to fit that set-up or the financial means to overhaul the squad overnight due to mounting debts. 

Ratcliffe, with the support of Berrada, Wilcox (who was technical director at the time) and INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, overruled Ashworth, and he was eventually forced out for not being on the same page as the rest of the top brass. If Ratcliffe had listened to the former Newcastle guru, maybe United wouldn't be in the mess they're in now.

Should United indeed shift to a system with four defenders, it will spell the end for Harry Maguire. The England international can play as a right or left-sided centre-back, but at 32, his best years are behind him, and persistent injuries are starting to take their toll.

Maguire has been out since early November due to a thigh issue, and faces an uphill task to win his place back once he's fully recovered. Lisandro Martinez has slotted back into the team seamlessly after returning from his own long-term injury, and is the best option on the left, not least because he already has a good rapport with veteran full-back Luke Shaw.

For the time being, one of the two emerging youngsters, Ayden Heaven or Leny Yoro will get the nod on the right, with Matthijis de Ligt in the treatment room with a back problem and Noussair Mazraoui competing in the latter stages of the AFCON with Morocco. But when everyone is fit, it should be De Ligt who partners Martinez.

De Ligt, who only turned 26 in August, looked to have recaptured the form of his Ajax years in the early weeks of the season, with United legend Nemanja Matic describing him as the best defender at the club in a recent interview with CBS Sports. The former Bayern Munich and Juventus ace is only just entering his prime, and should be a staple at Old Trafford in the coming years, provided he can avoid any further misfortune with injuries.

The same cannot be said for Maguire. It's been admirable to see him silence his critics in recent seasons to become something of a cult hero among supporters, with a long list of important, and often dramatic goals added to his CV. But the ex-Leicester City man isn't mobile enough to play week in, week out in the heart of the United defence anymore. Maguire's contract is up next summer and it would be a huge surprise if he is handed another extension, not because he's suddenly become a bad player, but because his cycle at the club is approaching its natural end.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo pushing for Al-Nassr to sign Real Madrid star in stunning FREE transfer","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-pushing-al-nassr-sign-real-madrid-star-stunning-free-transfer/blt175aab8a416dabb6","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:28:28 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly pushing Al-Nassr to launch a stunning raid for Antonio Rudiger. The experienced German defender is seeing his contract at Santiago Bernabeu run down and will become a free agent in the summer of 2026 if no extension is agreed. It is claimed that CR7 wants to see the former Chelsea centre-half join him in the Saudi Pro League.

As Rudiger has less than six months left to run on his current deal, he is free to enter into negotiations with any suitors outside of Spain. According to Fichajes, Al-Nassr are ready to make a serious play for his signature.

It is claimed that “discussions for a possible renewal are not progressing” in Madrid and Rudiger is “starting to generate a noise that is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore”. The “most likely scenario” at this stage is considered to be a move elsewhere when the 2025-26 campaign comes to a close.

He is said to be attracting interest from “several ambitious projects”, with big-spending teams in the Middle East forming part of that pack. Real are reportedly willing to let him leave as they remain in a “defensive transition process”, with recruitment focus being narrowed on “medium to long-term” additions.

The Blancos have always been reluctant to tie aging stars - those over the age of 30 - down on lengthy deals. Rudiger will turn 33 in March. Real Madrid are “not willing to compromise future planning with long contracts or conditions outside their roadmap”.

With that in mind, “one of the destinations that has gained momentum in recent weeks is Al-Nassr”. They already have Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo on their books, alongside Joao Felix and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane.

They are looking to bolster their back line and see Rudiger as an ideal addition. Fichajes claims that “an economically powerful offer is being prepared” - one which any European-based clubs will find it “difficult to match”. A “high-level salary contract and a central role within the sporting project” is on offer in Riyadh.

Fichajes go on to state that sources close to the Saudi outfit have revealed that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo “has recommended Rudiger's signing”. Having previously lined up against the German, he believes that an “immediate quality boost” can be secured.

It is noted that Ronaldo “holds significant influence within Al-Nassr's sporting project, not just on the field but also in strategic decision-making”. Several transfer calls have already been made on his advice, with the 40-year-old frontman desperate to get more proven winners alongside him.

A formal proposal is said to have been readied, but Rudiger “has not made a final decision” yet. He remains focused on the present for now, with Real still in the hunt for prestigious domestic and continental titles.

He is, however, aware of interest from Saudi Arabia and considers the option of such a switch to be “real, ambitious, and economically very attractive”. The presence of Ronaldo at Al-Nassr will also be factored into the equation - as he has committed to a deal through to 2027.

An extended stay at the Bernabeu cannot be entirely ruled out for now, potentially on rolling 12-month terms, but other options are certainly being considered - by Rudiger and the Blancos.

Al-Nassr are ready to pounce, with club captain Ronaldo an obvious ace in their pack. They have faltered of late, in a Saudi Pro League title bid, but remain fiercely competitive on multiple fronts and would provide Rudiger with opportunities to enhance his already impressive CV.

Fichjaes claims that any move to the Middle East would be “another impactful move by Saudi football, adding a top-level defender to one of the most ambitious projects”.

Manchester City are potentially at risk of being without key defender Josko Gvardiol for the rest of the season following the injury he sustained in Sunday's 1-1 draw against Chelsea. The Croatian defender had to be helped off the pitch in the second half, in the same game as chief centre-back partner Ruben Dias was also unable to continue, while John Stones is still sidelined.

Gvardiol was left unable to continue only a few minutes into the second half after what had appeared a fairly innocuous knock as he battled for the ball. He managed to walk off, without the need for a stretcher, although was helped to do so by a member of City's medical team and Chelsea captain Reece James.

Gvardiol seemed to catch his foot on the turf, with the impact now revealed to have caused plenty of damage. A medical report from City published on Monday confirmed a ""tibial fracture"". Liverpool's Alexander Isak recently suffered a similar injury, fracturing a fibula.

City additionally confirmed that Gvardiol will have surgery on the injury in the coming days. The assessment period ""remains ongoing"" and there is no official timeframe for when he might return to the pitch. However, to play for Manchester City again this season would require a full recovery and rehab to be completed in less than five months. Everything will depend on the exact severity of the problem and the success of the operation.

Aside from missing hugely important club games as City try to reclaim the Premier League title, playing catch up on Arsenal, just as concerning for Gvardiol on a personal level is the possibility of a knock-on impact on his World Cup dreams with Croatia. The tournament begins in mid-June and Croatia, who have finished second and third in the last two editions, are to face England, Panama and Ghana in Group L.

Ruben Dias came off later in the Chelsea game and, according to Daily Mail reporting, City are running tests on the severity of a muscle injury. It is unclear how long the Portugal international might be unavailable for, but with John Stones ruled out since early December and Manuel Akanji on loan in Serie A, it leaves Abdukodir Khusanov and Nathan Ake the only fit centre-backs in the first-team squad. Vitor Reis and Juma Bah are currently on loan at Girona and Nice.

As an emergency measure, City have already recalled 20-year-old Max Alleyne from a loan spell at Watford. He made 16 Championship appearances for the Hornets during the first half of the season, 14 of them as a starter, and has represented England at various age groups up to Under-21 level. He has never made a first-team appearance for City, though.

Although City's eye this month has been trained on completing a £65 million ($88m) deal for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, developments surrounding Gvardiol and Dias are forcing them to consider dipping into the market for a central defender too. City were already linked with Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, but things could now accelerate.

Guehi, who almost joined Liverpool in September, is out of contract at the end of this season and so Palace face losing the England international as a free agent if they don't cash in now. It was originally thought that City would wait for information to come back on Gvardiol and Dias before making a decision on Guehi, likely to be after the former's imminent surgery. But with a swift return unlikely, City may have their hand forced or risk playing the second half of the season with virtually no defensive cover.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly ""under consideration"" as Manchester United search for a caretaker or interim manager to take over from Ruben Amorim, just over four years after he himself was sacked by the Red Devils. Darren Fletcher will lead the team in the immediate short-term, but the club is expected to name someone else in charge for the coming months, before a final permanent appointment is ultimately made ahead of next season.

It ended on a sour note for Solskjaer last time round, sacked the day after a heavy defeat to Watford compounded what was already a poor start to the 2021-22 season. But the Norwegian still holds Manchester United very close to his heart, almost 30 years after first joining as a player in the summer of 1996, and Fabrizio Romano has reported via his YouTube channel that Solskjaer would be ""more than open"" to returning to Old Trafford once more as manager in a caretaker capacity.

The Athletic now claims that Solskjaer is “under consideration in what would be an emotional comeback”. Being drafted in as an interim is exactly how his first spell, which eventually lasted almost three years, came to happen when a previous United hierarchy sacked another Portuguese coach: Jose Mourinho.

Many United fans bemoaned the club's lack of tangible success during the Solskjaer era, which ran from December 2018 until November 2021. It's true that the former striker, who played 366 times for the Red Devils and had later spells in the first-team coaching staff and managing the reserves, was unable to win a trophy. However, he has proven more consistent than his two permanent successors.

In his two full seasons at the helm, Solskjaer oversaw third and second-place Premier League finishes, reached the semi-finals or better of five cup competitions, and brought the best out of Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial. His win percentage (54.2%) was marginally worse than Erik ten Hag (54.7%) – but over significantly more games – and is far better than Amorim achieved (38.1%). He also had a better such record than both David Moyes (52.9%) and Louis van Gaal (52.4%).

It may have fallen short of the impossible standards set by Sir Alex Fergsuon, but in this new way of looking at Manchester United, a club still finding its feet in the post-Fergie landscape, it certainly wasn't bad by any means. Of all those who have filled the hotseat since Ferguson retired almost 13 years ago, Solskjaer has also been the closest to harnessing what feels like the real 'United way'.

Speaking to BBC Sport as recently as November 2025, Solskjaer reflected on the difficulty that he faced as Manchester United manager, trying to build up a successful team at a time when Manchester City and Liverpool were both at their absolute peaks.

""It's not about getting the credit, but it was the worst time to be the manager of Manchester United. You have Jurgen Klopp with his Liverpool team and you have Pep Guardiola with his Manchester City team,"" he mused.

""Best managers in the world at the time and probably the two best teams in the world at the time. But we got second and third. So with the staff, we had something going but we couldn't take the next steps.""

Solskjaer added that the pressure of being United boss was a ""privilege"", rather than something to be feared. ""I felt privileged to be the manager of Manchester United, but of course it's not the same as playing. As a player, you just do your job. Suddenly now you're the manager, you're the face of everyone. You think about all these supporters, players, everything surrounding Manchester United.

""But that pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way. And that was having great staff around us, an environment in and around the club that was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work every day, training sessions... you need results and we unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Manchester United and they made a change, which is fine.""

Darren Fletcher has been placed in charge for at least this week, but the plan for Manchester United appears to be finding someone who can lead the team for the next few months until the summer. Then, a permanent appointment can be made, allowing time to get the crucial decision right.

The Athletic reports that “Fletcher will get a chance to show his credentials”. Another ex-Red Devils midfielder, Michael Carrick, “has also been mentioned for a possible return” while former defender Jonny Evans “could also be appointed to the club's coaching staff, possibly in time to assist Fletcher at Burnley”.

Jason Wilcox, who held a fiery meeting with Amorim prior to the Portuguese's dismissal, and chief executive Omar Berrada will lead the hunt for a new boss. They are aware that “knowledge of United can be beneficial”, but are said to have current Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner - who will be out of contract at Selhurst Park in the summer - at the top of their wish list.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich wonderkid Lennart Karl caused a stir this weekend by admitting his ultimate career dream is to join Real Madrid, despite currently developing at the Allianz Arena. While such comments often irritate the Bavarian faithful, club legend Lothar Matthaus has surprisingly defended the 17-year-old, drawing parallels with Robert Lewandowski and Florian Wirtz while revealing his own failed move to the Bernabeu.

In modern football, pledging loyalty to your current employer is usually rule number one of the media training handbook, especially for a teenager looking to break into the first team of a European giant. However, Bayern Munich prospect Karl tore up the script this weekend with a candid admission that his long-term sights are set on the Spanish capital.

The 17-year-old, who has been tearing up youth leagues and drawing attention from across the continent, frankly stated: ""FC Bayern is a very big club. It's a dream to play there. But at some point, I definitely want to go to Real Madrid. That's my dream club, but that stays between us. Of course, Bayern is something very special and it's a lot of fun.""

Usually, such a declaration from a player who has yet to fully establish himself as a Bayern legend would draw the ire of pundits and supporters alike. Yet, in his latest column for Sky Sport, Bayern icon Matthaus offered a refreshing and surprisingly supportive take on the youngster's ambition.

Rather than chastising Karl for a lack of respect, Matthaus praised the teenager's mindset. The 1990 World Cup winner believes that articulating such high ambitions is a sign of necessary self-belief rather than petulance.

""Big words, big goals! The Real Madrid statements from Lennart Karl have caused a stir,"" Matthaus wrote. ""I think it's good when someone has self-confidence even at 17. Setting goals has nothing to do with arrogance. I find it honest, but not presumptuous and not arrogant. Real Madrid simply has that myth. Bayern Munich is on a similar level, but often in life, you want to try something new.""

Matthaus argues that the era of the 'one-club man' is largely over, citing Thomas Muller as a glorious anomaly rather than the standard. He believes that the modern player is driven by diverse experiences, highlighting Robert Lewandowski's move to Barcelona and Florian Wirtz's switch to Liverpool as evidence that seeking a ""change of scenery"" is a natural human desire.

""You can't say: 'I'll stay at Bayern Munich for the rest of my life' like a Thomas Muller - that is unique,"" Matthaus explained. ""In the end, everyone has a goal. Robert Lewandowski also went to Barcelona and simply chose a change of air, a new experience. It's not always just about money, but also about a new challenge, to refresh oneself. Having a dream is normality. Florian Wirtz, for example, also sought the challenge in Liverpool to take the next step in his life and personally. He could have made himself comfortable in Leverkusen.""

Crucially, Matthaus pointed out that Karl's dream is actually beneficial for Bayern Munich in the medium term. The logic is sound: for Real Madrid to ever be interested in signing Karl, he must first become a superstar in Munich.

""I think it's all in order,"" Matthaus continued. ""It shows that Karl is ambitious and believes in himself. He knows that he has to perform outstandingly at Bayern Munich to even be on the list at Real Madrid. The 17-year-old hasn't said he wants to play for Real in the next two years. It is his dream. Dreams can come true, but you have to work for them and FC Bayern would also benefit from that. If Karl becomes so good that Real Madrid negotiates with him, he must first achieve extraordinary things at another club.""

Perhaps the most compelling part of Matthaus' defence was a personal revelation regarding his own career. The German legend admitted that he, too, had agreed to join Los Blancos during his prime, only for the move to be blocked by his club.

""I, too, would have liked to play for the Royals,"" Matthaus revealed. ""I became World Footballer of the Year in 1990-91 and suddenly Real Madrid was at the door. I would have liked to go, but I still had an existing contract. That's why the transfer didn't work out back then. Real and I, we were in agreement, however, Inter Milan didn't want to let me go for a high transfer fee.""

He added: ""I also had dreams: I always said that I want to play for a bigger club, want to become a national player and want to be at the World Cup. At some point, the dreams just get bigger. Four years ago he [Karl] probably would have said that he wants to play in the Bundesliga—probably at Bayern Munich.""

Finally, Matthaus touched upon the tangible factors that make a move to Spain so attractive for elite players, noting that it often transcends pure sporting reasons. He highlighted ""quality of life"" and ""better weather"" as genuine factors, alongside the global visibility that La Liga giants command.

""Karl simply sees that something is possible,"" Matthaus concluded. ""It's not just about the sporting side. It's perhaps also about a new, different and better quality of life, better weather, an even bigger club in the world. And frequently one has seen that the World Footballers do not come from the Bundesliga, but rather from a league that gets more attention worldwide.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd SHOULD look to old boys like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Darren Fletcher to heal wounds of Ruben Amorim reign","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-loyal-club-servants-darren-fletcher-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-michael-carrick-heal-wounds-ruben-amorim-reign-ineos/blt09d3e083d4383e85","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:18:07 GMT","

In the end, Ruben Amorim could not handle being told what to do by other people. Despite being the first man in Manchester United's history to be appointed under the title of 'head coach' rather than 'manager', he decided that he wanted the latter role. What he ultimately meant is that he wanted control, and he certainly did not want others meddling in his business.

Amorim should have seen this situation coming. Thomas Tuchel certainly did. According to the respected German television pundit Marcel Reif, Tuchel was excited about taking charge of United in the summer of 2024 until he learned that he would not have the final say on transfers. He had been in a similar position previously with Chelsea and Bayern Munich, and reportedly vowed, 'I won't do that to myself again'.

Amorim, though, felt that not only did he not have the final say on transfers, he did not have the final say on his tactics, and 'blew up' when director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to him about changing his system. Wilcox certainly had reasons for encouraging Amorim to adapt - even though he had been told time and time again by the Portuguese that he was not going to - as United were failing to earn positive results in too many winnable games.

Erik ten Hag's desire for control - he had a veto on transfers - also put him on a collision course with United's directors. The club's new regime of INEOS controlling the football operation is going to either put off elite candidates like Unai Emery and Oliver Glasner or eventually become unworkable a year or so down the line when whoever succeeds Amorim does not get their way.

As long as INEOS want to dictate how United is run, and especially if they want to do it on a tight budget, the only solution is to look to those who know the club inside-out and who care more about the Red Devils than their own careers. 

Former United defender Phil Jones recently told GOAL that""the United shirt is heavy to wear"", and the dugout has also proven inhospitable to every coach who has stepped into it since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. David Moyes was shocked about how different managing United was to taking charge of Everton, while despite Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho past lives at Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, they too were taken aback by the magnitude of the job at Old Trafford.

Ten Hag, meanwhile, was one of the most coveted coaches when he stepped into the fold, while Amorim had been on the shortlists of Liverpool and Manchester City before United hired him. Both managers had excellent reputations and track records in their own countries, but they struggled to get to grips with the Premier League and above all the intense spotlight on them at United.

Ten Hag did not enjoy being the subject of Jamie Carragher's Sky Sports analysis on Monday Night Football, and while Amorim claimed to not pay attention to the media, his final comments before being sacked cited Gary Neville. Constantly being ripped apart by former United captain Neville, whom he previously said ""is critical of everything"", clearly rattled him.

The only people who understand how big this club is are those that have lived inside it for many years. It is why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick are the most compelling candidates for United right now. They do not need a crash course in how the club works, how every word you utter reverberates around the world and can be twisted to suit someone else's agenda.

They also know what makes United players tick, and that going to war with a member of the first-team squad is never a good idea. Solskjaer never publicly spoke out against the players during his three years in charge. Instead, he took a group that had been beaten down by Mourinho's negativity and led them on a run of 14 wins in his first 17 matches.

The Norwegian's three-year stint was full of ups and downs and there's no getting away from the fact that he oversaw some shocking results, such as losing 5-0 at home to Liverpool or 6-1 at home to Tottenham. And yet Solskjaer secured back-to-back top-four finishes in his two full seasons, the only United coach since Ferguson to do so. He also made the club a much happier place to be after Mourinho, and came agonisingly close to winning a trophy, too, as he took United to a Europa League final, where they lost to Villarreal after a marathon penalty shootout, and three domestic cup semi-finals.

Solskjaer knew that the carrot, rather than the stick, was more effective at United. The Norwegian would never have called his team ""the worst in history"", a damning claim made by Amorim which only served to further drain the squad's confidence, nor ridiculed individuals like Marcus Rashford or Alejandro Garnacho. He would also never have spoken out against the academy, the club's biggest source of pride, by calling out youngsters like Harry Amass or Chido Obi.

While Amorim seemed to have a great bond with his players at Sporting CP, it is difficult to want to perform for a coach who keeps on criticising you in public. 

Fletcher, the Under-18s coach who will take charge of the first team against Burnley on Wednesday, also makes a lot of sense right now. He has been around United in a variety of roles since October 2020 following a 13-year career as a Red Devils player, meaning he knows the squad perfectly, as well as the academy.

Solskjaer and Fletcher - or Carrick, who was the Norwegian's assistant and briefly became interim coach when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021 - are far more likely to get a response from the team or the crowd. Amorim often talked about the players and fans feeling anxious at Old Trafford, but it was difficult for supporters to get excited about the often predictable football they were playing. By contrast, the atmosphere at Old Trafford was at its best when Solskjaer was in charge as fans felt a real identity within the club.

But INEOS should not just look to United's soul to make fans happy. After all, fan welfare has hardly been a priority for a regime which has sent ticket prices rocketing, and thus they need to lift the mood to protect themselves. 

Ratcliffe's swingeing cuts and mass redundancies, coming after almost two decades of decay under the Glazer ownership, have badly reduced morale around the club. But a coach that understands what it means to represent United can really lift the mood.

There is also a financial motive for looking within. United have burned through £42 million in little more than a year on bad appointments. It cost £10.4m to sack Ten Hag and his staff in October 2024, while two months later United sacked director of football Dan Ashworth after only five months in the role, costing £4.1m. 

Hiring and firing Amorim, meanwhile, is set to cost almost £27m, as United paid out his contract at Sporting and now have to pay off the remaining 18 months of his deal at Old Trafford. United can ill-afford another expensive hire after their total debt climbed to a record £1.29 billion ($1.72bn).

Solskjaer and the other club legends who have moved into coaching are not in it for the money; they merely want to help the club. Their love for United also means they will be more willing to work with, not against, the likes of Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.

It might seem that re-hiring Solskjaer or taking a chance on Fletcher or Carrick is a return to the days of Ed Woodward and undermines all the work that Ratcliffe has done in reshaping the club's structure in a bid to align with the other top teams in Europe. But the INEOS chief and his colleagues at United have ended up building a structure which is only like to repel the very top coaches. They might want 'best in class', but are quite reluctant to pay for it. 

After two years of eating away at the club's soul, it is time to go back to its roots.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea didn't waste any time replacing Enzo Maresca, announcing his successor just days after the Italian tactician's departure. The Blues confirmed Liam Rosenior as their new head coach on Tuesday.

Chelsea Appoints Rosenior as New Head CoachAfter Enzo Maresca left on January 1, Chelsea's management quickly secured a replacement. Just five days later, the club appointed Liam Rosenior on a long-term contract running until 2032.

Many media outlets and transfer experts had anticipated Rosenior's appointment. The former midfielder arrives from Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg, which helped smooth the transition.

Club officials praised Rosenior's work in Ligue 1 and see his leadership as a strong fit for their long-term vision. Although he remains early in his coaching career, he has shown enough promise to earn the board's trust.

Rosenior Eager to Begin Chelsea JourneyChelsea announced the appointment on their official website and included a statement from the new head coach. Rosenior shared his pride and excitement about taking on the role.

“I am extremely humbled and honoured to be appointed Head Coach of Chelsea Football Club,” Rosenior said. “I cannot wait to meet you all and get started.”

The 41-year-old will definitely face a tough challenge, especially since he hasn't had any experience managing teams in the Premier League before. Moreover, the expectation will be high at Chelsea as they are targeting at least a top-four finish.

The United States will continue its pursuit of dynasty status at the United Cup on Wednesday in Perth, where they are into the quarter-finals for the third time in four years.

Two-time champion USA, led by Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz, face a resurgent Greece at 10 a.m. local time, before Switzerland take on best-placed runners-up Argentina in the second quarter-final at 5 p.m.

Here we go! The Quarterfinalists for Perth have been set 🔒Day Session: USA v GreeceNight Session: Switzerland v ArgentinaWho progresses to Sydney?🤔 pic.twitter.com/UyWPYw66wB

USA vs. Greece [10 a.m.]
Gauff and Fritz topped Group A after twice being pushed to deciding mixed-doubles rubbers, repeatedly leaning on one another under pressure. Against Argentina, Gauff was forced into double duty after Fritz fell in a gruelling two-and-a-half-hour loss to Sebastian Baez, but he responded by saving a match point to defeat Jaume Munar en route to clinching their quarter-final spot.

Sakkari and Tsitsipas, both former World No. 3s who are looking revitalised after challenging 2025 seasons, now pose a stern test. Each went 2-0 in singles in Group E, with Tsitsipas holding a 3-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage over Fritz despite the American winning their past two meetings, including at the 2024 Australian Open. While Fritz has remained a Top 10 staple, Tsitsipas slipped outside the Top 20 for the first time since 2018 last year when he struggled with a back injury and searched for form.

The signs suggest Tsitsipas has begun 2026 recharged, having spoken of his ambition to return to a Grand Slam final and backing it up on court in Perth. Sakkari has also impressed, defeating Naomi Osaka in straight sets before finally overcoming Emma Raducanu on her fifth attempt.

“She really showed incredible tennis today, a lot of improvements she has made to her game,” Tsitsipas said of Sakkari after her win over Raducanu. “The shots are there. She has those shots. How can we utilise those to take them to the maximum? She actually did that with brave tennis and going for the kill.”

Gauff, a two-time major champion, will look to bounce back from her loss to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, though USA may again rely on her if the tie comes down to mixed doubles, having won both deciding rubbers alongside Christian Harrison.

Switzerland vs. Argentina [5 p.m.]
Stan Wawrinka continues to add intrigue to his farewell United Cup campaign, with the 40-year-old already spending six hours on court across two marathon singles matches. He produced a stirring final-set tie-break win over Arthur Rinderknech before falling in another against Flavio Cobolli.







Belinda Bencic has been the Swiss linchpin, winning both of her singles matches and delivering alongside Jakub Paul in a deciding mixed-doubles victory over Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. She opens against Solana Sierra as Switzerland seek to extend their run against an Argentine team that has already exceeded expectations in Perth.
“We're living in Belinda's world again,” Wawrinka said after Switzerland's tie against Italy. “She's showing us why we're here again. In general I'm quite happy with my level. Of course, I would have loved to win it. But they finished the job. We are happy as a team. That is the most important.”
Wawrinka now faces Baez, with the three-time major champion hoping to deliver another eye-catching performance. His endurance has been tested early, but his ability to rise in big moments has remained a hallmark of the first tournament of his final season on Tour.

Alex de Minaur once again carried the weight of the green and gold with distinction on Tuesday night at the United Cup in Sydney, where he pulled double duty to send Australia past Czechia into the quarter-finals.

After Barbora Krejcikova dispatched Maya Joint in straight sets, Australia faced an uphill battle to qualify on home soil. But the 26-year-old De Minaur fed off a lively Ken Rosewall Arena atmosphere to defeat Jakub Mensik 6-4, 6-1 before partnering Storm Hunter to overcome Miriam Skoch and Dalibor Svrcina 6-2, 6-3, sealing a 2-1 victory to top Group D.

With Krejcikova's triumph, Czechia also advanced to the quarter-finals as the best runner-up in Sydney.

“The atmosphere was unbelievable. Saturday night was incredible and tonight you delivered again,” Hunter said on court. “Demon brings energy, he's so clutch under pressure. So I felt really comfortable and confident with him by my side.”

Mensik produced moments of flair early in the second set against De Minaur, highlighted by an audacious front-facing tweener volley set up by a booming first serve. But the Australian remained relentless, saving all four break points he faced en route to improving his record to 5-0 against the Czech in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I didn't start the year the way I wanted to,” said De Minaur, who fell to Casper Ruud in his first group match. “But something I've done really well in my career is bouncing back, so I'm happy I bounced back today.”

In the women's singles, Krejcikova continued her strong start to the 2026 season with a comprehensive 6-4, 6-1 victory over Joint to give Czechia the early lead.

The 30-year-old, WTA No. 63 after missing the first five months of the 2025 season, jumped out to a 4-1 lead against Australian No. 1 Joint, who had missed her country's opening tie of the competition due to illness. Although Joint narrowed the gap to 4-3, Krejcikova held firm to close out the opening set 6-4 and ran away with the second.

“I'm very happy with my performance,” Krejcikova said. “I'm happy with the way I played from beginning to end. I had great support as well. It was a little up and down in the first set, but I'm happy to come through. I was trying to be aggressive from the start, and it's nice to have some matches under my belt. I felt a little better on the court today.”

Team Belgium earned a stunning 3-0 sweep of Team Canada Tuesday in Sydney at the United Cup to win Group B and claim a place in the quarter-finals.

After Zizou Bergs and Elise Mertens earned impressive singles victories to clinch the tie, the Belgians partnered to defeat Cleeve Harper and Victoria Mboko 6-3, 3-6, 10-5 in a critical mixed doubles match to top the group.

""We had to beat some big players today and a big tennis country,"" Bergs said. ""We small Belgians, we are so proud of each other today what we did as a team, especially after a rough first encounter with China. So we are happy and the group is very happy.""

The Belgians woke up this morning knew to win their group they needed to sweep Canada. That was a difficult task considering Canada swept China, which beat Belgium earlier in the event. That proved inconsequential inside Ken Rosewall Arena, where Bergs and Mertens found a way to keep their United Cup alive.

""I trust this team 100 per cent and I think we can do it and we actually did it,"" Mertens said. ""Nothing is impossible, so very happy about the doubles we played. We really were a team, we were growing.""

Bergs earned the biggest win of his career to start the day, upsetting World No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2.

“Really happy with the performance. I think this shows also our strength we have. We can fall down, but we will get back up and try to be better [than] we were the day before,” Bergs said. “This is what we do, and I'm also very thankful to have that team around me.”

Bergs claimed his second Top-10 victory (2-10) in one hour and 28 minutes, having also defeated then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev 10 months ago in Miami. A Belgian man had never previously earned a win at the United Cup. 

“I actually forgot this was my second Top-10 win, so that's really huge, actually, especially with a convincing way of playing,” Bergs said. “I just looked at it as a match. This is a a little different format, so we're still down. We still have to win a lot of matches today, so that was more the focus and today I just had to get the job done.”

Auger-Aliassime enjoyed the best season of his career in 2025, reaching the US Open semi-finals and competing in the Nitto ATP Finals. He looked sharp in his first match of the season against Zhang, but was unable to dominate the same way against Bergs, who saved all five break points he faced.

Watch Women's Singles Highlights:

Experience beat youth in the second match of the day when Mertens defeated Mboko 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Her two-hour, five-minute triumph put Belgium on the brink of the quarter-finals.

After coming from a set behind to defeat China's Zhu Lin in her opening match of the week, there was no similar escape for the 19-year-old Mboko against Mertens.

The Belgian rode a stellar serving performance to a one-set lead, holding at love in each of her first four service games and breaking Mboko decisively to love in the sixth game as well. Though Mboko showed the fighting spirit that earned her 15 three-set wins in 2025 on the way to being crowned the WTA Tour Newcomer of the Year to push the match the distance, she was unable to create any break point chances in the decider either. 

Mertens earned the decisive break of serve in the fourth game from a 30/0 deficit, and won a staggering 93 per cent of points played behind her first serve overall.

""I'm absolutely pumped ... I'm very happy with the point for Belgium,"" Mertens said. ""Also well played to my opponent. She's up and coming, she's really young — she's more than 10 years younger than me!

""I'm most proud of how I [started] the beginning of the third set. I really wanted to get that point, and of course, I had the team behind me. I got a little bit of experience already, but of course you always feel a little bit nervous. That's the game, tennis, a lot of emotions, but I'm very pleased about [the win].""

Sixteen inches separate Reilly Opelka and Dane Sweeny, but Sweeny did not seem to mind Tuesday at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ.

After Opelka defeated the Australian 6-3, 7-5 at the ATP 250 event, the 5'7” Sweeny grabbed a chair to step on to embrace the American. They shared a viral moment at the net.

""I'm just trying to not be overly serious with my tennis,” Sweeny told ATPTour.com. “And I told the boys, my friends, that at the end of the match, I would do the Dudi Sela. Dudi Sela did it to Karlovic a while ago. So I thought that was pretty iconic and he's 16 inches taller and I thought it'd be pretty funny.”

Sweeny was referring to 2014 in Bogota, where Dudi Sela did the same thing after losing his sixth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Ivo Karlovic. That embrace remains a fans' favourite.

“I think it's emblematic of the mindset I'm trying to take into this year,” Sweeny said. “I'm just trying to have fun with it as a whole.""

Coleman Wong became the first man representing Hong Kong in tournament history to win a match at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open on Tuesday, when he dispatched Mariano Navone 6-3, 7-5.

The 21-year-old had suffered defeat on his previous two appearances at the ATP 250 event but ensured it would be third time lucky. The wild card, who reached the third round at the US Open in August, will next meet Gabriel Diallo after the Candian beat Jesper De Jong 6-4, 7-6(7).

Shang Juncheng moved past Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-4 to improve to 7-2 at the hard-court event, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The Chinese wild card was in action for the first time since playing in Shanghai in October and will hope to put a difficult injury-hit 2025 behind him in the coming months.

The 20-year-old, who has reached a career-high No. 47 in the PIF ATP Rankings but is currently at No. 406, is a two-time semi-finalist in Hong Kong. Shang will play Lorenzo Sonego in the second round.



Defending champion Alexandre Muller maintained his impressive record in Hong Kong with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Miomir Kecmanovic. The Frenchman won his maiden ATP Tour title at the tournament in 2025 and will play Marcos Giron in the second round. The American cruised past Laslo Djere 6-2, 6-0.

Fifth seed Sonego and Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry also advanced. Sonego beat #NextGenATP Japanese star Rei Sakamoto 6-2, 7-6(4), while Etcheverry downed Valentin Royer 6-4 7-5. Etcheverry will next face top seed and the No. 7 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Lorenzo Musetti.

Botic van de Zandschulp set a second-round clash with second seed Alexander Bublik. The Dutchman beat Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 to level the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2.

France's Arthur Rinderknech saved two match points to stun Flavio Cobolli and eliminate Italy from United Cup quarter-final contention Tuesday in Perth. 

The result ensures that Argentina will finish as the Perth group runner-up with the best record. Wednesday's quarter-finals will see defending champion United States play Greece in the morning and Argentina play Switzerland in the evening session. 








After saving two match points on serve at 5-6 in the second set, Rinderknech rallied from a break down in the third set to close out a courageous 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-5 win in three hours and 21 minutes. 

 “I don't know if it was seriously good, but it was seriously tough, that's for sure,” the top-ranked Frenchman said. “He's powerful and he made me play a lot of balls. I was able to find a way somehow like Stan found a way against me three days ago. Both matches [went deep] in the third, so I guess it's good preparation for the Australian Open.""

Rinderknech survived 14 Cobolli forehand winners in the second set, when he came from within a point of going down a set and 1-5. He trailed 2-4 in the third before digging deep to win five of the last six games, finishing with 13 aces and saving seven of 11 break points faced.

“[Near the end] I relaxed a little more when my back was against the wall,” he said. “I couldn't do anything else but try to the last shot. I'll talk to my coach Lucas and I'm sure we can take something positive out of it.” 

Rinderknech finished 2025 as the No. 1 Frenchman and within the Top 30 for the first time in his career. He is now at a career-high mark of No. 27.

Although both Italy and France have been eliminated from quarter-final contention, play continues inside RAC Arena with Jasmine Paolini taking on Leolia Jeanjean, with mixed doubles to follow.

It was an unenviable task for Jasmine Paolini, stepping on court just moments after Italy was eliminated from quarter-final contention at the United Cup following Cobolli's loss to Rinderknech.

But she handled it with efficiency, defeating Leolia Jeanjean in businesslike fashion, 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes.

While the scoreline suggests a routine win, Paolini had to navigate more than a few challenges to secure her first victory of 2026. Beyond the dejected mood on the Team Italy bench, the World No. 8 also had to withstand a blistering start on serve by Jeanjean.

Despite entering as the underdog, Jeanjean fired six aces in her first two service games to take a 2-1 lead. Paolini responded by reeling off five straight games to claim the opening set in 40 minutes. 

She did so behind the strength of her own serve, winning 80 per cent of her own first-serve points in the first set. She finished the match at an even more impressive 88 per cent. On the other side of the net, Paolini broke Jeanjean to open the second set - and despite needing six match points - never looked back.

Even with Italy eliminated before she took the court, Paolini maintained her trademark positivity postmatch.

“We couldn't get through the group, but we did our best,” Paolini said. “We fought until the last ball and there's still mixed doubles, so we're going to be there to cheer for them. Sometimes it's sport, but we have to keep going, [keep] fighting, because that's the right way to finish this competition.”

With both teams already eliminated and only bragging rights remaining, Italy's Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori defeated France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 7-6(6), 7-6(6) to clinch the tie.

Despite Czechia's Barbora Krejcikova's straight-set victory over Maya Joint, Australia's Alex de Minaur defeated Jakub Mensik, and carried that momentum into mixed doubles with Storm Hunter to win Group D. Czechia still advances as Sydney's top runner-up.

Host nation Australia advanced to the United Cup quarterfinals after a comeback 2-1 victory over Czechia on Tuesday.

After two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova defeated Maya Joint in straight sets to give Czechia the early lead, Australia faced an uphill climb to qualify on home soil.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

Alex de Minaur responded in front of a lively Ken Rosewall Arena crowd, defeating Jakub Mensik 6-4, 6-1 to level the tie. He then teamed with Storm Hunter to clinch the result, beating Miriam Skoch and Dalibor Svrcina 6-2, 6-3 in mixed doubles to secure the 2-1 win and top Group D.

Despite the loss, Czechia also advanced to the quarterfinals as the best runner-up in Sydney, thanks in part to Krejcikova's singles victory.

Krejcikova, ranked No. 63 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, jumped out to a 4-1 lead against Australian No. 1, who had missed her country's opening tie of the competition due to illness. Although Joint narrowed the gap to 4-3, Krejcikova held firm to close out the opening set 6-4.

""Felt really good to be back out here today,"" Joint said to reporters. ""I felt ready to play and ready to compete. Yeah, I mean, love the atmosphere. [I] was pretty disappointed I couldn't play the first match.""

In the second set, Krejcikova -- who defeated Norway's Malene Helgo in straight sets in Czechia's first tie of the tournament -- again raced to an early lead, winning the first four games before sealing the 6-4, 6-1 win in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

It was a little up and down in the first set, but I'm happy to come through. I was trying to be aggressive from the start, and it's nice to have some matches under my belt.

In men's singles, de Minaur delivered a composed performance to defeat Mensik 6-4, 6-1 in 1 hour and 31 minutes and level the tie at 1-1.

""I didn't start the year the way I wanted to,"" said de Minaur, who fell to Casper Ruud in his first group match. ""But something I've done really well in my career is bouncing back, so I'm happy I bounced back today.""

Mensik produced moments of flair early in the second set, highlighted by an audacious front-facing tweener set up by a booming first serve. But de Minaur remained relentless, saving all four break points he faced and improving his record to 5-0 against the Czech in their head-to-head series.

Mertens had secured Belgium's victory over Canada with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 triumph against Mboko. Her 2-hour and 5-minute triumph followed a stunning 6-4, 6-2 win by Bergs against ATP World No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Group B saw Belgium, Canada and China all finish 1-1 in ties, but Mertens and Bergs' mixed doubles win Tuesday gave the Belgians in the tiebreaker -- the record of matches won in the tie. Belgium finished 4-2, Canada 3-3 and China 2-4.

Bergs, 26, had lost his first match of the season earlier in the week against China's Zhang Zhizhen before securing his second career Top 10 victory in 1 hour and 28 minutes, having also defeated then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev 10 months ago in Miami. 

""Really happy with the performance. I think this shows also our strength we have. We can fall down, but we will get back up and try to be better [than] we were the day before,"" Bergs said. ""This is what we do, and I'm also very thankful to have that team around me.""

A Belgian man had never previously earned a win at the United Cup.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

""I actually forgot this was my second Top-10 win, so that's really huge, actually, especially with a convincing way of playing,"" Bergs said. ""I just looked at it as a match.

Auger-Aliassime enjoyed the best season of his career in 2025, reaching the US Open semi-finals and competing in the Nitto ATP Finals. He looked sharp in his first match of the season against Zhang, but was unable to dominate the same way against Bergs, who saved all five break points he faced.

Elise Mertens led Belgium against Canada in the United Cup, defeating Victoria Mboko in a hard-fought match, while Zizou Bergs secured a win against Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Marta Kostyuk had an intentional offseason, taking an extended break to recharge and focusing on precision strength to increase power. Now the World No. 26 is ready to blow past her career-high No. 16 ranking and into the Top 10.

Marta Kostyuk had quite the eventful offseason.

She rested and recharged in the Maldives -- her ""happy place"" -- went on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje (a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina), returned to the Ukraine and ended up in Dubai before heading Down Under for the start of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season. (She also got a second dog, who proved to be more of a troublemaker than her first and required a substantial amount of training.)

The 23-year-old took advantage of her team's decision to take a longer break than usual after the season ended, in a year where she played a jam-packed schedule consisting of 22 tournaments (including Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers, and then the BJK Cup Finals five months later).

""It was a team decision,"" the World No. 26 said before heading to Brisbane for her first tournament of the year. ""We were like, 'OK, we want some longevity, and we want me to be mentally healthy.'""

Once the extended break concluded and Kostyuk returned to the court and the weight room, she went full bore.

Working with her fitness coach, Jolanta Rusin, for a third straight preseason, the pair homed in on Kostyuk's precision strength, which is more about explosive movements than being able to lift a ton of weight. Rusin created a series of intense, intentional workouts that incorporated speed, endurance and strength, specifically eccentric and isometric exercises. It was challenging work, Kostyuk says, though she and Rusin have been working towards this evolution of her fitness and power over the last three years.

They couldn't have executed it as effectively when they first started their working relationship.

""I needed two years of work so my body can handle what we are doing right now,"" she says. ""And it's not like everyone is going to see my strength or my power in the first week of the year. It's something that we have just started building up, and it's going to come in time.""

With time and reps, Rusin and the rest of the team have gotten to understand Kostyuk's body more intricately, and they've used that valuable information to not only build up the Ukrainian's power, but also help her prevent injuries. (Despite a wrist injury that sidelined her from the Cincinnati Open last summer, she played a full schedule in 2025.)

Ahead of her first tournament of the year in Brisbane, Kostyuk says she feels the effects of her offseason training, and is not merely excited about what it could mean for her performance on court -- she's also amazed.

""It's amazing to see how things come together and you become this incredibly fast human being,"" she said. ""Incredibly sharp and explosive. This process is incredible. And every time I go through it as an athlete, it's just so mesmerizing to me.""

Beyond feeling physically fit and energized, Kostyuk also gets life from the Australian swing, a part of the year where she's enjoyed some breakthrough moments and tends to shine.

She's had more than a few wonderful memories in Australia: her girls' singles title in Melbourne, when she was 14 -- the first Grand Slam she ever played -- is one of them. More recently, in 2024, she had her best result at a major when she reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.

And as far as it is from home, at times it feels like home. That's due, in large part, to a Ukrainian family that Kostyuk met at the tournament some years ago. She sees them every year at the season's first Slam, and considers them her Australian family.

But before she sets her sights on another deep run in Melbourne, she has a couple of tune-ups at WTA 500 tournaments in Brisbane and Adelaide, where she made the quarterfinals in both 2023 in 2024.

She'll make her season debut in Brisbane against Yulia Putintseva, after receiving a first-round bye. It will be their first career meeting.

""I feel great,"" Kostyuk said. ""I feel happy. I feel happy to be traveling again for the tournaments, and I start from my favorite place, Australia. I feel rested. I feel excited.""

Despite a solid season in which Kostyuk reached the quarterfinals of three WTA 1000 tournaments and the fourth round of the US Open, she fell in the PIF WTA Rankings in 2025. She started the season ranked No. 18 and fell down to No. 36 in April, ultimately finishing at No. 26.

The year prior, a few months removed from reaching the semis of Indian Wells and the Stuttgart final, she hit a career-high No. 16.

As she begins her ninth season on the WTA Tour, she's aiming to get back there, and then blow past it and into the Top 10. It's the first time she's had a specific, concrete benchmark like that in mind.

""I want to finish the year in the Top 10,"" she says. ""I've never set a goal like this before, a clear goal in my head. I still don't think it's the right thing to do, to focus on the rankings, because the most important thing is to develop yourself and your game. Then the rankings will just be a consequence of the work that you do. 

""But it's something that I keep in my head. It's still good to have something like this in your head, because it's a direction that you want to go. Because if you don't have a direction, you can get lost, you know?""

The ultimate goal, of course, is to win a Grand Slam. Though even that takes a backseat to being a quality human being and role model.

""At the end of the day, the most important thing is what kind of person you are,"" she says. ""[It's more important] than what kind of player you are. This is what we, as a whole team, work on every day, too. I think at times it is an even more difficult job than being a tennis player.""

Kovacevic was virtually untouchable when his first serve found the box, winning 25 of 26 points. He successfully converted a break in each set, both instances coming via an unforced error off the Australian's racquet.“Obviously a tough one to approach. You don't always know what you're going to get with Nick, whether he's healthy or he's not,” Kovacevic said during his on-court interview. “Tough to scout him recently, because he hasn't been on tour for a while playing serious matches.

For a quarterfinal berth, he gets the winner of a left-handed showdown between seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Ugo Humbert.

Since ending his 2022 season in Tokyo, tour appearances have been few and far between for Kyrgios due to persistent knee and wrist injuries. After entering just one tournament across the next two years, the former Wimbledon finalist managed to contest four events in 2025. He wrapped the year by defeating Aryna Sabalenka in ""The Battle of the Sexes"" exhibition.“I don't really know what my plan is this year.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

McLaren will enter the new Formula 1 season with another big-name arrival to bolster their leadership ranks.

Will Courtenay has started his new role as McLaren's Sporting Director in the build-up to the 2026 season, following an early release from Red Bull.

Courtenay represented Red Bull from their first F1 season back in 2005, having joined the Milton Keynes-based operation under the previous Jaguar guise.

He rose through the ranks to Head of Race Strategy, before McLaren secured his services in a deal originally announced back in September 2024.

“His experience, professionalism and passion for motorsport make him the ideal candidate to lead our F1 sporting function,” said McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella at the time.

“We are now entering a key phase in our journey as a team, and we are confident that he will be a great addition to our strong leadership team as we strive to continue challenging for wins and championships.”

Red Bull subsequently stated that Courtenay remained part of their team and would “see out his contract until mid-2026”, but his release has been brought forward to the start of this year.

“I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new position as Sporting Director at McLaren Racing!” Courtenay confirmed on his LinkedIn profile.

“After 22 years at Red Bull Racing, the last 15 as Head of Race Strategy there, I'm excited to say I'm now embarking on a new challenge, joining the McLaren Racing Formula 1 Team as Sporting Director.

“I'd like to say a huge thanks to everyone I worked with at Red Bull. I made so many great friends there and I hope I'll still see many of you in the paddock. It was an incredible two and a bit decades.

“But now I'm looking forward to settling into my new role and team, and hopefully making plenty more new friends, as I do my very best to help McLaren continue its recent success in the coming years.”

Courtenay will reunite with former Red Bull colleague Rob Marshall at McLaren – the latter having joined the Woking-based team as design chief at the start of 2024.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Zhou Guanyu tells F1.com about his excitement at becoming a reserve driver for the new Cadillac F1 team, how he feels he benefitted from his time at Ferrari and his hopes for the future.

Zhou Guanyu is the latest familiar name to join the Cadillac Formula 1 team, with the Chinese racer having been announced as the squad's reserve driver for 2026, forming part of a wider line-up that features Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez on the race team and former IndyCar racer Colton Herta as a test driver.

While Zhou is no stranger to the reserve role – having acted in this position for Ferrari in 2025 – the year ahead will provide a wholly new challenge for the 26-year-old as he prepares to provide crucial support work to a brand-new team, in a season that will also feature new technical regulations.

‘New' might be a term that cropped up a lot there, but the project is one that also brings with it a lot of familiarity for Zhou, a factor that he admits was part of the appeal as he discusses his Cadillac move with F1.com.

“Firstly, I'm really excited for this new project,” the driver from Shanghai – who spent three years on the grid with the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber team between 2022 and 2024 – explains.

“The main thing is that with this new team, I know for example Graeme [Lowdon], Valtteri and also a lot of engineers that work in the team and, over the course of this year, I've seen how the team was setting up and I really felt the future is bright.

“They're not setting up a team just to be on the grid – they're setting up a team trying to compete. They have a mission target, to try to achieve over the years, and to bring Cadillac to a top midfield team and so on onwards, so that's what really attracted me.

“On the other side, I think the team [saw] what I was able to do over the course of last year and what my role was, and I think it can really benefit both sides.

""So to be the team's only reserve driver, I feel like this is the best opportunity for me in order to be back behind the wheel, and at the same time I think what I am capable of bringing [in terms of] information and, together with two very experienced drivers, it just brings the team forward.

“This year is a massive rule change, so all this knowledge, experience we've had over the years, this can be a help if you're comparing to a less experienced driver.”

Indeed, Zhou described the feeling of joining the team as being like “rejoining family” in the announcement of his signing, with Team Principal Lowdon having long acted as part of his management team while Bottas was the Chinese driver's team mate throughout his time on the grid. It is the involvement of such experienced names that added further to his interest in the project.

“We spoke a lot,” Zhou says of his relationship with Bottas. “We spent a lot of time [together], even when we were in different teams over the course of last year, so the three years I spent [in F1 were] really together with Valtteri.

“But at the same time I always worked together with Graeme, and that's really what brings me the high trust over this project. I haven't worked with Checo before – I know he's a great driver.

“But the three of us were always very honest people, and also we're very transparent with what's going on behind the scenes. So when you come into a massive chapter change over the rules, that's what you really need.

“You need a team that can drive forward all together, rather than just focusing on an individual side of the garage for the, let's say, single benefits and results. All that is really important.

“And as well, it's a new team, so it just puts extra energy on it because you start from scratch. For me, it's also a brand-new experience I've never been [in] before. I'm excited for what's coming ahead, and looking forward to going back in the Charlotte factory, spend some simulator time, and also at Silverstone with all the engineers.”

After losing his spot on the grid with Kick Sauber at the end of 2024, Zhou returned to Ferrari – where he had previously been a member of the Driver Academy – in the role of reserve driver, working alongside race drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

With the Scuderia providing Cadillac with their power unit and gearbox in 2026, Zhou believes that his experience of working with the Italian outfit will be beneficial, along with the fact that he previously raced with Ferrari engines during his time with Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber.

“Since this new era of Formula 1 introduced in 2022, I was only driving with Ferrari engines, which I got really used to, and also while I was testing development for Ferrari last season, I was also trying their 2026 engines, so all these things come into play together,” he explains.

“I have a very precise idea and a feeling with feedback on how the engine, power unit, gearbox, everything works, and also the hydraulic system. When you change from engine to engine, that's also one of the biggest things you need to adapt as a driver, because the way you downshift, the way you drive, the driving style, it's going to be changing.

“You need to adapt, which, for me, I will be already up to date. I'm looking forward to seeing what is the biggest difference this year, because it's going to be a big change. Even though we are a Ferrari power unit, I think every single manufacturer is going to develop over the years, so that's going to be very important.

“I think this year is not about who can start on top; it's all about, throughout the season, who can put the most efficient hours in terms of wind tunnel development and to have the most efficient benefits on the aerodynamics or improvements throughout the season.

“So that's what I'm looking forward to, and also I don't feel that I'm joining somewhere where everything I need to adapt to. I have the people I worked with, the engine the same and also, like I've mentioned, many staff and engineers I worked with over the course of the years. Everything just feels already like I'm familiar with everyone.”

Zhou also believes that joining Ferrari from Kick Sauber helped him to “learn a lot” and develop as a driver, explaining: “The decision made last year [to join Ferrari] was because I can learn so much from them.

“For me, in 2024 I was fighting at the bottom of the field, and then when you're arriving into a top field team, you can see what they're doing as a team differently compared to what has been in the past.

“It's not just how drivers react over the weekend, it's also the way you are setting up the team, the way the constructor works in the factory, and all the little details really matter. So that's what I really learned, and I see the massive difference since day one I joined them. Now I'm understanding what it takes to be getting a team up to speed of fighting at the top, for winning victories or [becoming a] top midfield team.

“That's very important, useful information, and I really enjoyed my time in 2025, that's for sure, because this is a year I learned so much from the team side, but also from the driver's side.”

On the flip side of this, Zhou acknowledges that making the switch from being a full-time F1 driver to a reserve was not always the easiest adjustment.

“It's challenging in terms of the mental side, just because you're watching all the people that are racing, and some of them you have battled with or you've beaten them throughout the years,” he concedes.

“You want to be there, and you feel like you deserve to be on the grid fighting with them together. So that's probably the hard side, on the mental side, and when you're just watching the race.

“Then on the other side, I don't feel it's such a bad position, because while I was able to take a step down from a race seat over the 2025 season, I really felt the stuff I wasn't on the top performance level of, the stuff I would do differently if I go back on the grid again in the future.

“When you're outside, you can just see a clearer picture of how you should develop, because you learn from both sides of the garage. Especially over the last year, I was able to be around two of the top drivers on the grid, to see what they're doing, and when they struggle or what they do well, what they've done differently, how they adapt, react.

“All these things I'm taking into consideration, and I feel like it made me a better driver already. I'm just looking forward for the season coming together, but then also hopefully my ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, back behind the wheel, racing full-time.”

That goal of a comeback evidently remains on Zhou's mind, but he admits that this is not a target that he is rushing ahead with as he focuses on his current journey with Cadillac.

“I think generally it's not something I will think about every single week or monthly,” he explains. “While you are at the beginning of the season, you are just focused on the commitment you have, and my current commitment is with the completely new journey with the Cadillac F1 team.

“For me, I think the ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, and that's the target. But in terms to achieve the target, sometimes you need a bit of a waiting game. You need to show the team what you can do over the course of the weeks, months, putting the effort in, and sometimes the opportunity appears, so I'm not fully rushing on that.

“Right now, I'm actually looking forward to the next few weeks, few months, before the season.

“Normally the period [for thinking about the future] is a couple of weeks before the summer shutdown. That's where you have to start talking about the future, so right now I'm just trying to take my [focus] into the team and then try to build on that.”

Lowdon has reiterated that Cadillac's target entering into their maiden campaign is to “execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors”, and Zhou echoes these sentiments amid a season that poses unknowns over the pecking order.

“I think when you have a new team, you can't say that when you get to F1 for the first race, you're going to be on top or you're going to be fighting for a top 10 easily,” the team's new reserve driver explains.

“It's about building on that. Many midfield teams started from scratch and they had to build on it, and it's all about getting the right people and putting the team in the right place, not rushing everything. I think on that side Graeme is doing a fantastic job.

“Who knows [what will happen] – it's a question mark at the end of the day, because everything is so different with the regulations for this season, so you have no expectation for any teams. But what I can say is that how this team is looking over the course of the last few weeks and months, it's definitely in the right direction in order to make the team a lot stronger and better.”

There is little time to spare before some of those questions perhaps start to be answered, with three pre-season tests soon to take place before the campaign kicks off with the Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.

The work begins now, then, for Zhou, as he gives an insight into what his first few weeks with the team will look like.

“There will be simulator [work] going on,” he smiles. “I'll be finally meeting up with all the staff members in the team after this announcement. I've been waiting for this for a long time now – I'm, let's say, released in terms of I can just go there, start putting the hard work in, starting all the season from now.

“I'll be very soon back in the factory, in the simulator, trying to give an idea how I feel and the comparison to all the recent and all the past experiences [I've had]. I'm looking forward to trying that and to meeting some new faces, some familiar faces, so everything will start very soon.”

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

With the 2025 season behind them and the countdown to Melbourne underway, the drivers have been making the most of the winter break. From switching off and spending time with family to rest, travel, training, and celebrations, here's a social recap of how the grid has been recharging over the festive holidays.

Formula 1 drivers are a month into their well-earned winter break after a busy 2025 season – but where have they gone, and what have they been up to so far? F1.com provides a round-up with varied results…

Cricket-loving Aussie Oscar Piastri was joined Down Under by the grid's honorary Australian, Valtteri Bottas, to catch Australia take on England in the Ashes. Piastri even rubbed shoulders with the Australian team, all while looking like he could have slipped straight into the lineup – given his sharp outfit put together by mum Nicole, of course.

Bottas, as ever, fully embraced local culture, topping off the trip with a fresh mullet trim before spending his time in the crowds and greeting fans. The pair even had plenty to celebrate as Australia went on to retain the Ashes.

It's been less than a month since the final chequered flag of 2025, but many of the drivers have been itching for excitement again – four wheels or otherwise!

After a successful year combining F1 and GT3 racing, the work didn't finish in Abu Dhabi for Max Verstappen. The four-time World Champion headed to Portugal to test a Mercedes GT3, giving his new number 3 its first outing since his announcement that he was switching from his previous 33 – a break from F1 clearly takes many forms!

Also pushing the limit on four wheels was Fernando Alonso, jumping in his XC Cross car to rip up a dirt track – what can't that man drive? Heading back to their roots, Esteban Ocon and Gabriel Bortoleto headed down to their respective karting tracks for a nostalgic spin, while Kimi Antonelli set some searing pace in the wet, having sneaked into Daytona Milton Keynes under a fake name.

Meanwhile, Carlos Sainz went full support mode for his dad and rally legend Carlos Sainz Sr as he set off in January's Dakar Rally for two weeks of epic racing. Having won the 2010, 2018, 2020, and 2024 editions, Sainz Sr will be looking for a strong result this year!

Anyone heading to the slopes this winter? The F1 grid certainly has. George Russell, Pierre Gasly, Charles Leclerc and Lance Stroll are among those who've been hopping on the skis over the festive period, with time in the mountains proving to be a driver's favourite for mixing training up – whilst getting their high-speed fix.

A gruelling F1 season is tough on the drivers for many reasons, but time spent away from family might be the hardest for the grid to deal with – so it's no surprise that the winter break is all about quality time at home. For Russell and Liam Lawson, uncle duties called, as the pair enjoyed hanging out with their nieces in the festive period.

Antonelli and Bortoleto wished us some happy holidays with posts of their family under their Christmas trees, while Stroll gave us a look at his Canadian break, featuring table tennis, snow, and more adorable family time – a nice change of pace for the paddock.

Drivers get to travel the world as they make their way through the F1 calendar, but for some the travelling doesn't stop during the break. The grid love an adventure, and if Leclerc's Antarctica trip hadn't been cancelled, they would have visited every continent between them.

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton chose to give the Big Apple a visit, his “favourite city”, and even spent some time with Hollywood actor Michael B. Jordan. Bortoleto found some time during his vacation to get in the gym in his native Brazil, while new Racing Bulls driver Arvid Lindblad flew to Mumbai in India.

Thai driver Alex Albon relaxed in the country whom he races for, before exploring the stunning and remote Bhutan. Ocon got his fix of Marvel, spending Christmas in Disneyland Paris with partner Flavy Barla, while Mercedes' Russell combined the cold mountain weather with some warm desert sun during his Kenyan safari – an impressive array of destinations all round.

Winter also brings a chance to celebrate the highs of the year just gone. Newly crowned World Champion Lando Norris marked his triumph at the FIA Prize Giving in Uzbekistan, with the Brit sharing some behind-the-scenes glimpses of the evening on his socials for what he called “the night I'd waited for my whole life.”

Elsewhere, Gasly put the spotlight on giving back, attending the Make-A-Wish France gala, having spent the year as an ambassador for the charity. One of his helmets was auctioned for charity – a lovely way for the Frenchman to use his platform to help children in care.

We reckon few drivers are counting down the hours to lights out in Melbourne quite like Bottas and Sergio Perez will be. After a year away from the grid, both are set to make their highly anticipated returns in 2026 with the brand-new Cadillac team – and they're making sure to leave no stone unturned in their preparations.

While Bottas and Perez have clearly made the most of their “sabbaticals”, they've recently been sharing glimpses of the hard work going into what it takes to get race-ready again on their socials. Not long to wait guys!

In classic December fashion, drivers have spent some time reminiscing over a life-changing past year, especially the 2025 rookies. Isack Hadjar and Ollie Bearman posted end-of-year recaps after their milestone years, and with such impressive maiden campaigns, we can't wait to see what they will achieve in their sophomore seasons!

	The saga of Mickey Rourke‘s latest round of financial woes has taken another bizarre turn as the actor has released a video denouncing a GoFundMe set up in his name by his longtime manager, allegedly with his permission.


	The fundraiser, launched early Sunday morning, is nearing its $100,000 goal — money meant to help Rourke remain in his home after being served an eviction notice for falling $60,000 behind in rent.




	Seated with his beloved rescue dog Lucky on his lap, a distraught Rourke, in a fuchsia V-neck T-shirt and straw cowboy hat, addresses his nearly 500,000 Instagram followers.

	“Something's come up that I'm really frustrated, confused and I don't understand,” Rourke, 73, says. “Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money. A charity. 


	“And that's not me. If I needed money I wouldn't ask for no charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger,” he continues. “Whoever did this, I don't know why they did it. I wouldn't know what a GoFundMe is in a million years.”


	As reported exclusively by The Hollywood Reporter, the account was created by Liya-Joelle Jones, assistant to Kimberly Hines, Rourke's manager for a decade. Hines and Jones both told THR that the GoFundMe was created “with Mickey's permission.” 


	Hines now tells THR that Rourke may not have been completely clear on the details of how a GoFundMe works and is now embarrassed that the effort has become worldwide news.


	Rourke, however, is denying any knowledge of who created the fundraiser and insists he would never turn to fans for financial help, an act of desperation he calls “humiliating,”

	











	Rourke candidly admits he was terrible at maintaining finances throughout his career, with online estimates putting his net worth at its peak at $5 million. 


	“I did a terrible job managing my career. I wasn't very diplomatic. I had to go to 20 years of therapy to get over that. But I'm not that person anymore. … I'm not that wild man I was 20 years ago,” he concedes.


	Rourke goes on to pledge that he will reach out to his longtime lawyer, Bill Sobel, and return any money donated to the GoFundMe by fans.


	“I would never ask strangers or fans for a nickel,” Rourke says. “It's not my style. You ask anybody who knows me. It's humiliating and fucking embarrassing… I want you to get your money back. All things will pass.


	“There's only one person I can think of that would do such a thing. I hope it's not the person I'm thinking about,” he says.


	Speaking to THR from Europe, Hines details the events that led to the GoFundMe launch and offers more background on Rourke's current living situation.

Awards season is officially in full swing, with plenty of celebrations leading up to the Globes on Jan. 11.

The actor and aspiring filmmaker from Odessa, Texas has skated to representation at the powerhouse agency thanks to surprise superstardom delivered by the Jacob Tierney-created sensation.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	It's game on for Connor Storrie at CAA.


	The Heated Rivalry breakout has signed with the powerhouse agency for representation. The move comes as Storrie's star is on fire thanks to the meteoric rise of Jacob Tierney's hockey drama Heated Rivalry and his portrayal of the magnetic Russian Ilya Rozanov.




	Inspired by the second installment of Rachel Reid's beloved Game Changers book series and made by Canadian streamer Crave (acquired by HBO Max for the U.S. and Australia), Heated Rivalry casts Storrie as Rozanov opposite Hudson Williams' Shane Hollander in the steamy yet heartfelt story of professional hockey phenoms and arch rivals whose lust turns to love over the course of a decade.

					Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper Debate Who They Would Be in 'Heated Rivalry' During New Year's Eve Special		
			









	The six-episode series debuted Nov. 28, and by the time the finale aired on Christmas Day, it had become a certified smash buoyed by critical raves, a “truly joyful” press tour, frenzied online followings and eagle-eyed fans who analyzed every detail, line of dialogue, camera angle and song choice for inevitably viral clips on TikTok and Instagram not to mention loving reactions on Threads, X and more, which only seemed to reinforce what lovers of the book series had already known.

	Glowing reviews, like one in the Seattle Times, praised Storrie's Rozanov as a “pool of nuance, deeply vulnerable one moment and obnoxiously charming the next. (And you would never know Storrie was born in Texas instead of Russia — his accent is that good.) Williams' Shane feels like he was lifted perfectly from the book, down to his neurotic need to fold his clothes before sex. Together, they're a tour de force, completely mesmerizing in their dazzling chemistry.”

	











	Then came a slew of interviews, podcast recordings and photo shoots that pushed both Storrie and Williams to north of one million Instagram followers. Storrie teamed with Williams for a GQ Hype cover and features in Vanity Fair, The New York Times, Vulture, Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly and more. (A digital The Hollywood Reporter investigated the show's fandom.) Storrie went solo for widely shared outings with Interview, The Cut, Cultured and Behind the Blinds Magazine and more that displayed his versatile modeling talents in highly-styled spreads.


	Through it all, Storrie and Williams have boasted about being best friends, and that bond continues with representation as they both signed with CAA. (Deadline first reported Williams signing in what can now be seen as a coup for CAA to rep both.) There's been a fever online as fans speculate on how both actors will ride the wave of surprise superstardom to new projects beyond the rink of Heated Rivalry. It was recently reported that the show has already been picked up for a second season and that they're both under contract for a total of three seasons. 


	They're not completely new to this. Storrie's first major role came via Todd Phillips' Joker: Folie á Deux in a chilling climatic scene opposite Joaquin Phoenix, and he's been seen in April X and Tiny Beautiful Things. He's got more work up his sleeve, too, as he recently wrote and directed a self-financed directorial debut called Transaction Planet. The film, which he's called “super absurdist and bizarre” in the vein of John Waters meets Darren Aronofsky meets Sean Baker, follows an alien spirit that incarnates into a human body.

	











	But if you ask him, he's “very much in the beginning” stages of a white-hot career. “When I auditioned for Heated Rivalry, I was working at a restaurant. I was working at a restaurant 40 hours a week, getting off at 1 a.m. I did that on and off ever since I was in high school,” he recently told THR. “Really, honest to God, all I want going forward is to keep having opportunities to work and be on set and enjoy the people and the experiences along the way. It sounds so cheesy, and I was not of that mindset up until eight months ago, but it really is just about being inspired and being with cool people. I just feel so blessed to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do with my life. How long that lasts, what that looks like, who I get to work with, the ups and the downs, I don't know, but all I can do is be thankful for right now and hope that those fruits continue to grow.”


	Those fruits will be growing with CAA and a team that includes management at Atlas Artists, the law firm Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman and Shelter PR for personal publicity. He'll next be seen opposite Janelle James announcing SAG-AFTRA's Actor Awards nominees on Wednesday morning.

Creator Darren Star also recently received an honor from the French government. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	After a season split between France and Italy, Emily in Paris is heading home.


Netflix has renewed the romantic dramedy starring Lily Collins for a sixth season. The pickup for Emily in Paris comes less than three weeks after season five premiered to typically solid viewing figures: The season racked up 26.8 million views worldwide (155 million hours divided by a running time of 5 hours, 47 minutes) over its first 11 days. 




	The season follows Emily (Collins) to Italy, where she opens a satellite office for the marketing agency she works for in Rome. She strikes up a new romantic relationship there, but — spoiler alert — ultimately opts to return to Paris.

	“She really chooses her own life in Paris and her work, and what she's worked so hard to achieve,” series creator Darren Star told The Hollywood Reporter about Emily's decision. “I think ultimately that's where her heart was and it clarified for her the fact that she wants to be in Paris and she wants to live there, and it's not a temporary thing.”


	Star also hinted at a resumption of the on-and-off romance between Emily and Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) in season six. “I don't think that Emily and Gabriel would be … I don't think it'll be an instant relationship, though I do believe that people can find their way back to each other,” he said.

	











	Star also received an honor from French President Emmanuel Macron in December. He was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honor), the highest civilian honor France recognizes.


	Along with Collins and Bravo, the Emily in Paris season five cast also includes Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Samuel Arnold, Bruno Gouery, William Abadie, Lucien Laviscount, Eugenio Franceschini, Thalia Besson, Paul Forman, Arnaud Binard, Minnie Driver, Bryan Greenberg and Michèle Laroque.


	Paramount Television Studios produces the series with Darren Star Productions and Jax Media. Star executive produces with Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, Andrew Fleming, Stephen Brown, Alison Brown, Robin Schiff, Grant Sloss and Joe Murphy.

The collaboration will allow fans and artists to go in-depth on the music they love and create an artist incubator to explore AI in human creation.


													By
												

	Dan Rys



	The Universal Music Group has inked a new partnership with AI chipmaking giant NVIDIA “to pioneer responsible AI for music discovery, creation and engagement,” the companies announced today (Jan. 6). The collaboration will involve research and development, the companies said, with an emphasis on “advancing human music creation and rightsholder compensation,” including the identification of copyrighted works in AI uses.


	Much of that collaboration will center on NVIDIA's Music Flamingo initiative, launched in November, which allows for in-depth analysis of music below the surface level, digging into elements such as harmony, musical structure, tempo, instrumentation, key, lyricism, musical theory, cultural and historical context and dynamics, among other metrics, including things like emotional resonance and chord progressions. Universal sees that as being additive to the musical discovery process for fans — allowing for deeper connections to different songs, albums or artists based on more than just genre, scene or surface-level signifiers. It also sees it as additive for artists — who can now use it for in-depth analyses of their own works — as well as for fans to more deeply engage in the music they already love, in addition to finding new music that resonates.


	“We're excited to establish this ground-breaking strategic relationship which unites the world's leading technology company with the world's leading music company in a shared mission to harness revolutionary AI technology to dramatically advance the interests of the creative community and the role of music in global culture,” Universal chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge said in a statement. “We eagerly embrace the opportunities that AI presents, and the fact that NVIDIA is choosing to take a leadership position in the tech industry in their commitment to responsible AI principles is critically important. We look forward to working closely with NVIDIA to direct AI's unprecedented transformational potential towards the service of artists and their fans as we work together to set new standards for innovation within the industry, while protecting and respecting copyright and human creativity.” 


	That last part — human creativity — will be addressed in a second part of the partnership, which will involve a dedicated artist incubator supported by both UMG and NVIDIA. Rather than promoting the hands-off generative AI music creation models that have emerged, the incubator will aim to bring together artists, songwriters and producers to see how they can better utilize NVIDIA's AI tools to help to enhance their own creative processes, instead of replacing humans with click-of-a-button creation. “By prioritizing hands-on artist involvement, the incubator develops solutions that enhance originality and authenticity — serving as a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs, and placing artists at the center of responsible AI innovation,” the companies said in a press release.


	That will also extend to creative labs in UMG's existing studios around the world, and UMG will utilize NVIDIA's AI capabilities within its corporate structure, too. The NVIDIA deal follows other AI agreements that UMG has cut with companies, including Splice, Udio, KLAY, BandLab and more.


	“We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual and genuinely interactive,” NVIDIA's vp/GM of media Richard Kerris said in a statement. “By extending NVIDIA's Music Flamingo with UMG's unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem, we're going to change how fans discover, understand and engage with music on a global scale. And we'll do it the right way: responsibly, with safeguards that protect artists' work, ensure attribution and respect copyright.”

Then again, after the way things went for the Kansas City Chiefs this year, the ""Best Medicine"" star might be rethinking his diss.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Josh Charles has no complaints about appearing alongside his former Dead Poets Society co-star Ethan Hawke as mad scientists in the video for Taylor Swift‘s 2024 single “Fortnight.” Hell, after the clip won the video of the year prize at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, Charles got a Moon Person for his role.

	“I got a Moon Man. It was pretty cool. The Video Music Awards, when I grew up, was the thing,” Charles, 54, told Jimmy Fallon on Monday night's (Jan. 5) Tonight Show. “The idea that that came just speaks to what an incredibly generous, awesome person Taylor Swift is.”

	Now, here's where things got a bit dicey.


	Fallon asked Best Medicine star Charles about rumors that he “got into a fight” with Swift's fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, on the set of the video, a tale Hawke first shared last year on the Rich Eisen Show. During that appearance, Hawke said that Baltimore Ravens superfan Charles would not leave Kelce alone about the Chiefs' heartbreaking 17-10 win over Baltimore in the 2024 AFC Championship game.


	Specifically, Charles was worked up about a specific call he thought went the wrong way, with Hawke counseling his fellow actor to “let it go,” even as he praised Kelce being “super polite” about the awkward interaction. 

	











	“A fight? No, he exaggerated this. It wasn't a fight,” Charles assured Fallon. “I've always liked Travis Kelce. I just thought he was so cool. But that year they beat us in the AFC Championship game — they beat the Ravens — he was a real jerk that year. So I kind of fell off of him.”


	Describing the mood on set of the clip that also featured co-vocalist Post Malone, Charles said when he met Kelce he was blunt about his assessment of the sure-fire future football hall of famer, telling him, “‘You know I always liked you and this year you were kind of a d–k.'” 


	Fallon couldn't believe it, shocked that Charles would confront the three-time Super Bowl champ, and legendarily good guy baller, saying, “You said that to Travis Kelce? He's one of the most lovable people I know!” 


	Charles was unbowed, saying, “I did. I said, ‘What was up with that?' And he laughed. He was like, ‘You know what, you're right. I'm gonna tell you why.” The actor then said Kelce admitted that the Chiefs were “most worried about that game” that year and they were determined to come out on top. “He's like, ‘I knew I had to come in with some swagger,' and he did,” Charles said of Kelce. “He got one of our veterans to commit a personal foul. He got in our heads, and it worked for them, and they won the game.”


	In the end, Charles admitted that Kelce was “actually great. We talked all different kinds of football… Such a good dude. I really like him a lot.” And even though Charles now really likes Kelce the man, when it comes to the gridiron, the star said his feelings still run purple, black, gold and red. “I'll root against him,” Charles doubled-down of the football star who may have played his final game on Sunday, which the Chiefs lost in a 14-12 heartbreaker against the three-win Las Vegas Raiders.

	











	And while Charles' beloved Ravens won't be making a Super Bowl run this year, he can take solace that Kelce will also be watching from home as the Chiefs will miss the playoffs for the first time in a decade this year after a dismal 6-11 season.

The forthcoming album marks his first solo full-length since 2016's 24K Magic.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Bruno Mars took to social media on Jan. 5 to casually drop one of his most anticipated updates in years: “My album is done.” 


	The post marked his first confirmation of a new solo project since 24K Magic, his Grammy-winning 2016 LP that spawned hits like “That's What I Like” and “24K Magic” and swept six trophies at the 2018 Grammys.

My album is done.


	While he hasn't been absent from the spotlight — thanks to the wildly successful Silk Sonic collaboration with Anderson .Paak and a string of high-profile features — this marks Mars' first solo studio album in nearly a decade.

	In the time since 24K Magic, the pop icon has been selective with his output but impactful when he drops. In 2021, Mars and .Paak released An Evening With Silk Sonic, an homage to '70s funk and soul that earned rave reviews and swept the Grammys.


	In 2024, he featured on the global No. 1 hit “APT.” with BLACKPINK's Rosé. By the start of 2025, “APT.” had become the first No. 1 song by a K-pop artist on Billboard's Pop Airplay chart, and in April, it scored a record-extending 19th week atop the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart — ultimately topping the year-end editions of the latter chart and the Billboard Global 200. 


	The song had nearly 4.9 billion official on-demand global streams through Nov. 27, according to Luminate. 

	











	In September, “APT.” won song of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards — a first for a K-pop act — and in November, it earned three Grammy Award nominations, including for record and song of the year.


	Mars also released “Die With a Smile” with Lady Gaga in 2024, and the playfully provocative “Fat Juicy & Wet” with Sexyy Red in 2025. 


	He's also stayed in orbit of the rock world, most recently performing at an all-star corporate holiday party alongside Slash, Eddie Vedder, Brandi Carlile, and others — suggesting the new album could carry more eclectic, live instrumentation influences.


	Whatever the direction, it's clear Bruno Mars is gearing up for another chart-dominating chapter.

The 1977 classic experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams since appearing in the Netflix series.

	David Bowie's 1977 classic “Heroes” is seeing a major resurgence on streaming platforms following its prominent placement in the finale of Netflix's Stranger Things, which premiered Dec. 31.

	According to new Luminate data, the song experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams after soundtracking the end credits of the series' final episode.

	Over the previous five months, “Heroes” had averaged approximately 94,000 daily streams. That figure jumped sharply in the days following the finale's release, reaching roughly 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3 — representing a 3.6- to 5-times increase over its typical daily performance.


	The placement marked a full-circle moment for the series, which has become closely associated with 1980s music throughout its run. 


	In earlier seasons, the show famously used a cover of “Heroes” by Peter Gabriel, making the finale's use of Bowie's original recording a deliberate callback.


	In an interview with Netflix's Tudum, Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed that the idea to use Bowie's version came from cast member Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington.


	“It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do the Bowie version,” Ross Duffer said. “Once Joe said that, we immediately knew that was the right song to end the show on because it is, in some ways, an anthem for Stranger Things. To use the original Bowie version just felt fitting for the conclusion.”

	











	Keery also saw a streaming boost of his own following the finale. His music project Djo experienced renewed attention, with his 2022 track “End of Beginning” climbing to No. 1 on Spotify's Global Chart this week, according to Rolling Stone, displacing Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia,” which had held the top spot for several weeks.


	Music has long played a central role in Stranger Things, which helped reintroduce a new generation of listeners to catalog tracks from the 1980s. Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” famously returned to global charts in 2022 after appearing in Season Four, while the finale also featured Prince's “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain.”


	The Duffer Brothers told Tudum that music selection was especially critical in the final episode, which centered around a record player used as a key plot device. “We never talked about a song choice as much as we did for that moment,” Ross Duffer said. 


	“We knew we needed an epic needle drop, and so many ideas were thrown around. I think there's nothing really more epic than Prince.” “Purple Rain” has seen a 243% increase in Spotify streams, with global Gen Z listeners driving a reported 577% surge.

	In a 17-second video posted on Monday (Jan. 5), Dion officially launched her TikTok era with a fun clip in which she reintroduced herself. “My name is Céline,” Dion, 57, said while wearing a black hoodie from the French fashion house that happens to share her first name before rhetorically asking how old she is. “I've got kids,” said Dion, perched in front of a glowing skyline and adopting a cool kid pose as she channeled her 14-year-old twin sons pleading with her, “‘We have to get you on TikTok!'”

	Miming confusion, Dion, said, “On TikTok?,” with a sampled voice behind her yelping “WHAT?!”


	“I've heard of that before. Suddenly I'm becoming cool,” she added as a Seinfeld-like bass thump bubbled up behind her and digital sunglasses were superimposed on her face. “Céline Dion is cool. That's amazing,” she announced with the perfect amount of winky incredulity. “TikTok here I come!” Ciao.”


	Dion let the caption do the heavy lifting. “They told me, ‘Celine, it's time…' I asked, ‘Time for what?' Turns out…something completely new,” she wrote. “My team then said they'd handle everything, handed me back my phone, and then quietly disappeared. So here I am, learning how this TikTok world works…one video at a time! Thank you for being here, I'm glad we're here together.”

	











	So far, Dion's TikTok adventure includes just the one introductory video, though her feed is populated with earlier videos from her other social feeds. 


	As last year ended, Dion was in a silly mood, dressing up as the Grinch to do the a monologue from the 2000 Jim Carrey-starring How the Grinch Stole Christmas and crooning her legendary cover of Eric Carmen's ballad “All By Myself.” Then, on New Year's Eve, Dion shared a heartfelt message to her fans, telling them, “As we welcome this new year, I want to take a moment to send you all my love. May this year bring you good health, happiness and peace in your heart. I hope you find laughter in the little things, strength in the hard times and joy in the memories you create with those you love.”


	The TikTok bit is one of the rare recent appearances by Dion, who has been less visible over the past few years following her diagnosis with the neurological disorder stiff-person syndrome in 2022, which seriously affected her voice and caused uncontrolled tremors, forcing her to cancel a planned 2023-2024 world tour to focus on her health.


	Watch Dion make her TikTok debut below.

So here I am, learning how this TikTok world works…one video at a time! Thank you for being here, I'm glad we're here together. – Celine xx…

	The pair are confirmed alongside Sophie Turner who is playing the lead. Angelina Jolie portrayed the same character in the noughties movies franchise.

	The X-Men are back in the latest look at Avengers: Doomsday.


	The minute-long teaser, just released by Marvel, features Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his old nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) reuniting over a game of chess.


	McKellen, in his inimitable voice, intones: “Death comes for us all. That's all I know for sure. The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' The question is, ‘Who will you be when you close your eyes?' “


	The trailer then cuts to Cyclops, played by James Marsden, tearing off his visor and unleashing the signature red beam from his eyes. 


	The trio of actors, who first appeared together in 2000's X-Men, were all confirmed as part of the Doomsday cast last year.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The X-Men-themed teaser is the third released by Marvel. The previous clips featured Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. The Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to showings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. 


Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie, premiering on December 18, 2026. Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.799 billion at the global box office.

Come for RDJ.  Stay for the brief cameos.   Story?   Don't worry about it, Marvel hasn't for nearly 10 years.

I'm ecstatic that movies continue to be shot in darkness so that we can imagine what's happening.  Love it!

Love it! Disney/MCU doing Cyclops right unlike Fox

If you pay attention to the background when Cyclops is tearing off his Visor you can see Sentinal robots walking about!!

Also, the mansion appears to be in disaray. I don't think Magneto did that. He appears to be ill and Prof. X is comforting him.

After Hollywood's A-list toasted the critics' favorite TV and films of the year at the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday night, the evening's biggest winners made their way backstage to take photos and chat with press.

“Field of Dreams” alum Amy Madigan, who pulled off a surprise supporting actress win for her work as Aunt Gladys in the horror film “Weapons,” breezed into the winners circle with a glazed donut in hand.

After some requests from photographers, she reluctantly swapped the pastry for her silver starred trophy, waving it around and hamming it up for the cameras.

“I've got donut on my face! Ah, I don't care!” she said with a giggle.

“KPop Demon Hunters” singer-songwriter Ejae, who took home best original song for the smash hit “Golden” alongside Mark Sonnenblick, reflected on how the song has evolved over the past year. 

“It's in sync with the intention of the song and how I felt writing it. For me, it was a hopeful song. It gave me hope that one day my dreams would come true. I still feel that now.”

In the TV world, “The Studio” won big for lead actor Seth Rogen, supporting actor Ike Barinholtz and best comedy series.

As a screen in the press room showed Jacob Elordi taking the stage for his “Frankenstein” supporting actor win, Rogen quipped, “Elordi won? For playing Frankenstein?”

Barinholz was quick to correct Rogen's literary faux-pas: “He's not Frankenstein! He's Frankenstein's monster,” he said, prompting belly laughs from Rogen and co-star Chase Sui Wonders.

Jean Smart entered the press room soon after, joking that her martini just kicked in as she fist-pumped and crunched her trophy like a 10-pound weight in her arms.

Jimmy Kimmel, who snagged the award for outstanding talk show, took a moment to ask some questions of his own to the photographers and reporters in the room.

“How does this work? You all take the exact same picture of me, then it's a competition to see whose photos get used?”

After a resounding “yes” from the peanut gallery, he quipped: “And do you all hate each other?” to laughs from all the photographers (who assured him that they prefer to help each other out, not just compete for the best shot).

Not every winner made their way to the backstage press room: the Leonardo DiCaprio-led “One Battle After Another” crew, which took home trophies for best picture and best director Paul Thomas Anderson, opted to skip the photo op, as did “Marty Supreme” best actor victor Timothée Chalamet.

Nick Reiner is reportedly no longer on suicide watch, nearly one month after his parents' grisly murders.

The suicide prevention smock he was previously required to wear has been removed, People claimed on Monday.

Nick, notably, wore the smock during his first court appearance on Dec. 17.

Ahead of his arraignment, which is set to take place Wednesday, the outlet claimed Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner's son is still in solitary confinement at Los Angeles' Twin Towers Correctional Facility.

Nick, 32, who entered the prison on Dec. 15 on two counts of first-degree murder, will reportedly remain in High Observation Housing (HOH) and continue to be monitored until a judge or court hearing deems otherwise.

Nick's lawyer did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

As the suspect remains behind bars, his siblings — brother Jake, 34, and sister Romy, 28 — are leaning on each other at their family's beach house in California.

Page Six recently obtained photographs of the duo walking along the shore collecting rocks.

Romy reportedly was the one to find Rob and Michele's bodies after they were stabbed to death in their Brentwood home.

As for Nick, he was caught on camera wandering around Los Angeles prior to his arrest — and left behind a bloodstained hotel room.

Nick, who long struggled with drug addiction, was reportedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and had his meds changed weeks before the gruesome murders.

His behavior subsequently became “alarming,” TMZ reported, claiming Nick was “out of his head.”

He did, notably, make a scene at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party with his parents the night before their bodies were discovered.

A pal said at Rob and Michele's memorial service last month that the “petrified” late director admitted at the bash that he was “afraid of [his] son” and thought Nick could “hurt” him.

In the wake of Rob and Michele's “horrific” and “devastating” deaths, Romy and Jake released a heartbreaking statement.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they wrote, in part. “They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text Crisis Text Line at 741741.

Savannah Guthrie assured fans she is “all good” after undergoing a recent vocal cord surgery.

The “Today” show host took to Instagram Monday to share the positive update. 

In the snap, Guthrie held up a whiteboard that read, “All good! Thanks for prayers and love,” showing that she is apparently unable to speak for the time being.

“see you soon! 💛” she teased in the caption. 

Her fans instantly flooded the comments section with warm wishes and saying how much they miss seeing her on their screens. 

“So happy to hear all went well ! Sending healing ❤️‍🩹 vibes,” one wrote. 

“Miss seeing you with Craig and Sheinelle. Love you 3. Heal fast and come back,” another added. 

On Dec. 19, the journalist announced that she'd be taking some time away from from the talk show to undergo the vocal cord surgery in the new year.

Guthrie, 54, explained on air that she had nodules and a polyp that needed removal, which is why viewers may have noticed that her voice had been “very scratchy and started to crack a little bit.”

She also said she would need to be on vocal rest during the recovery period but insisted the procedure is “not a big, big deal.”

She joked that it sounded like she had “the world's longest head cold,” but now, she's “really excited” to finally have some answers and improve her voice. 

“This has been going on for years, honestly,” she shared.

Since she wouldn't be able to speak for a while, Guthrie joked, “Christmas coming early for my family!”

The lawyer shares two children, daughter Vale, 11, and son Charley, 8 with husband, Michael Feldman.

Co-host Sheinelle Jones noted that she had undergone the same surgery and gifted Guthrie the whiteboard, wrapped in a red bow, that she used to “speak” as she recovered. 

“The silver lining is you have permission to be still. The house gets quiet, the kids are gonna want to help you out,” Jones said. 

“A lot of the greats have done it, maybe you'll come out singing like, I don't know, Celine Dion.”

Ronnie Radke filed a temporary restraining order against Tommy Lee's wife, Brittany Furlan on Monday.

The Falling in Reverse frontman claims that Furlan harassed him on social media, and her behavior escalated when he ignored her messages, according to docs obtained by TMZ.

He claims in the docs that Furlan drove to his house and sat outside, and also alleged that she followed him to a doctor's appointment and waited outside, simply staring at him.

Advertisement

In a statement to Page Six, Furlan's attorney insisted she's the one being harassed.

“Ms. Furlan is offended to find out this petition was filed because the only victim of harassment is her,” the statement reads. “We will take all legal measures to defend against this frivolous lawsuit and request that Ms. Furlan be protected from further harassment and threats by the petitioner.”

Advertisement

Reps for Radke didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

In May 2025, Furlan claimed she was “catfished” on social media by someone she presumed to be Radke — while she was still married to Lee — but that she told her husband “everything.”

TMZ reported that she revisited the drama over the weekend, claiming in her Instagram Stories that Radke really was the one messaging her and also accusing him of interacting with underage fans.

Radke, 42, hit back at her claims on Instagram, accusing her of “stalking and harassment.”

“Brittany Furlan may be now committing a crime,” he captioned one video.

Radke told TMZ back in May 2025 that multiple other women besides Furlan were “tricked and duped” by the individual pretending to be him and that the FBI was involved.

At the time, he said that he was cooperating with authorities.

“I sent them some stuff,” he claimed. “They're gonna find out who it is. I want to prove to everyone it's not me.”

Despite the catfish scandal and reports Furlan and Lee split in May 2025 after six years of marriage, the couple is still together.

Furlan said the incident actually strengthened their marriage during an episode of her and Brittany Schmitt's “This Is The Worst” podcast back in June 2025.

Advertisement

“All of this happening has weirdly brought us together, which is really strange,” she said. “I think we really faced like, ‘Oh, what would life really be like without each other?'”

Advertisement

“I was so lonely,” she also confessed. “I was messaging Chat GPT for affection. I'm like, ‘It talks to you lovingly and it says nice things to you and it's sweet to you and if it could kiss me I would let it.'”

A month later, Lee, 63, captioned a pic of them on Instagram, “Hey fake news we're not separated or divorced!! Get your sh—t together!! 🤣.”

The Mötley Crüe drummer recently shared a selfie with his wife celebrating New Year's Day together.

Five days in, and it's been a shameful, humiliating, and violent year for the United States. There is no shortage of horrors to point to, from the immigration raids to X, the everything app, adding a new CSAM feature to the gutting of public television. But for now, let's focus on international relations. They're bad. Days after the Trump administration kidnapped Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, the President and the ghouls hanging off him for warmth have renewed calls to annex Greenland. Speaking of which, Stephen Miller appeared on CNN today to rant that “Greenland should be part of the US,” though he failed to make any discernible case for it. While these threats probably won't inspire any urgency among Democrats, Icelandic art-pop superstar Björk is calling on Greenlanders to declare independence.

In an Instagram post earlier today, the “It's Oh So Quiet” singer loudly wished all “Greenlanders blessing in their fight for independence,” reflecting on how “relieved” Icelanders are that they “managed to break free from the Danish in 1944.” Iceland managed to retain its language because of its independence, which is why Björk's children speak Icelandic rather than Danish. But Greenland hasn't been so lucky. The country is a self-governing entity within the Kingdom of Denmark, which continues to oversee Greenland's foreign affairs and to account for most of its public funds.

Though she did not mention Trump by name, Björk didn't leave much to mystery as to who and what she was describing. “Colonialism has repeatedly given me horror chills up my back,” she wrote, “and the chance that my fellow greenlanders might go from one cruel coloniser to another is too brutal to even imagine.” As she lamented the threats from one cruel colonizer, she reflected on the horrors of another. “I burst with sympathy for greenlanders,” she wrote as she recounted the “forced contraception” of thousands of Greenlandic girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1970, as well as the “parenting competency” tests Denmark enforced on Greenlanders until May 2025. “Still today the danish are treating greenlanders like they are second class humans, removing children from their parents in 2025.”

“Dear Greenlanders, declare independence !!!! Sympathetic wishes from your neighbors. Warmthness.”

Between Sisu and Ready Or Not 2, the world of John Wick is finding common cause with the influence of Quentin Tarantino. And there's no shortage of comedic kung fu, ironic bloodletting, and stylish hotel rooms in the first trailer for They Will Kill You. Produced by It sibilings Andy and Barbara Muschietti and directed by Kirill Sokolov, the Russian action-comedy filmmaker behind Why Don't You Just Die, the trailer makes no attempt to hide its influences before veering off in its own Satanic course. Still, while it may take people a second to realize that this isn't the trailer for Ready Or Not: Here I Come, it still gives Zazie Beetz, the Bullet Train star who's no stranger to this type of thing, an excuse to square off against Patricia Arquette, Tom Felton, and Heather Graham.

﻿

Here's the logline:

A young woman must survive the night at the Virgil, a demonic cult's mysterious and twisted death-trap of a lair, before becoming their next offering in a uniquely brazen, big screen battle of epic kills and wickedly dark humor.

They Will Kill You opens in theaters on March 25, 2026.

Stranger Things has come to an end, and as the Upside Down industrial complex prepares to churn out more strange things, the show's biggest fans have a simple question: Where is the real series finale, Netflix? The show's core fanbase has been in a tailspin ever since Stranger Things wrapped last week. While reactions to the final season have been mixed, a common occurrence in the world of long-running, big-budget fantasy television shows, a large swath of fans apparently think they've been duped into watching the fake finale. Some refuse to believe that's how it ended and have begun spinning up different conspiracy theories to explain their disappointment. For instance, a Change.org petition signed by 389,000 people argues that there is “unseen footage” of the show that will supposedly fill in its numerous plot holes. Winnii J, the petition's starter writes [sic throughout], “I believe the fans should have a say in how the series should go. This is why so many of us are disappointed because it didn't live up to the expectations that was held upon. Everyone is clearly dissatisfied with this season volume. And also the amount of clues and information we got from the cast members and interviews are not matching up with the episodes provided. We want stranger things to have a legacy not be seen as some show that couldn't pull though due to it bad writing.”

On TikTok and X, the Duffer brothers' faithful have launched a fan theory called “Conformity Gate,” which poses that the series finale was an elaborate illusion created by Vecna, explaining why all the characters conformed to adulthood in the epilogue, a strange decision for a show that's, more or less, about growing up. Why do they think that? Because the long-running “Byler” romance between Mike Wheeler and Will Byers did not come to pass. So now the fandom is poring over plot holes, production goofs, The Truman Show for some reason, Netflix's episode ID system, the legal definition of television season, and the seating positions of characters to prove that a secret episode will drop later this week.



This sort of thing isn't new. When Game Of Thrones disappointed fans with its final season, a million fans signed a petition for a do-over. However, back in the halcyon days of 2018, when a TV show was bad, it was because the creators screwed up. Now? They're masters of manipulation, pulling the strings, and playing 4-D chess with their audience to release a secret episode after most of the people who watch the show have already moved on to Heated Rivalry. We imagine the fandom will be overjoyed to hear that the last piece of the Stranger Things puzzle is an extensive behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of season five that Netflix announced today.

Hallmark Channel's tight-knit creative community is grieving the death of longtime script supervisor Holly Atchison, who monitored the filming of every scene in dozens of Hallmark movies since 2014. 

Several of the network's most prolific movie directors have posted tributes to Atchison, including her dear friend Gail Harvey, who shared via Facebook on January 5, 2026, that she'd been “crying off and on now for four days” over Atchison's passing. 

Harvey, who worked with Atchison on seven movies, including “Christmas on Cherry Lane” and “Happy Holidays From Cherry Lane,” wrote that Atchison had been hospitalized over the holidays for an undisclosed illness, noting, “I was hoping to fly to Vancouver when I got home to see her one time but she was gone so quickly. It was a shock. Please hug everyone you love.”

Longtime Hallmark director Ron Oliver, famous for destination movies like “The Groomsmen” trilogy and “The Wedding Veil” films, shared via Instagram on January 4 that he was “deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my darling Holly Atchison.” 

Oliver wrote, “As a script supervisor on half a dozen of my movies filmed in Vancouver, Canada, Holly was an integral part of my directing team, responsible for everything from timing to logic to story elements, and she did it with charm and skill and the kind of creative integrity we seem to be losing in our industry.”

“But beyond that,” Oliver continued, “she was a delightful woman, brimming with kindness and compassion, literally a beam of sunlight everywhere she went. We shared a love for our pups and a good martini, and without her in my life it is safe to say that what I refer to as my ‘career' wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as much fun. RIP Holly. Hug your pup for me.”

Another longtime Hallmark director, David Winning, also shared his heartbreak via Facebook on January 4, writing that he and Atchison had worked on 12 movies and two series together, including Hallmark's “The Nine Kittens of Christmas” and “Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead.” 

Sharing multiple photos of them on set over the years, Winning wrote, “My Rock xo So sad to hear this news. The BEST | my ORIGINAL SCRIPT SUPERVISOR. From the top of Frosty Mountains at Manning, to boxes full of Christmas KITTENS to OUTER SPACE | By my side for SO MANY years. RIP my friend Holly Atchison”

Winning's tribute received over 100 comments from people in the industry stunned to learn of Atchison's death, including La Vonne Girard, a longtime Hallmark movie set decorator who wrote, “Oh my goodness. Just heard this tragic news. Holly, Bob and I worked on sooooo many projects together. We are absolutely devastated hearing this news. Such a loss. RIP Holly.”

As a script supervisor, Atchison was responsible for ensuring continuity from scene to scene, closely monitoring the dialogue and set from filming through editing. Her first script supervisor jobs in the 90s, according to IMDb, included working on hit feature films like “Ace Venture: When Nature Calls” and four episodes of “Stargate SG-1.”

Her first Hallmark movie was 2014's “Garage Sale Mystery: All That Glitters” starring Lori Loughlin, and she was soon on sets year-round for Hallmark projects, including many Hallmark mysteries. In addition to working behind the scenes on all eight episodes of Hallmark's 2024 series “Holidazed” and a 2019 episode of “When Calls The Heart,” Atchison worked on over 30 Hallmark movies. Here is the full list:

Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are officially parents! The “Dancing with the Stars” former pro turned judge and his lovely wife announced the birth of their daughter on Monday, January 5. They also shared important details, including her date of birth and the beautiful name they had chosen. 

Hough and Erbert posted a joint Instagram announcement featuring a black-and-white photo of their daughter's feet. “December 29, 2025. Everley Capri Hough,” they wrote the caption. “Every step of our lives has led us to you. Our hearts have been cracked wide open, and our world is forever changed.”

Their daughter's name is Everley Capri Hough, and it's a stunning choice that's also incredibly meaningful. The name Everley is a “gender-neutral baby name of British origin,” The Bump reports. “This baby name directly translates to ‘boar' and ‘woodland clearing.'”

The meaning behind the name Capri is described as  “a feminine name of Italian origin,” The Bump reports. “The modern name depicts the charm of the colorful Italian island located just off the mainland's west coast.” Together, the names sound really pretty and have a natural, earthy meaning.

Baby Hough's initials are ECH, and her proud dad has already added them to his Instagram bio. The DWTS judge had hinted at his daughter's arrival just days ago, when he made a subtle change on Instagram. Hough's Instagram bio reads, “ECH, 4 X Emmy Award Winner, 6 X DWTS Champion, NYT Best Selling Author, LIVE ON TOUR.”

Days earlier, he added his daughter's initials and removed the sentence “soon to be Daddy,” generating excitement among fans, who felt it signalled the birth of their child. Little did the world know that Hough and Erbert are very good at keeping secrets, and their daughter is already one week old. 

Hough and Erbert's baby announcement, which is only two hours old, is already receiving a lot of attention from fans, celebrities, and Hough's DWTS family. The comment section has been flooded with messages, and the post has been liked over 500,000 times.

“Welcome to the world sweet angel Everley,” her aunt Julianne Hough shared. “She's going to be so loved,” Season 34 finalist and fan favorite Dylan Efron commented.

Congratulations to Hough and Erbert on the birth of their daughter. We are so excited to watch them in this next step of their journey!

Happiest of Baby Everley love to you and your family.  A Blessed event for your entire family.🍼

Wishing you all the best! She probably moves like she's dancing already!

Congratulations mom and dad! May all the joy and blessing of the Lord, be upon you and this little one! May he protect all of you and keep you all safe! In Jesus's Mighty name!  Amen! Such a blessing! I'm so happy for you both! She will bring you so much joy!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Rookie' Star Bridget Regan Hospitalized in Prague","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/the-rookie-star-bridget-regan-hospitalized/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:55:19 GMT","

Fans are eagerly awaiting “The Rookie” Season 8, and ahead of its Tuesday, January 6 release, stars Nathan Fillion and Jenna Dewan are opening up about what happened on set while filming scenes in Prague. 

In an interview with People, published on January 5, Fillion, who plays John Nolan, and Dewan, who plays Bailey Nune, discussed their characters and the involvement of Bridget Regan's character, defense lawyer Monica Stevens. “I think it just frustrates Nolan to no end that someone so criminal and so terrible and so smug about it can get away with it. She's not doing hard time,” Fillion said of Regan's character. 

“And she kind of knows it. She plays with it. There's a sense of, ‘You can't get rid of me,' and, ‘I'm untouchable, and now I have an immunity deal, so you can't do anything about it,'” Dewan shared. 

The dynamics between these three characters is going to make for some interesting television, and Fillion and Dewan revealed that the experience of filming in Europe had been “incredible.” But they also shared that Regan was hospitalized. “Bridget got food poisoning,” Fillion said. “So she spent a little time in the hospital.”

Although the incident was undoubtedly unpleasant for Regan, Fillion and Dewan shared their excitement about being able to film on location. “I do think they were happy for us, but I'm sure we're sending our pictures of the bridges and these gorgeous locations, they're probably like, ‘Oh man, next time,'” Fillion said of his co-stars, who did not make the trip, including Eric Winter, Melissa O'Neil, and Richard T. Jones. “But everyone, honestly, we have the nicest people on this show. The kindest, nicest, most supportive people.”

Dewan, a mom of two, also shared her excitement about getting to spend some time just “living.” 

“I was the busiest because I went sans kids,” she shared. “So I was — every free moment I had — living. We went to dinners. We did tours. I felt like I finally matured to the point where I wanted to do tours all day long.” Of the experience, she said, “It just felt so special. It felt like we were in the midst of a film, an action film. It was so cool.”

Regan teased Season 8 in an Instagram post on November 13, 2025, and fans could not be more excited that the storyline continues to involve her. Bring on “The Rookie” Season 8!

And so begins the slow descent of the show, going to Europe is always a sign that the writers are running out of ideas.  Look at 911, they've done a POSEIDON episode and an outerspace episode with their one woman LA police dept character, will this show also be doing these same desperate scripts?

Michael Sarnoski is just two films into his directing career, but everything he has touched so far has turned to gold. 

After bursting onto the scene with the truffle-hunting tragedy “Pig,” which boasted one of the best performances of Nicolas Cage's recent career, he turned a tricky I.P. assignment into a box office phenomenon with “A Quiet Place: Day One.” But his upcoming film “The Death of Robin Hood” seems like his most ambitious project yet.

The film stars Hugh Jackman as an elderly version of the famed thief who steals from the rich and gives to the poor in British folklore. Written and directed by Sarnoski, the film promises to offer a much darker take on the Robin Hood stories that explores the end of the character's life. With a supporting cast that also includes Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe, it is already one of the most anticipated films of 2026.

An official synopsis for “The Death of Robin Hood” reads: “Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last. In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






After “The Death of Robin Hood” comes out, Sarnoski will turn his attention to a packed development slate that includes an adaptation of Hideo Kojima's acclaimed video game “Death Stranding” for A24. In a 2024 interview with IndieWire, the filmmaker also expressed openness to returning to the world of “A Quiet Place” while making it clear that he wants to balance original projects with his work on existing franchises. 

“I'm definitely going to do something original next, [but] one of the great things about the ‘Quiet Place' universe is that you have this sort of fundamental creature, and beyond that, you can explore any human story you want to in that world,” Sarnoski said. “I would definitely be open to that if I found that kind of in again, but you can tell a thousand different stories in this world because it's just about the characters. But I'm going to do something a little different next.” A24 will release “The Death of Robin Hood” in theaters in 2026. Watch the trailer below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","Béla Tarr, Patient and Often Pitiless Director of Hungarian Epics Like ‘Sátántangó,' Dead at 70","https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/bela-tarr-dead-1235171338/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:18:26 GMT","

Béla Tarr, the patient Hungarian filmmaker who captured often pitiless worlds in slow-cinema epics like the seismic, seven-hour-and-30-minute black-and-white “Sátántangó,” has died. He was 70 years old. According to Deadline, Tarr's death was shared by Hungary's national news agency MTI via Hungarian filmmaker Bence Fliegauf, with the European Film Academy sharing in an email that he died after “a long and serious illness.”

Tarr had not directed a feature film since 2011's acclaimed “The Turin Horse,” a bleak and apocalyptic drama about the unraveling of a farming family, after which he relocated from Hungary to Sarajevo to start the international film school film.factory. Tarr had a reputation for mentoring younger generations of filmmakers throughout his career, from “Twilight” director György Fehér, who died in 2002, to “Lamb” director Valdimar Jóhannsson. Tarr shut down the school in 2016 but remained an academic in his post-filmmaking life; visiting teachers up until that time included the likes of Apichatpong Weerasethakul (whose own style owes a great deal to Tarr's), Carlos Reygadas, and Gus van Sant. His prior academic career had included launching the short-lived Társulás Filmstúdió in the 1980s.

Tarr's accolades included a Palme d'Or nomination at Cannes for 2007's “The Man from London,” a crime drama starring Tilda Swinton and again in Tarr's career-long black-and-white, languid style; a 2023 honorary European Film Award; and the 2011 Berlin Silver Bear prize for “The Turin Horse.” The crowning jewel of Tarr's nine features, and the most internationally renowned and discovered and rediscovered by every generation of cinephile, is “Sátántangó.” It follows the denizens of a small Hungarian village grappling with the consequences of communism's collapse; the László Krasznahorkai adaptation retains Tarr's pessimistic, nihilistic style, directing everything from farm animals to drunk actors within Tarkovsky-like long takes and statically shot dance sequences.

 










“I'm just a big fucking maniac who believes in people,” Tarr told IndieWire on the eve of the 4K restoration of the film. Looking back on the film, he said, “I was just an ugly, poor filmmaker. I still am. I don't have power. I don't have anything — just a fucking camera.”

His other films include 2000's “Werckmeister Harmonies,” which returned to theaters in 2023 with a 4K restoration from Janus Films; “Damnation”; “Almanac of Fall”; and his breakout debut “Family Nest,” from 1979.

The European Film Academy's statement upon news of Tarr's death, per Variety, said the community “mourns an outstanding director and a personality with a strong political voice, who is not only deeply respected by his colleagues but also celebrated by audiences worldwide. The grieving family asks for the understanding of the press and the public and that they not be sought for a statement during these difficult days.”

Now in its third year, The Popcorn List (TPL), an annual survey of acclaimed feature films currently without wide release, is offering up 25 films recommended by film festival programmers from across the United States. Those titles include some of our favorite films of the year, like Annapurna Sriram's “Fucktoys,” Brittany Shyne's “Seeds,” and Ian Bell's “WTO/99.”

Founded in 2024 as a discovery and visibility project to amplify independent films that deserve a wider audience, TPL has quickly grown. To date, its lists have targeted 60 independent films, with TPL tracking each film's distribution journey along the way (two of the 19 films from the 2025 List and 10 of 20 films from the 2024 List are now widely available).

 








Related Stories ‘The Housemaid' Is Already Getting a Sequel Production Designer Jack Fisk Could Never Have Enough Ping Pong Tables in ‘Marty Supreme' 

TPL exists as both an open, online database (check out its website right here) and as a Pop Up Series, bringing “fresh, hot films” to audiences around the country via sneak-peek screenings at art house cinemas and through a virtual format. 

This year, TPL reached out to 68 film festival programmers, 40 of whom responded with 35 film recommendations. Some stats: four films were recommended by more than one programmer, and 10 are included as Special Mentions (due to their distribution and release plans, or other mitigating factors). Of this year's official recommendations, 12 are narrative films and 13 are documentaries, 17 are feature directorial debuts, and 14 are directed by women. The films on the list premiered all over the festival circuit, from SXSW to Sundance, TIFF to Tribeca, Berlin to Venice. 

 










“As more filmmakers confront the flaws of the traditional system, TPL has likewise evolved its understanding of what ‘distribution' can mean. And that could look more like a choose-your-own-adventure model,” said TPL co-founder Lela Meadow-Conner in an official statement. “We've expanded our thinking around what ‘wide release' means to TPL: has the average viewer in any given U.S. city had access to your film at their local theater, on broadcast or VOD? If the answer is no, you're eligible for the List. We applaud filmmakers who are taking matters into their own hands, and recognize the value of their work.”

Also of note: TPL's Pop Up Series will also return in the summer of 2026. “The opportunity to work with eight film teams to bring their films to audiences across the U.S. was a natural extension of TPL's mission,” said Kathy Susca, of The Film Collaborative, TPL's partner in the series and its fiscal sponsor.) “We're taking our learnings and adapting the Series — aiming for more films, more art house theaters, and more audiences for these fantastic films. We're emphasizing building the TPL brand for general audiences as a marker of quality, independent films that they can't find anywhere else.”

And, don't worry: There's a third book, too. 

Hot off the success of the first in the soon-to-be film franchise, Paul Feig's “The Housemaid” is officially getting a sequel. Lionsgate announced on Tuesday morning that Feig's latest, based on the Freida McFadden novel of the same name and starring Amanda Seyfried, Sydney Sweeney, Brandon Skelnar, and Michele Morrone, is prepping for a new entry in the new year.

Per Lionsgate, the holiday smash hit “has taken in over $75 million domestically in its first 17 days of release and $133 million worldwide with international territories continuing to roll out through January,” and will now capitalize on that success with a planned 2026 production start for McFadden's second “Housemaid” book, “The Housemaid's Secret.”

The film stars Sweeney as the titular housemaid, the down-on-her-luck Millie, who is hired to clean the palatial home of the wealthy (and very fucked up) Winchester family, including a stand-out Seyfried as the unhinged (maybe?) Nina, with Skelnar as her husband, Andrew. Morrone is Enzo, their shifty-eyed landscaper with secrets of his own.

The studio adds that the sequel has been in development for the past few months, and will see the return of screenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine, who adapted “The Housemaid.” Also back: producers Todd Lieberman of Hidden Pictures, producers Feig and Laura Fischer of Feig's Pretty Dangerous Pictures, with Hidden Pictures' Carly Elter and Alex Young, and star Sweeney executive producing. McFadden will also serve as an executive producer. The film is “being developed with an eye for director Paul Feig and stars Sydney Sweeney and Michele Morrone to return.”

“It's clear from both the global box office and from the outpouring on social media that audiences have responded strongly — and audibly — to the totally unique and truly theatrical experience of ‘The Housemaid' and want to know what happens next,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson in an official statement. “We believed in these stories from the very beginning, and we are beyond excited to bring the next chapter of Millie's story to life on-screen in collaboration with our outstanding creative partners Todd, Paul, Laura, Carly, Alex, and Sydney. ‘The Housemaid's Secret' is another wildly thrilling book in Freida's series that has captivated readers worldwide, and we look forward to translating it into a similarly rousing and riotous moviegoing experience.”  

 










The second book in McFadden's trilogy follows Millie after her tenure with the Winchesters ends, and she takes on a new job, and, well, that's just about all we can say without spoiling it and its predecessor. And, yes, as promised, there is a third book in the series, “The Housemaid Is Watching,” which puts a twist on the kind of action that plays out in the first two books.

“The Housemaid” book series has sold over 12 million units across all titles, with the second book, “The Housemaid's Secret,” accounting for four million of those. Translated into 40 languages, the book has been a New York Times bestseller for 65 weeks and counting and won the 2023 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Thriller.

The film will be overseen by Lionsgate's Chelsea Kujawa, who also oversaw the first film and brought the project into the studio, alongside Maria Ascanio. Robert Melnik negotiated the deals for the studio.

OKO DJ's music is best measured not in decibels but in candle watts. Sunlight, one suspects, would reduce it to ashes. Her debut album, As Above, So Below, is a seance of a record, a journey into the darkest corners of the night. The Athens-based musician, aka Marine Tordjemann, is host of an NTS Radio show called Twisted Dream Diary, and As Above, So Below, is similarly steeped in dream logic and surrealistic visions. In its collision of bleak sounds and cosmic mysticism, it often feels like a gothic take on new-age spirituality. It might be the post-post-punk equivalent of a European art-house film shot in grainy black and white, framing monologues muttered in French and Greek in dramatically austere trappings. It's a mood piece par excellence.

“Exolition” opens the album on a Lynchian note. The scene: part abandoned jazz club, part shamanic ritual. A glowering electric bassline grudgingly shifts its weight between two notes while the drummer taps out a slow, swinging rhythm on cymbals and snares. Someone strums a guitar below the bridge, throwing off an atonal shimmer. Breathy flutes, shakers and castanets, prayer bowls, and the cries of what might be mythical birds lend intrigue, and a witchy voice cackles in the background. “Look!” sighs Tordjemann, launching into a meandering meditation on light, heat, and emotion peppered with burning suns and simmering lava.

The bulk of the album has been painted with a similarly ascetic palette. “La Colline au Ciel” is more electronic but just as dour, with eerie tones fluttering above a scratchy electronic drumbeat and garbled synth bass, stray synth noises zipping like tracers into the night. “είμαι ή δεν είμαι” grows from sullen rock drumming, slow and methodical, into a kind of no-frills approximation of '90s big beat, with gurgling synths dripping over overdriven electric bass and onarrivenow's keening vocalizations. In “Ivres,” thick basslines spread out like inkblots beneath formless guitar plucking and Tordjemann's tale of a night of drunken decadence. In moments like these, As Above, So Below feels almost like a kind of radio play, less a collection of songs than heavily atmospheric tableaux populated by cryptic characters and dripping with portent.

The album's lyrics are not publicly available, but listeners with a working knowledge of French and/or Greek—or, as in my case, multi-lingual AI transcription tools and a skeptical eye for errors and hallucinations—will readily pick up on the album's brooding themes. “είμαι ή δεν είμαι” (“I Am or I Am Not”) is an existentialist meditation on solitude. “Ivres” contains hedonistic images of drunken revelers with “black lips and bulging eyes,” bringing to mind visions of 20th-century bohemians carousing in some grotty basement bar, sticky with absinthe and opium. (For some reason, it evokes for me the wild gaze of Man Ray's 1922 photograph of Markiza Luisa Casati.) The album's longest song, the eight-minute “La Colline au Ciel,” takes the form of a travel diary or epistolary tale, stringing together pictures of secluded mountain villages, stone churches, and volcanoes in a reflective, matter-of-fact tone that makes me think of Rachel Cusk's Outline or Chris Marker's Sans Soleil.

One of the only (mostly) English-language songs, “Formentera” is a post-punk dirge set on the Balearic island of the same name. “Sacred geometry is everywhere,” whispers Tordjemann, before breaking into a breathless reverie: “Look at pinecones, look at the stone/The spiral movement of air/Look at the trees, look at the leaves/Everything is in peace.” It would be easy for such lines to come off as hokey—to say nothing of the harmonized refrain, “Find a place that resonates with your truth,” the album's most melodic moment—yet, like any seasoned reader of tea leaves, Tordjemann sells the illusion, and makes a believer of you. Were it not for a momentary burst of Auto-Tune that gives “Formentera” a weird, ultra-contemporary sheen, it would be easy to mistake As Above, So Below for a vintage creation, the kind of thing an enterprising label head might have discovered on an unlabeled Maxell XLII rescued from some waterlogged box in a European flea market. But post-punk pastiche is a dime a dozen. The strange, singular touches that make As Above, So Below harder to place make it all the more fascinating. Like all great obscurities, it thrives in darkness.

It's hard, these days, to move through the world feeling optimistic. Violence is everywhere. Prices are steep, jobs are scarce, AI fakery is ubiquitous, and everything seems to be in a state of collapse. It would be natural for me to turn to any of the harsh or melancholy-tinged AD 93 records stored in my iPod. But I've more often found myself hitting play on The Velvet Underground and Rowan, a brilliant and irreverent underground pop album released last summer that's edgy but not irony-poisoned, silly but not unserious, darkly funny and giddily joyful. Its 14 songs, totaling just over 30 minutes, brought the skip back to my step and the song back to my heart like little else in recent memory.

The Velvet Underground and Rowan is the work of Londoners Leo Fincham, a visual artist and producer who records as Worldpeace DMT, and Rowan Please, government name Rowan Miles, a member of the Teenagers-esque pop duo the Femcels. Fincham and Miles are part of the '00s-fetishizing London scene that tangentially includes fakemink and Bassvictim, but The Velvet Underground and Rowan makes the pair feel like a scene of two: They may give entertaining and slightly crazy interviews, maintain messy Instagram pages, and put on hyped shows with little advance notice—and Fincham may live, or have lived, with Bassvictim's Ike Clateman—but their music is a melange of hyper-uncool early-'10s indie references and pathos-heavy lyrics, delivered with Donny & Marie Osmond-level chumminess.

The first time I listened to The Velvet Underground and Rowan, I felt like I'd just been king hit by Carles: Fincham and Miles may talk up their love of the '60s in interviews, and shades of both the Beach Boys and their album's namesake may crop up at times—along with a chirpy cover of Fleetwood Mac's “The Ledge”—but, for the most part, The Velvet Underground and Rowan feels like the work of two people who came of age in the late '00s and early '10s. Fincham and Miles draw liberally from the primary-colored soup of post-landfill-indie bands like Darwin Deez, Grouplove, and Cults, cheerfully yelping choruses and layering them with chimes, programmed drums, and finicky guitar riffs. There are less outré reference points, too—Sung Tongs-era Anco, the sunny plunderphonics of the Avalanches—but never anything that would warrant a second glance from anyone in the bar queue at Ormside or OTO.

In this sense, The Velvet Underground and Rowan feels of a piece with Callahan & Witscher's Think Differently, pairing two underground musicians who put a cheeky, throw-everything-at-the-wall spin on relatively unfasionable sounds. But where Callahan & Witscher use their '90s rock pastiche in service of blackpilled anti-Boomkat nihilism, Fincham and Miles seem like optimists. Their music is certainly funny, but their lyrics often scan as totally earnest, even when they're droll. “Wrote this song just so you'd know/To love yourself no matter what,” yelps Miles on the sweet, glitchy “Love Yourself,” before, a few verses later: “Leo wrote this song for you/Sorry that I fucked your dude.”

Fincham's production is inherently bright, and his maximalist approach allows for surprising emotional range: The glitch-pop of “B-Side Story” and “Sound-waves” is dazed bordering on goofy, while “Hey Marshmallow” is directional and euphoric, building toward a punch-the-air orchestral hook halfway through. (Someone is screaming in the background at the same time; it doesn't sound like David Comes to Life, but it does sound like what I remember David Comes to Life as sounding like.) As if leery of seeming too in thrall of the straightforward positivity of 2010s indie, he still grounds the music in the metacommentary of a lot of underground pop: “If the music's bad, you haven't paid for it,” sings Miles on “Neighbourhood Announcement Squad,” an interlude that sounds like the Bugsnax soundtrack. “You can press skip, pause, and add it to a playlist!”

A lot of so-called indie sleaze warrants blasé nihilism because it sounds louche and unbothered. Miles, working within the framework of Obama-era indie optimism, maintains the extremely contemporary themes of the Femcels without any of the edge. “Say the Sky Is Grey,” a highlight that sounds like one of the dusty private-press curios from the 2016 compilation Sky Girl, is a bittersweet ode to a porn addict; her worn-down vocals imbue the scene with a surprising amount of pathos. “Do you still want me to stay in this room where you keep the window closed/Lay in bed and blow your loads?” she sings. “Nut on me, nut on me/Can't you ever do it on me?” It is a deeply unromantic love song for exceptionally unromantic times, rendered with nostalgia for a time when couples like Matt & Kim and Dave Longstreth and Amber Coffman were headlining festivals.

It's easy to be skeptical about music that's so indebted to past sounds when a good chunk of what's being released now is designed as a game of spot-the-reference. The Velvet Underground and Rowan is more confrontational than your average pastiche: Rather than imagine a universe in which they were hitting Misshapes at 14 or palling around with Uffie and Busy P, Fincham and Miles have chosen to trawl the depths of that scene's less cool, far less sexy aftermath. It might feel awkward to look back on that period now, but Worldpeace DMT and Rowan Please find pleasure in the discomfort.

Mickey Rourke confirmed he is not involved with the GoFundMe campaign that was launched under the premise of helping the actor to stay in his home. 


	In late December, The Wrestler actor was sued by his landlord, who alleged that Rourke owed nearly $60,000 in rent on the three-bedroom Spanish bungalow just south of West Hollywood that he was living in. In response, Liya-Joelle Jones launched a GoFundMe to “Help Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home.”


	Rourke, however, says he has no knowledge of the fundraising effort and isn't asking fans for any money. In a video posted to Instagram on Monday night, Rourke said he is “frustrated” and “confused” by the situation. He explained that he learned about the GoFundMe, but didn't understand why it was created. 


	“That's not me, OK?” Rourke said. “I'd rather, if I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no fucking charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger. So whoever did this, I don't know if they did it — why they did it. I don't understand it. I wouldn't know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years. My life is very simple. I don't go to outside sources like that.”

	











	He added that it is “embarrassing.” “But I'm sure I'll get over it like anything else,” Rourke said. “Everything else. Listen, I've done a really terrible job in managing my career. I wasn't very diplomatic. I had to go to over 20 years of therapy to get over the damage that was done to me years ago. And I worked very hard to work through that. And I'm not that person anymore … I'm not that wild man that I was twentysomething years ago. But you pay the price for your past.”

	











	Rourke told fans not to give any money to the GoFundMe campaign. “Get it back,” he said. He added that he plans to speak with his lawyer to “get to the bottom of this.” 


	“There's only one person I can think of that would do such a thing, and I hope it's not the person I'm thinking about,” Rourke said. “It's humiliating.” He confirmed that he has previously borrowed money from a “good friend,” but if he needed money he would ask. “But I would never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel,” he said. “That's not my style … I wouldn't take a fucking nickel from charity or from anybody.”

	He added, “I don't want anybody's money. I don't want anybody to send me money. I want you to get your money back.” 


	As of early this morning, the GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $97,000. The page states, “Life doesn't always move in a straight line, and despite everything Mickey has given through his work and his life, he is now dealing with a challenging financial moment that has put his housing at risk. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent eviction.”


	Earlier this week, Jones spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about setting up the campaign on Rourke's behalf. “Mickey is going through a very difficult time right now, and it's been incredibly touching to see how many people care about him and want to help,” she said. The publication names her a friend and a member of Rourke's management team.

	Rourke received a three-day eviction notice on Dec. 18, according to the Los Angeles Times. He signed the lease in March 2025 for $5,200 per month. It was later raised to $7,000 per month.


	The actor gained acclaim for his role as a fast-talking hustler in Barry Levinson's coming-of-age comedy Diner. He later starred in Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish and 9 ½ Weeks with Kim Basinger. After a lull in his career, Rourke mounted a comeback thanks to roles in Sin City, Iron Man 2, and his Oscar-nominated turn in The Wrestler. While Rourke has continued to maintain a steady stream of roles over the past decade, he's largely appeared in direct-to-video films.

	Days after Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro was kidnapped by American forces and extradited to the United States, President Donald Trump and his lackeys have been making it clear that their aim is to control the entire Western Hemisphere — throwing out the rules-based liberal international order we established with our allies after the Second World War.  


	The hubris has been coming fast and furious. On Air Force One, next to a grinning and bobbing Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump doubled down on the notion that the communist-failed state of Cuba would be next to fall, finding time to threaten Colombia, Mexico, and even Greenland.


	This isn't evidence of great power. But it is more than the egotistical impulse of an unchecked imperial president. It is a deliberate strategy that involves the gleeful destruction of the United States' reputation as the leader of the free world. Russia and China couldn't be happier: Trump is making the world great again for autocrats. 

	











	While America is busy remaking the Caribbean, it's worth asking why Greenland has found its way into the conversation. The answer is in the Trump administration's new favorite word: hemisphere. 


	The brutal realpolitik goal of the Trumpers is now to assert U.S. control of the Western Hemisphere — from Greenland down to South America. The word is suddenly on the lips of every obedient Trumper. In case you missed it, the White House put out a select transcript of the times Secretary of State Marco Rubio dutifully trotted out the word while doing the Sunday show cleanup of Trump's apparently inaccurate declaration that we are currently in “control” of Venezuela.  

	











	It's a fancy diplo-speak version of what Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday: “We live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength that is governed by force that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

	This is the sneering repudiation of the once essentially American belief that “right makes might” that was famously articulated by Abraham Lincoln and which formed the basis of the collective security agreements rooted in international law.  


	The Trump team is saying clearly that they believe might makes right. It is the logic of the Jan. 6 attack imposed on the world. And that's why Greenland is on their to-do list. As Miller explained on CNN, “Greenland should be part of the United States. The president has been very clear about that — that is the formal position of the U.S. government.”  


	This matters for more than bragging and mineral rights. Trump seizing Greenland — a protectorate of our longtime ally Denmark — would amount to an attack on a fellow NATO nation and effectively paralyze if not destroy the world's most successful multilateral security organization. If you don't believe me, listen to what the Danish prime minister told Bloomberg News: “If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops, including NATO, and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.” 


	That's why Putin is grinning offscreen. The Trump team shares his contemptuous belief that the liberal world order is “obsolete,” and they are helping him dismantle it. But of course, the rationale is based on a bigger quid pro quo — hemispheric dominance.

	This is what the Trump administration's National Security Strategy document stated, which Russia praised as being “largely consistent with our vision.” As I wrote last month for Rolling Stone: 


“In this vision, the United States leans into its role as the defender of the Western Hemisphere — which helps explain Trump's repeated, bleated interest in everything from annexing Greenland and Canada to retaking the Panama Canal, and of course the current threats to the odious Maduro regime in Venezuela. … The flipside to Trump's regional power grabs is an uneasy might-makes-right balance-of-power peace with the other regional hegemons China and Russia. China gets to dominate Asia, with Taiwan a tempting target on Chinese president-for-life Xi's to-do list. Russia gets eastern Ukraine and a weakened NATO, dovetailing perfectly with the musings of J.D. Vance's right-wing Svengali Curtis Yarvin, whose stated foreign policy vision for Europe is to 'give Russia a free hand on the continent.‘”  












	That's why America's NATO allies are recognizing that they have a dangerous president and a deeply unreliable administration on their hands. America's reputation as a beacon of freedom, equality, and opportunity is in tatters because of Trump and his enablers. Secretary of State Rubio might console himself with the belief that he is playing an advanced game of dominoes that will topple the communist Cuban regime — and good riddance if that occurs. But Trump's brisk ditching of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader Marina Corina Machado in Venezuela should make it clear that there is no pro-democracy agenda at work here — just power, money, and ego.

	Trump has no mandate from the American people for this kind of an unhinged power grab. But with the honorable exception of a few consistent conservatives like Rand Paul and Thomas Massie, current Republican members of Congress are afraid to call Trump out for selling out every Reagan-esque principle they once said they believed in.  


	This is a surreal, dark, and dangerous time. The Pandora's box that has been opened will not be easily closed. The effort to seize sovereign lands in our hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to South America is insane by any objective American standard. It will empower autocrats around the world to use Trump's example as approval for their own power grabs in their region of influence. These actions are unwise, unconstitutional, and un-American. We do not defeat dictators by acting like them.

David Bowie‘s “Heroes” might be stuck in your head after that iconic Stranger Things finale — and it's being streamed by thousands of people, too. According to new Luminate data acquired by Rolling Stone on Monday, the classic track, which soundtracked the end credits of Stranger Things‘ Dec. 31 finale, saw a jump of almost 500 percent on streaming services.


	On average, the 1977 song has been earning about 94,000 digital streams daily over the last five months. But after New Year's Eve — when the song was used in the Netflix show's final episode — it logged a rounded 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3, marking a roughly 3.6-to-5 times jump over its daily average in the days following the finale's drop.


	In a Monday interview with Netflix's outlet Tudum, the Duffer Brothers revealed that it was Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington in the show, who suggested that the Bowie song would be the perfect way to conclude the show during its end-credits segment. It was also a nostalgic nod to the Peter Gabriel cover of the song that was featured in earlier seasons.

	











	“It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do the Bowie version,” Ross Duffer told the outlet. “Once Joe said that, we immediately knew that was the right song to end the show on because it is, in some ways, an anthem for Stranger Things. To use the original Bowie version just felt fitting for the conclusion.”

	











	Speaking of Keery, the actor's artist project Djo also saw a surge on streaming following the finale. His song “End of Beginning,” originally dropped in 2022, climbed its way to Number One on the Spotify Global Chart this week — replacing Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia,” which held the position for weeks.


Stranger Things slayed at helping revive Eighties culture and music throughout its run, especially with its song choices. The show's finale also featured two classic Prince songs, “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain,” and Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” returned to the charts in 2022 after being featured in Season Four.

	The Duffer Brothers knew they would need several songs for key parts of the last episode after they figured out they'd have a record player serve as the trigger for the bomb that would end the bridge connecting the world to the Upside Down. Ross Duffer told Tudum they “never talked about a song choice as much as we did for that moment,” adding: “We knew we needed an epic needle drop, and so many ideas were thrown around. I think there's nothing really more epic than Prince.”  When it came to hitting those two moods, side two of Purple Rain “lined up perfectly for us,” Ross said. 


	According to Variety, since the finale aired on New Year's Eve, “Purple Rain” has seen a 243 percent jump in streams on Spotify, with a 577 percent surge among global Gen Z listeners.

	It's been 10 years since Bruno Mars‘ seminal record, 24K Magic — and now, his highly anticipated fourth solo album is finally ready. On Monday, the pop king confirmed that he had completed his upcoming record, though he revealed little details about the LP to come.


	Mars wrote simply on X: “My album is done.”


	While this will be his first solo album since the 2016 classic that featured hits like “That's What I Like,” “Versace on the Floor,” and Finesse,” he also linked up with Anderson .Paak to form Silk Sonic and dropped the 2021 duo LP, An Evening With Silk Sonic.

My album is done.


24K Magic was inequivocally one of the most successful modern albums, winning the star seven Grammys, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year for the title track, and Song of the Year for “That's What I Like.” The Silk Sonic record also received acclaim, especially with lead single “Leave the Door Open,” which won both Record and Song of the Year at the 2022 Grammys, along with two other trophies. (The duo decided not to submit the album itself for consideration, despite being a top contender. “We thank the Grammys for allowing us to perform on their platform — not once but twice — and awarding us at last year's ceremony,” Mars told Rolling Stone at the time. “We'd be crazy to ask for anything more.”)

	After the Silk Sonic era, Mars returned with several massive duets including “Fat, Juicy & Wet” with Sexyy Redd and “Die With a Smile,” the smash hit with Lady Gaga, which won a Grammy at the 2025 awards show. He also linked up with Rosé for “APT” at the end of 2024 and the collab gained three Grammy nominations at next month's awards show, including Record and Song of the Year.

White House E.T. cover-up claims say George H.W. Bush confirmed aliens are here and known to insiders.

Contact us by Email

Jan. 6 2026, Published 7:00 a.m. ET

A bombshell new disclosure reveals former President George H.W. Bush learned that space aliens came face-to-face with U.S. military personnel at a New Mexico airbase more than 60 years ago, but kept mum about the mind-boggling meeting, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

The explosive revelation comes from Dr. Eric Davis, a top astrophysicist who worked for the Pentagon's since-disbanded Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). 

He insists, in the new documentary The Age of Disclosure, that the former president briefed him on the extraordinary 1964 alien encounter at Holloman Air Force Base.

Eric Davis said George H.W. Bush described a 1964 UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in 'The Age of Disclosure.'

Davis says the ex-commander-in-chief detailed to him in 2003 – 10 years after he'd left office – that three UFOs buzzed the base before one of them actually landed on the tarmac.

""A non-human entity deboarded the craft ... and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel,"" Davis said Bush, who died in 2018 at the age of 94, told him.

But when Bush asked his aides for more details, he was curtly told ""he did not have a need to know"" and so kept it secret, said Davis.

Marco Rubio questioned assumptions about presidential access while discussing UFO secrecy in the documentary.

The bombshell revelation jibes with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told the film's producers, ""There's this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say, 'All right, take me to Roswell [New Mexico], show me the alien bodies [that allegedly were pulled from a downed UFO there in 1947]. I want to see the video of the autopsy, I want to see the whole thing.'

""I think that really is a naive understanding of how our government works.""

Sources say the doc reveals other astounding testimony that pulls back the curtain on a decades-old, secret government UFO retrieval outfit dubbed the ""Legacy Program.""

The program, Davis said, investigated an incident where several ETs were said to have been pulled from the wreckage of a large tic tac-shaped UFO in Russia in 1998.

Gary Nolan cited treating soldiers with severe injuries allegedly linked to encounters with an alien craft.

And Gary Nolan, an immunologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University's School of Medicine, told producers he once treated soldiers who had sustained ""horrific"" burns and ""internal scarring"" in their brains after allegedly encountering an alien craft.

Hal Puthoff, a quantum physicist and former AATIP member, says proof exists that more than one alien species have visited Earth.

""The bodies recovered are not all the same type,"" Puthoff said. ""Whoever it is, they're here – and they've been operating here for a long time.""

In a curious 1959 treatise, Carl Jung mused on the “psychological reality” of the flying saucer, a phenomenon whose postwar prevalence he speculated was the formulation, in real time, of a “living myth.”1 Rather than discredit the material possibility of close encounters of the third kind, Jung sought to understand these escalating sightings as integral to humanity's search for stability amidst the chaos of a modernizing world. Onto UFOs, Jung theorized, we project an expectation of salvation—not necessarily from all global woes but at least from our futile efforts to decipher the universe's mysteries.

In the galleries of the Drawing Center, curator Olivia Shao takes up the Jungian mantle, conceiving of UFOs as vessels for psychological projection rather than vehicles for galaxy-hopping. Across two floors, Shao refuses to dismiss outright the experience of otherworldly phenomena as mass pathology or optical sleight, instead figuring the UFO as metaphor, assembling nearly forty works to bolster this conjecture. By expanding the category of UFO to encompass projections of “collective anxiety, spiritual longing, and speculative belief,” the exhibition suggestively conflates the technoscientific with the mystical, arguing that human destiny may be as productively understood through esoteric prophecy as through empirical laws of physics.2

To illustrate this relationship between the rational and the arcane, the works oscillate between diagrammatic attempts to render mathematical the fantastical and abstracted depictions of metaphysics that defy demystification. Opening the show is Alexandru Chira's Installation for Invoking Rain and Rainbow - Colorful Project (1986), a drawing of a machine reminiscent of an anthroposophic opera house. Nearby, Howardena Pindell's Astronomy: Northern Hemisphere (August–September 1997) (2000-01) depicts clusters of numbered white dots against a gray wash. Understood as celestial bodies, many of these acrylic specks are ascribed an arrow, tracing witnessed movement, with the sea of arrows broken occasionally by complex algebraic formulae—hypothetical machinations undergirding the opera of the night skies. More overtly diagrammatic are Stephen Willats's Travelling with the Good Connector (2019)—in which the artist's training in cybernetics informs a mapping of watercolored entities that transgress dimensions of spacetime—and Shusaku Arakawa's Study for Moral / Volumes / Verbing / The / Unmind (1977), a paean to semiotics in the form of overlapping two-point perspective drawings of geometric solids.

If these works also showcase the perils of attempting to map paranormal phenomena squarely onto our rational conceptual systems, then less literal works examine the tendency to project sincere belief systems onto cosmic unknowns. Here, these works are as often produced by trained artists as they are by those serving as conduits for more-than-human forces. Adam Putnam's postcard-sized resplendent abstractions arrive as dispatches from some sort of stellar nativity: in Visualization #174 (2021–22), a light blue firmament gives way to luminous orbs triangulating against an opaque void, while Visualization #59 (2021–22) conjoins geometric forms via what may as well be an umbilical cord fashioned into the vague profile of a human head.

Paulina Peavy has constructed a divine cosmology of multicolored fractals, here represented by the ink-and-marker drawing Untitled (1960s–early 1970s). Among the most poignant works are two vision drawings, one attributed to He Nupa Wanica (Joseph No Two Horns), dated 1920, and the other to Arapaho artist B Henderson, dated 1880. In the former, an outlined hand—bespeckled with black dots, some circled in magenta, and teal crosses—fills the colored-pencil composition, while the latter combines two lined pages that show a supernatural ungulate, lasers beaming from its eyes, hooves, and tail toward a person—enveloped in a cloak, floating in the blank landscape—and a radiating sun, half obscured by horizon line. Such vision drawings were meant to illustrate journeys—via trance, meditation, or dreams—into realms beyond waking perception.

René Magritte's eponymous Voice of Space (1931) commands its own wall at the show's midpoint. As the celestial body around which the exhibition's constellation revolves, the work foregrounds a theme that counterbalances the chasm between empiricism and mysticism: harmonics. Over Magritte's pastoral oil-on-canvas scene loom three foreboding orbs, an imposing nod to Pythagoras's music of the spheres. Trisha Donnelly's Untitled (Bells) (2007), a nearly two-minute soundscape layering a soothing tintinnabulation, resounds throughout the gallery. If the exhibition's subtitle conjures that which we might perceive visually, then its title points to that which we might become more productively attuned. This is underscored as much by the inclusion of works on paper by artists with robust sonic practices—such as John Zorn, with the demure No Title (2024)—as by Isa Genzken's more explicit Weltempfänger Daniel (World Receiver) (1990). On a pedestal rests a cast concrete block, punctuated at its top by antennae and embedded in its center with two perforated pieces of circular mesh. Appearing like the detritus of a sci-fi-themed nightclub, the work seems pregnant with received transmissions, idly waiting to begin its broadcast.

Paranormal Cirque isn't just a show—it's an experience. From the moment you approach the ominous circus tent, it's clear you're not walking into a traditional circus. The atmosphere immediately signals something darker, stranger, and more daring. Enter horror displays, vendors, and fun before you even enter the big top world. This is a fully immersive blend of circus arts, horror aesthetics, and dark comedy, designed to push boundaries and keep the audience slightly on edge from start to finish.



The show opens by setting a tone that's eerie yet playful, letting you know you're allowed to laugh just as much as you're allowed to feel uncomfortable. The production leans heavily into its horror theme with dramatic lighting, heavy music, and striking costumes, but it never feels cheap or reliant on jump scares. Instead, it builds tension through mood, character, and unpredictability.



The performers are the true stars. The level of talent on display is genuinely impressive—gravity-defying aerial acts, jaw-dropping contortion, feats of strength, and acrobatics that feel both dangerous and elegant. Several moments had the entire crowd holding their breath. What makes these acts even more effective is how seamlessly they're woven into the show's twisted narrative rather than feeling like isolated performances.



Adding to the experience are the clowns and host characters, who bring a perfect mix of menace and humor. Their interactions with the audience are unscripted enough to feel spontaneous, keeping everyone engaged and occasionally uncomfortable in a fun way. The comedy often catches you off guard, breaking the tension just long enough before the show pulls you right back into its dark world.

The pacing is tight, with very little downtime. There's always something happening—visually, emotionally, or musically—which keeps the energy high throughout. While some moments are intentionally provocative or shocking, they feel purposeful rather than gratuitous, aligning with the show's identity instead of distracting from it.

This is absolutely not a family-friendly circus and shouldn't be approached as one. Paranormal Cirque is geared toward adults who appreciate horror, edgy entertainment, and performances that challenge expectations. If you enjoy Halloween haunt vibes, alternative theater, or shows that aren't afraid to take risks, this is well worth your time.

Overall, Paranormal Cirque delivers a bold, memorable, and highly entertaining night. It's strange, thrilling, funny, and impressive in equal measure—and unlike anything else currently touring. You can check their tour dates at The Tour – Paranormal Cirque

Why Evolution Is True

Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats.

A person I know has, for the past year or more, been trying to convince me that Earth has been visited by UFOs, and that, indeed, some of those spacecraft have been captured along with the bodies of the piloting extraterrestrials. Her claim is that the bodies and the spaceships (presumably crashed) have been given to private companies by the government, and the craft are being reverse-engineered to suss out the technology behind the “UFOs”.  Further, the bodies of the pilots (bipedal like us, I'm told) are being examined to see what kind of life they represent.  As to why this is all being kept secret, I'm informed that there are important security considerations. But I'm not told which considerations are important enough to keep this  huge story secret.

I have read a lot of the information sent to me supposedly supporting this claim, and ultimately it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others who supposedly have seen the extraterrestrials and their craft. It's instructive to look up Grusch on Wikipedia, where you read stuff like this:

David Grusch is a former United States Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official who has claimed that the U.S. federal government, in collaboration with private aerospace companies, has highly secretive special access programs involved in the recovery and reverse engineering of “non-human” spacecraft and their dead pilots, and that people have been threatened and killed in order to conceal these programs. Grusch further claims to have viewed documents reporting a spacecraft of alien origin had been recovered by Benito Mussolini's government in 1933 and procured by the U.S. in 1944 or 1945 with the assistance of the Vatican and the Five Eyes alliance.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have both denied Grusch's claims, stating there are no such programs and that extraterrestrial life has yet to be discovered. No evidence supporting Grusch's UFO claims has been presented and they have been dismissed by multiple, independent experts.

Grusch also appears in an infamous 2½-hour hearing by the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs on “Unidentified and Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs”. I've put it below. The hearing starts at 18:00, several True Believers gives testimony, and Grusch first appears at 46:45 and also later (I have not listened to the whole thing today). Note that AOC is on the subcommittee.

More from Wikipedia, including about this hearing:

On June 5, 2023, independent journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal provided a story detailing Grusch's claims of a UFO coverup by the government to The Debrief, a website that describes itself as “self-funded” and specializing in “frontier science”.  The New York Times and Politico declined to publish the story, while The Washington Post was taking more time to conduct fact-checking than Kean and Blumenthal felt could be afforded because, according to Kean, “people on the internet were spreading stories, Dave was getting harassing phone calls, and we felt the only way to protect him was to get the story out”.According to Kean, she vetted Grusch by interviewing Karl Nell, a retired Army colonel who was also on the UFO task force, and “Jonathan Grey” (a pseudonym) whom Kean described as “a current U.S. intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC)”. Kean wrote that Nell called Grusch “beyond reproach” and that both Nell and “Grey” supported Grusch's claim about a secret UFO retrieval and reverse engineering program.

Grusch claims that the U.S. federal government maintains a highly secretive UFO retrieval program and possesses multiple spacecraft of what he calls “non-human” origin as well as corpses of deceased pilots. He also claims there is “substantive evidence that white-collar crime” took place to conceal UFO programs and that he had interviewed officials who said that people had been killed to conceal the programs.

Grusch elaborated on his claims in a subsequent interview with the French newspaper Le Parisien on June 7. He said that UFOs could be coming from extra dimensions; that he had spoken with intelligence officials whom the U.S. military had briefed on “football-field” sized crafts; that the U.S. government transferred some crashed UFOs to a defense contractor; and that there was “malevolent activity” by UFOs.

During a July 26, 2023, Congressional hearing, Grusch said that he “was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program to which I was denied access”and that he believed that the U.S. government was in possession of UAP based on his interviews with 40 witnesses over four years. He claimed in response to Congressional questions that the U.S. has retrieved what he terms “non-human ‘biologics'” from the crafts and that this “was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the [UAP] program I talked to, that are currently still on the program”.  When Representative Tim Burchett asked him if he had “personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal” the government's possession of “extraterrestrial technology”, Grusch said yes, but that he was not able to provide details except within a SCIF (Sensitive compartmented information facility).

So it's not just the government that knows this stuff, but private companies, who apparently retain for study the craft and jars of pickled aliens, or “biologics.” (It may be relevant that Grusch has a history of mental disorders, for which he's been committed twice to institutions.)  At any rate, you can see above that not just Grusch, but also two other people who have had respectable military or government jobs, testify to the credibility of extraterrestrial craft.

The hearing itself, with all three witnesses swearing to tell the truth, has been presented to me as giving credibility of the witnesses' stories. To me all that means is that three people believe in UFOs and extraterrestrials, and yet fail to present convincing evidence. I have no objections to a hearing, because if there were credible evidence of this stuff, the government would like to know about it. So would the rest of us, especially biologists and physicists.

Both the government and other experts who aren't True Believers have heard the verbal evidence, but for some reason material evidence never surfaces. I'll revert to Wikipedia for the last time:

Grusch's assertions are primarily based on alleged documents and his claimed conversations, rather than testable evidence. Claims that the government is engaged in a conspiratorial effort to conceal evidence of extraterrestrial visitation to Earth are broadly considered untrue by the majority of the scientific community, because such claims oppose the best currently available expert information.

Joshua Semeter of NASA's UAP independent study team and professor of electrical and computer engineering with Boston University's College of Engineering concludes that “without data or material evidence, we are at an impasse on evaluating these claims” and that, “in the long history of claims of extraterrestrial visitors, it is this level of specificity that always seems to be missing”.  Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, published a critique of the Grusch claims on June 22 with Big Think. Frank writes that he does “not find these claims exciting at all” because they are all “just hearsay” where “a guy says he knows a guy who knows another guy who heard from a guy that the government has alien spaceships”.   [JAC: that's an apt critique of the claims.] Frank also said of the Grusch account that “it's an extraordinary claim, and it requires extraordinary evidence, none of which we're getting”, adding “show me the spaceship”.

Where is the damn spaceship? Where are the bodies of the extraterrestrial pilots?

You can go down the rabbit hole of these claims for days, but all I'll say is I will remain skeptical until genuine evidence comes to light—and by that I mean production of the “biologics” and their craft.  The failure of proponents to provide such evidence, which is always “kept elsewhere” and is “a secret matter of national security importance”, make me think that what we have here is true conspiracy theory. Again, reporters and skeptics should look at this evidence, but they've always come up with bupkes.

When I asked my friend why the greatest news story in the history of humanity has not been broken by mainstream news, I get answers involving extreme secrecy. But give me a break: there existed pickled aliens and spacecraft remains, and none of it has been verified by mainstream news outlets, not in decades? Smells like Pizzagate to me!

Finally, when I'm told that the very testimony of people with decent credentials proves that they're correct, I respond with this: “Well, there are lots of people with decent credentials who said they have had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.” Plenty of Americans believe in the literal truth of the divine-Jesus story and have had Jesus Encounter Experiences, despite the lack of evidence—even historical, extra-Biblical evidence for a divine, crucified-and-resurrected Son of God.  These people far outnumber True Believers in UFOs. Should we then take their testimony about Jesus seriously?

I haven't followed this controversy closely, and perhaps readers, or people like Michael Shermer, have something to say about it. But until I see those pickled aliens, I think it's more parsimonious to think that their existence is about as likely as that of the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot.

I believe they're supposed to look something like the picture below. If so, it would be a remarkable example of convergent evolution following two independent origins of life on two different planets.

Yeah, they've been making these claims for decades. When i was a child i was fascinated by the possibility. But it's all bullshit. Seventy years of these claims and all we get are blurry photos and unconvincing stories. Every day there are more than a million take off and landings, every one of those planes carrying people with cameras. UFOs flying around? Bullshit. I dont think so.

Conspiracies can work if only a handful of people are involved. But this is a secret kept by thousands over decades? Not a chance. Put up or shut up.

I was at a skeptic convention talk given by a man (military?) who had extensively interviewed many of the scientists and technicians at NASA who would have had to have been involved in anything extraterrestrial, study or coverup. It was his considered opinion than these folks couldn't keep their mouths shut if their lives depended on it; like most nerdy aficionados, get on their pet topic and they'd happily go on and on and on. They, and other experts like them, were the last people to keep a secret and sit tight lipped on a huge scientific discovery for years. Maybe a week, tops.

Sounds likely.

. . . it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others. . . .

Shades of John Smith. What is it Hitchens said, That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence? I assume that the True Believers are saying that the aliens will usher in the Age of Aquarius or some such Millenarian dream?

I think a light beam elevator into a flying saucer, where you will meet Ben Dover, and Probe-ably a case of amnesia afterwards.

In the 90s, there was an adult film actor named Ben Dover.

Now, his daughter has become an adult film actor. Her name is Eileen Dover.

They were both from Uranus, apparently.

Do believers explain how a culture with the technology to travel the distances required to reach Earth always crash or are taken hostage by Earthlings, with our far more primitive technologies? Or how how hundreds of people over the span of 80 years have all agreed to keep mum about extraterrestrials? Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague. I know the call for students to be taught “critical thinking ” sounds tiresome by now, but any educated person ought to be able to ask rational questions and dismiss this type of belief.

“Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague.”
Right, and. it's all nonsense and crank stuff but never underestimate the  Credentialed Brave Independent Thinkers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_from_Space
Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have this covered.

I shoulda known…

No, they don't.  Because these thoughts do not occur to them.  And when these inconsistencies are pointed out, they either do not comprehend them, or ignore them out of some great emotional need for this story to be true.

It's very similar to the ridiculous “aliens built the Pyramids” claims.  Ok, so apparently aliens advanced enough to master interstellar travel visited ancient Egyptians, who just knew simple metallurgy and could quarry and construct basic stone structures.  So these aliens decided to give them a boost…by showing them more sophisticated ways of building stone structures.  No evidence of advanced metals, no alterative sources of power…nothing.

You can only imagine the disappointment of these Egyptians, enviously watching these aliens with their seemingly god-like technology.  The day comes that these aliens announce that they will share their secrets with humanity!  Will we now be able to fly like a bird, or instantly communicate with others very far away, or cure any wound, or any number of these incomprehensible abilities that they possess?

Aliens: “My dudes, today is your big day.”

Egyptians: “Oh we can't wait!!! What secrets will you share with us!?

Aliens:  “They are…slightly more advanced ways of building stone structures!  See how you can only make a pyramid about 100 cubits high.  Well, we'll help you increase that to 150!  And, with a bit more precision on the stone blocks…let's get those tolerances down. You'll still have to use your primitive tools and your own muscle power or those of your beasts to move them about, mind you.”

I don't know if believers in these types of conspiracies (i.e. ones that are not only very improbable, but internally inconsistent) suffer from deficits in basic thinking power, have psychological quirks that make them vulnerable to ideas of this type, or some combination of the two.

Very well put!

Very much like XKCD fore-told:
https://xkcd.com/2477/

Aliens built the Easter Island statues: I've seen that one, too.

Part of that claim used to rest on the breathless assertion that, like the Tycho Monolith in 2001, no trace of quarrying on Easter Island had ever been found.  (I think that was a claim from Chariots of the Gods.)  But in fact the stone beds the moai and the different coloured stone top knots were cut from are well known archeological sites, down to the stone tools the workers left behind when they knocked off shift for the last time.  Some of the quarries contain partially worked moai.  The volcanic tuff isn't all that hard to work.  Google even shows a reconstruction of how the moai could be “walked” vertically to their display sites without having to crane them from horizontal to vertical.

But of course I've never been to Easter Island to see for myself and the above is what “They” would want me to believe, isn't it….
[Cue Twilight Zone music.]

I've always wondered about the sci-fi scenario of alien microbes causing a plague.  It is probably true that our immune systems would be helpless to attack an alien microbe, but wouldn't the alien microbes be equally unable to exploit our alien biochemistry?  Terrestrial microbes that infect us have coevolved with us for hundreds of millions of years.  But it seems to me that if a truly alien microbe entered my body it would simply perish for lack of sustenance.  Wouldn't my proteins be useless or perhaps poisonous to it?  Not that I would volunteer to test this theory on myself.

I'm at my comment limit for the thread but just wanted to follow on to this…as yes I've always wondered this myself.  Also, it seems that at least one author understood that concept at least partially..in H.G. Wells “War of the Worlds”, the aliens successfully invade us but then are thwarted by our microbes, which we are resistant to (because of co-evolution as you point out) but they are not.  But then…wouldn't these advanced aliens have known this would be a problem to begin with???  It's basic biology man.

That to me demonstrates how hard it is to write science fiction, especially involving future technologies.

The Andromeda Strain
Michael Crichton
(Late 70s?)

Book and movie each one of my absolute favorites!

The book is so great because it has realistic data output from – IIRC – protein sequencing, X-ray crystallography/scattering, etc….

Chrichton was a clever man and wrote intriguing books. He was also very tall – 6'9″ (206 cm)!

It's intriguing, what captures peoples' attention. But that drawing can't be right. There are no antennae on the head. A more accurate rendition is, I think, In the Dick Tracey comics where the moon people show up, at least so far as I can glean from the Comics Curmudgeon website.

I'm impressed that they can walk around with those gigantic heads without toppling over. Carl Sagan thought that they looked like fetuses.

As Bryan points out in Comment 11 below, there is a religious element in how many people view aliens. People assume that if aliens come here, they will be wise, all-powerful beings who want to help us. Consider the movie “E.T.” : A being comes from the sky, performs miracles, dies, rises from the dead, tells his followers to be good, and then ascends into the sky. The poster for E.T. even alluded to Michelangelo's “Creation of Man,” with E.T.'s finger replacing God's.

“Starman” features Jeff Bridges as another alien who can perform miracles. He impregnates a human woman and tells her that she will give birth to a son who will be a great teacher; she protests that she is infertile, but he assures her that the seemingly impossible conception is true, and he then ascends to the heavens.

In “Cocoon,” aliens heal (restore vitality to) a group of senior citizens and end up taking them to a place where “they won't ever get sick, they won't get any older and they won't ever die.” When my mother saw this on TV, she said “People don't believe in Heaven any more, so they make movie9s like this.” I don't think she was wrong.

I wonder if science fiction in non-western cultures (one where Hinduism, say, is the dominant religion) is influenced by the religion in that culture?

As for how aliens can travel the necessary distances, Shirley MacLaine explained it to Johnny Carson on an episode of The Tonight Show: Thought can travel faster than light, and the fastest thought is love.  The starships are powered by thought, specifically love. I know Carson was a skeptic, and I imagine it took self-control to keep a straight face.

My first boyfriend, who had been brought up in a strict Ukrainian Orthodox family, was a fervent believer in UFOs and alien visitors. He thought the aliens were here to teach us and would give us the secrets of everlasting life. It always seemed to me that he had shed his religious upbringing but needed a “science-y” substitute.

Traversing the cosmos solely via the power of love was the theme of the finale of the big budget movie Interstellar, as I recall. Incredibly dumb. I groaned at the time.

Johnny Carson even attempting to keep a straight face would have caused great mirth in the studio audience.  They would have had to cut to a commercial.

Michael Shermer and Skeptic is the best for everything UFO.

I thought UFO stuff was a fad or pure entertsinment through the 70s, 80s, .. X-files… I thought Neil DeGrasse Tyson put the nail in the coffin.

But it is dawning on me that … IMHO … UFO stuff is a modern pseudoscientific version of ancient Gnostic cult thought, perhaps driven by certain incentives.

IOW human nature and its ‘bugs' have not changed in centuries.. millennia…. perhaps categorized as psychological aberration, but at root a consequence of human nature… ?

“wadda ya gonna do”…

Yep, Michael does a good demolition job of this nonsense here :

https://www.skeptic.com/article/the-aliens-are-here-again-a-review-of-the-age-of-disclosure/

The saying “Three may keep a secret, if two are dead” springs to mind. It's a conspiracy theory, like the covid lab leak, but far less plausible.

“Her claim is that the bodies and the spaceships (presumably crashed) have been given to private companies by the government, and the craft are being reverse-engineered to suss out the technology behind the “UFOs”.”

So possibly hundreds, even thousands, of individuals are walking around with this information, and no one is leaking credible clues or documenting this in a way that would be convincing to a skeptic?  Information that would be the most incredible discovery in human history has been given to members of PRIVATE organizations, and somehow not one person is coming forward?

The probability of this is close to zero.  I truly think that people who believe in conspiracies of this type have either a general intelligence deficit, or some psychological trait that renders them very bad at assessing probability from basic facts and premises.  A form of innumeracy, in fact.

I wonder if studies have been done on the cognitive capabilities of hard-core conspiracy theorists.

KNox's Conspiracy Conjecture: For every vast conspiracy X there is a strictly vaster conspiracy Y in which X is an intentional misdirection.

(The infinite ascending chain aspect of this is admittedly a difficulty, but there are workarounds.)

Examples:
● Big Tinfoil (Y) covertly fosters many conspiracies (X), some of them patently ridiculous, so that sales will increase.
● The Aliens (Y) covertly founded Big Tinfoil (X) so that the first wave of the invasion (a.k.a. the Greatest Replacement Ever) can more easily neutralise those few Insightful humans who know The Truth, by means of remote detection and detonation of tinfoil hats.
● The Aliens (Y) also either covertly influence (via mind control) or bribe or threaten some humans to make sarcastic comments about all conspiracies (X) so that the Insightful will be ridiculed, ignored, and generally reduced as a threat.  (The Aliens are not barbarians — they kill only when other methods fail.)

Prove me wrong.

The universe has a great many stars. The idea that intelligent life has only existed on just one doesn't seem very likely. The notion that aliens might visit our planet does not seem completely farfetched. I am not trying to attach credibility to any specific claim. Almost all UFO claims are complete BS. However, ‘almost all' is not ‘all'.

I'm not a scientist. Nor any kind of statistician. However, I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that in this case, ‘almost all' is all.
On the other hand, I have never been to Area 51.

Many stars indeed.  But we don't know the probability of life occurring. It may be vanishingly small.  And even if simple life is prevalent, there are many other improbable steps after that to get to a space-faring species.  And…there is a timing issue.  Perhaps an intelligent species did pass by, but it was 50 million years ago.

If technologically advanced species arise and fall at different times, and the distances between them are vast and the speed of light represents a genuine speed limit, then the chances of interactions are almost zero.

I agree but the problem is we don't know how likely intelligent life is to arise (we have a data sample N=1). And even if life did arise, the likelihood is that the distance from us would make communication, let alone visitation, virtually impossible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox

One assumption behind the Fermi paradox is this:

“If Earth-like planets are typical, then some may have developed intelligent life long ago.”

But we don't have the slightest idea how likely it is for an Earth-like planet to produce intelligent life. Fermi was having some fun but calling it a “paradox” is a big stretch.

“what we have here is true conspiracy theory”

Is that an oxymoron?

Naah. Of course I meant “classic conspiracy theory”

I can understand that a few people might sincerely believe this stuff for their own reasons. But I find more disturbing the fact that reporters, Congress, and other serious folks give these claims credence despite so little evidence supporting them and so a low probability of them being true.

It seems to me there is a serious hole in our education system; we have produced a crop of leaders who are not very good at weighing evidence or at even understanding what constitutes evidence. Some of JFK, Jr.'s beliefs regarding the dangers of vaccines come to mind. Maybe it has always been this way.

A parallel to religion just occurred to me, the way aliens in UFO conspiracies always look like humans – this is the inverse of Imago Dei (man created in the image of god) / but instead, human creation of aliens in their own image – “man” as god creating alien .. which themselves could be god of “man” … the Gnostic Ouroboros with Aliens ad infinitum…

Starry Messengers used to be angels, now they are Greys.

“I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise,
We climbed aboard their starship, and headed for the skies!”

. . . but much to my surprise . . .

An excellent song reference, Come Sail Away by Styx. When he wasn't home I'd sneak into my older brother's room and listen to this album (Grand Illusion) on his audiophile headphones, close my eyes and be transported to another world.

Thanks for the correction; I was just going from memory.

To me, it's the most perfectly secular couplet in the entire rock ‘n roll canon.

This is why I can't take these claims seriously. If aliens exist they would be fundamentally different from us in their body plan and maybe even in their biology.

Projection is what I think this all is … from opposite directions:

As seen in The Office meme :

• “Corporate wants you to tell us the difference between these two pictures”
• picture: | Imago Dei | Greys |
• “It's the same picture“

The lack of material evidence leaves me uncommitted. The nature of what is being claimed leaves me skeptical. I do not, however, dismiss the idea that government programs can be kept secret for decades—they can, they have, they do—though this is far more common for inactive programs. Anyone who has worked in or around such a program knows that to reveal convincing details would only make you a criminal, while anything short of that could make you look like a kook.

If you ever want to get caught up in the details, one of the best websites is Metabunk:

https://www.metabunk.org/home/

It was originally started by Mick West, but it's grown a decently large community that looks into a lot of specific claims of various UFO/UAP sightings. If you remember the trio of Pentagon released videos that made a splash a few years ago, they've got pretty good explanations of what all of those videos probably were in reality (spoiler: not alien spacecraft).

To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin from Poor Richard's Almanack, the only way three people can keep a secret “is if two of them are dead.”  A similar calculus would seem to apply to numbers greater than three.

My life experiences over my 72 years would support this.

Another relevant observation about human nature is that it's no fun to have a secret unless you let someone else know you're keeping it.

How many of Robert Park's signs of bogus science (reprinted at https://quackwatch.org/related/signs/) can we detect here?
1. Pitches claim directly to media;
2. Suppression by establishment;
3. Effect at limits of detection;
4. Anecdotal evidence;
5. Appeal to acceptance in popular culture (or history);
6. Discoverer is “independent” of colleagues, associations, agencies, etc.;
7. Needs new laws of Nature to support claim.

I count at least 5 on a quick review of his claims!

Outstanding article; thanks!

Robert Park is also the author of the excellent book Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud, which is the book for people who have already read Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark and want more of the same.

All of this requires faster than light travel, which remains theoretical. People don't pay enough attention to Douglas Adams: Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.

Yes, it would require something like “warp speed.” The probability that members of another civilization have visited Earth is practically zero. How can anyone believe this?

Not theoretical – completely speculative science fiction.  There is no evidence of worm holes, folded space to game the speed of light for faster interstellar travel, or “warp fields”.  It takes infinite energy to accelerate matter to the speed of light.  If black holes rending suns apart and spitting matter out of its poles in jets of particles cannot exceed the speed of light nor gravitational waves from cosmic collisions, then nothing at human scale building contraptions is going to.  Interstellar travel is a fiction stemming from human wishful thinking and my knowledge of physics strongly suggests that no creature will be capable of it.  Maybe robotic missions within a few lighyears of a home planet over hundreds or thousands of years but for us humans, ask yourself – how many fascinating ET creatures live not within the Milky Way galaxy but within 200 light years of Earth TO visit?  I'll wager zero.  We ain't abducting them, they ain't abducting us.

The “relying on documents he has but can't share” reminds me strongly of the Mormon Golden Tablets that Joseph Smith claimed to have but could never share.

Why can't he share the documents — was this clear to Jerry or his friend?

This is a timely post as we are just leaving the Santa Claus season and won't get to Easter Bunny time for a while.

Perhaps I should say that I am skeptical for the sake of bend-over-backwards formality, but the claims are so incredibly bogus to me that I am more in the camp of people who say this definitely is pure fantasy. Akin to the chances of there being unicorns and angels.
1. One is asking for 1000's of people, over generations, to keep an explosive secret. This won't happen. Threats and even assassinations won't be enough. And why even try to keep it secret? There is no reason to keep this secret totally secret. Why not say “yes, we have 'em. But we are keeping details secret”.
2. I don't think that interstellar space travel is even possible for organic beings. I doubt. there is a propulsion system, even in the range of nearby sci-fi fantasy, that can move such a mass at the required speeds for this to work. To say nothing of the ripplingly intense radiation that would be experienced, the relative energy of which only increases with speed.
3. Also, such a civilization would have to be well within ~ a 100 light years from us for them to detect our transmissions and to even know to pay a visit. And yet beyond 100 light years for us to not be in range to detect their transmissions.
4. Individuals with respectable military or government jobs might have a bachelor's degree. And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves.

“And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves.”

True, but I can't help thinking: Like all those people with post-graduate degrees who believe boys can be girls, and girls can be boys; think it unevidenced that men have a general advantage in most athletic competitions; believe that they had a 25%+ chance of dying if infected with COVID; thought that tales of Biden's demise were conspiracy theory; and found Kamala the fount of joy and competence? We could go on with the follies all day long.

Is that the type of high-order thinking from our “best and brightest” that you had in mind?! If only education were the antidote to bias and self-deception that you seem to believe it to be.

As an aside, all officers today will have bachelor's degrees and most will have master's degrees within ten years of commissioning (though of highly varying quality). Moreover, pilot trainees are drawn disproportionately from the top performers at the Academy and among ROTC distinguished graduates (top 10%); the average will have a STEM degree, and SAT scores well above 1400 (old scale or new) are commonplace. Elite? Some of them. Stupid? Few of them. But as I suggested, intelligence and education are overrated safeguards against folly and self-deception.

See Michael Shermer's book Why People Believe Weird Things, especially chapter 18, “Why Smart People Believe Weird Things”.

“From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.”

Richard Feynman

Gotta say I absolutely adore the claim that aliens could have got here using “different dimensions”. Unfalsifiable and also wicked cool.

My father was a USAF officer with sufficient rank to know pretty much all the secrets.
When I was a teenager, I asked him about aliens and whether we had encountered them.

He told me that if we had, the information would be highly classified, and he could not share it with anyone.

However, he pointed out “I do not believe in UFOs”.

If I were an alien in charge of investigating Earth I'd make sure that each UFO I sent out carried a demolition charge that could be triggered remotely in the event of a crash. Expressly to prevent bodies of the crew and advanced technology falling into the hands of the primitives.

If not, why not?

Recruitment barrier, I should think.

Also, the signal from home base to trigger the destruction would take hundreds of years to reach the detonator.  By that time the primitive earthlings would have figured out how the damn thing worked….and how to disarm the fuse.

One alien to another: “let's crash land on that little blue dot”

Skeptical homo: yeah alien! you have the technology and can traverse over light years, but when you have a problem you can't fix it because Dozo down in the engine room left the spare part at home?.

Kurt Vonnegut's brilliant Sirens of Titan explains the purpose of all of human history: our whole history was guided to produce a spare part for a broken alien spaceship.

This conspiracy thinking is analogous to religion. Perhaps they should start their own church. Claims that are not falsifiable. Influenced by cultural memes of the times (sci-fi books, movies, etc). A desire to believe in something amazing.

The odds of us seeing or interacting with an alien species are so low that it is not much different than believing in a god. Humans don't have the capacity to grasp the infinite vastness of time and space. There could very well be other life in the universe but the chances of us crossing paths with it are astronomically low.

Space aliens are the modern day version of angels. They watch over us stealthily, highly concerned with our welfare, and visit a privileged few only under mysterious circumstances. If they leave a message, it's usually a warning about something we're worried about – pollution and nuclear war being favorites.

Jupiter's moon Europa may be less hospitable to life than scientists once hoped

Jupiter's moon Europa, long considered a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its vast subsurface ocean, may not be as habitable as once thought, according to new research. 

A study published in Nature Communications suggests that Europa's rocky seafloor is likely too mechanically strong to support the tectonic and volcanic activity crucial for generating life-sustaining nutrients and chemical energy.

On Earth, such geological processes facilitate interactions between rock and seawater, producing essential chemicals for microbial life. However, after modelling Europa's conditions, researchers concluded that its seafloor probably lacks these dynamic features.

The study considered factors including Europa's size, the makeup of its rocky core, and the immense gravitational forces exerted by Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet. Their evaluation, indicating little to no active faulting at the moon's seafloor, suggests this environment would be challenging for life.

""On Earth, tectonic activity such as fracturing and faulting exposes fresh rock to the environment where chemical reactions, principally involving water, generate chemicals such as methane that microbial life can use,"" explained planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis, the study's lead author. ""Without such activity, those reactions are harder to establish and sustain, making Europa's seafloor a challenging environment for life.""

Life may have emerged on Earth billions of years ago in the dynamic environment around seafloor hydrothermal vents, features that Europa may lack. ""Based on our findings, the seafloor would probably not contain major tectonic landforms, such as long ridges or deep troughs. There would likely not be any underwater volcanoes or seamounts, and we would not have any hydrothermal activity such as black smokers. Having said that, I hope I will stand corrected one day,"" said University of Georgia geologist and study co-author Christian Klimczak.

Despite these new findings, Europa possesses several traits that have long fuelled hopes of habitability. Its subsurface ocean is believed to be 40-100 miles deep, potentially holding double the water present in Earth's oceans, beneath an icy shell 10-15 miles thick. It is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, with a diameter of roughly 1,940 miles.

""There are three major factors thought to be critical for supporting life: liquid water, organic chemistry and energy,"" Mr Byrne noted. ""Europa's subsurface ocean satisfies the first requirement. We've identified organic chemicals on this moon's exterior icy shell, and there may very well be such chemicals inside the ocean. So that's the second requirement. And Europa's particular orbit means that Jupiter drives tidal heating within Europa – requirement three.""

NASA's robotic Europa Clipper spacecraft, launched in 2024, is set to conduct dozens of close flybys starting in 2031, specifically to examine whether Europa has conditions suitable to support life, underscoring the continued scientific interest.

Jupiter's gravitational pull significantly influences its moons. Io, the innermost large moon, is the solar system's most volcanically active body due to intense tidal forces. However, Europa orbits much further from Jupiter. ""The effect of this tidal heating drops off quickly with distance, so although there's enough tidal heating to keep Europa's ocean from freezing solid, according to our calculations at least there's not nearly enough to tectonically deform the ocean floor. So, in short, there probably isn't the kind of thing happening on Io taking place deep within Europa,"" Mr Byrne explained.

The study focused solely on Europa's current conditions. Mr Byrne suggested a nuanced possibility: ""There are reasons to think that Europa might once have been much more geologically active than it is today, albeit a few billion years ago. So perhaps for a time that world really was just not habitable but actually inhabited, before those conditions changed and the chemical energy for life ran out."" Despite these new insights, Mr Klimczak maintains that ""Given what we know about Europa, it is still the best place to look for extraterrestrial life.""

													By Robert Scucci
						 | Updated 18 seconds ago 

One of the reasons I've spent recent years latching onto the analog horror trend on YouTube is how the genre uses liminal space to generate unease. Series like The Backrooms and The Mandela Catalogue thrive because of the unsettling atmospheres they occupy, and films like Skinamarink are so sparsely decorated that they let your imagination do most of the heavy lifting. The problem is that there aren't a ton of feature-length films that really use liminal space to its fullest potential. At least, that's what I thought before feasting my eyes on 1974's Messiah of Evil. 

I have to give credit where it's due, as I first heard about Messiah of Evil after running a YouTube search for “Liminal Horror.” That rabbit hole led me to a channel called Nightmare Movies, which sold me on streaming the film after breaking it down so succinctly.

If you're a fan of liminal horror and you've slept on Messiah of Evil like I had, it's in your best interest to check it out on Tubi. It's streaming there for free, and it will take you to a strange place in the uncanny valley that threatens to swallow you whole.

I'm only going to touch on the most basic plot elements that Messiah of Evil has to offer, because the story is only half the battle here. The main thread follows Arletty Lang (Marianna Hill), who travels to the small beach town of Point Dune in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged father, Joseph (Royal Dano). Joseph is a troubled artist who has lived in the town for years, but has become increasingly unstable as of late.

Arletty discovers letters from her father addressed to her that warn of a plague overtaking Point Dune. These writings also describe the increasingly vivid nightmares Joseph has been experiencing, which slowly bleed into something far more ominous.

During her stay, Arletty encounters Thom (Michael Greer) and his two companions, Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford). While talking at Thom's motel, they have a run-in with a local vagrant named Charlie, who warns them about an upcoming blood moon. According to Charlie, this event marks the 100-year anniversary of the appearance of an entity known as the Dark Stranger, which ties directly into Joseph's paranoid letters.

After Charlie ominously claims that her father is “one of them now,” Arletty's curiosity turns into alarm, pushing her to dig deeper into what's actually happening in Point Dune.

Messiah of Evil's surface-level horror comes from the zombie-like trance the residents of Point Dune fall into as the film escalates. People who appear perfectly normal are suddenly shown feasting on raw meat in grocery stores, only to snap into pursuit once they spot someone who hasn't turned. For me, the liminal spaces these moments take place in make Messiah of Evil genuinely horrifying.

I've always found empty versions of places that are meant to be crowded to be among the most unsettling settings imaginable, and Messiah of Evil fully commits to that idea. Gas stations, Ralphs grocery stores, movie theaters, and other familiar third places feel menacing specifically because of their emptiness as Arletty searches for answers about her father. Joseph's artwork lurking in the background makes you hypervigilant as a viewer, never quite sure whether those paintings are playing tricks on your eyes or watching you back.

There's a constant sense that something is wrong just outside the frame. Much of that dread forms in your own head rather than being spelled out for you. The imagery does the heavy lifting here, not the exposition, which is why the specifics of the plot in Messiah of Evil matter far less than its cinematography and overall delivery.

Messiah of Evil feels like that figure you think you see standing in your doorway as you drift off to sleep, when you're not entirely sure if it's a shadow on the wall or someone watching you. For nearly its entire runtime, the film sustains that feeling. The zombie attacks are just an added bonus.

GFR SCORE

Messiah of Evil, which is currently streaming for free on streaming services like, Tubi, PlutoTV, and Hoopla, is one of those movies that rewards multiple viewings. Watch it once for the general storyline, then revisit it purely for the liminal nightmare it occupies and thrives in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural Dropped A Demon Rule After 1 Episode, But There's A Good Reason Why","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-demon-rule-drop-possession-eyes-reason/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:00 GMT","

Across 15 seasons, Supernatural wove a veritable tome of demonic lore. Knowing your Knights of Hell from the King of Hell became crucial to understanding Supernatural's demonic dangers, and each demon packed a different kind of punch. Even Hell itself didn't seem to quite understand the demon hierarchy at times, but the basic principles of the ""bad place"" and its residents remained largely the same.

A power angels and demons alike wielded was possession. Both species could only walk the mortal realm via a human body, and while demons would typically force their way into whichever unsuspecting victim they preferred, angels had a moral obligation to only possess willing individuals. Demons were also restricted from possessing anyone with specific markings, which was how Sam and Dean remained free from any unwelcome body guests.

One of Supernatural''s demon rules was seemingly broken after a single episode, but upon further examination, there was a logical reason it didn't last.

 The image of demonic possession fans will associate most with Supernatural is the cloud of black smoke forcing its way through the host's mouth. That wasn't how the trope began, however.

While Azazel was part of Supernatural lore from the earliest scenes, season 1 episode ""Phantom Traveler"" marked the first time a demon featured prominently. This was also the episode that introduced the idea of possession, as the plot revolves entirely around Sam and Dean tracking down a demon hiding inside a plane passenger.

Contradicting later lore, this episode established the notion that demons possess humans by flying in through their eyes. This idea never resurfaced again in Supernatural, and subsequent demonic characters would reliably take the oral route instead, creating the show tradition we all know and love.

In hindsight, it's easy to dismiss season 1's eye possession as a Supernatural plot hole. The inconsistency certainly could have come about due to Supernatural not yet having a firm foundation for its demon rule book in season 1, and the show's creative team changing its mind. Regardless of whether the eye/mouth switch was a retcon, however, the change can be easily explained by the show's lore.

The demon in ""Phantom Traveler"" was actually a special breed known as a disaster demon. One could argue that it makes no sense for a disaster demon to access a host through their eyes when even high-ranking hellions like Lilith are forced to go through the mouth like a commoner, but the distinction still works as a canon explanation for why we never see demons possess humans via the eyes again. This is the only disaster demon shown in Supernatural, leaving nothing to contradict the rules ""Phantom Traveler"" created.

The disaster demon excuse could also explain other differences between Supernatural's first demon and every other demon in the show - the grainy appearance of the black cloud, for example. Again, we can assume the Doylist explanation for this was the show changing how it visually presented demons, but the Watsonian explanation (that the disaster demon played by different possession rules) still holds water.

One day in 1961, father of four and Korean War veteran George Carroll went out to buy a packet of cigarettes. He never came home again.

Or so his wife Dorothy told their young children. As ‘her word was gospel' in those days, they believed her explanation.

‘Don't even think about him,' Dorothy assured them, later silencing their natural curiosities. ‘He wasn't a good guy.'

However, decades later a series of astonishing events revealed the dark secret behind their father's disappearance.

In a new documentary, The Secrets We Bury, the truth behind George's vanishing, which wife Dorothy took to her grave when she died of cancer in 1998, is laid bare for the first time.

It's a mystery involving missing family members living only streets away, children who suspected that their new stepfather had killed their father, a psychic medium and a body buried deep under the basement of a family house.

Mike, Dorothy's son who still lives in the family home in Lake Grove village on New York's Long Island, is the focus of the documentary. Now 64, he is the youngest of four children – with sisters Jean, 71, and Pat, 69, and brother Steve, 68.

‘When my mother became sick, my dad was always on her mind,' Mike says. ‘On her deathbed, I asked, “Can you tell me anything about that before you leave?”

‘My mother literally turned her head, winked at me, never said a word and then passed away.'

Their father's fate had long puzzled the children. It seemed odd that he'd left his wallet and car behind and hadn't cashed his final pay cheque. And it was suspicious that no police report about his disappearance was ever filed.

There were rumours that he'd returned to a girlfriend he had in Korea during the war there in the 1950s, or that he'd been murdered by the Mob – but nothing concrete.

Mike was only eight months old when George vanished and barely remembered him. Curiously, his older siblings who did remember their dad could not recall any drama leading up to the actual moment he vanished.

‘I know I was Daddy's girl,' says Mike's sister Jean. ‘My dad was there and then all of a sudden my dad wasn't there.'

After George vanished, Dorothy swiftly remarried and the children had a stepfather, Richard Darress, a newspaper photographer who lived locally. The older children described the switch from one father to another as ‘almost seamless'.

Although the children didn't like Richard, family life continued.

Curiously, when a young Mike then got a job delivering newspapers, one of his customers Mr Yagel appeared at the door of their family home with a box of old share certificates that had belonged to George Carroll. While Mike asked his mother how Mr Yagel had known his father, she never explained.

Life continued, Mike got married and had children with his wife Debbi and later, when his mother – a gregarious ‘frustrated actress' who put on comedy shows in her large garage – was struggling financially, they moved into the family home to help her out.

But there were signs that Dorothy had secrets. When Debbi and Mike divorced in 1995, Dorothy warned Debbi that ‘something would happen' to her daughter-in-law if she tried to take the house away from her in the divorce settlement. Debbi is clear that she believed Dorothy was entirely serious. It seemed that this wasn't such a ‘normal' family after all.

A family bombshell came a couple of years after Dorothy's death in 1998 when Mike, who worked as a respiratory therapist, was called at 3am one night to tend to a patient at the local hospital.

He was surprised to find that the patient had the same unusual last name, Yagel, as the older man who years earlier had delivered the box of his father's papers. He was even more shocked when the patient, on learning he was Mike Carroll, announced he was his uncle – George's brother.

Mike realised he had been delivering newspapers for years to the older man, Mr Yagel Sr, without ever knowing he was his grandfather.

His newfound uncle explained that George had been digging up his house to add an extension when he disappeared. The Yagels had always suspected George's body might be under the family home because the timing of the building work matched so neatly with his vanishing.

They'd become estranged from Dorothy, who they believed was involved.

Mike wouldn't hear anything against his beloved mother, but his sister Jean took up the investigation. She decided to consult a medium – a plan that other family members, who didn't believe in such things, dismissed. However, Mike accompanied her to a séance in 2010.

The medium spent an hour talking about other family matters until Mike – distinctly unimpressed – impatiently told her he only wanted to learn about his father.

‘She goes, “Oh, when it comes to the “M” word, I normally don't say anything until you give me the permission to do it,'” he says in the documentary. ‘I said, “What's the “M” word?'” She replied: “Murder.”'

She told the siblings that their father had been killed and buried in the basement of the family home – identifying the precise location, explaining that the spot lay under a ‘target' on the wall.

Jean was puzzled by what she meant, but Mike remembered a target used to hang on the wall at which they'd fire pellet guns when he was little, although it had long been taken down.

How did the medium know about such a specific detail about their family home, from 60 years ago? Mike was impressed. When he asked who did it, she replied with ‘Richard'.

They were in no doubt she meant their former stepfather, Richard Darress, but dreaded breaking the news to his son, Richard Jr, with whom they'd grown up.

The latter was also interviewed for the documentary. Asked about the theory that his father killed George, he says: ‘Is it possible? Sure it is. Is it likely? Probably not.'

The others were more convinced. Jean even had a distinct memory of waking up one morning, around the age of seven before her father's disappearance, to find a man sleeping on the living room sofa.

She later learned he was her soon-to-be stepfather Richard Darress Sr.

Darress had just got out of prison for theft and after meeting in a bar her father had offered him a place to sleep in return for help with the building work on his home.

So did Darress Sr and Dorothy have an affair while he was dossing on the sofa? Mike says ‘it kind of makes sense'.

Meanwhile, only siblings Jean and Mike believed that there could be something under the basement. Mike started digging, using only hammers and chisels to break through the concrete.

His initial excavation in the spot identified by the medium proved fruitless. But after his two adult sons joined the dig, hiring a team with ground-penetrating radar equipment, they identified a new place to search, a 5ft-square area that had been disturbed.

After spending months digging a huge 8ft hole without finding anything, they discovered an underground cinderblock wall on the edge of the excavation area. Breaking through it, they found a cavity which turned out to be a vault for the old house's water pump.

Inside, they first found of piece of decomposed fabric which turned out to be clothing. Under it was a pelvis bone. Then as they scrabbled away at the earth, it was revealed to be part of a complete human skeleton. It was Halloween, October 2018 – 57 years after George Carroll had vanished.

‘Everyone had said I was wrong,' says Mike. After many years during which everyone believed he and Jean were unhinged and needed to simply accept their father deserted them, this was ‘payday', he says.

Richard Darress Jr describes the discovery as ‘probably the most emotional day of my life – your whole body turns numb, you start reflecting on your entire life. Not just who did it – was it my father? Was it my mother? – but it was “Oh my God, my siblings - what did they endure their entire lives.”'

He rushed back from a business trip in Chicago to be with them, aware that they had little doubt that his father had killed theirs.

The family immediately called police who – after establishing this was not a typical Halloween prank call – arrived in force, while the media also descended on the quiet neighbourhood. Investigators confirmed that the victim was indeed George Carroll, who had died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Anxious not to upset Richard Jr and his own family, the Carrolls initially refused to be drawn into the media's speculations on who they believed to be the killer.

That suspect, Darress Sr, had died just three months earlier – infuriatingly, before the family had been able to talk to him about George's fate.

Parroting what he says he was told by his paternal uncle, Richard Jr believes George had been abusive towards Dorothy and that Richard Sr had been ‘defending her'.

He tells the documentary: ‘I've heard stories about George Carroll. He wasn't the best husband. I've heard the term “heavy hands”'.

Richard Jr's half-siblings accepted there was some truth to this as their mother claimed George had been ‘rough with her' – with scars to prove it – after possibly suffering post-traumatic stress in the Korean War.

But, crucially, did she conspire with Darress Sr to kill George? Some of her family cling to the hope that she knew nothing about the killing, although the fact she never filed a missing persons report and kept her children away from George's family is certainly suspicious.

And yet there's another explanation in this labyrinthine story.

Darress Sr's stepchildren claim he sexually molested the girls in the family – Jean and Pat – and that even while George was still alive, Darress repeatedly exposed himself to the Carroll children.

Jean remembers Darress as an ‘evil' and ‘manipulative' sexual ‘predator'.

Is it possible, asks Steve Carroll, Jean's other brother, that George was murdered after he confronted Darress in the house over his predilections?

He certainly believes so, although he adds that – if this was the case – why on earth did his mother allow such a monster to remain in her home?

So many questions and so few answers. It doesn't exactly help that all of the siblings have wildly divergent theories as to who did what and why.

George's children accept that they will never know for certain which of them – if any – is correct although they can at least find small consolation in the fact that their father didn't abandon them after all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","The Tim Walz Saga Shows Why Debunking Conspiracy Theories Doesn't Work","https://newrepublic.com/article/204943/tim-walz-child-care-minnesota-fraud","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","



Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has abandoned his 2026 reelection campaign. In his announcement Monday, Walz pointed to right-wing conspiracy theories about the state's Somali immigrant community as having played a part in his decision. It has been nine years since Pizzagate, and yet such conspiracy theories have gotten worse—and as they have further eroded many people's sense of shared political reality, combating them has only become harder.

Late in December, YouTuber Nick Shirley recorded himself going to several childcare centers in Minnesota, an attempt to “prove” that Somali immigrants have been using the centers to steal public money. When Shirley showed up, at least one childcare center did not open its door, one owner said, “because we thought it was ICE.” The resulting video was quickly rebutted and fact-checked: The state's Department of Children reported the childcare centers he descended upon were “operating as expected.” It didn't matter. By then, the video had millions of views, and the childcare center “fraud” narrative had become part of the right-wing cable news cycle of anti-immigrant grievance and cruelty. Workers at the childcare facilities Shirley targeted said they had received “hateful” and “threatening” messages. One day care center reported a break-in, and sensitive documents were found missing. 

The conspiracy theory was always thin, and never actually implicated Walz. Nevertheless, Walz found himself defending his administration's actions to stop fraud, and he cited the chaos caused by the video in his announcement abandoning his campaign on Monday. He called Shirley a “conspiracy theorist” and he accused Trump, accurately, of “demonizing our Somali neighbors.” But he was still leaving the race: “I can't give a political campaign my all,” said Walz. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”

It's all too easy to see the parallels to real-world chaos caused by Pizzagate, and the incident nine years ago that signaled to the public how right-wing conspiracy theories had become more serious and dangerous. Then, in 2016, a gunman entered a Washington, D.C. restaurant, convinced by Twitter conspiracy theorists like Jack Posobiec that he could save children who were being trafficked for sex in its basement by a ring they claimed was organized by and for Democrats. The restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, did not have a basement. No one was physically harmed. For most people, news of the gunman's arrest was their first exposure to such gruesome sex-trafficking conspiracy theories, which to that point were largely the province of marginal media figures feeding them to their growing online audiences.

It has often felt as if Pizzagate never ended. Long after it faded from public attention, Jack Posobiec now has the ear of the president—who, after the Shirley video, suspended childcare funding to the state of Minnesota. The conspiracy theories motivated Trump to take swift action. Trump himself, at the same time as the childcare center videos were circulating, was posting a video on his own social media about the Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman, promoting the conspiracy theory that Tim Walz had her assassinated. (The man indicted for Hortman's murder and currently awaiting trial also targeted other Democrats and abortion providers, and is reportedly a Trump supporter who considered himself to be engaged in spiritual warfare.) 

Politics now play out parallel to conspiracy theories, expressing them and promoting them. This has been building for nearly a decade, while attempts to counter them can barely keep up, and don't seem to stop them. Fact-checking responds to conspiracy theories as if they are isolated incidents that can be corrected, and not common and regular expressions of the political and media ecosystem in which we live. 

Over the last decade, each time such conspiracy theories take hold, break containment, and begin to widely circulate, a whole host of anti-misinformation experts, researchers documenting the far right, historians and journalists tracking the rise of Christian nationalism, fact-checkers and defenders of legacy media, and lobby groups for online and child safety attempt to respond. The idea that we can set the truth right is also appealing to those in the media, who, on our better days, believe facts are capable of making change in the world. 

It is increasingly common, however, for those who benefit from the rise of conspiracy-theory politics (influencers, content creators, and even elected officials and the mainstream of the Republican Party), to then target those misinformation experts and fact-checkers. In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol, it briefly looked like Republican members of Congress recognized the threats posed by conspiracy-theory politics: Their own lives were threatened by believers of election conspiracy theories promoted by the outgoing president. But since then, Republicans have mainstreamed the idea that they are under attack not from conspiracy theorists but from content moderators. They have made dismantling infrastructure for combating misinformation and disinformation a major part of their agenda. “Even before Donald Trump returned to the White House, the anti-anti-disinformation movement had chalked up a series of victories with a common set of tactics, combining independent media pressure, congressional scrutiny, and lawsuits that sometimes ran all the way up to the Supreme Court,” writes journalist James Ball in a recent story for The Verge, tracing the battle.

It should be a wake-up call: Misinformation and disinformation have potentially pushed a state governor out of seeking reelection, and appear to be on the cusp of taking away childcare from more than 20,000 children in Minnesota, thanks to the Trump administration halting federal funds over these fictions. Now the administration is reportedly planning to cancel funding for children and other social services to four additional Democrat-led states, premised on the same stories about immigrants stealing. These tales are perfectly suited to Trump's politics of grievance, defining a set of enemies who are always stealing what's rightfully the property and province of “real” Americans.

Misinformation and disinformation are how these people attain and build power. It's why they fight to protect communication and political channels in which to push lies, scapegoating, and propaganda. It's why you can't fact-check your way out of a conspiracy theory or disinformation. This was true in 2016, when Trump was a joke. It was true in 2020, when Trump was a loser. It's true now, with Trump in power again. There is still no coordinated response to misinformation that appears capable of confronting that truth: Lies are powerful. So long as there are people who can benefit from conspiracy theories, there will be people pushing them.

The French first lady may have had her day in court, but can she win an even bigger case in the US to finally clear her name following the spread of online conspiracy theories? 

After years of abuse, ten people have been found guilty of cyber bullying Brigitte Macron. Their claims included outright lies about her gender as well as allegations around the nature of her relationship with her husband, President Emmanuel Macron.

But the legal action won't stop there, with the couple also suing the American right-wing influencer Candace Owens for amplifying the same accusations.

So, who began spreading these theories and why? What is their enduring appeal to the public? And can the Macron trial prove to be a landmark moment in the fight against cyber bullying?

Niall speaks to Emma-Kate Symonds, a Paris-based journalist at Conspiracy Watch, about where these theories start and why they catch on.

      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

As lawmakers hope President Donald Trump will join efforts to create more transparency around government information on UFOs, they are also turning their attention to strange sightings in and around the ocean. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., is one of a bipartisan group of lawmakers pushing the Pentagon for more information on alleged secret programs regarding UFOs. Several high-profile whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of secret programs, recovered UFO technology, and even alleging the government has remains of non-human intelligence. He is concerned not just about unexplained objects in the air but also those in the ocean. Burchett pointed out that many UFO encounters pilots have reported have been over the deep oceans, and there have been reports of things diving into the water. Much of the world's oceans remain unexplored, which Burchett noted would make an appealing location for any entity trying to go unnoticed. “You would go where you would be least disturbed,” he said. Burchett said Navy officials who have broached the subject with him suggested the existence of five or six underground bases. Burchett says he will be meeting with the president soon, and it is one subject he hopes to discuss. “It still just bothers me that our government won't come forward with it,” Burchett said. “I am part of the government, and I don't trust it. You have to ask yourself, why are we being told to keep quiet? Why the secrecy?”

It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

An FBI investigation into an alleged terror plot in Southern California bears the familiar hallmarks of the bureau's long-running use of informants and undercover agents to advance plots that might not otherwise have materialized. The limited details available suggest an investigation that leaned heavily on a paid informant and at least one undercover FBI agent [who] were involved in nearly every stage of the case, including discussions of operational security and transporting members of the group to the site in the Mojave Desert where federal agents ultimately made the arrests. It is still unclear how the FBI first identified the group or how long the informant had been embedded before the bomb plot emerged — a period defense attorneys say is central to any serious examination of entrapment, whereby defendants are coerced into crimes they would not otherwise commit, a frequent criticism of stings involving paid informants and undercover agents. Despite comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Patel, and others characterizing the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a coherent group ... there's little evidence that any group by that name exists beyond a small digital footprint and a handful of attempts at organizing community events, including a self-defense workshop and a punk rock benefit show. A previous sting operation [involved] the so-called Newburgh Four, in which an aggressive and prolific FBI informant steered four poor Black men into a scheme to bomb synagogues and attack an Air Force base. Years later, a federal judge granted the men compassionate release, describing the case as an “FBI-orchestrated conspiracy.”


Note: The FBI has had a notorious history of manufacturing terrorist plots, often targeting vulnerable minors who have significant cognitive and intellectual disabilities yet no history of harming anyone. Read more about terrorism plots hatched by the US government, including cases in which alleged terrorists were acting on behalf of the CIA. This process not only pads arrest and prosecution statistics but also helps justify big budgets by misrepresenting the threat of terrorism.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","What it's like inside the infamous jail where Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro is being held","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/us/metropolitan-detention-center-brooklyn-maduro","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:47:01 GMT","


            A federal jail with a documented history of power outages, staffing shortages and detainee complaints just got two more high-profile detainees.
    


            Former president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were moved into the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on Saturday following their US military capture in Caracas just days ago. The husband and wife face criminal charges in the US.
    


            The couple isn't the only high-profile detainees to see the walls of the MDC. The building has housed several notable figures like hip-hop mogul, Sean “Diddy” Combs, singer R. Kelly, “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, socialite and Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, one-time cryptocurrency whiz kid Sam Bankman-Fried, drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, rappers Fetty Wap and Tekashi 6ix9ine – even former Honduras president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges before he was pardoned last year by President Donald Trump.
    


The many ways lawyers for Maduro could try to derail the case against him



            Suspected cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada Garcia and Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to the shooting death of a UnitedHealth Group executive, are current inmates at the facility.
    


            In their first court appearance in New York Monday, Maduro and Flores pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges and chose, for the time being, not to fight their detention.
    


            Here's a look at what life inside MDC Brooklyn looks like through the eyes of inmates, attorneys and judges:
    


            Constructed in the 1990s to address overcrowding in New York City prisons, MDC Brooklyn is a pre-trial detention facility for those charged in New York federal court. Detainees include a mix of suspects and defendants, including people accused of serious crimes, high-profile cases, and others awaiting sentencing or transfer.
    


            The Federal Bureau of Prisons operated two centers – one in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan – until 2021, when the doors to the Manhattan facility closed after it drew criticism for its management of multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's death there by suicide in 2019.
    


            Before his capture, Maduro lived mostly at Miraflores Palace, a sprawling presidential residence known for its neoclassical architecture, large windows, grand halls and manicured courtyards – a stark contrast to the living quarters inside the Metropolitan Detention Center.
    


            Described by attorneys and inmates alike as “disgusting” with “horrifying” conditions, the facility is the only federal correction center serving the nation's largest city.
    


            For its more than 1,300 inmates, daily life at the federal jail can be grueling.
    


            It's dark, overcrowded and loud, according to CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, who has been inside the building many times.
    


            While all prisons are miserable places to be, he said, “the MDC is maybe the most miserable” of all that he's visited.
    


            Inmates in the facility's Special Housing Unit, known as the SHU, where it's likely Maduro is being housed for safety and security, are kept in solitary confinement under restrictive conditions, Daniel McGuinnes, a criminal defense and civil rights litigation attorney who represents several clients housed at MDC, told CNN.
    


            Inmates are waking up “staring at cinder block painted white walls” while locked in a cell with steel beds and a thin mattress, often for 23 hours at a time with no pillow and hardly any room to move around, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former fixer, previously told CNN of the living quarters. Cohen was held at FCI Otisville, a federal prison 70 miles northwest of New York City.
    


Hell on Earth: Inside the jail where Maduro is being held



            The jail has also struggled with chronic understaffing, complaints about mold, fungus and poor food quality, McGuinnes said.
    


            Access to medical and dental care at the facility has always been “horrific,” according to McGuiness, who noted he often has to remind his clients to thoroughly document their requests for such care.
    


            “At some point I'll have to step in and request it on their behalf,” he said, “because it's just not getting done.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Bureau of Prisons for comment.
    


            A prolonged power outage spun the correctional facility into crisis, leaving inmates in near-total darkness during a polar vortex for a week in early 2019. The outage prompted a Justice Department investigation into whether the Bureau of Prisons had adequate contingency plans to address the issue.
    


            A lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates alleged they were confined to their cells for days with nonfunctioning toilets and other unsanitary conditions. The Bureau of Prisons ultimately settled the lawsuit, compensating almost 1,600 inmates with a total of approximately $10 million for enduring frigid and inhumane conditions because of the power outage.
    


            Michael Horowitz, Inspector General for the US Department of Justice at the time, said it was determined “that heating issues had been a longstanding problem at the jail that existed before, during, and after the fire and power outage and were unrelated to these events.”
    


            In early 2024, the Bureau of Prisons appointed an Urgent Action Team “to take a holistic look at the challenges at MDC Brooklyn,” spokesperson Emery Nelson told CNN.
    


            “The team's work is ongoing, but it has already increased permanent staffing at the institution (including COs and medical staff), addressed over 700 backlogged maintenance requests, and applied a continued focus on the issues raised in two recent judicial decisions,” Nelson said at the time.
    


            Despite the noted improvements that year, conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center seemed to worsen as the months ticked by.
    


A federal judge toured a troubled New York jail. What she found is disturbing



            In June 2024, Uriel Whyte, an inmate awaiting trial on gun charges, was stabbed to death by another inmate, according to a DOJ news release.
    


            A month later, inmate Edwin Cordero died in a fight that broke out inside the prison. Cordero's lawyer told The New York Times his client was “another victim of M.D.C. Brooklyn, an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.”
    


            Later in September, the DOJ announced five inmates were charged in those murders and a sixth was charged with attempted murder for allegedly stabbing another inmate 44 times with a makeshift weapon. Meanwhile, another inmate was sent to the hospital with an ice pick stuck in his back, according to the release.
    


            During a multi-agency operation, the following month – as part of a larger safety and security initiative – investigators seized “a number of electronic devices, drugs and associated paraphernalia, and homemade weapons,” the Bureau of Prisons said in a news release that year.
    


            The “charges demonstrate the Justice Department's commitment to rooting out violence and criminal behavior at federal detention facilities — a critical component of our work to improve conditions across the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the time.
    


            The situation on the grounds became so concerning; at least two federal judges refused to sentence defendants to MDC in 2024 because of the derelict environment, The New York Times reported.
    


            Bottom line: “It's a very difficult place to be an inmate,” Diddy's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said of the facility in 2024 and argued in court.

Donald Trump said Nicolas Maduro “imitated” his dancing before he was captured in a United States military operation.Mr Trump ordered the attack on Venezuela after becoming increasingly irritated by Mr Maduro's public displays of dancing, including to John Lennon's song ‘Imagine', US media reported.The US president made the remarks in his first public speech of the year at the Kennedy Centre in Washington, which Mr Trump recently renamed after himself.Speaking about the deposed Venezuelan leader, Mr Trump said: “He gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance a little bit”, before adding that he was a “violent guy” who had “killed millions of people”.He added that “they have a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas”, which is now being dismantled following the US operation to capture Mr Maduro.Mr Trump was full of praise for those who carried out the operation as he attempted to assuage the concerns of Republicans who fear the US could become entangled with the future of the South American country.“The United States proved once again that we have the most powerful, most lethal...fearsome military on planet earth and it's not even close,” Mr Trump said on Tuesday afternoon.He confirmed that no Americans were killed in the operation but said “many, many” people had been killed on the other side, specifically mentioning Cubans.

Mr Trump said over the weekend that he was going to “run” Venezuela, but the Telegraph reported on Tuesday that the president has no plans for the country's future.“There is no blueprint, no plan for what comes next,” said one source. “And anybody who tells you that it's anything other than day by day is really not being forthright with you.”Mr Maduro appeared in Manhattan's federal court on Monday after he was arrested in an audacious raid by US special forces on Saturday morning to face charges of narco-terrorism.The US has not finished its operation, however, with plans afoot to seize a Venezuelan oil tanker off the coast of Ireland.The Bella 1 evaded capture in the Caribbean Sea last month, but has been spotted in the Atlantic, around 500 miles from Ireland's west coast.American military aircraft flying from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk have been monitoring the vessel in recent days, according to flight tracking data.

Thanks for following our live coverage of Donald Trump's speech at the Kennedy Centre in Washington. It has now ended.

We'll be back soon with more updates and analysis. 

Mr Trump is deploying one of his favorite rhetorical devices during this speech, using the first lady and her raised eyebrow as a metaphorical “straight man,” setting up his jokes and delivering punchlines.

He described her horror at his dance moves, which she apparently thinks are “unpresidential.”

And later he used her to humanise him as the bumbling husband, while talking up how his policies have sent the markets to record highs.

“My wife thinks I am the worst investor in the world, and for the last year ... she thinks now I'm Warren Buffett,” he said to laughter.

“She said: ‘You're smarter than Warren Buffett. You're a better investor than Mr. Warren Buffett

“I said, ‘How's your [retirement fund.' It's doubled.”

It is a classic technique. He often uses a boast as the setup, followed by her sceptical view, often followed by a payoff when she gently corrects him. In this case the boast was the payoff for a hapless husband.

All indications are that this year's midterm elections will be dominated by questions of affordability and rises in healthcare costs. But the past 72 hours have been centred on the Trump administration's raid on Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro.

It has given Mr Trump a big win at the start of a year when he needs to pull his ratings out of the doldrums. It was no wonder he talked up the achievement during a speech that was meant to address the forthcoming elections.

But there are signs that Republicans are intent on stitching foreign policy to their domestic agenda as they figure out how to campaign. They have celebrated Mr Trump as a bold and decisive leader, while also starting to spell out how the attack on Caracas fulfils an America First agenda.

Dennis Lennox, a Republican strategist, said it was early days but that it was shaping it up as a win-win scenario in election year if American companies could enter Venezuela to rebuild its oil industry.

“It's going to be hugely consequential, because, number one, you will be flooding the market with oil, which will bring down the cost of oil that Americans are paying,” he said. “It will also undoubtedly result in hundreds of 1000s, not millions, of Venezuelans who have illegally entered the United States, perhaps returning to live in a prosperous country.”

Although Marjorie Taylor Greene, a one-time ally of Mr Trump who has turned against him, has condemned the raid for going against America First principles, she has been in a small minority within the party.

Nicolas Maduro provoked Donald Trump into action after his public dancing displays were perceived as mockery, sources told US media after the operation in Venezuela on Saturday.

Maduro, who is currently in a prison in Brooklyn, New York, sang and danced in the weeks leading up to his capture in Caracas on Jan 3.

Sources told the New York Times that Maduro's public displays were an attempt to call Mr Trump's bluff.

The US president alluded to that during his ongoing speech to Republicans, suggesting Maduro “imitated” his dancing. 

Donald Trump has wrapped up his speech to Republicans after nearly 90 minutes. 

The US president is clapped and cheered off stage to the sound of YMCA by Village People, which is typical for the end of Mr Trump's public appearances. 

Mr Trump touched on a range of topics, including the capture of Nicolas Maduro, as well as healthcare, and the upcoming mid-term elections. 

Donald Trump is still speaking to Republicans at the Kennedy Center after nearly 90 minutes, having covered everything from the price of Ozempic and the capture of Nicolas Maduro. 

Earlier this morning, we reported that the US president has no plan for what comes next in Venezuela, where Maduro was president until Saturday, according to sources familiar with his thinking. 

After capturing Maduro on Saturday, the US president is relying on his top aides to develop their Venezuela policy on the hoof.

“There is no blueprint, no plan for what comes next,” said one source. “And anybody who tells you that it's anything other than day-by-day is really not being forthright with you.”

The former Venezuelan leader appeared in Manhattan's federal court on Monday.

He was arrested in an audacious raid by US special forces on Saturday morning to face charges of narco-terrorism.

Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's vice-president, has since been sworn in as the interim leader. At first, she struck a defiant tone, but later suggested that she was prepared to work with the US.

Donald Trump claimed Nicolas Maduro “imitated” his dancing before he was captured in a US military operation.

The US president reportedly became increasingly irritated by Maduro's public displays of dancing, including to John Lennon's song ‘Peace', which the Trump administration believed was an attempt to call their bluff.

Speaking about the deposed Venezuelan leader, the US president said he was a “violent guy” who had “killed millions of people”.

Mr Trump made a thinly veiled dig at the BBC during his speech as he described his prowess on television and in interviews.

“We have ammunition. The problem is the fake news,” he said.

“That's why I like being on. I'd much rather do live television than do non-live because, like when they say, as an example in my speech, peacefully and patriotically to the Capitol, peacefully and patriotically.”

He said the Congressional committee that investigated the January 6 riot in 2021 did not report that he used the word “peacefully.”

“Do you know that the news never reported the words, walk or march ‘peacefully and patriotically' to the Capitol?” he added.

Mr Trump is suing the BBC for $10 billion for the way it excised those key words from one of its reports on his speech.

Donald Trump is continuing to talk up the operation to remove Maduro, saying it proved that the US had the “most powerful” military in the world. 

“The United States proved once again that we have the most powerful, most lethal...fearsome military on planet earth and it's not even close,” Mr Trump told Republicans in the Kennedy Centre.  

Donald Trump has praised the operation to topple Nicolas Maduro, saying it killed “many, many” people. 

The US president confirmed that no Americans died in the operation but that “a lot of people were killed on the other side...including Cubans”. 

“They knew we were coming.” 

Mr Trump starts by talking about how good his presidency has been so far, alluding to the operation in Venezuela by saying “we had a good day two days ago”. 

The president goes on to the talk about the mid-term elections, where the Republicans could lose the House to the Democrats. 

Donald Trump has just taken to the stage at the Trump-Kennedy Centre. 

You can watch his remarks at the top of this page. 

Good afternoon and welcome to our live coverage. Donald Trump is about to give his first speech since the operation to capture Nicolas Maduro in Venezeula on Saturday. 

We don't know if the US president will address the operation, which sparked concern among some of the Republicans Mr Trump is about to address. 

You will be able to watch Mr Trump's remarks at the top of this page. We'll also post any updates once Mr Trump starts speaking.

Organizers share where they find hope in the struggle for disability justice as we go into the second year of Trump 2.0.

Since Donald Trump marched back into the White House in January 2025, his administration has waged an all-out war on disabled people. Trump has issued executive orders rolling back civil rights protections, slashed funding for vital services and support, and advocated for legislation that would ramp up institutionalization.

The administration's actions reflect the cruel and dehumanizing language it uses to speak about disabled people, who comprise more than a quarter of the nation's population: One February 2025 executive order characterized children being diagnosed with autism or ADD/ADHD as “a dire threat to the American people and our way of life,” while, according to a memoir by Trump's nephew, the president thinks some disabled people “should just die.”

Trump's second-term assault on the disability community comes as many continue to shoulder the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately killed disabled and aging Americans, worsened the nation's care worker shortage, and left at least 20 million people ill or disabled with long COVID. Rather than commit to plugging gaps in the nation's public health system and preparing for future crises, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing an extremist anti-science agenda that public health experts have warned “endanger[s] every American's health.”

Truthout asked several disability justice advocates and organizers from across the U.S. to explain what's at stake for disabled people in Trump's attacks on voting rights, education, the climate and Indigenous land stewardship, health care, and trans rights. They also shared where they're finding hope and how you can join the struggle for disability rights and justice as it continues into the second year of Trump 2.0.

The responses below have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Sarah Blahovec, disability civic engagement expert and author of The Accessible Voting Booth:

Attacks on voting rights are undeniably escalating under this administration. To counter the attacks, voter education is going to become more important than ever, particularly when it comes to state election law. We also need to mobilize to support those working outside of an electoral system and a government that is failing us — disabled people's lives are on the line. We need to focus on supporting those who have never been properly supported (and have often been actively targeted by our government) who are facing extreme threats — including disabled immigrants, queer and trans people, incarcerated people, and people of color.

I'm motivated and inspired by community members who come together to take care of each other, from local mutual aid to efforts like ICE Out of Alexandria, where I live, which is organizing against our sheriff's voluntary collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I want to see these local movements grow, and I'm encouraged by how they have drawn on the lessons of disability justice. I'd like to see more cross-movement collaboration in 2026, where we can learn from and support each other, because we're going to need each other to survive this. I hope that we can someday shift from defending our rights and our existence to dreaming up new systems that create lasting change and liberation for all of us.

Alex Green, advocate and author of A Perfect Turmoil: Walter E. Fernald and the Struggle to Care for America's Disabled:

It has been a fight to emerge from more than a century of simply sending disabled kids into massive institutional state schools that resembled concentration camps and finally provide them with the education that they have a right to enjoy. Just at a moment where we absolutely could have fully emerged from that if we wanted to, we've chosen instead to roll back long-standing civil rights provisions and turn around and wholly embrace a backslide. Without support to prevent the abuse of disabled kids and without funding to ensure that they have a place in mainstream public school classrooms, they are going to be segregated. It's not hyperbole to say that disabled kids will be abused, and some disabled kids will die in a system built that way.

For folks who care about disabled kids and want to support their equal education in schools, look around your neighborhood and your local community, find disabled people who are leading efforts, and start advocating like hell.

It's not going to do everything, but this is a moment that calls for humanity and rejects the model that we've seen fail in recent years of bureaucratizing the lives of disabled people. That's what has brought us to the place where we're so vulnerable to the monstrous ideologies of Trump and Kennedy. Instead, this is a moment where we need folks to step forward and stand with disabled kids and their parents and say, “We're going to hold you tight, and we're going to make sure that this system does not cast you out.”

Johnnie Jae, disabled Indigenerd and founder of Red POP! News:

Trump's second term has intensified the same patterns that created a crisis that is not simply climate change, but the combined impact of colonialism, environmental racism, and ableism. The result is a cycle of harm that hits Indigenous and disabled people first, and in many cases, hits us hardest. When Indigenous governance is pushed aside, ecosystems lose the caretakers who kept them healthy for generations. When disabled people are excluded from planning, disaster becomes a test of luck instead of a shared commitment to survival. These patterns have always been with us, but they are now unfolding in a moment when the planet cannot absorb any more harm.

This moment calls for us to change how we think about preparation and prevention. We can't rely on the government, but we can invest in local and Tribal responses, accessible communication networks, and practices that restore the land instead of exploiting it. When we strengthen Indigenous stewardship and disability-centered care simultaneously, we create communities that are resilient in ways the federal government has never been. I hope the disability justice movement continues to root itself firmly in the understanding that we are part of the land and not separate from it. Disabled people, and especially disabled Indigenous people, have knowledge that is vital to the future we are trying to build.

Dom Kelly, co-founder, president, and CEO of New Disabled South:

We're seeing so much of the infrastructure for the enforcement of civil rights law being destroyed and Medicaid being defunded in such an enormous way that millions of people will lose health care. We have organizations doing advocacy, trying to stop bad policy or make bad policy less bad, but that can only go so far, given the makeup of Congress and the fact that this administration doesn't care whether what they're doing is right or wrong or who it will hurt. Systems are crumbling, and the same old strategies are not going to work. We have to be willing to do things radically differently.

Mutual aid and community care feel like the strategies we need to prepare and meet the ongoing struggle. The people who are going to be most harmed are queer and trans disabled folks, Black and Brown disabled folks, disabled migrants, and disabled undocumented folks. We need to understand the intersections of these systems and how they harm people, and we need to work across movements. We know that every issue is a disability issue, and disabled people are part of every community. My hope heading into the new year is that we can build more solidarity across movements as we show up, organize, and care for each other in our communities.

Arielle Rebekah, disabled trans activist and communications strategist:

We're seeing an escalation of similar policies that we've seen over the past hundred years, and I think the big thing that undergirds attacks on both trans people and disabled people is eugenics in a broad sense of not just scientific policies, but socio-economic, cultural influences removing both disabled and trans people from public life and putting us in harm's way. Countering these policies, I think, looks like continuing to educate our communities about trans and disabled lives. It looks like civil disobedience, in the sense of teachers, doctors, et cetera, being willing to push back vocally against policies that are negatively impacting trans students or removing care for trans people, even if that means a personal risk. Adults defending trans kids and taking on those personal risks is going to be critical.

I'm drawing hope from disabled and trans people continuing to fight, survive, and thrive despite everything that's happening. There are so many brilliant voices and brilliant people who are continuing to live our truths, refuse to be erased, and refuse to hide even when it puts us in harm's way, and I believe that's what it takes to create the future that we all deserve. I believe that because of that, we will create the future that we all deserve.

We can expect the government's attacks on vulnerable communities to continue this year, including a continued stripping away of what little support systems have historically existed to protect disabled and aging Americans. Meanwhile, grief over the loss of that support and the resulting increasing violence and number of premature deaths in marginalized communities threaten to become overwhelming. 

Faced with this overwhelm, disability justice advocates told Truthout that it is becoming more important than ever for individuals to organize in their communities, develop relationships with neighbors, and find ways to support one another. Wherever you decide to plug in this year, these advocates hope you will do so with this lesson in mind: The struggle for disability justice intersects with the fights for racial and climate justice, safety for our immigrant neighbors and trans siblings, and a dignified life for all people. By organizing across movements, we can build the liberatory future we all deserve.

Conway, a conservative lawyer and ex-husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, is vying for a New York district seat

George Conway, the former Republican turned Donald Trump critic and ex-husband of the US president's 2016 campaign manager and senior aide Kellyanne Conway, is running for Congress.

Conway, a conservative lawyer who helped start the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of Republicans, launched his bid as a Democrat seeking to represent New York's 12th congressional district, in what will be a crowded field of contenders.

“We have a corrupt president, a mendacious president, a criminal president whose masked agents are disappearing people from our streets, who's breaking international law, and he's running our federal government like a mob protection racket,” Conway said in his video announcement on Tuesday.

“I know how to fight these people. They are corrupt, amoral people. They will stop at nothing to rig the system for themselves. I've been fighting Trump for years and nothing will stop me.”

Conway enters a competitive race for the Manhattan seat of the retiring Jerry Nadler. As of December, there were at least nine people in the running, including Jack Schlossberg, the social media personality whose grandfather is the former president John F Kennedy; the New York state assembly members Alex Bores and Micah Lasher; and the activist Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting.

Early in Trump's first term, Conway had been considered as a possible solicitor general; his wife at the time, Kellyanne, was a senior White house adviser. But he grew increasingly critical of Trump and his administration, eventually becoming one of the most vocal and prominent anti-Trump critics in the Republican party, even as Kellyanne remained a key adviser to the president.

Ahead of the 2020 election, Conway co-founded the Lincoln Project, a conservative anti-Trump group. But in August 2020, Conway announced that he was stepping away from his role there “to devote more time to family matters”.

Around the same time, the couple's teenage daughter, Claudia Conway, had been making headlines with outspoken online statements against her parents' political views. Kellyanne also announced that she would be leaving her role within the Trump administration.

In March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced their divorce. She remains an ally of Trump and spoke at the 2024 Republican national convention.

In his campaign announcement video on Tuesday, George said that as “a former Republican, now a Democrat, I fought Trump publicly in every way I could and I paid a price. I'll never regret standing up to Trump.

“I don't like what he's done to our great country,” he added. “And now I'm running for Congress to take the fight directly back to him on your behalf, on the behalf of New Yorkers to whom I owe so much – to protect the fundamental rights and basic economic needs of all New Yorkers, to make our nation better than it was before, to write new laws that will safeguard our democracy so that we don't end up facing autocracy ever again.

“This is no ordinary time, and I will not be an ordinary member of Congress.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An estimated 10 million people will be newly uninsured over the next decade due to the GOP megabill passed last year.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

In 2013, before the Affordable Care Act helped millions get health insurance, California's Placer County provided limited health care to some 3,400 uninsured residents who couldn't afford to see a doctor.

For several years, that number has been zero in the predominantly white, largely rural county stretching from Sacramento's eastern suburbs to the shores of Lake Tahoe.

The trend could be short-lived.

County health officials there and across the country are bracing for an estimated 10 million newly uninsured patients over the next decade in the wake of Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The act, which President Donald Trump signed into law this past summer, is also expected to reduce Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over that period.

“This is the moment where a lot of hard decisions have to be made about who gets care and who doesn't,” said Nadereh Pourat, director of the Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program at UCLA. “The number of people who are going to lose coverage is large, and a lot of the systems that were in place to provide care to those individuals have either gone away or diminished.”

It's an especially thorny challenge for states like California and New Mexico where counties are legally required to help their poorest residents through what are known as indigent care programs. Under Obamacare, both states were able to expand Medicaid to include more low-income residents, alleviating counties of patient loads and redirecting much of their funding for the patchwork of local programs that provided bare-bones services.

Placer County, which estimates that 16,000 residents could lose health care coverage by 2028, quit operating its own clinics nearly a decade ago.

“Most of the infrastructure that we had to meet those needs is gone,” said Rob Oldham, Placer County's director of health and human services. “This is a much bigger problem than it was a decade ago and much more costly.”

In December, county officials asked to join a statewide association that provides care to mostly small, rural counties, citing an expected rise in the number of uninsured residents.

New Mexico's second-most-populous county, Doña Ana, added dental care for seniors and behavioral health benefits after many of its poorest residents qualified for Medicaid. Now, federal cuts could force the county to reconsider, said Jamie Michael, Doña Ana's health and human services director.

“At some point we're going to have to look at either allocating more money or reducing the benefits,” Michael said.

Some states, such as Idaho and Colorado, abandoned laws that required counties to be providers of last resort for their residents. In other states, uninsured patients often delay care or receive it at hospital emergency rooms or community clinics. Those clinics are often supported by a mix of federal, state, and local funds, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Even in states like Texas, which opted not to expand its Medicaid program and continued to rely on counties to care for many of its uninsured, rising health care costs are straining local budgets.

“As we have more growth, more people coming in, it's harder and harder to fund things that are required by the state legislature, and this isn't one we can decrease,” said Windy Johnson, program manager with the Texas Indigent Health Care Association. “It is a fiscal issue.”

California lawmakers face a nearly $18 billion budget deficit in the 2026-27 fiscal year, according to the latest estimates by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has acknowledged he is mulling a White House run, has rebuffed several efforts to significantly raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy. Despite blasting the bill passed by Republicans in Congress as a “complete moral failure” that guts health care programs, in 2025 the Democrat rolled back state Medi-Cal benefits for seniors and for immigrants without legal status after rising costs forced the program to borrow $4.4 billion from the state's general fund.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Finance, said that the Newsom administration is still refining its fiscal projections and that it would be “premature” to discuss potential budget solutions.

Newsom will unveil his initial budget proposal in January. State officials have said California could lose $30 billion a year in federal funding for Medi-Cal under the new law, as much as 15% of the state program's entire budget.

“Local governments don't really have much capacity to raise revenue,” said Scott Graves, a director at the independent California Budget & Policy Center with a focus on state budgets. “State leaders, if they choose to prioritize it, need to decide where they're going to find the funding that would be needed to help those who are going to lose health care as a result of these federal funding and policy cuts.”

Reviving county-based programs in the near term would require “considerable fiscal restructuring” through the state budget, the Legislative Analyst's Office said in an October report.

It's not clear how many people are currently enrolled in California's county indigent programs, because the state doesn't track enrollment and utilization. But enrollment in county health safety net programs dropped dramatically in the first full year of ACA implementation, going from about 858,000 people statewide in 2013 to roughly 176,000 by the end of 2014, according to a survey at the time by Health Access California.

“We're going to need state investment,” said Michelle Gibbons, executive director of the County Health Executives Association of California. “After the Affordable Care Act and as folks got coverage, we didn't imagine a moment like this where potentially that progress would be unwound and folks would be falling back into indigent care.”

In November, voters in affluent Santa Clara County approved a sales tax increase, in part to backfill the loss of federal funds. But even in the home of Silicon Valley, where the median household income is about 1.7 times the statewide average, that is expected to cover only a third of the $1 billion a year the county stands to lose.

Health advocates fear that, absent major state investments, Californians could see a return to the previous patchwork of county-run programs, with local governments choosing whom and what they cover and for how long.

In many cases, indigent programs didn't include specialty care, behavioral health, or regular access to primary care. Counties can also exclude people based on immigration status or income. Before the ACA, many uninsured people who needed care didn't get it, which could lead to them winding up in ERs with untreated health conditions or even dying, said Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network.

Rachel Linn Gish, interim deputy director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group, said that “it created a very unequal, maldistributed program throughout the state.”

“Many of us,” she said. “including counties, are reeling trying to figure out: What are those downstream impacts?”

Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Kendall Qualls joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his candidacy and reaction to Gov. Tim Walz's decision to drop out of the race.

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican is seeking to tighten the screws on the U.S. immigration system in the wake of multiple investigations into alleged fraud within Minnesota's social services system.

Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people from Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Somalia.

Immigrants from those countries currently in the U.S. on refugee status would be forced to self-deport within 180 days of the bill's enactment.

""It's important that we ensure that those entering our country are properly vetted, and they clearly have not been properly vetted. So what we are trying to do is ensure that we address this, we stop this,"" Hunt told Fox News Digital.

Part of his impetus for introducing the bill now, Hunt said, was the increased scrutiny on Minnesota's Somali community as federal prosecutors investigate what they believe could be billions of dollars of fraud targeting social programs in the Midwestern state.

Federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged multiple people with stealing more than $240 million from the Federal Child Nutrition Program through the Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future.

The probe has since widened to multiple state-run programs being investigated for potential fraud, however.

MINNESOTA FRAUD COMMITTEE CHAIR CLAIMS WALZ 'TURNED A BLIND EYE' TO FRAUD WARNINGS FOR YEARS

Childcare providers receiving state funding, mainly within the Somali community, are also under scrutiny.

Pressure from the growing scandal pushed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to drop his bid for a third term. He said Monday that he did not want to distract from efforts to shield his residents from both fraudsters and people seeking to politicize the situation.

""Every minute that I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity, and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,"" Walz said.

Walz previously said his administration has taken steps to crack down on the fraud, but argued federal officials are over-inflating the scope of the damage.

""I mean, looking at Tim Walz's decision not to seek re-election — where there's smoke, there's fire. There certainly is more to come out of this situation,"" Hunt said. ""He was clearly complicit in what was going on. That's why he's not seeking reelection, and so there's a lot of 'there' that's there, and it needs to be exposed, needs to be investigated.""

He added, ""Making sure that we revoke these TPS designations is the beginning of cleaning up this mess.""

Hunt argued that his bill would help hasten the timeline for President Donald Trump's move to end TPS for foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota.

He added that the wider purpose of the bill was also to block Sharia law from spreading in the U.S., noting it was something he experienced firsthand as a member of the military.

""As somebody that has lived under Sharia law, somebody that has deployed to the Middle East, this is also a broader conversation about keeping people that hate our country out of here,"" Hunt said. ""And so what we're going to do is try to pass legislation that codifies what President Trump is trying to do.""

Hunt is currently running for U.S. Senate in Texas.

Fox News' Howard Kurtz joins ‘Fox News Live' to react to President Donald Trump's $1 billion threat to sue the BBC and to weigh in on the political fallout from the government shutdown.

EXCLUSIVE: The White House published a new website Tuesday detailing the timeline of the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, taking aim at Democrat lawmakers for allegedly promoting a ""gaslighting narrative"" surrounding the protest to silence their political opponents. 

""The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as ‘insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump—despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government,"" the new website states. 

""In truth, it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection,"" the website continued, pointing to the certification of the 2020 election that the White House described as ""fraud-ridden"" and for allegedly ""weaponizing federal agencies to hunt down dissenters."" 

""All while (then-Speaker of the House Nancy) Pelosi's own security lapses invited the chaos they later exploited to seize and consolidate power,"" the website continues. ""This gaslighting narrative allowed them to persecute innocent Americans, silence opposition, and distract from their own role in undermining democracy.""  

BBC SAYS IT WILL FIGHT TRUMP'S $10 BILLION LAWSUIT OVER EDITED JAN 6 COMMENTS

The White House launched a new website on Jan. 6, 2026, detailing the events of the breach of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021.  (White House )

Tuesday marks the fifth anniversary of the protest that has haunted U.S. politics throughout the Biden administration and through the 2024 campaign cycle, as Democrats slammed Trump for allegedly promoting a riot. The new website works to shed accurate light on the events of the protest following years of Democrats describing it as a dark moment in U.S. history. 

The new site boasts the historic date with black and white images of Democrats and others who investigated the breach, a timeline of Trump supporters gathering in Washington, D.C., ahead of and after the breach, and how the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report reviewing the breach uncovered ""critical security failures on January 6, 2021, that were largely due to politicized decisions by Democratic leadership and the Pentagon.""

The Jan. 6th Select Committee was charged with the initial investigation into the breach and ultimately referred Trump for prosecution in 2022. The committee became a lightning rod of criticism for Trump and Republicans, who accused the congressional body of ""deleting and destroying"" evidence related to the investigation, which was detailed in the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report published in December 2024. 

TRUMP SAYS LAWSUIT AGAINST BBC WILL BE FILED IMMINENTLY

The website's timeline of Jan. 6, 2021, kicks off with Trump's ""call to action"" for Americans to travel to Washington, D.C., ""for a peaceful and historic demonstration.""

The timeline walks users through the events of the day, including excerpts focused on: ""President Trump Delivers Powerful Speech,"" ""Patriots March to the Capitol,"" ""Capitol Police Response Escalates Tensions,"" ""President Trump Urges Calm,"" and ""Leaked Pelosi Video Exposes Security Lapses.""

Supporters of Trump gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress was set to certify the Electoral College vote that determined President Joe Biden was elected to the nation's highest office. 

Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi was a key figure in the protest's subsequent investigations, as she served as speaker of the House at the time. Footage from inside the Capitol during the protest showed that she admitted to taking ""responsibility"" for the breach. 

A new website page published by the White House shows a timeline of the events surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.  (White House )

""Leaked footage captured by Nancy Pelosi's daughter shows the Speaker during the chaos admitting, 'I take responsibility,' for security failures,"" the White House website states. ""The video exposes Pelosi's catastrophic failure to prepare, including rejecting President Trump's reported advance offers of 10,000 troops to maintain security. Pelosi's daughter's own footage shows she knew security was so limited under her watch, exposing the deliberate refusal to accept offered reinforcements that could have prevented or delayed required reinforcements.""

Pelosi's office has slammed the promotion of the video as cherry-picked statements that don't contradict that Pelosi was not responsible for handling security at the Capitol, as tactical decisions ahead of the protest fell under the Capitol Police's and the Capitol Police Board's purview. 

When asked about the new site and remarks focused on Pelosi, the House Speaker emerita's spokesman, Ian Krager, slammed the use of ""cherry-picked, out-of-context clips"" to allegedly downplay ""the deadly insurrection,"" which included the fatal shooting of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt while in the Capitol.

""Numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed again and again that Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination on January 6th,"" Krager said. ""Cherry-picked, out-of-context clips do not change the fact that the Speaker of the House is not in charge of the security of the Capitol Complex — on January 6th or any other day of the week. The ongoing attempts to whitewash the deadly insurrection are shameful, unpatriotic, and pathetic.""

Pelosi published a statement Tuesday on the anniversary of the breach, calling it an ""attempted coup"" via ""a violent insurrection incited by the President of the United States."" 

""We must speak plainly: January 6th was an attempted coup. It was an effort to nullify millions of lawful votes and subvert the will of the American people,"" Pelosi wrote in the statement published Tuesday. ""But the attack failed because of the courage of public servants who gave proof through the night that our flag was still there by refusing to bend to pressure, threats, or intimidation. On that day, the Constitution held and we kept the Republic.""

LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS TRUMP COULD WIN 'CONSIDERABLE' DAMAGES FROM BBC DOCUMENTARY LAWSUIT

Jan. 6, 2021, thrust Trump into a legal and political storm that followed him out of office, fueling his second impeachment and years of courtroom battles. Democrats cited his words and actions surrounding the Capitol riot as grounds for ""incitement of insurrection,"" while prosecutors later built separate cases probing election interference and efforts to overturn the 2020 results. 

Democrats stated that Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in U.S. history, repeatedly pointing to it throughout the Biden administration and 2024 campaign cycle as the Biden–Harris ticket, followed by the Harris–Walz ticket, worked to preserve the party's control of the executive branch.

Biden called Jan. 6 a ""dark moment"" and ""an assault on the citadel of liberty"" back in 2021, while former Vice President Kamala Harris said during the 2024 presidential debate that it was ""the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.""

Trump has hit back at Democratic rhetoric, defending that he told supporters to march ""peacefully and patriotically"" outside the Capitol, while also describing the day as ""a day of love"" and casting many defendants as unfairly targeted. The president granted clemency to all individuals convicted or awaiting trial over the breach, roughly 1,600 people, upon his return to the Oval Office in January 2025. 

TRUMP ISSUES FRESH PARDONS FOR JAN 6 DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING WOMAN ACCUSED OF THREATENING FBI ON SOCIAL MEDIA

The new White House website page argues in one section that ""President Trump Corrected a Historic Wrong—freeing Americans Who Were Unjustly Punished and Restoring Fairness Under the Law.""

""With his triumphant return to the White House, President Trump wasted no time righting one of the darkest wrongs in modern American history,"" the site states. ""On Inauguration Day 2025, he issued sweeping pardons and commutations for the vast majority of January 6 defendants—patriotic citizens who had been viciously overcharged, denied due process, and held as political hostages by a vengeful regime."" 

The major legal cases targeting Trump that were tied to claims he worked to overturn the 2020 election were later dropped after Trump returned to office, while a Georgia election-interference prosecution against Trump and others was also dismissed.

The BBC is currently wrapped up in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit leveled by Trump in a Florida federal court over a documentary the outlet published ahead of the 2024 election that included an edited clip of Trump's 2021 speech on Jan. 6. The outlet has apologized for an ""error of judgment"" regarding editing the speech, but has rejected demands for financial compensation. The edited video is also included on the White House's latest website.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Here's who funds the groups protesting America's capture of Maduro","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/4408061/who-funds-groups-protesting-america-capture-maduro/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:45:12 GMT","

Mainstream liberal foundations, private charities with histories of supporting terrorist-linked groups, a Chinese Communist Party-aligned businessman, and an array of left-wing activist organizations with histories of operating in Latin America have, in recent years, united by bankrolling the organizations taking to the streets to protest America's arrest of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

Among the most vocal critics of the U.S. military-supported arrest of Maduro have been CODEPINK, the ANSWER Coalition, and The People's Forum — a trio of left-wing activist groups that have traditionally aligned themselves with countries and organizations hostile to the United States. To voice their opposition to the military action, the groups have organized street protests in cities across the country while flooding social media with messaging accusing the U.S. of colonialism, violating international law, and comparing it to past U.S. military adventures — talking points that have since been adopted by mainstream Democrats. 

These three groups share considerable ties owing to their shared leadership and sources of funding. 

Their mobilization this week in the aftermath of Maduro's arrest, as previously documented by journalist Asra Nomani, was rapid. 

At 1:35 a.m., just as U.S. special forces landed in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, the executive director at The People's Forum, a New York City-based nonprofit organization, declared that the American incursion represented an “illegal bombing.” Roughly an hour later, the group called on Maduro sympathizers to stage an “emergency protest” in the heart of New York City.

The ANSWER Coalition and CODEPINK responded with comparable urgency, with the former calling for an “emergency day of action” at 2:29 a.m. and the latter accusing the U.S. of “war crimes” as early as 6:09 a.m. The trio of groups has collaborated in demonstration organization and messaging campaigns in the days since Maduro's capture.

A Washington Examiner analysis of tax filings tracked roughly $7 million worth of funding flowing into these groups from a variety of sources since 2020. However, much of the funding they receive is anonymous, as, while charitable foundations are legally required to disclose their giving, individuals are allowed to remain anonymous, prompting speculation that foreign donors could be funding domestic activism.

People's Support Foundation, a left-wing grantmaking organization run by CODEPINK co-founder Jodie Evans, was the single largest donor recorded in public disclosures, giving $5 million to The People's Forum in 2024. Evans's husband, Neville Roy Singham, is a self-described socialist who sold his software firm for approximately $785 million in 2017. Since then, he has been accused of using his immense wealth to advance the interests of America's adversaries, chiefly China. 

A 2023 New York Times report linked Singham to Chinese government-backed propaganda efforts, but the former tech executive has denied having a relationship with the CCP. Singham has praised former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, describing the country under his rule as a “phenomenally democratic place.”

Singham reportedly provides The People's Forum and CODEPINK with the bulk of their funding. The People's Forum, in turn, provides the ANSWER Coalition's parent organization with cash and general support. Another CODEPINK co-founder, Medea Benjamin, is the source of funds for Arc of Justice, which provided CODEPINK with $606,000 between 2020 and 2022.

Benjamin has a history of supporting America's adversaries, including the communist Viet Cong and the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.

Many of the organizations pouring funds into groups protesting Maduro's capture have also financially supported entities linked to terrorist organizations. 

The Alalusi Foundation, a charity operated by a wealthy Bay Area Arab-American who owns a grouting company, gave $20,000 to CODEPINK in 2024. That same year, the foundation cut large checks to organizations with links of varying strength to Islamic terrorists. Among these were the Alliance for Global Justice, the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, and American Muslims for Palestine.

In March 2025, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) announced a congressional investigation amid allegations that multiple leaders of American Muslims for Palestine have strong ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups. 

Among these was AMP's former executive director, who served as “secretary general” of the Islamic Association for Palestine, which court records show was founded with funds from senior Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook. Other individuals flagged by the senator included AMP's current executive director, who worked for IAP's media operation and interviewed top Hamas leaders; a former AMP board member, who served as the “Michigan representative” for IAP; and the organization's accountant, who served as IAP's president. Additionally, multiple individuals associated with AMP were also involved with the Holy Land Foundation, which, according to U.S. government estimates, sent “$12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to willfully contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.”

Meanwhile, Alliance for Global Justice was the longtime parent organization of Samidoun, a group that the Treasury Department sanctioned in October 2024 for operating as an “international fundraiser” for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. USCPR held a conference in May 2024 that was endorsed by a founding member of the PFLP and has produced reams of material supporting Hamas, including its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel.

The Yoosufani Family Foundation, similar to the Alalusi Foundation, is run by a Texas-based Pakistani businessman and gave $100,000 to CODEPINK in 2024. That same year, the foundation cut five-figure checks to AMP, USCPR, and a media organization called the “Electronic Intifada.” 

The Alalusi and Yoosufani Family Foundations are far from the only link connecting the groups behind pro-Maduro demonstrations to terrorist organizations.

For instance, The People's Forum accepted a $33,000 donation from the Alliance for Global Justice at some point between April 2023 and March 2024, after the organization began taking criticism for its ties to Islamic terrorists. Additionally, in 2024, the Fred R. Martin Foundation donated $15,000 to the Alliance for Global Justice, with an additional $10,000 allocated to The People's Forum that same year. The People's Forum grant was earmarked specifically for supporting Cuba's left-wing regime.

Support for left-wing regimes in Latin America was another common thread uniting the backers of CODEPINK, the ANSWER Coalition, and The People's Forum.

The Justice and Education Fund is a left-of-center grantmaking network that bankrolls “popular education schools” in South America to boost support for left-wing ideas in the region. It provided nearly half a million dollars to CODEPINK between 2020 and 2022. On top of CODEPINK, the Justice and Education Fund has also poured hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years into BreakThrough News, a far-reaching media operation that has been accused of providing support for adversaries of the U.S., such as the Chinese Communist Party, former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and Russia.

Following the American raid in Caracas, BreakThrough News has been flooding its large social media accounts with messages criticizing the U.S. and offering support to the Maduro regime. 

WHO IS FUNDING THE ANTI-ICE ACTIVISTS IN LA?

While receiving funding from organizations sympathetic to terrorist-linked groups and left-wing radicals, CODEPINK also counted on institutions close to the mainstream liberal movement for support. 

The Tides Foundation, one of the largest dark money networks on the Left, for instance, gave $268,000 to CODEPINK between 2020 and 2024. Other mainstream organizations that have directed money toward CODEPINK and its allies since 2020 include the Good Planet Foundation, the Ben & Jerry's Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, and ImpactAssets.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Six Books You Can Get Lost In","https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/books-recommendation-daydream-fantasy/685504/","Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:30:00 GMT","

These novels highlight the power—both good and bad—of unchecked fantasizing.

Many people—the overwhelmed, dissatisfied, or understimulated—share a powerful desire to escape the life they're living. But doing so usually isn't practical or possible. What is available is the daydream—a limitless realm of freedom. In this other world, one  might be famous or rich, finally catch the attention of their beloved, or simply sit on a beach as a waiter brings them cocktails. They might fly or speak to animals, heroically save a child, tell off their boss with no consequences, win the Super Bowl at the whistle, or travel to another continent, planet, or time period. No one can stop them; no one can even object.

Some writers are naturally drawn to this kind of reverie. Daydreams can illuminate our hidden, anarchic, or even seductive inclinations, and they can say a lot about our conscious lives. Their conjurers, who refuse to accept the rules of the real world, can also be great fun to read about. While working on my new novel, The Ten Year Affair, which follows a woman fantasizing about a love affair with a longtime friend, I thought about what happens when speculation or wishing starts to bleed into the real. Daydreaming, I realized, can sustain a person over the course of a life—and perhaps even change it, for good or for ill. The six books below explore the limitations and hazards of dreaming, even as they push the boundaries and conventions of the act.



Y/N, by Esther Yi

The title of Yi's strange and appealing 2023 novel refers to, as the unnamed narrator puts it, “a type of fanfiction where the protagonist was called Y/N or ‘your name.'” The narrator attends a K-pop show in Berlin and becomes obsessed with the band's youngest member, the 20-year-old Moon: “a gift forever in the moment of being handed over,” Yi writes. As the narrator's fixation grows, she begins writing Y/N fan fiction about Moon, much of which is reproduced in the novel. When Moon abruptly retires, the narrator goes to Korea to find him. Some readers might expect an indictment of fan fiction and celebrity culture; Yi swerves, though, and creates a more searching and subversive tale of love, connection, and art. Even after the narrator finds Moon, her motives remain obscure. The point of her fantasy seems to be the fantasy itself.



Hangsaman, by Shirley Jackson

Jackson's fascinating novel follows Natalie, the daughter of a writer, as she unravels during her first few months of college. At the opening, Natalie, bored and filled with loathing for her parents, flees her family home by retreating into imaginary worlds of vivid, eroticized violence. But just before she can escape to college, she's sexually assaulted at a family party. This leads to three claustrophobic months on campus, as a traumatized Natalie fails to connect with her peers, falls in with the hard-drinking wife of her professor, and finally befriends an odd apparition created by her own mind. Hangsaman is a horror-tinged investigation into how the pressures of mid-century sexual politics affect one woman: Natalie's unsettling hallucination is an unexpected expression of freedom, and she uses it to buck the stereotype of the kind of girl her parents, and society, expect her to be.



Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen

Like Austen's other novels, Northanger Abbey contains a marriage plot. But it's set apart from the rest of her work by a long, satirical section sending up gothic fiction and its fans. The book's heroine, Catherine Morland, is an avid reader of the popular novels of the day, and has a specific fondness for Ann Radcliffe's real-life 1794 best seller, The Mysteries of Udolpho, a tale of ghostly figures and hidden manuscripts. Catherine views herself as the hero of a similar story, and when she goes to the country house of a family she has befriended (the titular Northanger Abbey), she reinvents herself as the protagonist of a mystery. Austen is the master of depicting small faux pas, and Catherine commits many—she forces open cabinets in search of creepy documents; she begins to suspect that the family patriarch has murdered his wife. The chronic daydreamer can easily identify with Catherine's near-delusional longing for something to happen beyond the courtships and evenings around the pianoforte that seem to make up the better part of her future.



Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, by Molly McGhee

Abernathy, the everyman at the center of McGhee's funny and moving novel, is drowning in debt: thousands of dollars of combined student loans and his dead parents' bills. In a desperate attempt to make his payments, he takes a shady government gig as an auditor of dreams. In exchange for $20 a night and substantial debt relief, he's tasked with going inside the dreams of corporate office workers and flagging anxieties that might make them less productive; once noted, bad feelings or thoughts will be literally sucked into oblivion by his superiors. Soon enough, though, Abernathy begins to wonder what these losses do to a person. McGhee's world is dark, a place where overworked sleepers grieve and worry. McGhee's humor and anticapitalist critique reminded me of George Saunders and Karen Russell; dopey, affable Abernathy also gets his redemption. Plus, the story fully realizes its premise: Readers will see what happens to a dream deferred—or, rather, vacuumed up.



Quichotte, by Salman Rushdie

Rushdie's sprawling picaresque is, as the title promises, a riff on Don Quixote. But in this version, set in a contemporary world resembling our own, where politics is a spectacle, the main character's delusions revolve around television. Quichotte aspires to woo a daytime-talk-show host, Salma R, the gorgeous and talented heir apparent to Oprah's throne. Here, Sancho is Quichotte's imagined 15-year-old-son, an apparition made up of the flickering black-and-white fuzz of early TV, who rides along in the passenger seat of Quichotte's car. The story of Quichotte's quest is being written, in alternating chapters, by Sam DuChamp, a mid-list spy novelist making his first foray into literary fiction. As DuChamp dreams a story about a classic dreamer, he weaves in his own biography and disappointments, and the book likewise layers fancy on top of memory, examining the human tendency to mythologize.



The Lathe of Heaven, by Ursula K. Le Guin

Set in Portland, Oregon, in a bleak, overpopulated near future, The Lathe of Heaven is built around the banal question What if your dreams came true? But Le Guin's answer is astonishing. Her protagonist, the “milquetoast, repressed, conventional” George Orr, has the ability to rewrite reality with his dreams, changing both the past and the present. When he's sent to therapy for drug addiction, his therapist, Dr. Haber, finds that he can suggest dreams to Orr that will achieve goals big and small. But the dreams don't always deliver the hoped-for outcomes—and Haber isn't the most well-meaning steward of Orr's gift: Haber's suggestion for a solution to the population problem results in a horrific pandemic; his request for peace on Earth brings aliens into the picture. Le Guin examines unchecked power, eugenics, and the ethics of governance in this inventive and consistently surprising novel, which explores the limits of trying to manifest a better world.

Better friendships can just start with an emoji.

When Sam Dylan Finch was in his early 20s, he had the friend group he thought he always wanted. “We had holiday dinners, and game nights, and it felt really lovely,” he said.

But then, some dating within the friend group and then a death in the circle split them apart. People split up and chose who they wanted to stay friends with, Finch said, “and I was not the chosen friend.”

The whole experience sent Finch into “hermit mode,” where he began intensely analyzing his friendships and their patterns. He realized certain tendencies: He struggled to prioritize friendships the same way he prioritized romantic prospects, he was a people pleaser who felt he always had to earn people's kindness, and he often sought friendships with people who were not emotionally available to him. And he would feel nervous when people were kind to him right off the bat — “It didn't feel earned, and I didn't feel like I deserved it.”

Realizing his patterns, Finch was determined to break them. He wanted to start intentionally cultivating friendships with the people who were kind, whose interactions left him feeling safe and nourished. He started by making a list of everyone in his orbit, from current friends to old friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. Then, in his phone contacts, “I challenged myself to put a strawberry emoji next to the people who were really kind to me,” he said. “The kind of warmth and kindness that made me nervous.”

This handful of “strawberry people” became Finch's priority friends, and he even told some of them about his intentions to cultivate their friendship. He also put seedling emojis next to the names of people who challenged his ways of thinking and helped him grow.

“It completely changed my life,” said Finch. Clearly marking where he would channel his energy gave him a roadmap to building more purposeful relationships. Previously, he would get easily overwhelmed by text messages, opting to respond to no one. But now, if a text from a strawberry person popped up on this phone, the emoji acted as a reminder to Finch that he values this friendship and should try to respond without too much delay, even if he was tired.

The practice also made Finch more mindful about how interactions with others really made him feel. After hanging out, he made a practice of asking himself “how did that feel?” or “how did that feel in my body?” He noticed times when he was tense versus relaxed and nourished versus drained and made sure his strawberry people were those who left him feeling the former.

Inspired by the impact this little change made in his life, Finch posted about the strawberry people strategy in a thread on X, which is likely where social psychologist Devon Price heard about it. Price included the strategy in their book Unmasking Autism, which was where psychotherapist Michaia Walker heard about it.

Walker, who practices virtually from their home in New York City, began talking about the strategy with clients earlier this year. “It's really similar to a concept of ‘safe people' that we often use with folks with neurodivergence,” they say. People with autism are often encouraged to find “safe” friends who they can let their guards down around and not worry about being themselves, said Walker, and the strawberry people method can be super helpful for keeping track of those people.

In times of crisis, or in moments when you need to find a person to lean on, most people reflexively turn to family members or the friends they see most often, Walker said. But those might not actually be the people who can best support you emotionally. Attaching a strawberry emoji to the friends with whom you feel emotional intimacy provides a good visual reminder and mental shortcut, Walker said.

Walker said that this strategy could be really helpful for anybody looking for ways to track and maintain emotionally close friendships, whether you're neurodivergent or not. And you can make it your own. If you wanted to differentiate your strawberry people a little more, you could, for example, “put a strawberry and a suitcase for work friends, and then a strawberry and a flower for regular friends,” they say.

You could choose a different meaning of the strawberry, or a different emoji, based on the aspect of friendship you're trying to focus on. You could even teach this method to kids to help them learn from a young age what a healthy and emotionally safe friendship is supposed to feel like, said Walker.

If you're interested in implementing this strategy, Walker recommends starting small, with just three to five strawberry people at first. If you're not used to actively cultivating friendships, having more than a few strawberry friends can be overwhelming. But depending on your capacity and what you want out of your social life, “you can build up to 10 or more,” Walker said.

Their suggestions align well with psychologists' understanding of our social bandwidths. Given our own limited tanks of social and emotional energy, no one is capable of maintaining huge numbers of close friends. In fact, the evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has posited that we only have the capacity to maintain three to five very close friendships at a time, though his research suggests we can have up to 15 “best” friends (your main social circle and the friends you might turn to for favors like child care) and 50 “good” friends (your “big-weekend-barbecue people,” as Dunbar has described them).

Once you have your designated strawberry people, decide what purposefully building a friendship means to you. Do you want to check in regularly with them? Or are these simply the friends who you'll always respond to in a timely manner? Clearly outlining how your treatment of these friendships will differ from others will help crystallize the meaning of the strawberry.

Finch, who uses this strategy to this day, said he's found the strawberry people method most impactful when you tell your friends what you're doing. You don't necessarily have to say “you're one of my strawberry people,” he said — “that requires more explanation than is actually necessary” — but it can be nice to voice to them that you want to be intentional about cultivating your friendship.

“The meta conversation, the conversation about the relationship, is normalized in romance and not enough in friendship,” said Finch. But that conversation can be so powerful because, unless you tell them, “it's difficult for people to know how important they are to you.” Telling someone that you are serious about your friendship can help make sure you're on the same page and invites them to make this a joint endeavor.

When talking about strawberry people, Finch likes to remind folks that it's not about ranking your friends or creating some exclusive top tier. “We're not doing a MySpace Top 8,” he said. Rather, for him, the strawberry emoji is simply an indicator of where he can find kind and fulfilling friendships and a reminder that these are the folks he wants to intentionally build closeness with.

The strawberry emoji is also not a permanent designation; people can gain or lose strawberry emojis or seedling emojis over time. “I think of it like tending a garden,” Finch said.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered above $91,000 per token on Tuesday as recent momentum sparked optimism that the brutal fourth quarter sell-off may be behind it.

'We believe with reasonable confidence that Bitcoin and broader digital asset markets have bottomed,"" analyst Gautam Chhugani and his team said in a note on Tuesday, pointing to $80,000 in late November as the bottom.

Concerns that the October high north of $126,000 marked the peak in a historical four-year cycle for the token are overstated, Bernstein said, as the industry goes through a ""digital assets revolution"" that extends the bull run.

""As we have highlighted earlier, we believe the market concern on the 4-year cycle pattern is unwarranted in the current market context, where institutional demand is driving adoption,"" the analysts said.

Bernstein maintained its forecast that the token will hit $150,000 in 2026 and $200,000 in 2027.

Chhugani points out that despite bitcoin's 6% decline in 2025, the year was positive for crypto-related stocks and IPOs.

Looking ahead, a tokenization ""supercycle"" led by highfliers Robinhood (HOOD), Coinbase (COIN), Figure (FIGR), and Circle (CRCL) will continue to drive institutional adoption and lift the crypto sector.

Bitcoin prices have rebounded to start 2026 after trading in a tight range in recent weeks following sell-offs in the fourth quarter of last year.

Forced liquidations and selling by long-term holders pushed prices down as much as 35% from their October highs.

On Sunday, 10X Research noted technical indicators signaled ""Bitcoin has entered a bullish trend.""

The cryptocurrency ended December down for a third consecutive month, a pattern seen only 15 times historically, often setting up the token for January gains.

“There is a good opportunity for a tactical rally,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital assets at Fundstrat, on Monday night.

Farrell points to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion and a drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA), similar to the US government's checking account, as positive signs for bitcoin.

“We have liquidity improving, flows improving, and we've finally seen a couple of days of outperformance versus equities,” said Farrell.

The strategist sees a scenario where bitcoin could test the $105K–106K level, though his base case still calls for a significant drawdown in the first half of this year before a rally into the end of 2026.

Riot Platforms (RIOT), a publicly listed bitcoin mining company that develops and operates large-scale data centers, stepped up its bitcoin selling at year-end, offloading 1,818 BTC ($161.6 million) and 383 BTC ($37 million) in November. The sales reduced Riot's bitcoin balance to 18,005 BTC by the end of 2025.

While bitcoin miner sales of coins can occur for various reasons, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, suggested that funding for the company's AI build-out could be at play. The amount sold, he noted, is “roughly the entire capex Riot has guided for the first 112 MW core/shell build at Corsicana, targeting completion in Q1 2027. In other words, one winter of BTC sales equals funding Phase 1 of the AI data center pivot.”

Sigel added that the AI trade and bitcoin are increasingly linked, arguing that miners have been among the largest marginal sellers of BTC as they fund AI related capex, especially when credit conditions tighten. It could be one of many reasons for bitcoin's decline during 2025.

Riot shares are lower by 2% on Tuesday alongside a 1.2% retreat in the price of bitcoin to $92,500.

Mammals aren't known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this study:

Billions of people globally experience some kind of vision impairment, with many millions living with near or total blindness. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. But while other members of the animal kingdom display remarkable methods of vision regeneration, mammals largely lack these restorative powers. 

However, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies. 

Within the human body, it's mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn't explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. To investigate, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland explored what happens between connections of cells in the visual system and neurons in the brain in mice after an injury. While neurons didn't regrow, the researchers did notice that surviving cells increased branching, allowing for more connections in the brain. Eventually, this branching process—known as “sprouting”—resulted in nearly the same number of connections as before the injury. The results of this study were published in the journal JNeurosci. 

“The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. “Here we […] explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system.”

While the mice in the study did recover to an extent, the scientists were surprised to see that recovery wasn't uniform across sexes. Male mice showed enhanced recuperative abilities, while female mice experienced slower and incomplete repair by comparison. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn't wholly unexpected.

“Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University's Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.”

While the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail's eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish. 

For now, humans lack methods for fully regenerating cells that can completely restore our much-needed vision. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.

Neither jellyfish nor sea anemones have brains. But these animals sleep in ways strikingly similar to humans, according to a study published today in Nature Communications1. The findings bolster a theory that sleep evolved, at least in part, to protect the DNA in individual nerve cells, helping to repair damage that builds up while animals are awake.

“Neurons are very precious,” says study co-author Lior Appelbaum, a molecular neuroscientist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel. “They don't divide, so you need to keep them intact.”

Previous work has shown that jellyfish enter a sleep-like state, but this study is the first to characterize the phenomenon in sea anemones, and the first to describe both creatures' sleep patterns in detail. “Every time somebody adds to the list of species that sleep, it is a very important step for the field,” adds Chiara Cirelli, a sleep researcher at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Sleep is a risky state for animals. It leaves them vulnerable to predators and environmental hazards, and it cuts into time that could otherwise be spent foraging, mating or caring for offspring. Scientists broadly agree that sleep must serve a fundamental biological function, because evolution has preserved it across all animals with nervous systems studied so far. 

The idea that sleep might actually predate the evolution of a centralized nervous system gained traction in 2017, when Ravi Nath, now a postdoctoral neuroscientist at Stanford University in California, and his colleagues demonstrated the sleep-like state in jellyfish2. “There is good evidence that sleep emerged with neurons,” he says. “There is likely a core function, but each species has also adapted sleep to meet its own needs.”

How to get the best night's sleep: what the science says

The latest study builds on that insight by defining sleep more precisely and inspecting what effect it might have at the cellular level in animals that have neurons, but no brain. In both the laboratory and in a natural habitat in Key Largo, Florida, Appelbaum and his colleagues found that, like humans, the upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea andromeda) sleeps for roughly eight hours a day. Most of that sleep occurs at night time. But the jellyfish also had a short midday nap. The team also studied the starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in the lab, characterizing its sleep for the first time. It, too, slept for about one-third of the day, although its rest was concentrated around dawn.

Cancer cells can reawaken after a period of dormancy, triggering a relapse. Credit: Science History Images/Alamy

When Lisa Dutton was declared free of breast cancer in 2017, she took a moment to celebrate with family and friends, even though she knew her cancer journey might not be over. As many as one-third of people whose breast tumours are cleared see the disease come back, sometimes decades later. Many other cancers are known to recur in the years following an initial treatment, some at much higher rates.

“It's always in the back of your mind, and that can be stressful,” says Dutton, a retired health-care management consultant living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies

Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies

As part of her treatment, Dutton had enrolled in a clinical trial called SURMOUNT. This would monitor her for sleeping cancer cells, which many researchers now think might explain at least some cancer recurrence1. These dormant tumour cells evade initial treatment and move to other parts of the body. Instead of multiplying to form tumours right away — as is typical for metastatic cancer, in which cells spread from the main tumour — the dormant cells remain asleep. They are hidden from the immune system and not actively dividing. But later, they can reawaken and give rise to tumours.

Even though Dutton understood that her treatment might not have removed all signs of cancer, she says she was floored in 2020 when dormant cells were found in her bone marrow for the first time.

Researchers are discovering dormant tumour cells, also known as disseminated cancer cells, in association with breast, prostate, lung, colon2 and other cancers, and these cells are increasingly implicated in some metastatic cancers. An estimated 30% of people who have been successfully treated for cancer might harbour these cells, although unpublished work suggests they could be even more common.

Over the past decade, a flurry of efforts have attempted to identify and understand dormant cells, with the ultimate goal of treating them. A handful of clinical trials are now under way to test potential therapies.

Although the first trial Dutton enrolled in only monitored the cells, she has since enrolled in a second, called CLEVER, that aims to eliminate them3. As such trials move ahead, open questions about the sleeper cells, including what induces dormancy and how to fight it, are drawing more researchers into the field.

“We're starting to see multiple groups converging on some of the same ideas, which is always very affirming,” says Cyrus Ghajar, a cancer biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. The trials under way are “a testament to just how much progress has been made”.

The existence of dormant tumour cells was proposed as early as the 1930s, when Australian pathologist Rupert Willis attributed some secondary cancer growths to such cells4. As people who had been treated for cancer began to live longer, he and others noticed that the disease sometimes returned much later, and was often even more aggressive. Despite this early proposal, the idea of dormancy didn't catch on for decades.

Lewis Chodosh, a physician-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, recalls facing resistance when he began discussing the idea with colleagues more than 20 years ago. No one wanted to believe that cancer-killing drugs might be leaving something behind, he says, and drug companies weren't interested in developing therapies for people who seemed to have been cured. Many scientists at the time said that recurrent cancers must instead be new, not linked to any past diagnoses.

“It's only when enough evidence accumulates that you get pushed out of this way of thinking,” says Chodosh, who is a co-investigator on the SURMOUNT and CLEVER studies alongside Angela DeMichele, a medical oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.

Using a handful of cellular markers, researchers have now identified dormant tumour cells in many parts of the body5. These markers can tell scientists not only whether the cells are growing and dividing, but also where the cells originated and therefore which type of cancer they're associated with. The methods aren't perfect, however, and researchers are still trying to determine whether certain cells are more likely to go dormant than others, and which features define these cells.

Ghajar and others have found that dormant cells leave the primary tumour early in a cancer's progression, often before the disease has been diagnosed6. How and why these cells break away isn't entirely clear, but after spending just minutes in circulation, they exit the bloodstream and concentrate in certain parts of the body, such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Even in these niches, dormant cells are extremely rare, amounting to just a handful among millions of healthy cells, he says. Their state of suspended animation shields them from conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, that target rapidly dividing cells.

Petros Tsantoulis, a medical oncologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, says that dormancy differs from other known states such as senescence, in which old cells stop dividing as they prepare to die. Given the right conditions, dormant cells can begin dividing anew. Once reawakened, dormant cells multiply into tumours that replicate the full complexity of the original tumour.

This has led some researchers to suggest that dormant tumour cells might be cancer stem cells, a type of cell that through renewal and differentiation might give rise to the tumour — or that, at least, they might be cancer cells with stem-like features.

Forget lung, breast or prostate cancer: why tumour naming needs to change

Forget lung, breast or prostate cancer: why tumour naming needs to change

Dormant tumour cells have some characteristics that are commonly associated with stem cells, such as the overexpression of certain genes. Cancer biologist Joan Massagué, director of the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York City, says that stem cells spend most of their time dormant, waking only after an injury or illness — making them obvious candidates. Still, the existence of cancer stem cells is a contentious idea.

Scientists seem poised to resolve some of these open questions soon. With advanced laboratory techniques that give researchers the ability to study individual cells more closely, it's now possible to identify, isolate and enrich dormant tumour cells for further study. Chodosh and DeMichele's team, for example, is developing an assay to identify dormant cells. Chodosh says it is much more sensitive than existing approaches, and might ultimately improve estimates of how many people harbour dormant cells.

Ghajar, meanwhile, is settling on a different way of thinking about these cells. If a dormant cell from a breast tumour ends up in the bone marrow, for example, it might be expected to retain many features of a breast cancer cell that would enable its identification. “But what we're finding is that these expectations don't hold up,” Ghajar says, noting that once a cancer cell spreads, it often changes its shape, size and behaviour. “We're going to have to go beyond a definition based on unifying features, and instead map the mutations in these cells to mutations in the originating tumour — to define a disseminated cell not by what we think it should look like, but what its genome tells us it is.”

Beyond defining dormancy, researchers want to understand how and why cells go dormant, and what sorts of triggers reawaken them.

According to Judith Agudo, an immunologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, cells probably enter dormancy as a protective measure. As part of a tumour, individual cells might be insulated from attack by the immune system, but once on their own, “they can easily be picked off without taking steps to hide themselves”, she says. In addition, the journey through the body to a new niche is a stressful one that kills the vast majority of cells that break away. Dormancy is one way of persisting in a harsh environment.

Research has shown that while cells are asleep, they continue to engage in crosstalk with their microenvironment7 and modify themselves to actively maintain dormancy. For example, dormant cells seem to alter the expression patterns of genes involved in cell survival, including a central regulator of cell metabolism and growth called the mTOR pathway8. The cells also exploit a form of self-recycling called autophagy — literally ‘self-eating' — that allows dormant cells to repurpose internal resources and survive with little input from their surroundings9.

The cells seem to have a complex relationship with their external environment, too, including the immune system. Julio Aguirre-Ghiso, founding director of the Cancer Dormancy Institute at the Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York City, says that the immune response is implicated not only in inducing dormancy, but also in maintaining and ending it.

He and his team have shown that macrophages in the lungs produce a particular protein that binds to dormant breast cancer cells and reinforces dormancy10. Other research has demonstrated how dormant cells can evade surveillance by immune-system cells, including T cells11 and natural killer cells12.

Taken together, the research suggests that cells most often remain dormant until the immune landscape is disrupted in some way, shifting the balance enough for cells to reawaken safely. These shifts might involve injury or illness, with studies in the past few years linking cellular damage13 and COVID-19 and influenza infections14 to an escape from dormancy. Ageing, fibrosis15, chronic stress or lifestyle choices might also contribute to reawakening.

For the cells, “it's an odds game”, says Shelly Peyton, a biomedical engineer at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Cells are constantly attempting to exit dormancy after small perturbations, only to be killed. “But in moments when the balance is disrupted, that's when we often see metastasis taking off,” she says.

Peyton's work focuses on fibrosis, the build-up of fibrous connective tissue at a damaged site. This is often associated with cancer, because stiffness helps the tumour to grow and aids in signalling between cells. But the bone marrow, where dormant cells often reside, is soft, and Peyton is interested in whether that soft environment might be one feature reinforcing dormancy. She says it's possible that natural, age-related loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or hormonal changes in women who previously had breast cancer could trigger fibrosis, and potentially a reawakening of their cancer.

Surface terminations critically govern the properties of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes), yet a universal strategy to obtain MXenes with uniform and controllable terminations remains elusive. Here we introduce a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching strategy that employs iodine vapour, halide molten salts and MAX phases to produce MXenes with pure and precisely tunable halogen terminations (Cl, Br, I or their combinations). In this process, halide molten salts dissolve iodine via interhalogen anion formation while efficiently transporting etching by-products. The resulting MXenes retain excellent structural integrity, yielding uniformly ordered surfaces. As a representative example, Ti3C2Cl2 shows a 160-fold enhancement in macroscopic conductivity and a 13-fold enhancement in terahertz conductivity relative to conventional Cl/O-terminated Ti3C2, attributed to minimized electron trapping and scattering. Beyond single-halogen terminations, the gas–liquid–solid approach enables dual- and triple-halogen termination control, providing a general platform for tailoring MXene surface chemistry towards advanced (opto)electronic applications.

Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, also known as MXenes, have emerged as a large group of multifunctional materials, characterized by the chemical formula Mn+1XnTx (M: transition metal, X: carbon or nitrogen, Tx: surface terminations)1. The Mn+1Xn core of MXenes comprises C/N layers sandwiched between transition metal layers. The partially filled d-orbitals of transition metals endow MXenes with a wealth of free electrons, resulting in outstanding electrical conductivity. The intrinsic metallic nature makes MXenes particularly appealing for applications where efficient charge transport is essential, such as electrocatalysis2, energy storage devices3, electromagnetic interference shielding4, terahertz detectors5 and various (opto)electronic devices. A distinguishing feature of MXenes is their adjustable surface terminations, which cover the exposed metal atoms on the MXene surface. These surface terminations have been shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to determine the intrinsic intralayer charge transport properties of MXenes by manipulating the electronic structure of the surface metal atoms6. In addition, they can markedly impact macroscopic charge transport in MXene films composed of multiple nanoflakes or grains7, with intergrain electron hopping being identified as the dominant mechanism8. However, the currently reported MXenes often possess mixed and mostly randomly distributed terminations, leading to surface disordering that causes severe electron trapping and scattering, consequently compromising the intrinsic charge transport9. Moreover, the lack of MXenes with uniform terminations poses a substantial obstacle to experimentally determining the impact of specific terminations on both intrinsic charge transport and intergrain electron hopping. Achieving this fundamental understanding is crucial for optimizing MXene properties and broadening their range of applications.

The random arrangement of terminations on MXenes stems from the intricate top-down etching synthesis process used to produce these materials from layered ternary metal carbides/nitrides (MAX phases). Typically, the synthesis process involves selectively removing the A-layers (for example, Al or Si) of MAX using strong acidic etchants, which exposes the transition metal atom layers to the surface. Anionic species in the reaction environment tend to bond with the exposed transition metal atoms for charge balance, acting as terminations on the MXene surface. The most common method employed is wet-chemistry etching using F- or Cl-containing aqueous acids, which generally yields MXenes with mixed terminations (–OH, –O or –F/–Cl) arranged randomly10,11. An alternative approach uses Lewis-acid halide salts as etchants in conjunction with molten salts to create a ‘solid–liquid' reaction environment under inert gas protection12,13,14. This approach also requires subsequent washing steps using aggressive oxidizing agents to eliminate side products, which inadvertently introduces O terminations and causes termination disordering. A few additional etching methods have also been proposed, including electrochemical and hydrothermal etching15,16. However, these approaches similarly result in MXenes characterized by mixed and randomly distributed terminations. Recently, a bottom-up approach was developed to synthesize Ti2CCl2 MXene with uniform terminations17, marking an important step towards MXene synthesis. Nonetheless, this method is currently limited to a few selected types of MXene. It is highly desirable to develop synthesis methods that can be universally applied to diverse MXenes, while ensuring ordered and uniform terminations.

In this work, we develop a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching protocol (denoted GLS) that is capable of synthesizing diverse MXenes characterized by uniform and controllably orchestrated halogen terminations. The etching reaction involves solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salt and gas-phase I2 vapour. Iodine is selected as the etching agent because the generated by-products (for example, AlI3 and KI) can be readily removed through simple washing. The effectiveness of iodine as an etchant has been previously verified both in wet-solution phases and in a high-temperature vapour phase18,19,20. The halide molten salt acts as a crucial intermediate that dissolves the I2 etchant by forming interhalogen anions, creates a solid–liquid interface and facilitates the transport of side products for effective etching. After the etching reaction, a simple ethanol wash is able to completely remove generated side products and unreacted reactants, preventing contamination and disordering of the MXene terminations. We showcase the versatility of the GLS method by synthesizing MXenes from eight distinct types of MAX phase. Using Ti3C2 MXene as a representative example, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis of Ti3C2 with uniform Cl, Br and I terminations by utilizing different halide salts. The highly ordered and pure terminations of the yielded MXenes are confirmed by atomic-resolution ultralow-energy secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations. Importantly, our study highlights the critical role of uniform halogen terminations in substantially improving the charge transport properties of MXenes. For instance, the achieved Ti3C2Cl2 with ordered Cl terminations exhibits a 161.6-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity and a 12.7-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity compared with Ti3C2 with mixed Cl/O terminations (denoted ClO-Ti3C2). These enhancements are attributed to the mitigation of electron trapping and scattering, facilitated by the high structural ordering associated with the uniform Cl terminations. Furthermore, the GLS synthesis demonstrates the controllability to flexibly orchestrate the terminations of MXenes with dual-halogen and triple-halogen terminations. Six examples of Ti3C2 with varying proportions of mixed halogen terminations are successfully synthesized. This tunability opens avenues for further termination modifications with chalcogens or organic groups, as highlighted in previous studies6,21, thereby broadening their functional versatility.

We started by synthesizing MXenes with mono-halogen terminations using our GLS etching method. Typically, the GLS synthesis was conducted in a sealed glass tube containing iodine, potassium halide salt (KI, KBr or KCl), and MAX as the precursors (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Upon annealing, the precursors underwent a transformation into a triphasic system, comprising a solid-phase MAX phase, liquid-phase molten potassium halide and gas-phase I2 vapour. The molten potassium halide acted as a crucial reaction intermediate, facilitating the dissolution of I2 vapour by forming interhalogen anions (TI2−, T = I, Br or Cl), which enabled solid–liquid etching and aided in the transport of etchant (TI2−) and side products (AlI3 and KI). During the etching process, halogen anions from the molten salt attached to the exposed metal atoms of MXene, resulting in uniform and impurity-free terminations. Using Ti3AlC2 as a representative example, Fig. 1b illustrates the overall reaction process to obtain Ti3C2 MXenes with uniform halogen terminations (Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2). The overall reaction can be described by equation (1). The side products (AlI3) and unreacted I2 are highly soluble in ethanol, allowing easy removal by washing with ethanol in a glovebox. The generated KI and unreacted potassium halide salts are also soluble in ethanol and can be removed through iterative ethanol washing (Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall synthesis process of MXenes does not involve any hazards or oxidative compounds, effectively avoiding termination contamination. The synthesis yields of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 from 1 g of Ti3AlC2 are calculated to be 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively. We demonstrated the synthesis of up to 10 g of Ti3C2Cl2 in a single batch using a custom-designed laboratory set-up, highlighting its strong potential for industrial-scale production (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, apart from Ti3AlC2, our GLS approach also works for seven additional MAX phases, including Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, TiNbAlC, Nb2AlC, Nb4AlC3 and Mo2Ga2C. With an I2–KCl–MAX combination, we exemplified the successful synthesis of Ti3CNCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 4), Ti2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 5), Ti2NCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), TiNbCCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 7), Nb2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 8), Nb4C3Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 9) and Mo2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 10) with uniform halogen terminations.

To validate the synthesis mechanism, we conducted annealing time-dependent ex situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å) analysis to track the compound evolution during the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Given the strong hygroscopic nature of AlI3, all samples underwent rapid ethanol washing before PXRD measurement, during which AlI3, together with I2, can be completely removed. By examining the (0002) peaks of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Cl2, we observed a gradual conversion from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2Cl2. After annealing for 54 h, Ti3AlC2 was fully converted to Ti3C2Cl2. In addition, with increasing annealing time, the intensity of characteristic KCl peaks exhibited a continuous weakening trend, while the intensity of characteristic KI peaks gradually increased. This phenomenon indicates the consumption of KCl during the reaction to form Cl terminations on MXenes, generating KI as the side product, thus confirming the reaction mechanism depicted in equation (1).

In addition, the formation of interhalogen anions during the synthesis process was confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy analysis, macroscopic colour changes on the annealing products and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 12). The presence of interhalogen anions was identified as a crucial factor in promoting etching efficiency. As a control study, PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig. 13) shows that potassium halide salts alone do not etch the MAX phase to yield MXenes in the GLS system. Moreover, we attempted to synthesize Ti3C2I2 MXene with a solid–gas biphasic system of I2 and Ti3AlC2. After 54 h of annealing, although the formation of Ti3C2I2 was detected in the synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) pattern, the presence of Ti3AlC2 was still evident, contrasting with the complete conversion of Ti3AlC2 achieved using our triphasic GLS method for the same duration of reaction (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Like MXenes synthesized through other methods, the obtained Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 2a), as well as Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 MXenes (Supplementary Fig. 15), display an accordion-like morphology, which is distinguished from the bulk morphology of Ti3AlC2. These layered MXenes can be further delaminated into single- or few-layer nanoflakes using a liquid-phase chemical exfoliation approach with n-butyllithium (Fig. 2b). The Ti3C2Cl2 nanoflakes suspended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) present a noticeable Tyndall effect when illuminated by a laser pointer. Meanwhile, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image discloses the single- or few-layer character of the exfoliated flakes, with the thickness of a single layer measuring approximately 1.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Ti K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were next collected to evaluate the chemical and local coordination environments of Ti atoms in the three MXenes. In the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 2c), all three Ti3C2 MXenes exhibit a similar spectrum shape to their corresponding metal carbide reference, TiC. The absorption edge energy (E0) values were determined to be 4,969.3 eV for Ti3C2Cl2, 4,968.8 eV for Ti3C2Br2 and 4,967.9 eV for Ti3C2I2. The noticeably higher E0 of Ti3C2Cl2 compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 suggests stronger hybridization between the surface Ti and Cl orbitals, probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms. Besides, Ti K-edge Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) R-space spectra were derived22 (Supplementary Fig. 17), and wavelet-transform analysis of EXAFS in R and k spaces was further performed for Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 2d), Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 2e) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 2f). The contour intensity reveals the coordination environment around Ti atoms, including the first-shell metal-termination scattering (1.67 Å for Ti–Cl, 1.73 Å for Ti–Br and 1.76 Å for Ti–I in R space) and second-shell Ti–C–Ti scattering (2.41 Å for Ti3C2Cl2, 2.55 Å for Ti3C2Br2 and 2.57 Å for Ti3C2I2 in R space). Overall, different halogen terminations cause slight changes in the Ti-termination distance and the Ti3C2 backbone thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of mono-halogen terminations in all three MXene samples (Supplementary Fig. 18). No iodine signals were detected in Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2, indicating that the terminations are entirely dependent on the molten salts used in the synthesis. In addition, the Ti 2p and C 1s spectra also indicate the integrity of the Ti3C2 backbone structure (Supplementary Fig. 19). It is important to note that the O 1s signals are attributed to C–O bonds, which may arise from lattice oxygen within the carbon layers, as previously reported6,23.

To elucidate the crystalline structures, SXRD patterns (λ = 0.4142 Å) of the three MXenes were collected, and their atomic structures were determined using DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig. 20). The detailed lattice parameters were derived through Rietveld refinement of the SXRD pattern with the simulated structures24 (Supplementary Table 1). As depicted in Fig. 2g, the SXRD pattern of Ti3C2Cl2 aligns well with a hexagonal structure characterized by the P63/mmc space group, exhibiting lattice parameters of a = b = 3.16 Å and c = 22.19 Å. Similarly, Ti3C2Br2 (a = b = 3.08 Å, c = 24.05 Å; Fig. 2h) and Ti3C2I2 (a = b = 3.09 Å, c = 25.19 Å; Fig. 2i) both exhibit a hexagonal structure. The interlayer distances follow the trend of Ti3C2I2 > Ti3C2Br2 > Ti3C2Cl2, consistent with the atomic size trend of I > Br > Cl.

We further sought to reveal the atomic arrangement of the three Ti3C2 MXenes by using quantitative atomic-resolution ultralow-energy SIMS23,25. This technique utilizes low-energy Cs+ ions to achieve layer-by-layer sputtering towards the sample surface at a high incident angle, enabling the elemental distribution to be resolved over the sample with atomic-depth resolution. As expected, the Ti3C2 backbone was distinctly identified in the quantitative SIMS analysis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 3a), Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 3b) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 3c). O signals were detected only in the C layers, consistent with the previous reports8,23. Notably, on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone, a monolayer of halogen atoms is visualized as the terminations, with no impurity elements detected between the Ti3C2 layers. Importantly, taking Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, depth profiling across multiple layers further verifies that each termination layer is uniformly Cl-terminated (Supplementary Fig. 21). For comparison, we synthesized ClO-Ti3C2 through the classic Lewis-acid molten salt approach12. By contrast, strong Cl and O signals were observed at the termination positions of ClO-Ti3C2 (Supplementary Fig. 22, and Supplementary Table 2). These findings underscore the uniform nature of the terminations on MXenes synthesized via our GLS method.

In addition, high-resolution TEM images and selected area electron diffraction patterns confirm the excellent crystallinity and hexagonal structure of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 23). High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) was further used to obtain atomic-resolution cross-sectional images of the MXenes. In Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 3d), three distinct Ti layers in the Ti3C2 backbone are clearly identified. Due to the relatively low atomic mass, the presence of Cl terminations on the Ti3C2 backbone is barely discernible. By contrast, the heavier atomic masses of Br and I in Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 3e) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 3f) are more clearly visible in the HAADF-STEM images, where they appear as distinct monolayers on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone. The interlayer distances of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 were determined to be 1.12 nm, 1.21 nm and 1.28 nm, respectively, in close agreement with the SXRD analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 24), Ti3C2Br2 (Supplementary Fig. 25) and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 26) reveal a uniform distribution of Ti, C and halogen elements within individual MXene particles. Quantitative analysis (Supplementary Table 3) indicates that the chemical formulas of the three MXenes can be represented as Ti2.9±0.3C2.0±0.2Cl2.0±0.3O0.1±0.03, Ti3.2±0.3C1.8±0.1Br1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04 and Ti3.3±0.3C1.9±0.1I1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04, closely resembling the ideal Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 formulas. A small amount of oxygen detected is attributable to lattice oxygen in Ti3C2, consistent with our SIMS analysis. In addition, to systematically evaluate the air-oxidation resistance of MXenes synthesized via our GLS method, we conducted time-dependent XPS and atomic-resolution SIMS on Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Figs. 27–29). All samples were obtained from the same batch and stored under ambient conditions for defined periods before testing. The results consistently show that MXenes produced by the GLS method remain stable in air for at least 8 weeks, with no substantial structural changes, particularly in the termination layers.

The highly pure and ordered terminations are expected to minimize electron trapping and scattering in MXenes, potentially leading to a substantial improvement in their charge transport properties. We first assessed the direct-current conductivities σdc of MXene pellets utilizing the temperature-dependent van der Pauw method (Fig. 4a). In general, macroscopic charge transport in MXene-based pellets is dominated by thermally activated intergrain electron hopping, leading to a continuously increasing conductivity as the temperature rises9,26. However, both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 exhibit metallic behaviour from 300 K down to ~100 K, with conductivity decreasing as temperature increases. Below 100 K, conductivities of both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 rise with increasing temperature. Hall effect measurements on ultrathin Ti3C2Cl2 film further confirmed this phenomenon (Supplementary Fig. 30a,b), which can be attributed to electron localization effects. A similar transition from high-temperature metallic to low-temperature localized electron transport has previously been observed in highly controlled epitaxial thin films of related materials27. Notably, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibited the highest electrical conductivity (51,380 S m−1 at 300 K), compared with Ti3C2Br2 (11,126 S m−1 at 300 K) and Ti3C2I2 (4,149 S m−1 at 300 K). Moreover, we measured the electrical conductivity of previously reported ClO-Ti3C2 (ref. 12) and Ti3C2 MXene synthesized via the conventional wet-chemistry hydrofluoric acid (HF)-etching method10 (denoted HF-Ti3C2) for comparison. Impressively, the Ti3C2Cl2 achieved approximately 160-fold and 13.5-fold increases in macroscopic electrical conductivity relative to ClO-Ti3C2 (318 S m−1 at 300 K) and HF-Ti3C2 (3,815 S m−1 at 300 K), respectively. To better compare the macroscopic electrical conductivity with reported literatures, we fabricated MXene thin films from delaminated MXene flakes and measured their conductivity using the van der Pauw method (Supplementary Fig. 30c). At 300 K, Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 films exhibited conductivities of approximately 16,000, 3,000 and 800 S cm⁻1, respectively. For comparison, ClO-Ti3C2 and HF-Ti3C2 showed conductivities of approximately 400 and 7,300 S cm⁻1, respectively. These values are comparable with those reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, time-dependent electrical conductivity measurements further demonstrated that Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits superior oxidation resistance compared with ClO-Ti3C2. After 4 weeks of air exposure, the conductivity of the Ti3C2Cl2 film decreased by only 12.5%, whereas that of ClO-Ti3C2 dropped by 86.5% (Supplementary Fig. 31). Both the temperature-dependent behaviour and the relatively high electrical conductivity in macroscopic specimens highlight the excellent chemical and structural quality of the synthesized materials.

We further explored intraflake transport in our MXenes using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, leveraging the transient nature of the terahertz electric field to probe short-range charge transport properties at the nanoscale9,28,29. We first conducted frequency-resolved static terahertz conductivity across a ~0.3–2.1 THz range (Supplementary Fig. 32), with the average terahertz conductivity values derived and compared in Fig. 4b. Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits the highest average terahertz conductivity (5,056 S m−1), surpassing that of Ti3C2Br2 (3,230 S m−1) and Ti3C2I2 (1,551 S m−1) (Methods). Compared with ClO-Ti3C2 (397 S m−1), Ti3C2Cl2 achieved a 13-fold increase in terahertz conductivity, highlighting a substantial enhancement in its intrinsic intraflake conductivity. Considering the 160-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity, we conclude that the uniform Cl terminations in Ti3C2Cl2 also substantially enhance intragrain electron hopping compared with ClO-Ti3C2.

Optical pump–terahertz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy elucidated the charge carrier dynamics and mechanisms governing the intrinsic intraflake charge transport of MXenes. In the OPTP measurement, additional charge carriers were photogenerated in MXenes using an optical pump pulse (1.55 eV laser pulse with ~50 fs duration) and then probed by a single-cycle terahertz pulse. The relative attenuation of the terahertz field (−ΔE/E) is directly linked to the terahertz photoconductivity (∆σTHz). Figure 4c illustrates the photoconductivity dynamics of our three MXenes in comparison with ClO-Ti3C2. In each sample, a transient increase in photoconductivity signifies the generation of free carriers, followed by rapid decay due to recombination or trapping effects9. Moreover, ∆σTHz is correlated with the charge carrier mobility (µ) as described by equation (2), where N, e, ϕ and Nabs represent the charge carrier density, elementary charge, photon-to-free-charge conversion quantum yield and absorbed photon density, respectively. Assuming a similar ϕ for all MXene samples, the highest photoconductivity per absorbed photon density (∆σTHz/Nabs) observed in Ti3C2Cl2 (9.3 × 10−18 S m) indicates its largest charge carrier mobility, while that of ClO-Ti3C2 is 2.6 × 10−18 S m. Quantitatively, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates a 3.6-fold enhancement in charge carrier mobility compared with ClO-Ti3C2.

DFT calculations were used to simulate the band structures of Ti3C2 MXenes, providing deeper insights into how Cl terminations enhance charge transport properties. We noticed that different halogen terminations substantially alter the band structure of Ti3C2 MXene, with Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 4d) exhibiting the highest electron density around the Fermi level compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 33). This effect is probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms, which enhances hybridization between the surface Ti and halogen orbitals. We also simulated the band structure of ClO-Ti3C2 (with a Cl/O ratio of 0.6/1.4; Supplementary Fig. 34), which presents minimal differences compared with Ti3C2Cl2. To further assess the impact of termination purity, electron transport through Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2 lattices was simulated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method in a two-probe pattern. Figure 4e and Fig. 4f visualize the electron transmission pathways within the Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2 lattices, respectively. Clearly, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates superior electron delocalization across the probes, whereas ClO-Ti3C2 shows notable electron localization near the left probe, leading to strong electron scattering. This interpretation is further supported by the quantified current–voltage curves (Fig. 4g) and electron transmittance patterns (Supplementary Fig. 35) of Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2. Together, these experimental and theoretical findings emphasize the critical role of uniform Cl terminations in enhancing the charge transport capabilities of MXenes.

Electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the practical applicability of the halogen-terminated samples30. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36a, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits strong EMW absorption in a frequency range of ~14–18 GHz, with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −51.4 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 4.6 GHz. Meanwhile, Ti3C2Br2 exhibits strong absorption in the ~12–17 GHz range, with an RLmin of −54.6 dB and an EABmax of 4.6 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36b). In comparison, Ti3C2I2 shows weaker EMW absorption, mainly in the ~16–18 GHz range, with an RLmin of −27.5 dB and an EABmax of 4.7 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36c). This RLmin value is much higher than the previously reported Ti3C2Tx (~−20 dB) prepared by wet-chemistry methods31,32. By contrast, ClO-Ti3C2 shows its primary absorption at lower frequencies of ~6–9 GHz, with a RLmin of −61.4 dB and an EABmax of 4.4 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36d). These results demonstrate that tuning the surface terminations can effectively shift the primary EMW absorption frequency range of Ti3C2 MXenes. This result suggests a promising strategy for designing MXene-based absorbers tailored to specific frequency bands for various practical applications.

The strong dependence of MXene charge transport properties on termination type further motivated us to pursue controllable orchestration of halogen terminations on MXenes through our GLS synthesis method. In particular, DFT calculations not only revealed that mixed-halogen terminations are thermodynamically stable, but also demonstrated that they possess a more stable structure compared with single-halogen terminations (Supplementary Fig. 37). We noticed that the termination type of MXenes is directly determined by the chosen molten salt in the GLS synthesis. While mono-type potassium halide salts were initially used to achieve single-halogen terminations, we further employed mixed molten salts to synthesize MXenes with dual- and triple-halogen terminations. Specifically, we synthesized Ti3C2 MXene with mixed halogen terminations: I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. 5a), I:Cl = 1:1 (Fig. 5b), Br:Cl = 1:1 (Fig. 5c) and I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1 (Fig. 5d). In addition, taking Ti3C2 with mixed I/Br terminations as a model, we demonstrated precise control over the I/Br termination ratio with I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. 5a), I:Br = 1:2 (Fig. 5e) and I:Br = 2:1 (Fig. 5f). These examples showcase the capability of our GLS method in controllably orchestrating halogen terminations, which would further expand the MXene family and offer a venue to precisely customize the intrinsic properties of MXenes. Finally, Supplementary Table 5 compares the GLS method with previously reported MXene synthesis approaches, underscoring its unique advantages in termination chemistry, structural stability, production scalability and electrical conductivity.

In summary, we have demonstrated a triphasic GLS etching method that is applicable to eight different types of MAX phase, enabling the production of their corresponding MXenes with uniform halogen terminations. This process integrates solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salts and gas-phase I2 vapour. The resulting MXenes are characterized by highly pure and ordered halogen terminations (Cl, Br or I). As a representative case, Ti3C2Cl2 synthesized via this method exhibited a 160-fold improvement in macroscopic charge transport, a 13-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity and a 3.6-fold rise in charge carrier mobility, compared with ClO-Ti3C2. These enhancements are attributed to the uniform Cl terminations with superior structural ordering, which effectively reduces electron trapping and scattering. In addition, the GLS synthesis demonstrated the capability for controllable orchestration of dual- and triple-halogen terminations on MXenes. Beyond broadening the MXene family with finely adjustable properties, controlled halogen terminations offer the potential for further surface functionalization, such as selective postsubstitution or covalent grafting on specific halogen terminations6,21. We envision that our GLS method will accelerate the development of MXenes with customized properties for advanced (opto)electronics and beyond.

Ti3AlC2 and Nb2AlC MAX phases were purchased from Carbon-Ukraine. Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, TiNbAlC, Mo2Ga2C, Ti2AlN and Nb4AlC3 MAX phases were purchased from Jilin 11 Technology. Elemental iodine (I2), 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution in hexane, N-methylformamide (NMF), ethyl acetate (EA), HNO3, cellulose and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexane, tetrahydrofuran, potassium iodide (KI) and potassium bromide (KBr) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. High-purity ethanol (absolute, analytical reagent grade) was bought from Fisher Chemical. All chemicals were used directly without any purification.

The GLS method used MAX phase, elemental iodine and halide salts to create a triphasic system for MXene synthesis. Taking the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, typically, 500 mg Ti3AlC2, 1,956 mg I2 and 575 mg KCl were mixed (molar ratio of 1:3:3) and placed in a home-made glass tube (Supplementary Fig. 1). The tube was connected to a Schlenk line, purged with Ar gas three times to completely remove air and then vacuum-sealed to 10−2 mbar. The tube was flame-sealed with a butane torch (model: CHF CF211). Due to the volatility of I2, precursor materials were kept at the bottom of the glass tube in an ice-water bath during sealing to prevent iodine vapourization. The sealed glass tube was calcined at 600 °C in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for 54 h. After the reaction, the product was removed from the glass tube and washed eight times with high-purity ethanol to remove by-products such as AlI3 and KI, as well as unreacted KCl and I2. Each washing step involved 10 min of sonication in an ice-water bath to assist in dissolving any remaining salts. These washing steps were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox to prevent MXene oxidation. Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at room temperature for 24 h to obtain Ti3C2Cl2.

The synthesis of Ti3CNCl2, Ti2CCl2, Ti2NCl2, TiNbCCl2, Nb2CCl2, Nb4C3Cl2 and Mo2CCl2 was conducted using the same methodology. The synthesis process of Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 follows a similar procedure, differing only in the choice of molten salt: the Ti3AlC2–I2–KBr combination for Ti3C2Br2 and the Ti3AlC2–I2–KI combination for Ti3C2I2. For MXenes with dual- and triple-halogen terminations, precursor ratios were adjusted as follows: Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:2.5:0.5) for I:Br = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KCl (1:3:2.9:0.1) for I:Cl = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KBr–KCl (1:3:2.5:0.5) for Br:Cl = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr–KCl (1:3:2.8:0.1:0.1) for I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:1.5:1.5) for I:Br = 1:2 and Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:2.9:0.1) for I:Br = 2:1. Ti3C2I2-GS was synthesized following the same method as Ti3C2I2 but without the inclusion of any halide salts. The synthesis of ClO-Ti3C2 was conducted according to a previously reported procedure12.

The delamination process of MXenes was carried out using an intercalation method8. Initially, 50 mg of MXenes and 1 ml of 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution were mixed in an Ar-filled glovebox and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Following this, the material underwent washing steps with high-purity hexane and tetrahydrofuran. The washed sample was then transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of anhydrous NMF and sonicated in an ice-water bath (<5 °C) for 40 min. The solution was centrifuged at 360g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min to isolate MXene nanoflakes, which were then dispersed in anhydrous NMP for subsequent use.

XPS was analysed by an Axis Supra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). PXRD was performed by the AERIS XRD system (PANalytical) using Cu Kα. SEM images were collected using Zeiss Gemini S4 500. AFM images were collected using Park NX10 AFM. TEM investigations were conducted using a Talos F200X transmission microscope at 200 kV. The measurements were carried out in a STEM mode using the high-angle annular dark-field detector. EDX was used for chemical composition analysis. SIMS was performed via CAMECA IMS SC Ultra instrument with a Cs+ primary-ion beam23. The primary ion beam featured an ultralow impact energy of 100 eV, a moderate current of 6 nA and a standard spot diameter of 30 µm. Measurements were conducted using a negative detector polarity. Initially, a parallel beam of primary Cs+ ions was applied to gently remove surface impurities and promote the formation of a flat, clean crystal surface. Subsequently, low-energy Cs+ ions were directed towards the sample at a high incident angle to ensure selective interaction with only the topmost atomic layer. During this bombardment, atoms from the sample surface were sputtered off and detected as secondary ions.

Synchrotron XAS measurements were conducted at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The XAS spectra were acquired in transmission mode at room temperature with photon energies centred around the Ti K edge (4,966 eV). The incident, transmitted and reference X-ray intensities were recorded using gas ionization chambers. A titanium foil standard was simultaneously measured with the samples and used for energy calibration. Before measurements, all powder samples were pressed into 8-mm pellets, homogeneously mixed with an appropriate amount of cellulose, and sealed between Kapton tapes inside an Ar-filled glovebox. The collected XANES and EXAFS data were subsequently processed and corrected using the Athena software (version 0.9.26)22. The wavelet transform analysis of the EXAFS spectra was carried out using the HAMA Fortran software. The EXAFS oscillation function, χ(k) (k-weights: 2), was extracted as a function of the photoelectron wave number k, within the selected radial range of 0–6 Å (Rmin = 0, Rmax = 6). The Morlet function was chosen as the mother wavelet, with parameters set to kappaMorlet = 10 and sigmaMorlet = 1. SXRD measurements were performed at the BL04 beamline of the ALBA synchrotron facility using an incident energy of 35 keV (λ = 0.4142 Å) and a high-angular-resolution multicrystal analyser detector set-up. The MXene powders were loaded into 0.3-mm-diameter glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH) and mounted on the dedicated sample stage provided by the beamline. The collected SXRD data were analysed using the GSAS-II software, and Rietveld refinement was used to determine the lattice parameters24.

The macroscopic direct current temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the MXene pellets was measured using the van der Pauw method in a commercial Physical Property Measurement System cryostat equipped with the electrical transport option and automatic contact switching (Quantum Design). Ohmic contacts were established using gold-plated spring-loaded probes on the clean surfaces of the MXene pellets. MXene pellets were made by using compressed powders with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of less than approximately 1 mm. The sheet resistance (Rs) of the pellet in the temperature range of ~5–300 K was determined to calculate the bulk electrical resistivity (ρ) and electrical conductivity (σdc). MXene ultrathin films used for the conductivity measurement were prepared as follows. First, exfoliated MXenes were dispersed in NMF to form a stable suspension (~1 mg ml−1). A volume of 1.5 ml of this suspension was then added to 40 ml of deionized water in a 60-ml wide-mouth beaker, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 1 M HNO3 to stabilize the surface potential. After thorough mixing, 2 ml of EA was introduced, and the beaker was covered to approximately 90% of its opening, allowing the EA to evaporate slowly. Once the EA had completely evaporated, the MXene nanosheets spontaneously self-assembled into a continuous single-layer ultrathin film at the water-air interface. These films were subsequently transferred onto gold prepatterned four-probe SiO2/Si substrates and dried under vacuum. To minimize cracks or discontinuities, two layers of film were transferred for each sample.

Terahertz spectroscopy was conducted using a commercial regenerative amplified mode-locked Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser system (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace, seeded by Mai Tai and pumped by Empower). The laser produced ~50-fs pulses centred at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Terahertz radiation was generated via optical rectification in a nonlinear zinc telluride (ZnTe) crystal oriented along the (110) direction. The transmitted THz electric field was detected using a second ZnTe crystal through the electro-optic sampling technique, probed by an 800-nm gating pulse. This configuration allowed frequency-resolved measurements in the range of 0.2−2.5 THz.

To determine the terahertz conductivity of MXene thin films without photoexcitation, the transmitted terahertz pulse through the sample (Esample) was compared with that through a reference substrate (Ereference). When the film thickness (d) is much smaller than the terahertz wavelength (d/λ << 1), the thin-film approximation can be applied, as illustrated in equation (3). Here, \(T\,(=\frac{{E}_{\mathrm{sample}}}{{E}_{\mathrm{reference}}})\) denotes the transmission ratio between the sample and reference signals, ∆σTHz represents the complex terahertz conductivity, Z0 = 377 Ω is the impedance of free space and nsub = 1.95 corresponds to the refractive index of the fused-silica substrate in the terahertz range.

For OPTP measurements, the terahertz absorption induced by photoexcited charge carriers (excitation wavelength 800 nm) was monitored by fixing the sampling beam at the peak of the terahertz electric field. Time-dependent, pump-induced terahertz absorption was recorded by varying the temporal delay between the pump and terahertz probe pulses. To eliminate interference from water vapour absorption, the entire terahertz set-up was continuously purged with dry nitrogen. During measurements, the samples were either maintained under a dry nitrogen atmosphere or kept under vacuum (<2 × 10−4 mbar). The time-resolved photoconductive response (∆σTHz) of charge carriers was determined from the time-dependent change in the transmitted terahertz field (∆E) using the thin-film approximation, as expressed by equation (4), where Epump and E0 correspond to the peak amplitudes of the transmitted terahertz field with and without optical excitation, respectively.

Similar to previously reported methods30, all samples were mixed with paraffin and fabricated into concentric rings with an inner diameter of 3.04 mm and an outer diameter of 7 mm for testing. The measurements were carried out using a standard coaxial-line method, using a vector network analyser (N5222B) to record the electromagnetic parameters, including the complex permittivity (εr = ε′ – jε′) and permeability (μr = μ;′ – jμ′).

Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)33,34, based on the plane-wave projector augmented-wave method. The exchange-correlation functional was used in the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof35. Van der Waals interactions were taken into account by using the Grimme (DFT-D3) method36. An energy cut-off of 500 eV was set for all the simulations. The Brillouin zone of the systems was sampled using 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst−Pack k-points37. The VASPKIT code was used for postprocessing of the VASP calculated data38. The electron transport was calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function technique as implemented in the Atomistix ToolKit package (QuantumWise A/S. Atomistix ToolKit, Version 2016.4). We used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with single-zeta plus polarization numerical basis sets for all the transport simulations. The kinetic energy cut-off of 75 Ryd was set for the self-consistent calculations. A fast Fourier transform solver was used to address the system's Poisson–Schrödinger equation in a self-consistent manner. The transport models were treated as two-probe systems with the central scattering region sandwiched between the semi-infinite source (left) and drain (right) electrodes from the same. The current through the scattering region is calculated within the Landauer formula (equation (5)), where \({T}\left(\varepsilon ,{V}\right)\) represents the energy- and voltage-resolved transmission function, f is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function and \({\mu }_{{\rm{L}},{\rm{R}}}={E}_{{\rm{f}}}\pm eV/2\) stands for the chemical potentials of the left and right electrodes. The transport calculations were performed at T = 300 K.

Immune molecules and their cognate receptors are developmentally regulated in brain and dynamically expressed in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the importance of immune molecules to brain wiring, a comprehensive map of the neuroimmune landscape is lacking in developing brain. Here we employed multiplexed in situ spatial transcriptomics to measure the expression of major immune ligands and receptors in developing mouse brain during mid and late gestation. Given the importance of maternal environment in shaping fetal neurodevelopment, we determined how embryonic neuroimmune landscape was altered after maternal immune activation (MIA) and maternal microbiome depletion. Our study revealed notable sex-specific patterns in gene expression and spatial architecture within developing brain. We observed changes in the CXCL12/CXCR7 chemokine network after MIA and microbiome depletion, suggesting a potential common mechanism underlying neural progenitor abnormalities. This resource underscores how the maternal environment programs precise regulation of immune molecules in developing brain, highlighting sex-specific vulnerability.

Amazon's Ring is rolling out a $5,000 solar-powered surveillance trailer for parking lots, construction sites, and events — part of a broader expansion beyond the doorbell and into commercial security.

The new Ring Mobile Security Trailer, announced Tuesday morning at CES, is designed to be an alternative to the heavy-duty rigs often seen at industrial sites. It uses a 360-degree camera with 4k resolution, which the company says ensures high-definition visibility without blind spots.

Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018, has renewed its focus on security under Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who returned to the tech giant last year after his 2023 departure.

The move puts Ring in more direct competition with commercial security players like Verkada and Motorola Solutions, which sell cloud-connected cameras and mobile surveillance systems, and traditional industrial providers such as Bosch and Hikvision known for rugged security gear.

Ring's strategy appears to be leveraging its brand recognition in residential security and Amazon's infrastructure — including Amazon Sidewalk connectivity and AWS cloud services — to undercut competitors on price as part of a larger system that bridges home and business security.

Set for release this spring, Ring's trailer can run on line power with battery backup or operate fully off-grid via solar panels. It comes with built-in LTE connectivity, meaning it requires no external internet infrastructure to work. It can also be detached and mounted in a truck bed or used as a standalone station, making it adaptable for temporary deployments like festivals.

It's part of Ring's new “Jobsite” security portfolio, which also includes a new Ring Elite camera line designed for large-scale business settings like logistics yards and campuses.

Separately, Ring introduced “Fire Watch,” a new feature developed in partnership with the non-profit Watch Duty. It provides real-time wildfire alerts directly within the Ring app and allows camera owners to voluntarily share periodic snapshots with first responders.

Apart from its new commercial offerings, the company announced several new residential security features and products.

Ring announced that the Sidewalk network itself is expanding globally, launching in Canada and Mexico in the coming months before reaching Europe, Australia, and Japan later this year.

Nvidia announced today at CES 2026 that it would help Siemens electronic design automation (EDA) software run on its GPUs in an attempt to speed up the chip design process. Nearly all computer chips today are designed using EDA tools, and as chip features get smaller and transistors more numerous, the process has grown more computationally intensive.

Beyond speeding chip development, Nvidia and Siemens are aiming to create digital facsimiles, from chips to entire racks, before they're built to test their function before they're built. “What we are hoping for, and the reason why we're partnering so closely together, is so that we could build that Vera Rubin in the future as a digital twin,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said today at the Siemens keynote.

It's absolutely fucking ridiculous to have an 800MB app for this and the reason is just marketing. It's full of stupid videos promoting their stuff. And the account just causes stupid spam. I should have returned the damn thing to be honest.Ps pardon my french but I'm really annoyed about this and in this case it's warranted in my opinion. 800MB is ridiculous.

Due to the absence of (cross-app) shared libraries on at least iOS, developers often end up building big company-internal libraries that then have to be shipped with all of their apps.Tree shaking isn't perfect, and the result are these > 0.5 GB monstrosities.

That doesn't seem right. Localization feels like it should add a few MB. Not over 100. (Plus shouldn't it be compressed, and locally uncompressed the first time a language gets used?)

More like a few dozen kilobytes to a handful of megabytes. If you look in F-Droid you can find some good old apps where graphics are either small or it uses the default styles for buttons and the likeLooking at a tiny utility app I made 6 years ago, it's 9KB, most of which will be the default things the compiler includes

This is Android, but: 13+ years ago I had an HTC Desire. I was really struggling with internal storage space, regularly uninstalling and replacing apps just to be able to update others. Eventually I moved to custom ROMs just because they allowed some apps to be moved to the SD card.I remember the biggest problem was WhatsApp, which was somehow over 7MB while the average was closer to 1MB.On my current phone WhatsApp is 231MB. It's still pretty high up in the rankings, but doesn't stand out, and barely any apps are below that then-huge 7MB.

One of those arbitrary metrics was bundle size, how many megabytes on the app store was the app. The bigger the better and more serious it was.At the time I was knee deep in optimizations, using SVGs, doing compression, even bitshifting, to make apps smaller for the companies I worked for. Reducing how many people would be bounced from downloading or installing the app.And yet, that impressive 12MB app from a venture backed company with hundreds of thousands of users was getting me penalized for taking up so little spaceI literally started putting dummy files in the app bundles and it worked for my professional goals. All kinds of premium marketing has similar fictions in them to convey valueso I can emphasize how its the difference between $50/hr upwork gigs inconsistently, and $500,000/yr at Google

Besides that, there's just a lot of garbage that gets added by various people with different interests. An unoptimized version of the app I'm currently working on has a ~15mb binary, the core app not including all the ""extras"" people have asked for. It has about 75mb of assets, probably 10-15% are unused but I have no idea. The download size is about 400mb.

reply

What are the other 310?

reply

Again, a lot of these companies have also been around so if my app has a ton of bloat from years of work, we're bringing in frameworks from other companies who have been around for years as well and probably have a similar amount of crap in their code. Plus they probably want to track everything we're doing so they're bringing in their own third party libraries. It's kind of ridiculous but that's where we're at.Bigger companies won't have as many third party libraries as they can afford to do it in house but they're still bringing in similar sized libraries to do the same things.

Apple Mail leverages libraries and frameworks already present on the device.Google uses libraries and frameworks very likely already present on say Android, but on iOS they have to ship a gigantic runtime that implements those things the app depends on; this way they only have to write the app once for several supported platforms.I'm just speculating by the way but it sounds like the likely reason.You'll notice Google Docs or sheets are equally gigantic because each also ships a copy of those enormous runtimes.

reply

When you pull in the gmail dependency from the internal monorepo, you are most likely pulling in the entire visual stack for Google meet, chat and spaces, plus the heavy protocol buffer definitions and gRPC libraries that underpin them.Even if you don't use the ""meet"" tab, the binary could be including the video codecs, the real-time transmission logic plus the AR filter assets, because the app is compiled as a ""Super App"" container rather than a modular mail client. I feel it's an organizational artifact as much as a technical one.

Right, I wouldn't be surprised of the app includes its own cryptography instead of relying on platform libraries, and/or contains what amounts to a userspace network stack in the form of QUIC (Cronet).

reply

It would be really hard to believe that somehow Apple has found some magic formula to make their apps 100x smaller than Google and Microsoft.Much more likely is that the reporting by the OS is off somehow (probably most of the app functionality is tied up in shared resources counted towards system files, and not counted towards the app's size).With respect, I would expect more from articles posted on Hacker News. More thorough research, and in fact an answer to the question.

And, snarkily, can they do this for the web page?  On my decent connection right now, loading a new tab to gmail takes about 3 seconds to visibly load.  Another few seconds to get so that I can interact with it.  Is kind of hilarious to see how long it takes to load the compose window if I press ""c"" as soon as I see any of the app has loaded.

reply

It's also taking helper functions and pre-evaluating them putting results inline, and unrolls loops (could be 5-50x increase where they exist?)And it precalculates lookup tables (takes up space) for virtual methods.

I do feel that this bloat is, far and away, the worst offender when it comes to why things feel slower nowadays.  The application just flat out does way more than most people assume it can.  Which means it almost certainly has way more capabilities than it needs for many of us.Would be neat to see a metric on ""how much of the code is never loaded"" in typical use.  Akin to some game medals of ""played more than x% of players.""

Another reason, is rusty code (not Rust. It's a play on the saying ""Code doesn't rust"", which I used to hear, last century).It does, indeed, rust. Actually, ""rots"" is probably more apropos.I'll bet that's the reason that Xcode is such a pig (makes GMail look like an anorexic).Code is created that people no longer understand, so they are loath to make large changes. They just do enough to fix a bug, and pray that they don't need to dig any deeper. One of my first software jobs, was exactly like that.When that happens, the code never shrinks. It just accretes.

Apple, on the other hand, doesn't have to do this. They can integrate at lower levels and even with all else being equal can develop updates with perfect insight on the ecosystem and foresight on things to come.Somewhat supporting this possible explanation is that, similar to Apple on iOS, Google's apps on android are significantly smaller.

Just yesterday, I wanted to generate a GeoTiff on a macbook.  To do it in a simple way, you need libGDAL, a geo-spatial abstraction library that exists since maybe the '90 and supports all thinkable formats. Under Linux, you just install it together with QGIS as a dependency. Mac is still unix, so you may think, a 3-decades old library, with few patches to support modern formats, should be just a couple of megs, right? Brew suggested downloading ~2 GB of ~100 packages!!!! Half of them were aws-* (yes, AWS tools), and 1 GB of LLVM!!! (is it their whole GIT repo with 10M SLOC?)For geotiff, I ended just using standard Tiff library, inserting my 4 geospatial tags with a few lines of code.

* 562mb of Python 3.11 and libraries (of which 240mb goes to the qgis python library, 101mb goes to duckdb, and 50mb to PyQt5)
* 130mb to i18n
* 140mb to `libclntsh.dylib` which I think is the Oracle DB client library?
* 80mb to libduckdb.dylib, separate from the Python version
* 80mb to libQtWebKit

Also, one thing that annoyed me when I used iPhones is that you can't remove an app's cache without reinstalling it and losing all your data. And most modern applications think cache is free so they use a lot of it. Many times it will exceed even your installed apps or data size.

Until Apple penalizes app developers for app size, nothing will happen.  Most consumers are not aware of the impact , until they go to clean up their phone.There isn't much usable free space on the device after the OS, and now having 50+gb of used space from apps, means your own content (photos, music, videos) doesn't fit.There isn't much incentive regardless, since Apple merchandise's iCloud storage. Bloated apps actually drive iCloud sales.  A lose-lose for the consumer.

One reason is those are typically apps which need to be heavily secured. So behind the seemingly ""simple"" user interface and functionalities, there's so much security related code to ensure their ""safety"".More importantly, it's difficult to code without dependencies.

For anything else, where I just need ""small computer running Linux to do a thing over USB or the network"", the Intel mini-PCs are still a better deal.1. They are usually upgradable, either in storage, and/or RAM, WiFi, etc depending on which one you buy.2. They usually have actual M.2 storage without the need for an add-on board.3. More sensible board and port layouts. I despise the Pi B form factor. Easily the worst thing about my Radxa X4 is the slavish ""lets make it Pi B"" form factor, which they didn't even manage to do, so any time I use it it's a port squid mess instead of having everything be neatly managable and I don't get to use any of the Pi B form-factor accessories I have anyways.4. Can run any x86 operating system, and get installed off of a USB. I dual boot my Radxa X4 between Windows and Linux.5. Typically have faster networking and definitely better video/NPU hardware. Intel QSV is excellent.6. Power usage stats that are a rounding error up or down from what a Pi 5 could do.At this point, I'd rather the Pi Foundation really focus on the Pico stuff, I find it far more interesting. The compute modules are also pretty useful when you really want to customize the I/O. As the landscape changed, the full-size Pi B's just seem...left out. Weird boot process, weird form factor, weird Broadcom stuff, weird price/performance ratio, downright hostile power supply choices (5V5A is supported by like two special snowflake supplies, and guess what, the Pi Foundation sells one!), few upsides. Maybe if the mini-PCs prices still increase, and the Pi Foundation can still get away with selling 8GB Pi 5s at $100 or whatever, it'll make more sense.

To give a very concrete and potentially hazardous example: I have an induction range which has no physical controls but has a touch interface which requires various combinations of tapping, holding and sliding fingers. To say nothing of the fact that this is useless for people who have significant visual impairments, how am I supposed to turn it off if there's an electrical fire because a pot boils over or something? Is the expectation that I reach into boiling water that potentially has current running through it and hope to tap my fingers in the right place? Am I supposed to try to yank the power? Or is the expectation that I just walk outside and call the fire department?

Though also I would wonder if bad market research was a problem. I bet if, 10 years ago, you showed someone a traditional VW interface, or a touchscreen thing, they'd go ""oh, cool, touchscreens"". They might feel differently if they actually _used_ the thing, but if you skip that bit of the research... It's fairly common that companies make changes based on what customers _say_ they want, because customers are not necessarily good at realising what they _actually_ want until they experience it.

It has a ""apps"" page, but there's no app store for crying out loud!!!At least the screen is only for radio stuff and a few car monitoring things.  The HVAC is still manual buttons.

It isn't hard to see, tbh. Think about the controls in a Tesla from a few years ago. They had physical controls for drive selection, turn signals, cruise control/TACC, cruise control distances, volume, next and previous track, seat controls, and manual overrides for the automatic wipers. The things that were used a little less were on the touch screen, with automation attempting to mitigate the downsides of this. This largely consisted of climate, manual overrides for the automatic headlights, and things like suspension settings.So, what has VW made better here? Well, they have physical controls for turn signals, drive selection, volume, next and previous track, etc. They appear to use the touch screen for much of the climate control and entertainment settings, including appearing to retain the much maligned touch settings for seat heaters.I'm not convinced that this is better. By contrast, my Nissan has driving settings like lane centering and seat heater controls on physical buttons... right next to my left knee where they are nearly inaccessible while driving.TBH, the whole debate around this needs to be recentered around actual ergonomics and less around touch vs physical.

A big and higher definition screen provides a ton more context from the navigation's map with wider sidebars that can contain more information, while also providing more contrast and better legibility.Usual Android auto screen sizes and resolutions feel to me like the difference between looking at a 32"" monitor and an early 4.5"" LED mobile screen. Too small for context, low definition, and not enough space to display additional useful information (so you don't have to touch the display every 5 seconds).

There were two converging factors: number one is that there was a time where it was considered a sign of sophistication / progress. Definitely a case of form over function, but remember this was the era when everything Tesla did was cool and everyone was chasing them.The second factor is cost. Physical buttons are expensive to design, certify and manufacture (most people don't have a notion of how high the durability bar is for everything that goes into a car interior). Once you have to have a touchscreen anyway you can (theoretically) remove almost all physical controls.

I'm not sure whether this is also true for your induction range. Certainly on generic table lamps and such, the touch-activated buttons are the hobby slop we'd buy from amazon.Anyway, I've never really heard anyone offer performance, likeability, or usability as a reason for touchscreens in cars. Glad to see the industry get rid of them, at the decadeslong speed you'd expect from a dinosaur industry with a regulatory forcefield.

Safety is in fact the big selling point of the device.  The surface doesn't get above food temperature.  If you boil a pot over, move the pot and just wipe it up with a rag, just like you would spilled tea or whatever.That's not to say there aren't human interface issues with relying on capacitive sensors[1], but safety surely isn't one of them.[1] Actually ""boiling over"" is in fact the shortcoming: what happens is that your sauce spills over the controls and causes the sensors to glitch, which the device detects as a failure and shuts down before you can wipe it.  Then you have to reset all the temperatures.

Also the breaker itself is like $130+, plus slightly higher chance to nuisance trip, so fat chance any builder is putting that in voluntarily.

You can live a LONG time without a working ... radio tuning knob, if the other 99.9% of the controls work.  Or if the right passenger door lock button fails, really who cares.  But when the central control of the entire car fails, its scrap.Very profitable for the manufacturer.

I don't want a screen at all, but reversing cameras are now mandatory so that one is probably not going away.I like the ""return to real buttons"" trend but it's less about buttons and more about the appropriate physical controls. Temperature for example should be a dial or slider that moves between two physical end points. If you have to repeatedly push/hold an ""up"" or ""down"" button and look at a display to set the temperature that's suboptimal. Moving a slider or dial where the physical position corresponds to the actual setting is so much better.

I don't use my phone at all while driving so all of the phone buttons could go away in my car.  I hate audio assistants, so that button could go away too.  The dash control switch could be on the dash.. etc etc.  I'm not a UI person and I'm sure some committee fought over every square inch of that space, but just personal preference.

I hope Apple Carplay and Google Android auto can also take over other car control such as volume and climate control. Later someone can build uniform hardware buttons and knobs that I can place on my steering wheel and it can use the phone to control those features.

General cautionary tale: just coz a company is successful, doesn't mean it's doing _everything_ right. Plenty of folks who love their Teslas would prefer a few more buttons (and door handles on the inside, etc) if given the choice. Could say similar things about some choices Apple made.

1. What Tesla did right was put a big screen in the center of the car, and then actually think about the UX, and how to improve the software to avoid having to fiddle every other minute with controls on the screen (e.g. climate control is usually amazing, I rarely touch the temperature). What other companies did was just put the screen and slap on sub-par software without much regard for UX, so of course it sucks, even if you have the big screen.2. Yes, I'd have loved a couple extra buttons, perhaps programmable. My main gripe for instance is/was the air re-circulation (used to live in a country with lots of tunnels), but I'm sure others would have liked some other button. I'd have been very happy to have 3-4 software-programmable buttons for the most used functions.

Both times, the touchscreen-only controls were such a pain in the butt that we vowed we would never purchase such a car. It was a timesaver, because in that period our family has gotten two new (to us) cars, and our experiences with the rental Volkswagons allowed us to exclude an entire manufacturer from consideration.If they haven't re-broken their interiors by the next time we look for a new car, I guess we'll have to consider them again.

The Equinox EV is one of the better EVs to offer AWD out there right now, matching the range of a Model 3 at a decently better price and obviously massively better UI. Slower charging is the only real downside.And a used pre-2020s Bolt is a really excellent value, because they are insanely cheap (under $15k) and due to the whole catching-on-fire thing they all had their batteries replaced in the last few years, which means you get a much newer battery than the mileage/age of the car would suggest. The Bolt is replacing a much older Leaf, so bumping the range up to ~200 miles from ~70 is a huge upgrade for us.

Mine still cold boots/watchdogs every time you start the car in what I suspect a Patriot-style fix of numerous issues. It still has confirmation dialogs over confirmation dialogs (e.g. when selecting CarPlay you get to confirm your choice three times). Voice input is still unusable: the only thing it reliably recognizes is when I tell it to fuck off (and it scolds me for that). Door locks/keyless became more unreliable, which I frankly doubted was even possible. Everything is lagging, especially after cold boot: getting to entering nav destination after you sit in the car takes an eternity.

Next, they need to make the buttons more physically distinguishable, instead of panels of identical buttonsThe dashboards of older pre-1990s cars had a wide variety of buttons, switches, and knobs, all with different locations and feels.

The year 2026 just started, but we're already thinking ahead to 2027—October 1, 2027, to be specific, the date the very long-awaited The Batman Part II is slated to hit theaters. Not a month after Scarlett Johansson signed onto Matt Reeves' sequel opposite Robert Pattinson's Caped Crusader, another Avengers alum, Sebastian Stan, has also reportedly joined the project.

We don't know who Johansson is playing, and the same goes for Stan: Deadline, which broke the news, reports Stan's potential role is unknown at this time. (The InSneider's Jeff Sneider suggests that it could be Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, a villain that's frequently popped up in previous Batman movies—but that's merely speculation at this point.)

Stan, like Johansson, is no stranger to the superhero movie realm thanks to a long stint in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He first played Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier in 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and reprised the role in 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 2016's Captain America: Civil War, 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, 2019's Avengers: Endgame, and last year's Thunderbolts. Plus, he was the co-lead in the 2021 Disney+ limited series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Bucky also had a couple of key cameos along the way (Ant-Man, Black Panther) and is slated to appear in this December's Avengers: Doomsday.

However, Stan isn't just a blockbuster guy; he's had a wildly diverse career, including key roles in I, Tonya, The Martian, and Fresh. He also played Tommy Lee in Hulu's Pam & Tommy biographical series. Most recently, he notched critical acclaim for 2024's A Different Man and The Apprentice, the latter scoring him his first-ever Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump.

Razer is always good for a “wait, what did I just see?” moment at CES, and this year's convention is no different. At CES 2026, Razer showed off a desktop hologram meant to embody its gaming assistant, known as Project Ava.

That's right, Project Ava isn't just an AI chatbot that gawks at your screen and tells you how to play games; it's now a hologram that sits on your desk and tells you how to play games. The whole thing is very Razer, to be honest, right down to the customization options. The avatar inside the hologram chamber can be preselected from a few selections, including “exclusive Razer characters” like Kira, which is the waifu-coded avatar you see here. There's also a male option called Zane, though I don't know what Zane's deal is or if he's anything like Billy Zane.

There are other options, too, which include the green blob that represented Project Ava in its original iteration and also “esports legends,” though I'm not sure which “legends” that includes. I asked Razer if there were plans to let people customize their avatars in the future, and it seems that's something they've considered, but for now, you have to take what Razer gives you.

The addition of a camera on the hologram chamber changes the Project Ava game a little. While Ava was previously confined to just watching what was happening on your screen, Razer's AI can now watch you. The company says that the ability to see your real self opens up new possibilities like… helping you style clothes? Theoretically, it could make Project Ava feel more companion-like, too, and I suppose it could help you check if you have any residual Cheeto dust stuck on your face while you're gaming or something. As you can see, Project Ava hooks into your machine and is powered that way, though I don't know what the exact power demands are.

I got a chance to chat with the hologram Ava a bit, and the experience is as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there. Sometimes it answered my questions while I was playing a Battlefield demo, and sometimes it went off on tangents that had nothing to do with what I was doing. The noise inside the room didn't help, but generally speaking, this is just the way AI chatbot-infused voice assistants are going right now.

The hologram version of Project Ava is apparently running on xAI's Grok model (the one that you can interface with on X), so I'll let you make inferences there on what the experience could potentially be like. Clearly, Razer sees the hologram-ification of Ava as an expansion on what the gaming assistant can do, and is pitching the device as something that can do more general chatbot stuff, like check your email or offer you suggestions on what to eat for dinner.

The wild part is that Razer seems like it actually intends to sell this desktop hologram and is projecting a release date in the second half of 2026. There's no price right now, but if you're itching for a hologram on your desk, then you can put down a $20 refundable deposit.

2026 is already looking to be filled with plenty of crank science. Over the weekend, Joseph Ladapo, Florida's controversial surgeon general, recommended that people start drinking “structured” water—a seemingly fictional form of water that's become popular in the alternative medicine world.

Ladapo made the claim in an X post Saturday, in response to perfectly reasonable advice from the Florida Department of Health to stay hydrated. After first telling people to avoid drinking from plastic bottles if possible, Ladapo stated that “drinking structured water might offer more advantages.” The trouble is, structured water isn't something that really exists, according to actual scientists.

“It surprises me greatly that someone in such an important public position could demonstrate a lack of basic undergraduate knowledge of science,” Timothy Schmidt, head of the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, told Gizmodo.

Avoid the plastic bottles as much as you can, and drinking structured water might offer more advantages… https://t.co/MxsVk7R4MN

— Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD (@FLSurgeonGen) January 3, 2026



Structured water is also sometimes called hexagonal or Exclusion Zone (EZ) water.

It's supposedly a “fourth phase” of water, different from liquid, gaseous (water vapor), or solid (ice) water. The originator of the term, bioengineer Gerald Pollack, has argued that water can sometimes behave differently near very hydrophilic surfaces, or areas filled with things that are chemically attracted to water. This water purportedly has a distinct structure from other kinds of water, hence the name.

Proponents have also claimed that structured water is composed of three hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, or H3O2, as opposed to the chemical formula of typical water, H2O. And it's supposed to have all sorts of added health benefits over classic water, such as improved nutrient absorption, detoxification, and strengthened immunity.

While there could be something to the idea that water can behave weirdly around hydrophilic surfaces, that's about where the science ends, according to Schmidt.

“Structured water is a nebulous idea—at its most fanciful, they suggest a chemical formula that does not exist and is different from that of actual water, while at its most scientifically plausible, it describes unusual properties of water near an interface,” said Schmidt, who has previously written about the implausibility of structured water.

Even if it might be possible for water to shift into a form resembling what proponents call structured water, Schmidt adds, such a change would be incredibly brief and not something that could be mass-produced and sold to people looking to improve their hydration game.

“There is no evidence that water with surface properties can be packaged into a product,” he explained. “Water molecules swap hydrogen atoms with each other after just two milliseconds, and it loses memory of its structure a billion times faster. Any water structure is changed completely after a few trillionths of a second.”

That hasn't stopped people from claiming to have created structured water products marketed to boost your health, and even media outlets have occasionally been fooled by the sales pitch. Schmidt notes the Sydney Morning Herald once published an article in 2022 that credulously repeated the claimed health benefits of structured water with only the barest hint of skepticism (the article seems to have since been pulled down).

To give Ladapo a modicum of credit, it is true that experts generally recommend against reusing plastic water bottles, so his first piece of advice isn't completely off-base. That said, that's more because the bottles can accumulate harmful bacteria over time than because of the plastic itself (microplastics, unlike structured water, are a genuine phenomenon, but their health effects are still being studied).

Of course, this is far from the first time Ladapo has endorsed sketchy notions about health.

During the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, for instance, Ladapo promoted ineffective treatments for the viral illness, such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (numerous studies failed to find any benefit), while also downplaying the harms of the pandemic. And since taking over as the state's surgeon general in September 2021, Ladapo has repeatedly misrepresented the safety of vaccines, particularly the covid-19 shot, and questioned the value of vaccine mandates in general (he once compared mandates to slavery).

Last September, Ladapo stated his intention to remove all of Florida's school vaccine mandates—a plan so controversial that even President Donald Trump expressed his disdain for it. As of last December, the proposal has been scaled back to remove only some vaccines. Ladapo has also pushed for the state to end all water fluoridation, yet another move strongly opposed by actual experts.

Ladapo hawking fictional water might be small beans compared to all of the above. But it's still a disturbing sign that our country's public health is increasingly being led by devoted anti-science zealots.

The first teaser for Avengers: Doomsday heralded the return of Chris Evans' Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and our second checked in on Chris Hemsworth's Thor. And for week three? It's all X-Men, baby.

Well, “all” in the sense that it's about the superteam. The teaser here chooses to focus on three returning actors: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and a tiny tease of Cyclops (James Marsden). We get shots of the Xavier Institute, which looks to be empty of students and staff, and Charles and Erik playing chess like they did in the old movies.

Then, Cyclops yanks off his visor to use a full-force optic blast in the middle of battle. And after that shot of Cyclops? “The X-Men will return…”

The MCU has been flirting with bringing back the OG Fox-Men for a while, starting with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness featuring an Xavier variant and continuing that thread with The Marvels and Deadpool & Wolverine.

With Avengers: Doomsday, one-third of the film's main cast consists of these comeback characters: along with Charles, Erik, and Scott, we'll be seeing older versions of Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Beast (Kelsey Grammer), and Gambit (Channing Tatum). The jury's out on if we'll see other X-actors like Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), or Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), but it certainly could happen.

Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18.

In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), switching to a second TNF inhibitor was associated with a higher 5-year risk of developing immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) than those switching to the biologics ustekinumab or vedolizumab. The risk was consistent across patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease and was further elevated among older patients and those with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

“When loss of response to a first TNFi [TNF inhibitor] necessitates escalation, class switching appears to confer a clinically meaningful 3.9% absolute risk reduction in incident IMID over 5 years,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Aakash Desai, MD, Division of Gastroenterology, Allegheny Health Network in Pittsburgh. It was published online in December 2025, in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.

Specific reasons for changing biologic therapy could not be ascertained from the database, and on ‑ treatment risk windows could not be constructed. The analysis relied on diagnostic codes and may be subject to channeling bias. The dataset lacked serum cytokine and genetic data needed to explore mechanistic correlations.

This study did not receive any specific funding. One author disclosed being a speaker, consultant for, serving on the advisory board of, and/or holding stock options in multiple companies including Eli Lilly and Company, Pentax Medical, and Olympus.

An estimated 230 million women worldwide have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), which involves injury to the external genital organs for nonmedical reasons. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these practices are performed as rites of passage into adulthood, expressions of cultural identity, or means of controlling female sexuality.

The most common form, classified by the WHO as type 1, involves excision of the external part of the clitoris. The next form, which is more invasive and less prevalent, is type 2, which involves the removal of the external clitoral tissue and labia minora, with or without removal of the labia majora. Type 3, known as infibulation, involves narrowing of the vaginal opening by cutting and suturing the labia minora and labia majora, leaving only a small opening for menstrual blood.

Specialists at the 100th National Congress of the Italian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics, held in Bari, Italy, from December 14 to 17, 2025, dedicated a session to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of women in Italy who have undergone FGM. Estimates suggest that more than 88,000 women are affected in Italy, with approximately 16,000 girls considered at risk during visits to their countries of origin.

In Italy, the practice was prohibited under Law No. 7 of 2006, including when the act was performed abroad by an Italian citizen or resident against an Italian citizen or resident. Women from other countries who had undergone FGM or had a well-founded fear of undergoing the practice in their home country were entitled to refugee status in Italy and other EU countries under Directive 2011/95/EU, which was implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree No. 25 of 2008.

An update to the second part of the Guideline on “Physiological Pregnancy,” published by the National Center for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità in Italy, recommends offering screening for FGM at the first health assessment to all women at risk. Clinicians were advised to ask directly whether the woman had undergone genital mutilation.

Women considered at risk included those born in countries where FGM was widespread, those whose mothers came from such countries, and those belonging to communities where FGM is traditionally practiced.

The aim of screening was to enable multidisciplinary counselling, dedicated programs, appropriate follow-up, and psychological support. The guidelines also recommend offering deinfibulation in cases of FGM type 3 and implementing preventive actions to reduce the risk for continuation of the practice within families.

Training in FGM is recommended as a mandatory component of undergraduate curricula and continuing professional development for all professionals working in perinatal care services in Italy.

“Pregnancy is an important opportunity to identify women who had undergone FGM,” said Lorenza Driul, MD, PhD, director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Udine Hospital and professor at the Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy, speaking at the Bari congress.

“Active case finding is essential because many women do not report it unless they are explicitly asked. Some patients do not remember the procedure because it is performed at a very young age. Assessment needed to be conducted by experienced clinicians, as type 1 and some type 2 cases of FGM could be difficult to recognize.”

In Italy, pregnancy is not the only time when women subjected to FGM meet healthcare services. “Colleagues in emergency departments referred women to us when they presented with an emergency condition,” said Luca Bello, MD, adjunct professor at the University of Turin, Turin, Italy, and head of the service for the prevention and treatment of FGM at the local health authority of the City of Turin, Italy, which has been active since 2021.

“Other points of contact included cervical cancer screening, requests for contraceptive counselling, and termination of pregnancy. Many women were accompanied by staff from third-sector workers who run shelters,” said Bello.

Medical staff from the Italian Red Cross working at the migrant hot spot in Lampedusa, Italy, recorded the presence of FGM in the medical records of each woman during the examination. “Between 60% and 70% of women attending assessments were affected,” reported Giuseppe Canzone, MD, director of the Department of Family Health, Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale 6, Palermo, Italy.

The long-term consequences of FGM vary depending on the type of injury. Victims may experience dyspareunia, recurrent genitourinary infections, incontinence, fistulas, urinary dysfunction progressing to renal failure, scar tissue formation, keloids, and adhesions that narrow the vaginal introitus.

“The local health authority clinic in addition to treating these conditions and referring women patients who request for reconstructive surgery,” said Bello. “The service offers pre- and post-initiation counseling, education on personal hygiene, and support throughout childbirth.”

“During pregnancy and childbirth, type 1 and type 2 FGM does not necessarily increase the risk for complications,” said Driul. “In these cases, healthcare professionals need to provide reassurance and psychological support, as the process of childbirth could trigger traumatic memories of the violence she suffered.

In cases of infibulation, or type 3 FGM, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK recommends surgical intervention around the 20th week of pregnancy to restore functional anatomy and allow tissue healing before delivery.”

Women often request deinfibulation only at the onset of labor, reflecting the customary practice in their countries of origin. “In these situations, the role of the cultural mediator is essential, particularly in explaining that in Italy, reinfibulation after birth was prohibited, even when requested,” Driul added.

Reconstructive surgery aims to restore reproductive function and improve body image, sexual function, and quality of life. “In addition to deinfibulating and removing scar tissue, procedures could include reshaping of the labia minora and labia majora and intervention on residual clitoral tissue to partially restore sensitivity,” said Tommaso Simoncini, MD, professor and head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Division at the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine of the University of Pisa in Pisa, Italy.

“The purpose of clitoral mutilation is precisely to deprive women of sexual pleasure. Couples from countries with high prevalence are developing greater awareness and are increasingly approaching us to undertake this type of care.” Simoncini said. “These procedures require specific expertise, which led the Pisa University Hospital in Italy to establish a dedicated Regional Referral Centre in 2024 and is committed to multidisciplinary training in this area.”

Patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) living in Medicaid expansion states showed higher 5-year overall survival than those in nonexpansion states, despite having more adverse tumor features.

The results “support a growing consensus” that Medicaid expansion “improves cancer outcomes through expanded access to care,” including patients with MCC, the authors concluded. “As national discourse continues regarding the future of Medicaid policy,” they added, “these findings provide timely evidence of the oncologic benefit of expanded insurance coverage, particularly for vulnerable, low-income populations.”

The study was led by Yingjoy Li, University of California Irvine School of Medicine, and was published online on December 29 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The study was retrospective and lacked data on recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and treatment timing.

The study did not receive any funding. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Social media influencers are a growing source of medical information, particularly advice on gut health. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that over half of respondents (55%) said they use social media to find health information and advice at least occasionally, and most reported seeing health-related content in the past month. Notably, close to three quarters (72%) of those respondents saw content about weight loss, diet, or nutrition.

“I had one patient who saw a TikTok video about doing a colon cleanse, bought something over the counter to do the cleanse, and ended up in our emergency department,” American Gastroenterological Association spokesperson Shazia Siddique, MD, told Medscape Medical News. 

Another recent social media fad encouraged people to drink beet juice to “eliminate up to 10 lb of waste in your body. That's appealing to many young people whose weight isn't where they want it to be,” Siddique added.

The KFF poll respondents reported being skeptical of the health information and advice they see on social media, with fewer than half saying they find “most” or “some” of the information trustworthy.

Nevertheless, many are following the advice of social media influencers, and the authors of a recent study in The BMJ argued that doing so can cause “psychological, physical, financial, and systemic harm — from inaccurate self-diagnosis and inappropriate treatments to unnecessary spending and higher healthcare costs.” That harm stems from four potential sources of bias in influencer statements: lack of medical expertise or relevant knowledge, industry influence, entrepreneurial interests, and personal beliefs.

Even influencers with health-related credentials can provide misleading advice. The authors of the BMJ study cite Eric Berg, a US chiropractor with 14 million YouTube subscribers who promotes high-dose supplementation while selling his own brand of supplements.

It's easy to find product promotions on social media that could appeal to patients with gastrointestinal problems. For example, a reel on Instagram shows an influencer touting “Naturezempic” for bloating and cravings. The product is positioned as “your natural GLP-1 support.” The influencer said taking it has made her feel “lighter, more in control, and more confident.”

On TikTok, the hashtags #guttok and #guthealth “show endless videos of influencers promising ways you can ‘eliminate bloating!' or ‘heal your gut,'” according to a recent article in The Guardian. Those solutions include olive oil, ginger shots, curcumin/turmeric supplements, prebiotic and probiotic tablets, and kombucha. The article also references a fad from a few years back called the “internal shower drink,” a mixture of water, chia seeds, and lemon juice purported to relieve constipation.

Alex Kresovich, PhD, NORC, of the University of Chicago, Chicago, and colleagues recently investigated high-engagement social media posts for three major drug classes, assessing their alignment with FDA and Federal Trade Commission oversight. “We wanted to quantify exactly how much promotional content is flying under the radar,” Kresovich told Medscape Medical News.

“The sheer scale and the profound lack of balance were striking,” he said. “We analyzed just 740 high-engagement posts, yet they had already amassed over 57.5 million views.

We found that 80.1% of posts with clear marketing elements (like ‘life-changing' language or calls to action) lacked any clear sponsorship disclosure.” Furthermore, less than a third (32.3%) of posts touting a drug's benefits also mentioned potential harms.

Clinicians need to be aware that many patients are entering the exam room “presold on ‘life-changing' drugs based on one-sided content,” Kresovich said. “They have likely seen the benefits hyped without hearing the risks. You will likely have to be the one to re-introduce that ‘fair balance.'”

“Access to social media is so easy, and there's a popular culture around it where people's friends are seeing the same videos, with short, bite-sized pieces of information and lots of anecdotal data,” said Saddique, who is also an assistant professor at Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. “So if one person tried beet juice and said it cleaned out their system, patients see this real-world experience that feels very different than a physician saying, ‘Here is a therapy that I recommend.' A story is a very powerful narrative.”

In a feature linked to the BMJ study, Stephanie Santos Paulo, editorial registrar for The BMJ, highlighted patient influencers who have amassed large followings on social media by sharing personal stories of their conditions that foster a sense of authenticity and emotional connection with followers.

Therefore, clinicians “absolutely have a duty to recognize that patients are getting their health information from other sources,” Saddique said. “When we're listening to them telling us what brought them in, we often ask ‘Have you seen another doctor? Have you tried any other medications?' And that's it.”

Patients often don't say that they saw something on social media and tried that first, for fear of how the doctor might react, Saddique said. “We don't even need to ask explicitly if that's where they got the information. But we do need to ask something like, ‘Have you tried any therapies on your own based on recommendations from friends or elsewhere that worked or didn't work for you?'”

Paulo quoted Liam Robertson, whose Instagram page @livingwithulcerativecolitis has 9300 followers: “I think partly people are finding social media better for answers because it's not easy to get a hold of a medical professional. It's almost like a strategy to [get help],” he said. “I don't feel like they should need that, but we do.”

Clinicians can counteract some of the power of social media influencers by being honest and transparent when patients come in asking questions about symptoms and treatments. For example, Max Brondfield, MD, assistant clinical professor in the Division of Gastroenterology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), sees many patients who ask about digestive enzymes and probiotics, areas in which there are many brands, strains, ingredients and doses.

“We can help first by being transparent,” he told Medscape Medical News. “It's impossible for clinicians to keep up with all the trends and products out there and trying to sound like you know everything doesn't build credibility with patients.”

If Brondfield is familiar with a product, he'll discuss it with the patient. If not, he might look for information on it during the visit. “Often, we're doing telehealth and we can share the screen and look at the product and go over the ingredients,” he said. “I can provide a couple of caveats, but if it seems safe and like a good fit, I can say it seems reasonable to try. This kind of visit can really help patients.” He may also invite patients to share a list of supplements they have questions about, so he can review them offline.

Vivek Rudrapatna, MD, PhD, an inflammatory bowel disease specialist at UCSF, believes the rise of social media medical influencers reflects, at least in part, “some failures of medical science and or of the medical establishment — something that's particularly true in gastroenterology, where there are few diagnostics that can help the physician confidently attribute diagnoses to symptoms.”

“Patients say, ‘I have bloating,' and we'll ask for more information, and then we'll say, well, it could be A, B, or C,” he said. “What we don't say is that it's also possible that we'll do a lot of tests and we still won't know the answer. Medical science hasn't evolved enough to help us know definitively what's causing this.”Taking this approach conveys that the problem is larger than the patient's individual experience, and that going doctor shopping or taking more tests won't solve it, Rudrapatna explained. “We have to be comfortable saying something like, ‘We've done these tests, and because the results are normal, they basically imply you don't have one of the serious conditions we do worry about in many patients like you.' Then we move forward from there to the measures we can take to help them feel better.”

Experts acknowledge that some medical influencers do provide useful health advice. Some may help debunk misinformation or, if they're patients themselves, may offer peer support by sharing personal experiences and creating safe spaces for others to do so.

“I don't think clinicians should feel obligated to have an online presence, which can feel like an extra task,” said Brondfield. “But it can be very valuable to have trusted voices in those spaces. So whether or not clinicians choose to make patient-facing content, it's a good idea to be on those platforms, at least to some degree, to try to be aware of the trends and what's out there. That can be helpful in communicating with our patients and having more familiarity with what they're seeing.”

For those considering becoming influencers, Brondfield recommends searching for and connecting with the medical influencer communities on the major social media platforms. Connecting with them can be as simple as searching on a topic of interest such as colon cleanse or diet tips and seeing what comes up, he said.

“Vetting the sources can be a challenge, but many people include their credentials, and you can find people who are verified by the platform,” he explained. “If you find someone who is talking with people on the platform, you can watch those interactions. Then find others who are giving credible advice with their content and connect with them. That's one of the best ways to learn.”

Medical communities on these platforms, particularly X, are “very supportive and interactive,” he added. “If you see someone whose content you like, you can directly message them and ask how you can get involved. Many are really trying to educate and do a service. They're happy to bring other clinicians into the fold and help show how they do it.”

If you are a clinician influencer or in the process of becoming one, “Be the signal in the noise,” Kresovich added. “Embrace radical transparency. Disclose any and all ties, even if not strictly required. Differentiate yourself by rigorously presenting the risks alongside the benefits [of a product or procedure]. In an environment where 80% of content is opaque and promotional, being the objective, balanced voice is your greatest asset, and much needed.”

Kresovich, Brondfield, and Siddique declared no relevant conflicts of interest. Rudrapatna research is partially funded by grants to UCSF from the following for-profit entities: Janssen, Merck, Genentech, Alnylam, Takeda, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Stryker, and Blueprint Medicines. He reported also being a shareholder in ZebraMD and DataUnite and receiving an honorarium from Natera and Ironwood Pharma.

Morocco is currently hosting the Africa Cup of Nations 2025 (ending on January 18, currently in its round of 16). In 2030, they will co-host FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. And now sources say they could host FIFA Club World Cup 2029. ""According to several reliable sources, Morocco is one of the most credible candidates"", reports RMC Sport.

Nothing has been announced at the moment, but it would follow a pattern: 2025 edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, the first one under the new format, to be held every four years, took place in the United States one year before they co-host FIFA World Cup. If Morocco hosts Club World Cup in 2029, it would serve as a dress rehearsal before the World Cup 2030.

""Behind the scenes, various Moroccan sources are openly acknowledging this strong ambition for the Kingdom"", reports the French outlet, adding that the Kingdom meets the criteria needs for the competition. If works continue as expected, the Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca will be open by then (expected in 2028), with a capacity of 115,000 spectators, making it the largest football stadium in the world.

It would also be a step up compared to the current Africa Cup of Nations, which is held in nine stadiums with 24 teams. The 2025 Club World Cup has hosted in 12 stadiums with 32 teams, and there were rumours that FIFA would increase the number of participant teams in the competition.

Do you think Morocco will host FIFA Club World Cup in 2029?

Oops, something went wrong

Mario Götze will go down in soccer history as the player who scored the winning goal that made Germany the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion. But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.

Companion M, Götze's personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. But the athlete also learned some lessons along the way about vetting opportunities. “I only agree to invest if the startup and its founders check all the boxes,” he told TechCrunch.

The boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25,000 and €50,000 ($29,000-$58,000). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn't one of those areas — at least not directly.

According to Götze, Companion M primarily focuses on B2B SaaS, software infrastructure, and cybersecurity, as well as health and biotech. While that's not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.

In 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn't touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.

With cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant.

Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don't have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote.

Götze isn't doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained.

There is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut's first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.”

This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.

Not coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based Arcee AI and Frankfurt-based Qualifyze. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo.

Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he's also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.

Götze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly discussing an extension. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told Bloomberg. But even then, don't expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.

“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: dwelling on what you missed won't help you score the next goal.

A briefing note to city councillors rounds up the final costs and revenue from Taylor Swift's six-night run at the Rogers Centre.

A briefing note to city councillors rounds up the final costs and revenue from Taylor Swift's six-night run at the Rogers Centre.

Taylor Swift performs during the opening show of the Toronto dates of The Eras Tour in November 2024

The Swift-ematics are in.

To host Taylor Swift's “The Eras Tour” over six shows at the Rogers Centre in November 2024 cost the city more than $4 million, and generated less than $8 million in direct revenue, according to a city hall briefing note sent to councillors last month.

The internal note outlined the costs, benefits and lessons learned from the pop superstar's concerts that could be applied to the 2026 FIFA World Cup this summer.

Swift's concerts cost Toronto $4.2 million in total across city services and agencies.

Its biggest single item was for police — $1.9 million, as previously reported. An additional $680,000 was covered by the Rogers Centre to have paid duty officers inside the venue and The Ritz Carleton for stationing two officers at the hotel every day.

The second-largest cost was the increase in TTC service on buses, streetcars and subway lines. The transit agency spent an extra $1.7 million, but generated $588,000 in additional revenue during the concerts compared to the weeks prior, in keeping with its prediction of $1 million to $1.2 million.

The city's transportation division incurred additional costs of slightly more than $333,000 for traffic management costs, such as sign and camera installations, signal adjustments. It also includes the cost of traffic agents, paid duty officers and the traffic operations centre.

Staffing for the city's emergency management was just over $134,000.

The city's economic development and culture division kept to its $131,000 budget, including $25,000 for marketing. It also included $47,000 for the TO Poets Department, the city's free pre-concert poetry events to promote local artists, and $59,000 to hire a co-ordinator and purchase signs, outside radiators and other supplies to support a volunteers program that helped visitors get around the city.

Meanwhile, Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency in charge of GO trains and buses, incurred approximately $827,800 in “incremental service costs” for increased cleaning, marketing, additional bus and rail trips, standby operators and “enhanced staffing.”

Metrolinx generated approximately $1.2 million in additional revenue from increased ridership on GO Transit and the UPX, according to the note.

While there were approximately 240,000 concert goers, that number more than doubled when accounting for people accompanying them who didn't have tickets but still visited Toronto.

Of the $152 million in direct spending, $141 million came from international visitors, mainly from the U.S., while just $11 million was estimated to come from local Swifties. 

However, the federal and provincial governments collected the most from the tax revenues associated with that spending. Combined they received 80 per cent of the tax revenue generated, with Ottawa directly getting $10.6 million and Queen's Park getting $8.6 million.

The city directly collected $7.1 million — a large portion of which was from the Municipal Accommodation Tax, a local levy applied to the price of short-term accommodations, while the rest was from such city services such as transit fees or parking.

“This analysis underscores the challenges that cities face in fully capturing the financial benefits of hosting major events,” according to the internal note.

“While staging events are quite lucrative to the artists/hosting organizations and other orders of government, associated costs are primarily absorbed by the municipal government.”

The note doesn't outline the federal and provincial governments' expenses. The ministries involved did not respond to the Star in time for publication.

The note also confirmed that the large injection of Swift money was primarily focused on the downtown core, as experts previously told the Star.

The note said that The Eras Tour offered the city “an invaluable opportunity” for Toronto to refine and improve how it prepares for large-scale events — such as the FIFA World Cup.

Some of the main lessons include having “as much lead time as possible” when planning large-scale events and streamlining the number of city departments and agencies involved to “reduce redundancy and issues with staffing and reporting.”

The Eras Tour also underscored the need for a more “robust” emergency management strategies including “detailed contingency plans, efficient communication systems and comprehensive training exercises,” the note said.

While Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz battle Maria Sakkari and Stefanos Tsitsipas for a spot in the final four, the season heats up with Amanda Anisimova and Jessica Pegula making their highly anticipated debuts in Brisbane.

Two compelling United Cup quarterfinals play out Wednesday in Perth as the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz continues its opening stretch, with the United States taking on Greece, followed by unbeaten Switzerland facing Argentina.

Let's break it down:

Taylor Fritz saved a match point Monday against Spain and won a 3-hour, 14-minute match that ended in a tiebreak before Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison sealed the tie in mixed doubles.

Team USA captain Michael Russell was asked how he assessed the dramatic tie.

“The first three hours or the last eight?” he said jokingly. “Look, the team fought so hard like we do. That's why they've done so well here in the past, because everyone is playing for everyone.”

The United States has won two of the three United Cup titles, but the team faces a significant test Wednesday due to a format quirk. As Group A winner, Team USA was meant to play Perth's best runner-up -- Argentina -- but they already met in group play. So instead, the Americans face Greece, the Group E champion.

Play begins with Gauff taking on a resurgent Maria Sakkari. Their head-to-head is 5-5, but Gauff won both meetings last year in Indian Wells and Miami, each in straight sets.

Stefanos Tsitsipas leads Fritz 3-2 in their ATP Head2Head.

Gauff and Harrison clinched both U.S. wins in mixed doubles.

Sakkari and Tsitsipas -- both looking to reestablish themselves near their peak career rankings -- have guided Greece to the quarterfinals for the third time in four years.

“It's great that we know that we're at the same position right now,” Sakkari said. “We're trying to get back to where we were.”

Tsitsipas credited Sakkari for helping reignite his belief.

“Maria was the reason I really believed at first,” he said. “She played the breakthrough first. That reignited a new flame inside of me. … I can't help but be proud that we're both in this together.”

Sakkari is already off to a far brighter start than last season's 20-27 campaign, with strong wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu.

Start Time: 10 a.m. local / 9 p.m. ET

Women's singles: Coco Gauff vs. Maria Sakkari

Men's singles: Taylor Fritz vs. Stefanos Tsitsipas

Mixed doubles: Gauff / Christian Harrison vs. Sakkari / Tsitsipas

A year ago, Belinda Bencic was steadily working back from maternity leave. Today, she's leading Switzerland again.

“We're living in Belinda's world again,” Stan Wawrinka said after Switzerland's win over Italy. “She's showing us why we're here again.”

Bencic is 4–0 across singles and doubles, including the deciding mixed doubles win with Jakub Paul to send Switzerland into the quarterfinals. She opens against Solana Sierra in their first career meeting.

Wawrinka has also been outstanding, producing two long matches including a deciding-set tiebreak win over Arthur Rinderknech. He faces Sebastian Baez.

Argentina's dominant 3-0 win over Spain -- and their 4-2 overall match record -- pushed them through.

Start Time: Not before 5 p.m. local / 4 a.m. ET

Women's singles: Belinda Bencic vs. Solana Sierra

Men's singles: Stan Wawrinka vs. Sebastian Baez

Mixed doubles: Bencic / Wawrinka vs. Maria Lourdes Carle / Guido Andreozzi

Poland, last year's finalist, can clinch the Group F title and a quarterfinal berth against Australia.

World No. 2 Iga Swiatek faces Suzan Lamens at Ken Rosewall Arena.

Swiatek needed two-and-a-half hours to defeat Eva Lys on Monday, improving to 12-2 overall at the United Cup and winning for the 31st time in her past 32 matches against players ranked outside the Top 40.

Lamens, ranked No. 97, pushed Swiatek to three sets at last year's US Open.

Start Time: 10:30 a.m. local / 2:30 a.m. ET

Men's singles: Hubert Hurkacz vs. Tallon Griekspoor

Women's singles: Iga Swiatek vs. Suzan Lamens

Mixed doubles: Swiatek / Hurkacz vs. Demi Schuurs / Griekspoor

Another star-packed day as several headliners make their season debuts: No. 2-seeded Amanda Anisimova, No. 4 Jessica Pegula and No. 6 Mirra Andreeva all take the court. No. 8 Clara Tauson also opens play.

In doubles, Aryna Sabalenka and Paula Badosa return as a team in the quarterfinals.

Film Editor


	Another Marvel Studios mainstay could be heading to DC's Gotham City. Sebastian Stan is in talks to join his Avengers co-star Scarlett Johansson as among the new recruits for The Batman Part II, the DC Studios feature starring Robert Pattinson as the Dark Knight. 


	DC Studios had no comment. 




	Matt Reeves returns to direct the movie, which is aiming to film in May, and co-wrote the script with Mattson Tomlin.


	Stan has had an eclectic career, with credits in movies such as I, Tonya and Donald Trump feature The Apprentice and TV shows such as Pam and Tommy. It's all been anchored by 15 years in the MCU, where he plays Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier. He originated the role in 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, and followed it up with two more Captain America movies, as well as Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, in addition to the TV show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. He most recently appeared in Marvel's Thunderbolts*, and will return for December's Avenger's: Doomsday.

Lionsgate has confirmed a 2026 production start for ‘The Housemaid's Secret,' with Michele Morrone also returning and the 'Euphoria' star to exec produce. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Sydney Sweeney looks set to star in and executive produce The Housemaid's Secret, the sequel from Lionsgate for The Housemaid now in development and with the studio eyeing the Euphoria actress in a starring role.


	The next film in the franchise, based on the second novel in Freida McFadden's trilogy, will also be directed by Paul Feig. Sweeney has already signed on to exec produce the sequel, and while there's no deal yet signed for her to star, Lionsgate is understood to be looking for her to reprise her role as Millie.

	As for Amanda Seyfried, a co-star in The Housemaid, she too has an executive producer credit on the sequel. And her character doesn't appear in McFadden's second book, but the possibility of Seyfried appearing in the sequel is still a possibility, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

	The Hidden Pictures / Pretty Dangerous Pictures production of the sequel follows the box office success of The Housemaid, now in theaters and having earned $75 million domestically and $133 million worldwide with international territories continuing to roll out through January.


	Screenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine, who adapted The Housemaid, will return to adapt the sequel for producers Todd Lieberman, Feig, Laura Fischer, Carly Elter and Alex Young. McFadden will also serve as an executive producer. 

	











	“It's clear from both the global box office and from the outpouring on social media that audiences have responded strongly – and audibly – to the totally unique and truly theatrical experience of The Housemaid and want to know what happens next,” Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement.


	 “We believed in these stories from the very beginning, and we are beyond excited to bring the next chapter of Millie's story to life on-screen in collaboration with our outstanding creative partners Todd, Paul, Laura, Carly, Alex, and Sydney. The Housemaid's Secret is another wildly thrilling book in Freida's series that has captivated readers worldwide, and we look forward to translating it into a similarly rousing and riotous moviegoing experience,” he added.


	Feig added: “It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world fall in love with The Housemaid and the incredible work of our talented cast and crew. We're lucky that Freida McFadden has already extended Millie's journey on the page, and that we get to work with Rebecca Sonnenshine and Lionsgate to bring this next story to audiences.”


	The sequel will be overseen by Lionsgate's Chelsea Kujawa, who also oversaw the first film and brought the project into the studio, alongside Maria Ascanio. Robert Melnik negotiated the deals for Lionsgate.

As long as we've known about him, we've heard that Robin Hood's thing is that he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. This sounds like a net positive. But The Death Of Robin Hood, the upcoming film from A24 which released its first trailer today, has a different take on the legend. “People speak of Robin Hood, tell his stories… they're all lies,” we hear early in the clip. Of course, it's Robin Hood (Hugh Jackman) himself telling us these things, so perhaps he has an ulterior motive. 

“Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last,” reads an official synopsis for the film. “In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.” From the looks of it, at least some of this salvation will come from Robin's relationship with a little girl whom he teaches to use a bow and arrow. This leaves him conflicted, given his new distaste for murder and pillaging, so he later promises to keep her safe. 



The Death Of Robin Hood comes from A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig director and screenwriter Michael Sarnoski. Jackman stars alongside Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe. The film is slated for a 2026 release, though there's no firm theatrical release date as of this writing.

Although Jaeda Lily Miller has been part of the Hallmark family since she was eight years old, the “When Calls the Heart” actress is growing up in front of fans' eyes and coming into her own — much like Allie, the character she's played on the series since 2019. Allie got lots of screen time during the season 13 premiere on January 4, 2026, from her reunion with friends in Hope Valley to her slowly developing romance with Oliver. 

Miller, who's now 19, has stretched herself as an actress over the last couple of years with emotionally raw scenes on the series and by taking on additional movie roles. Her Hallmark colleagues have definitely noticed; some of the series' biggest stars have commented in recent weeks about how proud and impressed they are with Miller's growth, excited to see what she does next. 

Ben Rosenbaum, who has played Mike Hickam on “When Calls The Heart” since 2014, got the chance to see Miller in a totally different light when she appeared in his 2025 holiday movie “The Christmas Cup.” Before the movie's premiere, he told EntertainmentNow how impressed he was with Miller, noting that they got to spend much more time together on that set than when they're filming “When Calls The Heart.”  

“Our characters can go a long time before getting to have scenes together on the show,” he said of Hickam and Allie. “So this was much more concentrated, and I got many days in a row of working with her, and that was super fun.” 

Rosenbaum said Miller was so good playing a different and more vivacious character, Starla, that she “stole some scenes” in the movie. He gushed, “She's so bubbly and fun and funny in this. She really takes a character that felt like it could have been a caricature, and made it feel totally real, like a real person in the world who's just a little bit extra dramatic, a little extra out there.”

While the season premiere of “When Calls The Heart” was airing on January 4, Rosenbaum sang her praises again when he tweeted, “I still can't believe the @jaedalilymiller who plays Allie in WCTH is the very same Jaeda who played Starla in The Christmas Cup. So different! Such a transformation!” 

Rosenbaum added a cute GIF to his tweet, with a clip of comedian Billy Eichner aggressively stating, “You are overflowing with talent and I admire you!” 

In “When Calls the Heart,” longtime Hallmark star Kevin McGarry plays Allie's uncle and adoptive dad, Hope Valley Mountie Nathan Grant. At the Hallmark Christmas Experience in December, Stephanie Long of the “Heart in Motion” podcast captured video of McGarry singing Miller's praises. She shared footage of Miller's early days on the show to reveal her physical growth, contrasted with McGarry praising her personal growth over the years. 

He told the audience, “When Jaeda came on to … our show, seven years ago or whatever? I have seen Jaeda, because I work so closely with her, not only grow up as an actor, but as a person, as well, and bring all these life experiences that she's had to work and play off (of), and I've just seen her become this incredible actress.” 

“You don't get that (while working) on a four-week movie,” McGarry continued, adding that Miller has “an incredible storyline” for season 13, “and I can't wait for all you guys to see it.”

Ironically, Miller's very first Hallmark role was in 2014's “A Cookie Cutter Christmas” starring Erin Krakow, who also plays Elizabeth, the main protagonist of “When Calls The Heart.” Elizabeth spent years as Allie's teacher on the series, and could become Allie's stepmom if Nathan ever gets up the courage to propose to Elizabeth. 

Krakow, who happens to be married to Rosenbaum in real life, was part of the same Hallmark Christmas Experience panel as McGarry, and the “Suspenders Unbuttoned” podcast posted video (above) of her comments about working with Miller. 

“She is just a phenomenal young actor and is such a joy to work with,” she says in the footage. “Her enthusiasm is through the roof.” 

Miller also took on a gritty role in the July 2025 Lifetime movie “Before Your Father Finds Us,” co-starring Hallmark alum Alexa PenaVega. Other Hallmark Christmas movies you might spot Miller in (but looking much younger) include 2017's “Christmas in Evergreen” and 2020's “Christmas in Evergreen: Bells Are Ringing,” as well as 2016's “A Heavenly Christmas” and 2015's “Love Under the Stars.”

Nick Reiner has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder with a special allegation of using a knife in the murder of his parents Rob and Michele Reiner. 

With his arraignment set for Jan. 7, PEOPLE reports that Nick has been taken off suicide watch at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles. Since he's been in prison, Nick has been held in solitary confinement and on safety watch, with a police source telling PEOPLE in December that he is required to wear a blue suicide-prevention smock at all times.  

However, in the new report, PEOPLE says that the suicide-prevention smock has been removed. The outlet adds that according to their Los Angeles County sheriff source, Nick will remain in High Observation Housing (HOH) “unless a judge or a court hearing determines otherwise and will continue to be monitored and housed alone.”

Rob and Michele were found dead inside their Brentwood, Los Angeles, home on Dec. 14, and it was the couple's daughter, Romy, who discovered her father's body and called authorities. Their bodies were returned to the family on Dec. 19 after their passing was ruled a homicide.

When he appeared in court for the first time on December 17, Nick Reiner waived his right to enter a plea, which is why the arraignment was pushed back to January. 

The BBC reported that the only three words he said in court were “yes, your honor,” when asked about his decision not to go with the speedy trial.

Prior to this tragedy, Nick Reiner was diagnosed with schizophrenia, TMZ reports, adding that the medication he was taking was making him “erratic and dangerous.”

“Two sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ … Nick was under the care of a psychiatrist for mental illness,” the outlet added. “We're told in the month before the murders, Nick's behavior had gotten ‘alarming.'”

Nick went on to “received care at a Los Angeles-based rehab facility that specializes in mental illness and substance abuse,” according to TMZ, adding that “3 to 4 weeks before the murders, doctors changed his meds, and he became even more erratic.” While doctors tried to adjust his medication, “it wasn't working.”

“One source told TMZ … once the meds were changed, “Nick was out of his head,” they added. “Our sources also say Nick's substance abuse was worsening the schizophrenia.”

It's a very good time for people who love love — and want to see it on their screens. Hot off the massive success of the Rachel Reid adaptation “Heated Rivalry,” beloved romance author Emily Henry is gearing up for her very first film adaptation to arrive. And are people going to love it? Oh, we think so.

While Henry's first five romance novels are all in various states of adaptation, it's Brett Haley's spin on her second romance novel, “People We Meet on Vacation,” that is first out of the gate. The film version arrives on Netflix this week, with “Lady Jane” breakout Emily Bader and “Plainclothes” star Tom Blyth starring as our star-crossed lovebirds, Poppy and Alex. The film was written by Yulin Kuang, Amos Vernon, and Nunzio Randazzo. (Kuang is also on board to write and direct an adaptation of Henry's “Beach Read.”)

As fans of Henry's work know, her blend of swoony love and spicy romance built around compelling characters has rocketed her to the top of the bestseller lists, and fans are eager to see how that might translate to film success. “People We Meet on Vacation” has sold more than 2 million copies and spent 69 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list, but it's just one of Henry's hits. 

 










This one follows unlikely best friends Poppy and Alex, who first met-sorta-cute in college (shades of “When Harry Met Sally”) and bond intensely during their first road trip together. While the pair couldn't be more mismatched (Poppy is a travel junkie who worries she's a bit too much, Alex is a reserved dude who doesn't want to stray too far from their own hometown), their annual summer vacations together provide both of them with something they can't get elsewhere.

You might see where this is going, but Haley's take on Henry's story ably uses the novel's nonlinear storyline to guide us through every step of Poppy and Alex's ever-changing relationship, including the trip that went so off the rails that they didn't speak for two years and the big! important! sexy! wedding trip that forces them to reunite (and confront some long-held feelings).

Ahead, executive producer Henry talks to IndieWire about the “Heated Rivalry” effect, why romance fans are so voracious (and so deserving of more stories and adaptations), what she personally had to have in Haley's film, why Netflix was the best fit for this one, and what it's like to get to work on adapting her own work with the upcoming “Funny Story” feature. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.
 










IndieWire: I want to start with asking you the question that I've been asking everyone in my life for the last month: Have you been watching “Heated Rivalry”?

Emily Henry: I haven't yet. I haven't yet. I'm seeing all the memes. I'm learning that I should. I'm looking forward to it. Is it all fully aired now?

Are you a binge-watcher by nature?

That's my preference, definitely, because I just don't have a good memory. I can do the weekly, but what I'm really struggling with is the two-part drops.

The two-part drops are really rough.

I haven't watched the new “Stranger Things” yet because I know by the time the second half comes out, I will not [remember what happened], because it happened to me last time. And “Bridgerton” did it. I'm struggling with those. My memory is not good enough. It's probably social media breaking my brain. But also, I hate being spoiled. I kind of hold out until I feel like I can't ignore what's happening around me anymore, and then I usually give in.

Oh, I love spoilers.

Do you really?

“Gravity” was spoiled for me two days before I was going to see it. Someone was like, “Man, can you believe it when she lands back on Earth?” And I was like, “What?”

Wow. My gosh. Let me tell you this: I have not seen “Gravity” because I did not assume that that happened, and now I feel like I can see “Gravity.” Maybe I like spoilers too! [Laughs] I have such a deep, deep, healthy, normal, natural fear of space.

 










I would not go.

This whole story sounds like a dream that I had, but I was at a dinner where they had an astronaut do a toast, and he gave this beautiful, poetic toast. I thought an astronaut was sort of a person who just didn't feel connected. It really kind of rocked my world to realize this man with this poetic soul and this love for humankind was also an astronaut because I've always just felt like, who is going to space? And why?

Well, they often say when they get up there, they look back down—

—and it changes them. Maybe he wasn't poetic and wonderful until he saw the Earth from a great distance. I don't know.

Well, we're happy for him, and we're not going to go!

I'm very happy for him, and I'm not going. I'll die on Earth. Thank you.

Even though you have not yet seen “Heated Rivalry,” you know that people are talking about it. As someone who is a creator and a consumer of romance, when you're seeing things like this breaking through, what excites you about that?

It's really exciting because it's a queer love story. Even with a hetero love story like “People We Meet on Vacation,” there has still been this hesitancy to believe that this can work on a big level, and I don't really know why. For something like “Heated Rivalry” to be something that is a cultural moment that everybody's talking about, everybody is watching, [it] is so significant and is going to open so many doors for other stories that have not been allowed to get made and have not had the funding.

 










I really hope that “People We Meet on Vacation” will do that as well. I hope that people will see that this is a kind of story that people are hungry for. For a long time, not always, but for a long time, romance has not been viewed as meaningful, significant, valuable art unless it is tragic. I love a good tragic love story, to be clear. 

I went to school for creative writing. I was obviously not reading romance in my classes, of course, which is fine. I wasn't really reading about women at all, frankly. The story of art and its acceptance is just, here is what's acceptable and interesting and valuable, and then it's just pushing that wider and wider and wider and wider until everyone and all stories are included and valued.

You know better than anyone what a big, hungry, excited audience there is for these stories.

Voracious. We will read and watch all of it.

I hope that men will feel like they're getting permission to like this kind of story, too. In my real life, I feel like almost everyone that I know really craves romantic love. Not everyone, but most people that I know really crave romantic love the same way that we really crave familial love, and we really crave platonic friend love. We really crave self-love. All of those things are very natural, human things.

 










It's strange to me, because I think you can make a movie about friendship, and it's not going to be put in the same little cordoned-off area as far as who thinks that that isn't silly and embarrassing and escapist. Audiences take stories about male friendship, I would say, more seriously than they take almost any other relationship, which I think is really interesting.

But so many of us crave romantic love. It's so human to long for that. And for a lot of us, it's one of our highest priorities is to have that one person who is with you through everything who you, hopefully in the best-case scenario, get old with. It's not a mystery that people would want this.

It's not some weird, niche thing.

It makes complete sense. It's not a shock.

Pretty much everything that you've written is in some state of being adapted for the screen, but this is the first adaptation that has arrived. What was that timeline?

“Beach Read” was optioned before its release for a deal that didn't end up going through. They extended the option a couple times and tried to get it together, and they were looking at it as a series, and it didn't end up coming to fruition. And then this one was optioned, and then that “Beach Read” option lapsed, and someone else got it. This was the first one with real movement on it.

 










Once Brett signed on, he really wanted this to be the first one. He was like, “I want to be the one to crack this and be the first Emily Henry movie.” For me, if any of them get made, that's great, but I think his passion and determination is part of the reason why we are sitting here on this call right now. He really wanted to get it made, and he wanted to get it made efficiently, quickly, well.

When you get the call that the movie is happening, what was the first thing that you're like, “They've got to do this. This part needs to be included. This specific thing, this scene, this moment”?

I definitely told him from the beginning the balcony scene was the most important moment. I really wanted him to find a way to get the condom scene with her mom in, and he did. It was not actually essential at all. I was like, “I understand that if we need to cut fat, this does not advance the story. However, I really want it in.” And luckily, that made the cut.

It gets in with Molly Shannon, who, of course, is naturally the funniest person on the planet.

If we didn't have that scene, then I don't think we would've even bothered sending [the script] to Molly Shannon. We had to have something good for her to do. And same with Alan Ruck. That scene that they conceived of, I love between him and Alex. I did really want the pregnancy scare in. I remember that. That felt important to me.

 










The big thing really was character. I never wanted it to be oversimplified to the point of she's just “afraid of commitment.” That was kind of my big fear, which would've been fine, but for some reason, that just felt like such an oversimplification. What makes it interesting is why they're afraid of commitment, and that's what makes it feel real. That's what readers connect with, too, is the thing that you're actually afraid of. Because fear of commitment, you're just like, what? Are you afraid you're going to be bored?

I really wanted to get all of the stuff about Poppy being afraid of being too much, because I think the thing that really most of the readers who are diehard fans of each of my books are connecting with is the female lead. I usually go pretty deeply into their psyches. I felt like anyone who's watching this who's already a diehard fan of the book, it's probably because they connect with Poppy, and that probably means that they feel like they're too much or too loud, too weird, too annoying, all of those things. I think it's really important to show someone on that journey, realizing that they're discounting themselves in a way, and their fear is keeping them from deep, intimate love.

Do you picture people when you're writing?

No, it would be really hard if I had just locked onto one actor and then had to adjust that in my mind and accept it. I really can barely picture any of them. I remember having a conversation with Jasmine Guillory, and I was saying, “I don't really picture anybody, but I do know exactly what everybody's kitchens look like.” And she was like, “Me, too.” I've talked to a lot of authors since then who have said, “I know the exact layout of my characters' kitchens.” We know where the fridge is! But it doesn't matter to me what they look like. 

 










It's something that I'm really fascinated by, when somebody can really pull off a love-at-first-sight premise in a book because, as an audience member, it's so hard to glom onto that and experience it. I don't imagine someone being described and it really working or doing anything to me. But the description of attraction, the description of touch, and the way that someone's looking at you, all of those things are interesting and exciting to me and call to mind specific moments. You just want to believe that these two characters are crazy about each other. I don't really need them to look like anything in particular.

What was the first time you actually saw Tom and Emily in character?

The first time I actually saw them was their chemistry read. Brett had met them both separately and loved them both separately. I thought it was promising because, once or twice a year, I usually go into a bookstore and sign stock all day, and I get to spend a lot of time with the booksellers, and they're mostly women in their 20s, and they're lovely and wonderful. And I knew that they all loved Tom Blyth, so when Brett mentioned Tom Blyth, I was like, “I actually am not super-familiar. However, I know that my readership loves him, so that's good.”

With Emily, she had just been in another adaptation, “My Lady Jane,” and my editor had actually emailed me and said, “I know who should be Poppy. It should be Emily Bader.” I trust my editor more than most other people in the world.

 










Then, Brett did this chemistry read between the two of them over Zoom, and he knew instantly, this is who they should be, and this is who I want. He basically called me and was like, “We have our Alex and Poppy.” I was still scared, because ultimately, I don't have any control. It's not my movie. He was like, “I'm going to send you the chemistry read, and I hope you agree.”

I was so nervous to watch it. Of course, it's not ideal circumstances, you're seeing two people in horribly lit rooms on opposite sides of the world, Zooming. But they were so good. They were so good. So quickly, I was so ecstatic. And it was the day that they met, by the way. And then getting to see them act together on set. I did two different set visits, which was really fun. I got to see a little bit of everything. I just couldn't be happier.

I saw you during the wedding scene. What other days were you on set?

I was there the day that they shot the opening and closing scenes. I was there for all the wedding. I was there for most of the wedding stuff. Then I came down to New Orleans for a couple weeks later, and I was there when they shot the dance scene.

Honestly, it's such a blur. When I would go to these set visits, Brett would also just show me a bunch of the dailies from the stuff I had missed. I kind of feel like I got to watch the whole thing get made, even though I was only there a handful of days.

 










It was amazing. It's a weird experience, because you both feel like you're kind of a spare part. I didn't need to be there. I was there for my own fun. And it was really humbling both in that it was, wow, I can't believe this is happening, and this is looking so great, and everybody's so talented.

It was a wild, wild experience. But I will say that none of it really sunk in until getting to sit down and watch with an audience. That was way more surreal. That was just one of the most magical moments of my life was just getting to watch with some of the readers. I feel like I'm going to be thinking about that on my deathbed. It was so special.

I assume that they all loved it.

They at least performed loving it very well. It was a warm room. They were pretty thrilled because Tom and Emily had also stopped by. Everybody was pretty excited.

But, the same way that I was like, “Nobody's going to be a harsher critic than I am,” I feel like the readers are going to be a harder audience than people who are just seeing a movie that don't have any preconceived notions. There was a lot of laughing. They cheered at multiple points in the movie. There were just gasps and shouting. And it was so fun.

 










Why do you think a streamer, Netflix in particular, was the right spot for this?

Well, honestly, Netflix was who wanted it. If somebody had wanted to make it theatrically, that would've been really exciting. But Netflix, they are champions of the romance genre, they have been early adopters of the romance genre, and they understand that that audience wants these stories.

When you have a movie you love on Netflix, you just watch it over and over and over again. And I thought about “To All the Boys I've Loved Before.” I have rewatched it so many times. If people want to restart it the second it's over, they'll be able to. If they want to have watch parties with their book club and their friends, they'll be able to.

What made them the right partner is that they wanted to be partners. I think that readers have this idea that everybody just lines up, actors, studios, everything, and I just point. That would be nice if that's how the world worked. It's not. You have to find someone who's genuinely excited about what you're doing, and that's who you're going to partner with. You don't want to make a movie with someone who does not want to be making the kind of movie that you want to make.

You are adapting “Funny Story” yourself. The way I wrote the question is, “You are adapting ‘Funny Story.' How is that going?”
 










[Laughs] It's going well. I have really liked adapting, because you're taking so much that you can pull from, doing this little Jenga thing. Everything's moving. I have notes on that script that I'm going to be diving back into. We're very close on getting things coming together. I never know what I'm allowed to say, so that's what I can say.

At least from the outside, you are prolific in a way that feels sustainable. You generally have one book a year, and that's easy to rely on as a reader, but what is useful for you in terms of scheduling and creating things?

I think earlier in my career, it did feel extremely sustainable. I'm very happy to get to talk about this movie with you today, but having interviews, that takes time. Needing to travel to do press, that takes time. And it isn't always as sustainable as it was back when nobody really cared what I was saying, and I could just write in my living room all day long.

I think that it has been kind of an adjustment and a growing pain of mine to figure out how to make all of these other pieces of the job all fit together. But ideally, it is I'm waking up, I'm having coffee, I'm playing my New York Times word games, and then I'm just sitting down to write, and I'm writing until either all day or until I have my first phone call of the day. And typically, I do have one or two phone calls a day now just for other various things.

 










In my perfect world, I am just writing all day every day, but that's, luckily, I guess, not what my world is. But I'm very excited that when I finish [promotion of the movie], I can start on “Heated Rivalry.” I am really excited.

“People We Meet on Vacation” starts streaming on Netflix on Friday, January 9.

Universal Music Group has signed the latest in a string of contentious deals between major labels and artificial intelligence companies, this time partnering with the chipmaking tech giant Nvidia. The deal opens Universal's enormous catalog to the world's most valuable company: Nvidia will use its AI infrastructure to develop new ways to make, discover, and engage with music, all while protecting artists and rightsholders, a press release claims.

At the heart of the partnership is Nvidia's large audio-language model Music Flamingo, designed to develop a “human-like understanding of songs” that accounts for “harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context,” Nvidia's research overview notes. The model's way of parsing “emotional narrative and cultural resonance” will enrich the experience of music discovery, the press release adds (though websites staffed by humans, with emotions and cultures of our own, can help with that too). The prospect of song generation is given less attention, but UMG and Nvidia promise to establish an “artist incubator” where real artists, songwriters, and producers will co-design and test AI-powered tools. According to the press release, the incubator will offer “a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs.”

Lucian Grainge, UMG's chair and CEO, said in a statement that Nvidia would protect and respect copyright and human creativity. Richard Kerris, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of media, reiterated Grainge's assertion and added, “We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe—conversational, contextual, and genuinely interactive.”

							By 

	Emily Zemler



Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned Monday night after the holiday break, and host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to recap all of the “crazy stuff” Donald Trump did while the show was away.


	“It would take a nine-part Ken Burns documentary series to cover it all,” Kimmel noted. “But I'm going to do my best to boil it down.”


	Kimmel reminded viewers that Trump hosted the the Kennedy Center Honors, which aired in December to notably low ratings. “After boasting about what a great host he is and how much better he is than I am and how huge his ratings would be, Trump hosted the lowest rated Kennedy Center Honors telecast of all time,” Kimmel said. 


	He added, “I'd hate to be the White House intern who had to tear that headline out of all the papers and eat 'em. You know, as I recall, he said he'd step down if this happened, right? He said, ‘If I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel, then I don't think I should be president.' Hey, a deal is a deal. Back to Mar-a-Lago you go.”

	











	Kimmel then noted that since Jimmy Kimmel Live! left for its break, Trump posted on Truth Social 556 times. “Behold the ramblings of a madman,” he said, displaying all of the social media posts on a video wall behind him. “He was in an especially festive mood on Christmas Eve.” That evening, Trump threatened to “terminate” the broadcast licenses of news networks and late-night shows.

	“This is the vision of sugar plums that are dancing in his head as he goes to sleep,” Kimmel quipped. Trump then posted, “Merry Christmas to all, including the many sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein.” 

	











	“Leave it to Trump to wish Merry Christmas to himself,” Kimmel responded. Trump closed his Christmas Eve post with, “Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.” “What is he trying to tell us?” Kimmel asked. “He's going down? He's taking us with him? I don't know.”


	Elsewhere in his monologue, Kimmel recounted how Trump enlisted Vanilla Ice to perform at his New Year's Eve party for the third time in five years. “Which is a lot of times for a guy with one song,” Kimmel said. “What year were they ringing in? 1991?”

	He added, “President Trump said his New Year's resolution this year is peace on Earth. And that lasted for just under two days. If you were wondering how bad these Epstein files are for Trump, turns out they're invade-Venezuela bad. This is literally the plot of the movie Wag the Dog. The president gets caught in a sex scandal, so he attacks a smaller country to distract us. And here we are, distracted.”


	Kimmel closed his monologue by taking the cognitive test that Trump has repeatedly bragged about acing. “Let's find out just how difficult this big, beautiful test is,” Kimmel said. “And how my brain stacks up against our stable genius president's.” Spoiler alert: Kimmel received a perfect score. “So I could be president,” he confirmed.

	On Sunday night, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was awarded the trophy for Best Talk Show at the Critics Choice Awards. In his acceptance speech, Kimmel joked that he owed the win to his nemesis “Donald Jennifer Trump.” “A FIFA Peace Prize would have been better, but this is nice, too,” Kimmel said. 


	He added, “Most of all, I want to thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump, without whom we would be going home empty-handed tonight. Thank you, Mr. President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day.”

A new paper posits that advanced alien civilizations may communicate through subtle flashes, like fireflies do on Earth. The thought experiment suggests that we need to avoid human biases in our search for extraterrestrial life.

Advanced alien civilizations may communicate via a series of flashing lights, similar to how fireflies do, a new paper hints. This would potentially make extraterrestrials much harder to spot if we continue to rely on our current observation techniques, the researchers argue.

However, while this thought experiment raises interesting questions about alien intelligence, it does not provide any evidence that these signals actually exist.

So far, the quest to uncover alien intelligence has focused on finding evidence of distant human-like civilizations. For example, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute — the world's leading organization dedicated to searching for alien life — spends most of its time searching for radio signals from distant exoplanets or heat given off by technological megastructures, such as the theoretical Dyson sphere.

However, some scientists believe that these searches suffer from an ""anthropocentric bias"" — meaning we're trying to understand nonhuman entities through a distinctly human lens — and do not account for potential civilizations that are wholly different from our own. Due to this bias, we may be overlooking promising signs of life.

In the new study, uploaded Nov. 8 to the preprint server arXiv, researchers proposed a new way that an alien civilization could communicate — by flashing to one another like fireflies. These flashing signals could be used for specific and complex communications. However, the researchers argue that they are more likely being widely broadcast to other civilizations, like a luminous repeating beacon. (This paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but is now under consideration for publication in the journal PNAS.)

 




On Earth, fireflies communicate via a series of regularly repeating flashes caused by internal chemical reactions. These flashes are mainly used to find mates. But while these signals are simple, they do allow distinct firefly species to tell each other apart.

The researchers argue that similar flashing could be used as ""here we are"" signals by an alien civilization. And space is plentiful with repetitive bursts of light.

In the new paper, researchers analyzed the flashes of more than 150 pulsars — rapidly spinning, highly magnetized neutron stars that shoot out regular beams of electromagnetic radiation — as a proxy for what these signals may look like. And while they found no evidence of any artificial signals, they did note some similarities between the pulsars and firefly signals, and proposed ways of being able to detect future firefly-like flashes from other natural objects, like pulsars.

The study team argues that these signals could be more likely to evolve in long-lasting alien civilizations that progress past the need for widespread use of radio waves. A similar progression is already happening on Earth, where the use of communications satellites with more specific and concentrated radio signals is making our planet appear more ""radio quiet"" from afar, the researchers wrote.

And just because we may not naturally think to communicate in this way, it doesn't mean that other civilizations wouldn't, they added.

""Communication is a fundamental feature of life across lineages and manifests in a wonderful diversity of forms and strategies,"" study co-author Estelle Janin, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, recently told Universe Today. ""Taking non-human communication into account is essential if we want to broaden our intuition and understanding about what alien communication could look like, and what a theory of life ought to explain.""

This is just one example of what non-human signals may look like, and the researchers encourage others to think outside of the anthropocentric box to come up with other ways that a non-human-like civilization could communicate.

""Our study is meant as a provoking thought-experiment and an invitation for SETI and animal communication research to engage more directly and to draw more systematically on each other's insights,"" Janin said.

Chrystia Freeland has announced she will resign from her posts in Canada to become an economic advisor to Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky. 

Freeland, a descendant of a Nazi collaborator and a leading figure in Canadian politics, was appointed by Zelensky on Monday. He praised Freeland as “an expert” in economy and finance. 

Confirming the appointment on X, Freeland stated that her contributions to Kiev would be “voluntary” and “unpaid.” 

“I will be stepping aside from my role as the Prime Minister's Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine. In the coming weeks I will also leave my seat in Parliament,” she wrote on Monday. 

One of the most prominent figures in Canadian politics for over a decade, Freeland has held ministerial positions in international trade, foreign affairs, and finance. In September, she resigned as Canada's minister of transport to become Ottawa's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine. 

Freeland, however, has a controversial family history. Archival evidence and research show her maternal grandfather was editor-in-chief of a Ukrainian-language newspaper in occupied Poland and Austria that published Nazi propaganda during World War II. Freeland has long rejected knowledge of these facts, claiming they were Russian disinformation. 

In 2023, Freeland was among the Canadian parliamentarians who gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a former member of the Waffen-SS Galicia Division, during Zelensky's visit to Ottawa. The incident sparked widespread outrage in Canada and abroad, forcing the government to issue an official apology. 

Following Freeland's appointment by Zelensky, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova branded Ukraine “a haven for neo-Nazis.”

Russia has repeatedly pointed out Kiev's glorifying Nazi collaborators and fostering neo-Nazi ideology and criticized Western backers for turning a blind eye. Moscow has cited “denazification” as one of the goals of its military operation in Ukraine.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided readers achieved higher detection rates for congenital heart defects (CHDs) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.974 vs 0.825 for unaided readers. AI assistance reduced interpretation time by 48 seconds per examination while increasing clinician confidence scores from 3.90 to 4.63.

“AI assistance for ultrasound interpretation was associated with an improved detection rate of prenatal ultrasonograms suspicious for CHDs across differing patient BMIs, image quality, and ultrasound manufacturers. In the subgroup analyses related to reader characteristics, there were no significant improvements in AUROCs [area under the receiver operating characteristic curves] by years of reader experience,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Jennifer Lam-Rachlin, MD, Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It was published online in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

According to the authors, the study's limitations include a higher prevalence of abnormal cases (50%) than that in the general population's CHD incidence of about 1%. Additionally, the dataset included fetal echocardiography examinations (35.5%) which may not represent typical images interpreted by clinicians in practice. The high proportion (84.0%) of examinations with superior image quality and missing BMI data for many cases may limit generalizability.

The study was funded by BrightHeart. Lam-Rachlin and Arunamata served as consultants for BrightHeart. Several authors were compensated for ultrasound case reviews by BrightHeart. Malo de Boisredon, Eric Askinazi, Valentin Thorey, and Christophe Gardella declared being employees of BrightHeart; Bertrand Stos and Marilyne Levy were cofounders and shareholders in BrightHeart.

Twice-daily bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide resulted in high sustained viral suppression rates over 48 weeks in patients with HIV infection receiving rifampicin-based treatment for tuberculosis (TB). The regimen was safe and well tolerated, with no discontinuations or drug switches due to adverse events.

“Our findings support the use of this regimen among people with HIV and TB in settings in which the drug is available and opens a pathway for expanded access to this treatment option in Africa and other low-income and middle-income countries where the drug is not yet available, and to be included in the current WHO [World Health Organization] guidelines for the treatment of HIV as an alternate INSTI [integrase strand transfer inhibitors] option,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anushka Naidoo, PhD, Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa. It was published online on December 01, 2025, in The Lancet HIV.

The noncomparative design was not powered to detect differences between study groups. Individuals with CD4 counts < 50 cells/μL and those who did not previously respond to second-line antiretroviral therapy were excluded, potentially limiting generalizability to these groups. Reliance on self-reported dose timing and adherence before pharmacokinetics visits may have affected the accuracy of measured drug concentrations.

This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the South African Medical Research Council. One author reported being an employee of the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences and holding stock in it.

Footy Headlines has leaked the home jersey of the US men's soccer national team for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and its design is classic and innovative.

The design presented by Nike is based on the national flag and on two previous jersey designs of the USMNT.

The jersey features a bold interpretation of the classic American stripes of the national flag. The pattern of the stripes flows across the jersey.

The predominant colors, clearly, are red and white, and they have some details in navy blue on the collar, sleeve cuffs, and the Nike swoosh.

The leaked photo shows the badge of the US women's soccer national team, but the cited portal assures that it is also the design that the USMNT will use at the 2026 World Cup.

According to the Footy Headlines report, this jersey is expected to be announced shortly, as they indicate it will be available for purchase early in 2026.

""The Nike USA 2026 World Cup home jersey will be available from early 2026,"" they wrote in the leak article.

The US Soccer 2026 Home Jersey will be available for purchase in multiple stores, both physical and online, with the most prominent being Nike and Fanatics.

Some things just go together: chocolate and peanut butter, sex and candy, death and chess. Fortunately (or not, depending on your expectations of a Marvel movie), only the latter is the focus of the latest Marvel teaser, which reunites Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto for some threats over the King's Game. 

“Death comes for us all. That's all I know for sure,” says McKellen in a voice-over as chess pieces move over a board telekinetically. “The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' The question is, ‘Who will you be when you close your eyes?'” Careful, fellas—you'll break the Seventh Seal. 



We've known at least since the infamous chair reveal that McKellen and Stewart would return for Avengers: Doomsday, but this is the first visual proof we've had that these two pre-MCU franchise stars are back in the blue void for the next film. James Marsden as Cyclops also gets a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at the end of the clip. He was also confirmed at the chair announcement last March. “I've spent 20 years listening to people say, ‘When are you coming back? When are you coming back? Are you coming back?'” the actor told Vanity Fair last August. “I'm dead. Well, maybe not. I'm going to have a tough time struggling to get into costume if they waited a couple more years… it's been a blast.” 

Avengers: Doomsday is slated for release on December 16, 2026.
