                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's Ring is rolling out a $5,000 solar-powered surveillance trailer for parking lots, construction sites, and events — part of a broader expansion beyond the doorbell and into commercial security. The new Ring Mobile Security Trailer, announced Tuesday morning at CES, is designed to be an alternative to the heavy-duty rigs often seen at industrial sites. It uses a 360-degree camera with 4k resolution, which the company says ensures high-definition visibility without blind spots. Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018, has renewed its focus on security under Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who returned to the tech giant last year after his 2023 departure. Ring's strategy appears to be leveraging its brand recognition in residential security and Amazon's infrastructure — including Amazon Sidewalk connectivity and AWS cloud services — to undercut competitors on price as part of a larger system that bridges home and business security. Set for release this spring, Ring's trailer can run on line power with battery backup or operate fully off-grid via solar panels. It can also be detached and mounted in a truck bed or used as a standalone station, making it adaptable for temporary deployments like festivals. It's part of Ring's new “Jobsite” security portfolio, which also includes a new Ring Elite camera line designed for large-scale business settings like logistics yards and campuses. It provides real-time wildfire alerts directly within the Ring app and allows camera owners to voluntarily share periodic snapshots with first responders. Ring announced that the Sidewalk network itself is expanding globally, launching in Canada and Mexico in the coming months before reaching Europe, Australia, and Japan later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington State Ferries is taking an initial step toward offering public Wi-Fi service at ferry terminals and aboard vessels. The effort is driven by state legislation passed last year directing the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to deploy a Wi-Fi pilot within existing resources and report on viability, costs, and potential free or fee-based models. Washington State Ferries (WSF), which operates under WSDOT, is working through the procurement process for a vendor for the pilot program, according to a spokesperson. WSF estimates that expanding public Wi-Fi across terminals and vessels statewide would likely require a multi-million-dollar capital investment, along with ongoing annual operating and maintenance costs in the seven-figure range. WSF currently provides no public internet service anywhere in its ferry system. The new pilot could determine whether modern networking technology and vendor models change that equation. WSF plans to measure how many passengers actually use Wi-Fi, how much bandwidth they consume, service reliability, and what kind of staffing and vendor support is required to keep the system running. Final costs for a potential broader rollout would depend on factors such as how many terminals and vessels are covered, the level of bandwidth provided, and whether service is free, paid, or a mix of both. The agency flagged several risks, including cybersecurity requirements, potential strain on staff resources, infrastructure limitations on older vessels and terminals, and the challenge of managing passenger expectations for a temporary test program.

More sensible board and port layouts. I despise the Pi B form factor. Easily the worst thing about my Radxa X4 is the slavish "lets make it Pi B" form factor, which they didn't even manage to do, so any time I use it it's a port squid mess instead of having everything be neatly managable and I don't get to use any of the Pi B form-factor accessories I have anyways.4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A spokesperson for Adaptive said the startup is “adjacent” to Adaptive's current strategic focus on immune medicine and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing. “We are proud to have supported their journey to date and look forward to seeing their continued progress in the coming years with this new financing in place,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Digital Biotechnologies works out of Adaptive's headquarters in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Present methods for high-throughput sequencing are not suitable for many clinical applications, as all current NGS platforms lack the combination of high accuracy, rapid turnaround time, and low cost that would lead to robust clinical utility. The startup appears to leverage Adaptive's immune medicine expertise and IP with a dedicated engineering and product organization focused on hardware. Jason Bielas, a longtime professor at the University of Washington and leader at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, is a co-founder of Digital Biotechnologies. The company has a handful of other employees, according to LinkedIn. Adaptive plans to consolidate the company's financial results in its own earnings reports. Chad Robins still leads the company as CEO. Adaptive's stock is up more than 120% over the past 12 months. Adaptive last month entered into two autoimmune-related agreements with Pfizer, including one focused on rheumatoid arthritis that could be worth up to $890 million. The company agreed to terminate a deal with Genentech last year. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant. When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It's the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said. To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C. To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia's Omniverse libraries. The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.

An investigation by Jeff Geerling, which we've independently confirmed, shows that pricing for Pi's is now within just a few cents with a similarly configured board from brands like GMKTec. Hobbyists and homelab builders had a great 2024 / 2025 which saw low prices for their DIY setups. If you've been keeping a close eye on the PC hardware market of late, you'll have noticed prices only going one way: upward. Flash memory costs, along with tariff uncertainties last year, have forced mini PC manufacturers and retailers to raise prices across the board. As Geerling explains, an explosion in homelab builds using $100-150 mini PCs made those same PCs a better, or certainly cheaper, alternative to current-gen Raspberry Pi 5s which when bundled up with NVMe HATs, NVMe drives, cases etc, retailed for over $200 last year. Geerling, who compared the prices of a GMKTec mini PC versus a Raspberry Pi 5 kit in March 2025, found in his updated investigation that the GMKTec machine he considered in his first investigation is now more expensive (albeit by only a few cents). Both systems feature 16GB RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, but given current market conditions, systems like these aren't be sold as cheaply as they were last year. Raspberry Pi 5 16GB (with 512GB SSD, 27W PSU, Bumper Case, and RTC Battery) Our own comparison of rival mini PCs, based on Amazon's current pricing whilst compared with Camelcamelcamel's historical data, shows that this isn't just a brand-specific issue. For instance, the Beelink S13 with the refreshed Intel N150 CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $269, from as low as $168.99 in August 2025. Geekom does offer an N100 mini PC costing $199.99 that hasn't seen a price change on Amazon in the last year, but with only 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. This now leaves prospective homelab builders with three variables to consider: overall cost, power usage, and performance. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Geerling believes that, as a result of these price rises, repurposing old hardware will be the “theme” for this new year, and one that will save you far more money, given the alternatives.

Deposit accounts at most banks pay you less than that, so it's unclear why you'd want gift cards to pay that much. Or how would you calculate income taxes from the interest? Sell a product for $7 but only allow "recharge" in $5 increments. It pretty much guarantees that you will have tons of accounts with random dollar amounts laying around in them, never to be used. Even for regular gift cards, the counter party would be beholden to honoring them at their full value, as they should.Besides, nothing it stopping you from rolling monthly treasuries and using those as a bank. Something people with enough money to exploit this proposed "gift card bank" would almost surely already be aware of.

I would have thought the intention with such regulation as proposed by the original commenter would be that apps specifically stop offering such functionality? If giving/receiving cash wasn't already illegal or socially unacceptable, gift card issuers would have started lobbying for that yesterday.Other than that original use case, many people use them as a form of poorly functional digital cash (since it's not fungible across issuers) that really ought to exist natively in a currency these days.

According to Gallup [1], only 47% of US Americans thought that immigration should decrease in 2020. That number had held more or less steady since at least 2000. This, I believe, is a reflection of how the democrats shifted their rhetoric to be "tough on immigration". And it handed Trump a populace that was primed to be more susceptible than ever to his much more aggressive immigration rhetoric.Of course, this is just a small part of a much bigger picture, but I don't exactly think it helped. For instance, Trump has said "oranges" instead of "origins", said that Hannibal Lector was a late and great person, praised pedophiles...And where's the wall to wall coverage of that like there was when Biden screwed up that debate? How come ABC doesn't even show the public when Trump calls _their own_ reporters piggy and tells them they're incompetent?Not detached from reality, but thanks for the lame, no effort comment.Similarly!

So, while the next president can just undo executive orders made by any previous one, making them a bit ephemeral, they do have direct and real consequences going as far as torture.

The left and right actually agree on a lot at a high-level but do not agree on how to tackle the problem. You can't really talk with these people anyways, they're too far gone Mamdani seems very proud to be a socialist and you get a taste of it where he says "...the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment" and "..we have to continue to elect more socialists and we have to ensure that we are unapologetic about our socialism", etc. I also doubt either channel can define communism or jihad correctly. From an European perspective... him and Bernie are center-left, if not centrist. So if this seems like Mamdani is doing something weird here, I think it's more that the twisted media framing of the left has pushed people to have a vision of it that is dissonant from its real ideology and goals. In the context of US politics, progressive politics have been often labelled "communist" for around 100 years.> According to this same article, the efforts seem to be a continuation of existing work that was happening before he got electedMamdani is not the first progressive politician in NYC > According to this same article, the efforts seem to be a continuation of existing work that was happening before he got electedMamdani is not the first progressive politician in NYC</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is pausing its plans to sell its Ray-Ban Display glasses outside the U.S. due to “unprecedented demand and limited supply,” the company said on Tuesday. “Since launching last fall, we've seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we've decided to pause our planned international expansion.” Unveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.

I suppose part of the problem is that training a model on publicly available C++ isn't going to be great because syntactically broken code gets posted to the web all the time, along with suboptimal solutions. I recall a talk saying that functional languages are better for agents because the code published publicly is formally correct. It's possible Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 are significantly less terrible with C++ than previous models. Those only came out within the past 2 months.They also have significantly more recent knowledge cut-off dates. They also have significantly more recent knowledge cut-off dates.</p>

They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network. While the company didn't specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house. And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app's Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras. Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon's Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company's Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren't in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router. Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. For people who subscribe to Amazon's Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces. The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring. Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Margaret Atwood has spent most of her 86 years writing prolifically across subjects and genres, from speculative fiction to poetry to children's books—often plumbing the depths of her own relationships and experiences to do so. But it's only now that the celebrated writer is putting her own life to paper. In her recently published memoir, Book of Lives, Atwood chronicles everything from her youth in the Canadian wilderness, to her early professional years toiling in relative obscurity, to the various grudges and score settling she's finally able to undertake freely—since the people involved, she notes, are now largely dead. Of course, Atwood long ago ascended from being defined merely as a writer. She has become, particularly since her dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale experienced a timely resurgence during the first Trump administration, something of a sociocultural and political expert, asked to opine on everything from dictatorships to reproductive rights to social media. They're also, as I learned during a lengthy and expansive conversation with Atwood for The Big Interview podcast, still decidedly reassuring: In a 2023 interview with WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs, Atwood said that she was still optimistic about the United States. Despite everything that's happened thus far during Trump 2.0, she tells me her stance hasn't changed. As a Canadian myself, the child of a writer, and someone who doesn't believe in god, interviewing Margaret Atwood is probably as close as I'll get to having a truly religious experience. Atwood was sharp, hilarious, and generous with her time—even leaving her landline phone off the hook when it wouldn't stop ringing—as we talked about the merits of jumping from gig to gig, the ins and outs of political resistance, doomscrolling, and much, much more. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Margaret Atwood, welcome to The Big Interview. MARGARET ATWOOD: Thank you very much. Now, we always start these conversations with some very quick questions, like a warm-up for your brain. Do I get a choice of neither? Unfortunately, I cannot elect “neither” because nobody's called that. But I don't belong to a political party and I usually vote on the basis of what the person is likely to do. What is the best and worst part of literary fame? The best part of literary fame is you don't have to work for a university and you can't get fired. Are you often asked for selfies? In very odd places, such as the ladies' washroom. We're not gonna go there because then I'll get just so many more requests for them. If Gilead took over Canada, which province would rebel first? I thought you would say Quebec or Alberta. I don't know about Alberta. They've had some pretty, um, Gilead signs recently. For those unfamiliar with Albertan politics, I would describe it as the most Texas of the provinces. I think it's another one of those places that's very divided between rural and urban. If you could live for one year inside any book, which book would you live inside? Do we want peace and quiet or excitement? Well, that's up to you, but excitement. So any book that I would like to live inside, well now, what a question … For peace and quiet, Anne of Green Gables. I think we can do that. Yes, it's before World War I, no bad things had happened. No bad 20th-century things had happened yet. I think I would offer up the rumor that was going around in about 1960, 1970, that I dressed up in pre-revolutionary French court dress, including the wig, and prowled the streets of Toronto at night in this getup. Why would you be doing that? I don't know, nor do I know where this rumor came from, but it was a rumor. The only thing I can suspect is that the rumor was supposing I'd been alive since 1780, and was still wearing the same outfit while looking for my prey. Name something humans will still be arguing about in a hundred years. Now, let's go back to the beginning because we are, of course, here on the occasion of you publishing a book all about your 86 years on earth, which I just finished reading over the weekend. You wrote your first story at 6 years old. You say there wasn't much else to do in the Canadian wilderness. I, as a Canadian, am inclined to agree … You have to put “when it's raining.” When it's not raining, there's lots of other things to do. I think what was particularly interesting to me, and what I didn't know about your history, was that you spent very large portions of your childhood in a very remote part outside of Ottawa … So up north in the Canadian boreal forest, either up the Ottawa River on the Quebec side or over in Sault Saint Marie, which is, as you know, at the eastern end of Lake Superior. My dad was a forest entomologist, and those were the months, after the ice went out, until after it froze, until it was freezing up, that's when insects are active and can be studied. Then in the winters we would be in a city where he would write up his research. How did that shape you as an adult? Be prepared to improvise 'cause things break, right? Never throw out a bendy piece of wire. If you wanna get lost in the woods, come with me. My dad, in addition to being a scientist, was also what I call one of the old bushy guys. So one of the old woodsman-type of people that used to be fairly common in Canada, but probably aren't anymore. I mean, you see them on the streets of Toronto. The other piece that surprised me, although it shouldn't have been surprising, was how many years, decades, you spent in what sounded like relative financial precarity. Lots of people, I think now more than ever, jump from gig to gig. Would you rather have hunkered down writing books or was there real value for you, in hindsight, in moving from role to role to role? I think it's very valuable, particularly if you're writing novels, to have some kind of experience of how people actually live when they're not at quote, “creative writing school,” which didn't exist when I was doing those things. I did have a poet, an older known female poet, say to me very early on, in about 1961, “If you want to be a writer, you have to drive a truck.” Good luck with that as a woman. Yeah, good luck with that as a short female in the 1960s. It wasn't possible, but translating that into other things, like other types of jobs, I think that's right. My parents were both big storytellers. My mother told a lot of stories about her family, which was extended and eccentric and from Nova Scotia. It was the norm in those days to have an extended eccentric family if you were from Nova Scotia. She had lots of stories about her youth, which took place before motor cars and television or any of those things, and were pretty interesting and funny. My dad was funny, too, but his stories were about other things. They were usually about horrifying adventures he'd had in the backwoods. I don't think it was so much about the material that they were telling as the fact that they were telling it. Stories don't have to be about dwarves and Cinderellas, they can be about people you've known. I noticed in the book that you refer to your dreams more than once. There are a few very moving passages about your parents dying in particular. It is a very poorly understood field. Scientists don't know why we dream. It is a great medical mystery. How do you think about dreams and dreaming, and what is their significance to you? It is a universally shared human characteristic. And we suspect it also happens among dogs. I have two dogs and they definitely dream. It's an interesting area, and lots of cultures have been very attentive to their dreams. But in general, and you know this yourself, you have dreams that are just kind of taking out the trash and little bits of this and that, and other ones that appear to you to be quite significant. So why do those ones appear to be quite significant? Because they connect with something that's going on in your life. If you have a problem, let's say it's a creative problem, let's say it's a scientific problem, and you go to sleep, you often have the answer when you wake up because your brain has been working away at it. So going to sleep or going for a walk are often helpful when you're waiting for answers to come out of left field. Do you write your dreams down? I have done, I've written some of them down, and people have said also that if you keep a dream journal, you're likely to remember them better in the morning. I thought to myself, “She either wrote that down or she has a really frighteningly good long-term memory.” I have a frighteningly good long-term memory. My brother said after reading my memoir—he's a man of very few words—he said, “You seem to have an unusually detailed memory.” I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning. I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning, but you remember things of significance, not just what you did yesterday morning. Not what you had for breakfast. You have had a remarkable career, and in many respects, an unlikely one. As we've talked about already, it's not easy to make even a basic living as a writer. Well, a lot of things would be different, but it's a meaningless question because I would be quite a different person at 20. But when you look at young writers … First of all, in Canada anyway, when I was 20, there was not very much competition. There were a lot of lunatics in the bohemian underground writing community at that time. These were not the most able of people. I was quite abnormal amongst them. I wasn't a drug addict, and I didn't want to commit suicide. So what business have you got being a writer? So now it's been more professionalized, I think, through lots of advice, seminars, and creative writing schools and people saying, “Here's what you have to do and this is how it works.” We didn't have a clue. I didn't know what an agent was. I had no idea what should be in a book contract or any of those things. So more people think they're gonna go into it, right? They get a certain amount of flim-flam shoved their way. And that doesn't happen very often. Or, let's put it another way. We were in Ireland at a bed and breakfast and we had a very good breakfast and we said to the man, “This is a really good breakfast.” He said, “I used to be a chef.” And we said, “Oh, where were you a chef?” He named the restaurant. And we said, “Oh, what a coincidence. We had dinner there last night.” Pause. “Anyone can cook a good dinner once.” Whereas with a lawyer, you're usually bound to get some kind of a job. Yes, as my dad reminded me many times. There's a lot of luck involved, and also a lot of persistence because you have to keep doing it. Have a patron, and that includes the Pope, the Canada Council, and everything in between. Have a job that is not related to writing, a job in the other world. So that means selling your books and living off the proceeds. Very few writers can do that in North America. Did you ever seriously contemplate moving to the United States earlier in your career? Not that I would get hired by Harvard because Harvard didn't hire women in the English department at that time, but I got a letter from the Canadian government and it said, “We certainly hope you'll come back to Canada because we really need you.” That's a nice letter to get. I wonder how many people get letters like that now. You're the first I've ever heard of. So situated generationally, born in 1939, wartime baby, low birth rate, following the Depression, low birth rate, followed by the post-war baby boom. People could see this wave of babies washing towards them and they knew they didn't have enough people to fill the jobs to service those babies. So people of my generation were in demand. It wasn't a question of whether we would have a job, it was a question of what kind of job we would have. So did the letter do it? Certainly inclined me in that direction, plus the fact that my student visa was gonna run out. I ask because for me growing up in Canada, the prevailing wisdom was, Well, if you wanna go big, you go to the United States. I want to ask you about The Handmaid's Tale. Your name at this point is practically synonymous with prescient, whether you like that or not. One aspect I'm curious about, though, is technology in the book. Technology was not a key part of it, right? The Eyes are actual human beings. People are punished in these antiquated ways. There is no mass surveillance apparatus the way there is in the United States today. Even in 1985 when you were writing it, certainly there was a degree of government surveillance … Yeah, but you'd have to get into somebody's apartment and rig them up, and bug it. You would've had to bug it. I think it segues OK today because those women would not be allowed access to those things anyway. As for a dark car driving by, you don't know what's in it. Was that a concerted decision in writing the book, or was it simply a matter of writing in a way that reflected your context? We had credit cards, and that certainly makes it into the book because what better way to make women go back into the home than cut off their jobs and credit cards? Which is what's happening now in the United States. There's actually a movement afoot to make it impossible for women to have credit cards in their own names. That law was not changed until 1974. Obviously the piece around reproductive rights and reproductive freedom is incredibly salient today and has been, unfortunately, for several years. When you were writing the book in the eighties, did you sense a backlash to a woman's right to choose? I think there is a backlash against women's rights in general, beginning with the election of Ronald Reagan and the rise of the so-called religious right as a political force in the United States. And I did keep a scrapbook of what people were saying. Yeah, just at the edge of newspaper clippings. So they were saying that women belong in the home and they were certainly pushing back against a woman's right to choose. The ‘70s had been pretty game-changing for women in North America. So there was a reaction to that in the ‘80s. That's one of the reasons I wrote the book, because what people say they would like to do if they got power, because I think they will actually do it. Some people say, “It's just words. Then I think, how would you go about it on a practical level? How would you get them back into a male-dominated, controlled space? It's what people have done over time. What was so interesting to us, among other things that WIRED is covering in this most recent federal election, was that the playbook had been written. You could go see what they were going to do. He just says these crazy things. You can read what they're gonna do. I guess they've never read it. Which part of it do you believe literally? Are we going to follow the lifestyles of some of the people in it, because they're pretty severe and weird. I ask because it feels like, at least to me, and I think to a lot of us sitting here, the con there is so much concern and conversation around young men online. It has, I think, eclipsed so many conversations around gender recently. It feels like women are increasingly excluded from those conversations. We're spending a lot of time wondering what to do about the plight of the man when there's a lot that we could be talking about on both sides. I'm wondering what you make of that, or where you think that comes from. But you're wondering why people are talking about it. Well, they didn't for quite a long time. In fact, they pretty much ignored it. You could see where it was going because here came all of these young men who were told they were bad and nobody wanted to listen to them anymore. That shows up in statistics, how many women are succeeding at university and how many men are dropping out. Because obviously they don't feel welcome. They don't get a lot of, “Hey, you're great.” They get a lot of “shut up” and “we don't wanna hear your opinions.” There used to be organizations that they joined. They joined the Boy Scouts before it got such a bad rep. There was some direction for that sort of energy. What can a male young person do to feel valued by society and not like a total failure? Well, yes, they can participate in Jordan Peterson discussion groups. But that's not a very stable platform. But if society is not taking the voices of young men seriously and we are increasingly suppressing the voices and the success of women, I would argue… Whose voices do you think are being taken seriously? But every time Elon Musk opens his mouth, people take that seriously. So I would say tech bro billionaires are taken seriously. Are we gonna count, quote, “influencers”? I think a lot of podcasters have pretty devoted followings. I think you just nailed it, though, and I'm actually working through this while we talk. But it is a fractured ecosystem. So we are all looking to a different source of truth. So I think anytime you introduce a new communications technology, you're gonna get a lot of disruption. Let me just mention the Gutenberg press followed by 300 years of sectarian religious warfare. When WIRED's Kate Knibbs interviewed you a few years ago, you said “I am not counting the United States out.” You know, everybody wants a little bit of hope. Well, first of all, Canadians shouldn't be mad at Americans. Well, you tell that to my dad's wife. All Americans didn't do this. Well, she's not mad at me. There are just many people in my life in Canada who don't want to come to the United States anymore. Yeah, especially with this new thing that you have to bring five years of social media information… That's not the same as being mad at all American people, which is just stupid. I have actually been surprised in the last year at how little resistance, relatively speaking, we are seeing in the United States. You know, employees at the big tech companies that we cover at WIRED, they have essentially been silenced. They don't wanna be fired. They don't wanna be fired. Everyday Americans are protesting here and there. We've seen some really substantial protests at times, but what would a revolutionary moment in this country look like? First of all, the resistance is visible in the polls, which I'm sure you're tracking. So if you're afraid of getting fired and don't want the death threats and all the rest of it because you spoke out in public, you can express your opinion at the ballot box and in an anonymous poll. But again, you have to understand that ordinary people are not billionaires and they have jobs. A truly revolutionary moment would be like the French Revolution over a span of two or three years, which started out, as all these things do, they all start out as utopian visions. Things are gonna be so much better if only we … fill in the blank. Then you end up with Stalin. So, I'm not sure you really want that kind of revolution, which usually says tear it all down. So I'm not sure that you really want the terror. For my family, for myself, what I want is for people to show up at the midterms and then show up in 2028 and for there to be a peaceful transition of power. Well, I think that's quite likely to happen right now, as to the midterms, because the economic policies that we have been seeing have not been successful. That's where it hits people: in the pocket book. If you look at revolutions through the ages, they usually start by being about money. I've thought for a little while that things were getting way too top heavy in that country and dangerously close to 1792. Well, one challenge here is that the midterms don't solve for the grotesque wealth disparities that we now see in the United States. I want to ask you, speaking of power, and the consolidation of power in Big Tech, about artificial intelligence. That is a subject about which I know very little, except that it's a crap poet and a pretty bad imitator of me. You wrote for The Atlantic, “What concerns me is the idea that an author's voice and mind are replicable.” I mean, that is one of many concerns about artificial intelligence. When you read about this, when you read about AI art or AI in writing, where do you sit on the notion that AI can be a useful and productive tool in the creation of works of art? It's like absolutely every other human tool that we have ever come up with, including fire and language. Name one, and that is what you will see. No, probably because I don't know how. Do you give a shit about learning at this point? I mean, the thing is, anytime you sign on to any of those things, they're getting a lot of data on you. They're gonna bombard you with crap. So my problem at the moment is not adding another one is getting rid of some of the ones that I have. How much time do you spend online? What is your relationship to the internet? People like me spend, you know, most of our waking hours online. So you're not spending all of your life online? Well, my job exists on the internet. Well, I'm not different in that respect. I also use my phone to keep in touch with people, usually with text messages. I do a lot of doomscrolling. I want to keep up with the latest doom. My husband will be up till two in the morning looking at horrible headlines. What you should tell him is “go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, it will be the same.” You don't have to do it at night. I'm putting quote marks around “invented,” because it's quite a stupid story. I would love to hear the story. So the story is this: Back in the early 2000s, I was looking at the publishing sector and I was seeing a couple of things. One was that publishers only ever sent authors on tours to cities that reported to the New York Times lists. They just never got any author visits, and a lot of authors were being excluded because their publishers were making the determination that it wasn't worth their investment to send them to these other cities. So a lot of people just weren't being given tools for promoting their own books. So what we invented at first was supposed to be a service to the book business. What it was, and here's when I put quotation marks around it, I thought that the FedEx person who was coming with the package that you signed for, I thought the signature was flying through the air and turning into ink somewhere else, but it wasn't. So I said “Oh goody, we can sign books with this.” Actually no, you can't. So I asked some of my more tech-savvy, and I have to say younger, friends. The closest thing was long-distance surgery. So nobody had invented anything that could scribble and you wouldn't wanna scribble on a body with a knife anyway, I don't think. Most of us would not, no. So we set about inventing this thing. It was going to be a remote book-signing technology. This is before any of the stuff that we currently use for it existed. So we were putting together bits that did exist, like video cams, and there was only one signing tablet that you could get at that time. We were sticking them all together. Then we needed to make something that would accommodate a book on the other end. The idea was that people could give interviews in remote places and then sign the person's book. It took some bizarre twists and turns along the way. I think one of our models involved something that looked like an LP disc with a little pen in the bottom. So it broke off and flew across the room. Not cutting off anybody's head, but it might have. So with all of these things, you have to have something that's accurate that can be made inexpensive enough so people can actually use it. And is attractive enough some people will wish to use it and that they can see a use for it. But I said to one of my board members, “Frank, what else do you think this might be good for?” And he said, “Everything.” You can go onto the internet and look up Syngrafii, or you can look up iinked and you can see that we are now in the super secure absolutely accurate, long distance, digital and ink signature business. Are you still actively in that business? The interesting thing is, because book collectors when we were first doing it were so extremely picky about it being absolutely accurate, one of them said, “I want the skin flakes on the paper.” They weren't gonna accept signatures that weren't the real person's signature. So what we invented is something that will replicate any marks you make, and you can now do it on your phone. There weren't any phones when we started. You can do it on your computer screen. And our physical version that we started with, that we thought would become obsolete, it's now having an increased demand because people are becoming more distrustful of digital. Talking to young people, they're into vinyl LPs and things like that. These new phones that you can't do anything smart on. How revolutionary, “Hey, this is a phone that doesn't do anything. I know we only have a few minutes left, and I want to ask you about the book. I don't want to give anything away, but I finished it, and—I'm gonna be very honest with you here—I left wondering whether you would ever publish anything again. I also ended the book feeling like you are, if I may say this, thinking about your own death. Oh, I think about my own death all the time, don't you? I do, but it reads as maybe more imminent than how I think about death. Well, no, let's not plan on that. [But] not in the far distant future. Do you plan to keep writing? You don't plan to keep writing. But you actually don't control whether any of your fantastically brilliant ideas is going to turn into a book. You have to discover that through the process of doing it. You don't care at all. No, because I'm not gonna be here. Also, looking at the lives of writers, usually they die, then there's a little flurry of interest in their work, then they go down, and then there might be a revival, but it usually follows the same trajectory. And it is generational, so you know “Oh, my mom read that. So it usually does that thing of going down and then if you're lucky it comes up again. But it's not gonna be your luck, it's gonna be your estate's luck. To me, I think something I've always appreciated about writing and about books is there is a permanence to that. Maybe a more fleeting permanence than I'm willing to admit, or want to admit. By which you mean maybe it sticks … By which I mean there were a lot more Greek classical plays than we have, and we know about them, they existed, but we don't have any copies anymore. So ultimately it's too much to worry about, and what do we care when we're dead? What would I do about it? I can't control the future, contrary to popular opinion. So it's one of those things of why worry because you can't do anything about it anyway. The short game I'm going to politely request you to play is called Control, Alt, Delete. So, what piece of technology would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change? So the first one is, what one would I like to be able to control? Well, I would do nothing with them, but I would be in control of that nothing. I would be in control of whether anything got done with them or not. So if they're all under my control, the world would be safe from them. What would you wanna change? What would I want to change? I think I would like to change the very nasty turn that social media took after that initial period when it was fun. Because it was fun at first. And now it's not so much fun. So I think parts of it are still fun, but you have to really limit what you're accessing, because the rest of it is not fun at all. Do I get a large swath of it? It's so tempting and it's so beset with traps: There was a golden age and we could go back to that if only we got rid of name-your-thing-to-get-rid-of. So, I'd really probably have to think about that. But let's say we should start with the problems besetting humanity and dial back from there. So then it would be the automobile. Because we have a problem with oil addiction, as you know. We also have a problem with urban expansion beyond the ability to make those bases interesting, vibrant, and safe. What allows those spaces to be so big is rapid transportation. But then we would be stuck with a lot of horses and then we have a horse poop problem. You don't get to choose. Well, it probably takes us into the age of steampunk to a certain extent.

Tied to a March 1 retail launch, the Smart Brick debuts in three Star Wars sets, with pre-orders opening January 9. Under the plastic, Lego has built what is effectively a mixed-signal embedded system. Power comes from an internal rechargeable battery that charges inductively, designed so the brick can be topped up even when buried inside a build. Interestingly, Lego says that the brick understands its surroundings. Instead of cameras or optical tracking, Lego is using near-field magnetic sensing. ‘Smart Tags' embedded in tiles and minifigures carry unique IDs that the brick reads through copper coils. Those same coils enable relative positioning, letting multiple bricks detect distance and orientation to one another. Lego calls the resulting wireless mesh BrickNet, a low-latency network that allows two models to recognize when they are facing off or interacting without an intermediary. Rather than storing large sound files, Lego says the Smart Brick generates effects in real time, based on prompts from SMART Minifigures and Tags, thereby keeping memory requirements low and avoiding the need for constant updates just to add new clips. “By breaking down just a few sounds to their most basic principles, you can actually carefully adjust their frequencies and amplitude to create drastically different end results,” a deep divereads. For launch, the Smart Brick appears in three all-in-one Star Wars sets ranging from 473 to 962 pieces, priced between $70 and $160 — expensive, no doubt, even for Lego. The radio link is encrypted, and firmware updates are handled through a companion app rather than an always-on connection. This isn't the first time that Lego has added electronics to a toy, but Smart Brick does represent a first in terms of how compact and self-sufficient this implementation is. It's essentially a computer designed to disappear into the plastic, doing just enough sensing and processing to make a model feel reactive without the need to drag a tablet into the room.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hyundai is not claiming that robots will take over the world, or save mankind, but on Monday at CES it may have just cracked a load-bearing pillar of investor confidence in Elon Musk and Tesla. Over the last three years, Hyundai sold roughly 7 million cars per year globally, while Tesla hovered around 1.8 million sales per year over that same period. Specifically, that narrative stems in part from Elon Musk's promise of a self-driving car future in which, he claims, Tesla will crush Waymo. But perhaps more importantly, it comes from Musk's claim that his Optimus line of robots is so powerful, they might end poverty, become the “biggest product of all time,” and generate “infinite” revenue. Boston Dynamics absolutely wrote the book on present-day robots. So with that in mind, watch the head of the Atlas program at Boston Dynamics, Zachary Jackowski, hype his robot, and keep in mind that he knows his competitor is Elon Musk: He claims that while that thing moving around is just a research prototype, his company has been “hard at work on making the actual product version of Atlas,” and that it's going to be “the best and actually simplest robot that we have ever built.” It's going to be, he claims, water resistant, and able to endure temperatures as cold as minus 4 and as hot as 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Jackowski claims Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are putting together, the “most complete dataset in the world to train humanoid skills in manufacturing,” and that the car side of the company will soon be both using and manufacturing these things in “a new robotics factory capable of producing 30,000 Atlas robots a year.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk will only get the complete version of his famous trillion-dollar pay package if he deploys 1 million Optimus robots, so it's pretty clear what's motivating him. But Musk's claims about applications for his robots keep expanding. In November of last year he compared Optimus robots to having a “personal C-3PO/R2-D2.” If you're reading this, Tesla probably doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, but Hyundai shouldn't either. When it comes to creating armies of robots with the potential to crush labor power and generate “infinite” revenue, the question is not whether you should root for a company like Tesla or one like Hyundai. It's which company's outlandish narrative do you find more plausible? Whether this stair-climbing—and cleaning!—robot is the first true whole-home robot vacuum remains to be seen. And we looked into how Tesla compares to its competition. Elon Musk is making wackier promises than Very Serious People seem to realize.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It felt great on the fingertips thanks to its mechanical keyboard with Cherry Ultra switches. It looked the part—like it had fallen off a UFO fuselage and was glowing with vibrant otherworldly energy through its bottom panel glass window. Its extraterrestrial design was unfortunately hampered by a dull IPS LCD screen. Dell's gaming brand may have come back to make amends. This display will claim a 0.2ms response time and 120% DCI-P3 color gamut, typical of organic light-emitting diode screens. The new gaming laptop promises HDR True Black 500 certification as well as a peak of 620 nits of brightness in HDR. If you're not already aware, OLED displays offer far better contrast and black levels than other LCD-based screens. There are more modern, updated OLED screens coming to CES 2026, which promote better brightness overall. Take the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i as an example of ultra-bright shiny displays that will reflect practically everything when not playing in a dim interior. The tradeoff with most anti-glare screens is a less vibrant picture. Indeed, every Alienware laptop is getting an OLED option. This includes the 16X Aurora, which will also pack a similar 240Hz panel. There likely won't be any 18-inch OLED version, unfortunately. Alienware told Gizmodo that there aren't enough 18-inch OLED panels available to make the laptop cost-effective. Dell has previously told Gizmodo that it will take “targeted pricing action when necessary” due to the spiking cost of memory. Already, the company has increased prices for corporate clients, according to a report from Business Insider. AI data centers are demanding so much high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that the semiconductor makers who are responsible for today's consumer-level RAM are shifting their focus—causing a massive shortage in memory across RAM and storage options. Which is why consumers may be more enticed by the cheaper options. Dell's gaming brand may also have an “entry level” as well as an “ultra-slim gaming laptop” that's only around 17mm thick. I saw it in person, though Alienware was adamant I didn't take any photos of the laptop in its pre-production, relatively simplistic body. That new form factor will come in 14- and 16-inch sizes and will still support an Nvidia GPU as well as “next-gen” Intel CPUs, which could be one of the new Panther Lake variations. No matter what, expect that laptops will cost more, but for now we can think about what may come in the future. Gizmodo is on the ground in Las Vegas all week bringing you everything you need to know about the tech unveiled at CES 2026. Qualcomm demoed its Flex SoC that controls driver assistance and safety features at the same time as in-car entertainment in cars. The Spatial Multi-Sensor FP400 takes mmWave presence sensing a step further. Whether this stair-climbing—and cleaning!—robot is the first true whole-home robot vacuum remains to be seen.</p>

Mechanical keyboard maker Keychron is going all in on wireless with its new Q Ultra series — which will have ZMK (rather than QMK) firmware — launched Monday at CES 2026. The Q Ultra series will be, according to Keychron, the "first mass-produced ZMK mechanical keyboard series of its kind, offering up to 660 hours of battery life in 8K polling rate in wireless mode." Yes, you read that correctly — 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate, thanks to the ZMK firmware. ZMK is, like QMK, open source — but it uses a different license (the MIT license), and is developed with wireless keyboards in mind (QMK doesn't natively support any wireless microcontrollers; QMK-based wireless keyboards like Keychron's Q1 HE or the Wobkey Rainy 75 Pro use dual- or hybrid microcontrollers, and still need to be wired for configuration). Anyway, all this to say that ZMK is (much) more power-efficient than QMK, as evidenced by the fact that Keychron's upcoming Q Series will have 660-hour, 8K polling rate battery life. The Q Series will also feature Keychron's new Silk POM switches, which the company says is made from a new material that "delivers a richer sound and improved typing feel favored by typing enthusiasts." You'll be able to get that ultra-high 8K polling rate over both the wireless and wired connections. Keychron is also updating its V Series with new V Ultra models, which have the same improvements seen in the Q Ultra series — up to 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate thanks to the ZMK firmware, updated switches to Keychron's Silk POM switches, as well as a new 1MB Flash microcontroller. Finally, Keychron also announced a few fancy special edition luxury keyboards that are (literally) rock-solid. The Q1 HE 8K Marble Version will launch in April 2026, and will feature an 8K polling rate and Hall Effect magnetic switches (also a 75-percent layout), and will be made out of marble (only the case, it seems — looks like the keycaps are still going to be double-shot PBT). No word on pricing for these, but I'm sure they will not be cheap. Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And an upcoming change announced Monday at CES will bring image and video generation via Google Gemini's Nano Banana text-to-image model family to your TV. Like anything announced at CES, the implied promise is that people will want to use this, and the suite of features being described here is, I have to admit, intriguing. There are some AI assistant features mentioned in this announcement, but since the advantage Google TV has over most smart TV operating systems is that it's connected to your Google account, the most interesting new change is that Gemini will be able to search your library on Google Photos, and apply the Nano Banana features you may have already futzed around with on your smartphone, but from the comfort of your couch this time. This next ability is listed separately in Google's press release, even though it sounds a bit like the first: “Use Nano Banana and Veo to reimagine your personal photos or create original media directly on your TV.” As photos accompanying the announcement make clear, much of what's on offer here is designed to, well, get TV viewers to watch a slop generator. In one image, Google AI Premium users are invited to create videos. Another shows the actual video creation interface, which has what look like Pixar-style animated sample videos with suggested prompts like, “Fluff fish swimming on coral reefs made with squishy yarn.” There's a popup at the bottom of this menu with the text, “Describe your video…” Below that is instructional text about pressing and holding the mic button on your remote to talk. It all paints a picture of an activity you're meant to enjoy in your living room: the “generate videos of our family members” game, perhaps. Anecdotally, most people I know who tried Sora had their curiosity slaked after a few days on the app, and don't really revisit it. I can see that being a problem with generating custom videos on Google TV as well. But there is, at the very least, something novel about messing around with AI while curled up with the dog and a bowl of popcorn. A riveting 55-minute YouTube video will show you where the GPU wafers come from. Elon Musk's xAI has largely been silent on the matter, but some authorities have noticed.</p>
