                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor. Companion M, Götze's personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. The boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25,000 and €50,000 ($29,000-$58,000). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn't one of those areas — at least not directly. In 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn't touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant. Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don't have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained. When Götze became Revolut's first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.” This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo. Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he's also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. But even then, don't expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the end, Ruben Amorim could not handle being told what to do by other people. Amorim, though, felt that not only did he not have the final say on transfers, he did not have the final say on his tactics, and 'blew up' when director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to him about changing his system. Wilcox certainly had reasons for encouraging Amorim to adapt - even though he had been told time and time again by the Portuguese that he was not going to - as United were failing to earn positive results in too many winnable games. The club's new regime of INEOS controlling the football operation is going to either put off elite candidates like Unai Emery and Oliver Glasner or eventually become unworkable a year or so down the line when whoever succeeds Amorim does not get their way. Former United defender Phil Jones recently told GOAL that"the United shirt is heavy to wear", and the dugout has also proven inhospitable to every coach who has stepped into it since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. David Moyes was shocked about how different managing United was to taking charge of Everton, while despite Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho past lives at Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, they too were taken aback by the magnitude of the job at Old Trafford. Both managers had excellent reputations and track records in their own countries, but they struggled to get to grips with the Premier League and above all the intense spotlight on them at United. Ten Hag did not enjoy being the subject of Jamie Carragher's Sky Sports analysis on Monday Night Football, and while Amorim claimed to not pay attention to the media, his final comments before being sacked cited Gary Neville. Constantly being ripped apart by former United captain Neville, whom he previously said "is critical of everything", clearly rattled him. The only people who understand how big this club is are those that have lived inside it for many years. It is why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick are the most compelling candidates for United right now. They do not need a crash course in how the club works, how every word you utter reverberates around the world and can be twisted to suit someone else's agenda. They also know what makes United players tick, and that going to war with a member of the first-team squad is never a good idea. Solskjaer never publicly spoke out against the players during his three years in charge. Instead, he took a group that had been beaten down by Mourinho's negativity and led them on a run of 14 wins in his first 17 matches. The Norwegian's three-year stint was full of ups and downs and there's no getting away from the fact that he oversaw some shocking results, such as losing 5-0 at home to Liverpool or 6-1 at home to Tottenham. And yet Solskjaer secured back-to-back top-four finishes in his two full seasons, the only United coach since Ferguson to do so. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting He would also never have spoken out against the academy, the club's biggest source of pride, by calling out youngsters like Harry Amass or Chido Obi. Amorim often talked about the players and fans feeling anxious at Old Trafford, but it was difficult for supporters to get excited about the often predictable football they were playing. By contrast, the atmosphere at Old Trafford was at its best when Solskjaer was in charge as fans felt a real identity within the club. After all, fan welfare has hardly been a priority for a regime which has sent ticket prices rocketing, and thus they need to lift the mood to protect themselves. Ratcliffe's swingeing cuts and mass redundancies, coming after almost two decades of decay under the Glazer ownership, have badly reduced morale around the club. But a coach that understands what it means to represent United can really lift the mood. United have burned through £42 million in little more than a year on bad appointments. It cost £10.4m to sack Ten Hag and his staff in October 2024, while two months later United sacked director of football Dan Ashworth after only five months in the role, costing £4.1m. Hiring and firing Amorim, meanwhile, is set to cost almost £27m, as United paid out his contract at Sporting and now have to pay off the remaining 18 months of his deal at Old Trafford. United can ill-afford another expensive hire after their total debt climbed to a record £1.29 billion ($1.72bn). Their love for United also means they will be more willing to work with, not against, the likes of Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell. But the INEOS chief and his colleagues at United have ended up building a structure which is only like to repel the very top coaches. They might want 'best in class', but are quite reluctant to pay for it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the same steely gaze he wore as he patrolled midfields during an illustrious career spanning nearly two decades, Michael Bradley sat eagerly and excitedly as he took questions as the New York Red Bulls' newest head coach. Though Monday was Bradley's introductory press conference, he has long been at work preparing for this role. The former U.S. men's national team captain has been ever-present at the Red Bulls' training facility and, from afar, it's easy to forget he's planning training sessions and not preparing to take part in them. In fact, when head of sport Julian de Guzman peered through the glass windows at RBNY's training facility to see someone running wind sprints on the practice field, he wondered which player it was — only to take a closer look and see it was his 38-year-old head coach. “An individual like Michael doesn't come around very often,” de Guzman told the media on Monday. De Guzman and the Red Bull hierarchy had no reservations over whether Bradley was ready for this job or not. Bradley took over as Red Bulls II head coach this summer, joining midseason and helping continue the development of young players. Bradley didn't hesitate to seize the opportunity, either. “How in the world could you say no?” Bradley asked as he broke his seriousness with a smile. “Like anything in life, you can ask yourself certain questions,” Bradley continued. Well, certain things come and you have to go for it. He has long known he wanted to go into coaching after he hung up his boots and many viewed him as an extension of the coaching staff on the field, even in his younger days, such was his pedigree, soccer intellect and leadership. Upon retiring, his early days in coaching included an assistant stint for his dad, Bob Bradley, at Stabaek in Norway, and a brief guest stint under Jesse Marsch with the Canadian national team. “This guy is here to win,” de Guzman said. Bradley's age won't be abnormal in this league, either. Minnesota United's Eric Ramsay (34), St. Louis City's Yoann Damet (35) and the Colorado Rapids' Matt Wells (37) are all younger. The tactics will get a refresh under Bradley, too. Just as he implemented during his time with RBNY II, Bradley plans to change the team's typically narrow, pressing- and transition-based system to one that values possession a bit more and plays wider, particularly with the use of wingers. “Taking the ideas we have in our heads and bring them to life.” Key departures to headline the offseason include Carlos Coronel, Lewis Morgan, Peter Stroud, Sean Nealis, Kyle Duncan and Alexander Hack. So far, just two senior players have arrived — Cade Cowell and Justin Che. It's a process, but the Red Bulls are fully stuck into this task, from de Guzman to Bradley and everyone inside the building. “To make sure we are able to put a team on the field our fans are proud of, to represent our club, this community, in a way where everybody who comes into this stadium feels a part of.” Tom Bogert  is a Senior Writer for The Athletic, providing exclusive, original and unique insights on MLS and the U.S. national team.

In 2030, they will co-host FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. And now sources say they could host FIFA Club World Cup 2029. "According to several reliable sources, Morocco is one of the most credible candidates", reports RMC Sport. If Morocco hosts Club World Cup in 2029, it would serve as a dress rehearsal before the World Cup 2030. If works continue as expected, the Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca will be open by then (expected in 2028), with a capacity of 115,000 spectators, making it the largest football stadium in the world. It would also be a step up compared to the current Africa Cup of Nations, which is held in nine stadiums with 24 teams. Do you think Morocco will host FIFA Club World Cup in 2029?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly pushing Al-Nassr to launch a stunning raid for Antonio Rudiger. The experienced German defender is seeing his contract at Santiago Bernabeu run down and will become a free agent in the summer of 2026 if no extension is agreed. As Rudiger has less than six months left to run on his current deal, he is free to enter into negotiations with any suitors outside of Spain. He is said to be attracting interest from “several ambitious projects”, with big-spending teams in the Middle East forming part of that pack. Real are reportedly willing to let him leave as they remain in a “defensive transition process”, with recruitment focus being narrowed on “medium to long-term” additions. Real Madrid are “not willing to compromise future planning with long contracts or conditions outside their roadmap”. They already have Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo on their books, alongside Joao Felix and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane. They are looking to bolster their back line and see Rudiger as an ideal addition. Fichajes claims that “an economically powerful offer is being prepared” - one which any European-based clubs will find it “difficult to match”. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Having previously lined up against the German, he believes that an “immediate quality boost” can be secured. It is noted that Ronaldo “holds significant influence within Al-Nassr's sporting project, not just on the field but also in strategic decision-making”. Several transfer calls have already been made on his advice, with the 40-year-old frontman desperate to get more proven winners alongside him. He is, however, aware of interest from Saudi Arabia and considers the option of such a switch to be “real, ambitious, and economically very attractive”. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting An extended stay at the Bernabeu cannot be entirely ruled out for now, potentially on rolling 12-month terms, but other options are certainly being considered - by Rudiger and the Blancos. Al-Nassr are ready to pounce, with club captain Ronaldo an obvious ace in their pack. They have faltered of late, in a Saudi Pro League title bid, but remain fiercely competitive on multiple fronts and would provide Rudiger with opportunities to enhance his already impressive CV. Fichjaes claims that any move to the Middle East would be “another impactful move by Saudi football, adding a top-level defender to one of the most ambitious projects”. Real Madrid legend Ronaldo - who remains the club's all-time leading goalscorer - is a man that has grown accustomed to getting his way down the years, and that suggests that Rudiger could complete a stunning switch once dropping into the free agent pool.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A briefing note to city councillors rounds up the final costs and revenue from Taylor Swift's six-night run at the Rogers Centre. A briefing note to city councillors rounds up the final costs and revenue from Taylor Swift's six-night run at the Rogers Centre. To host Taylor Swift's “The Eras Tour” over six shows at the Rogers Centre in November 2024 cost the city more than $4 million, and generated less than $8 million in direct revenue, according to a city hall briefing note sent to councillors last month. Swift's concerts cost Toronto $4.2 million in total across city services and agencies. Its biggest single item was for police — $1.9 million, as previously reported. The transit agency spent an extra $1.7 million, but generated $588,000 in additional revenue during the concerts compared to the weeks prior, in keeping with its prediction of $1 million to $1.2 million. The city's transportation division incurred additional costs of slightly more than $333,000 for traffic management costs, such as sign and camera installations, signal adjustments. It also includes the cost of traffic agents, paid duty officers and the traffic operations centre. Staffing for the city's emergency management was just over $134,000. The city's economic development and culture division kept to its $131,000 budget, including $25,000 for marketing. It also included $47,000 for the TO Poets Department, the city's free pre-concert poetry events to promote local artists, and $59,000 to hire a co-ordinator and purchase signs, outside radiators and other supplies to support a volunteers program that helped visitors get around the city. Meanwhile, Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency in charge of GO trains and buses, incurred approximately $827,800 in “incremental service costs” for increased cleaning, marketing, additional bus and rail trips, standby operators and “enhanced staffing.” Metrolinx generated approximately $1.2 million in additional revenue from increased ridership on GO Transit and the UPX, according to the note. While there were approximately 240,000 concert goers, that number more than doubled when accounting for people accompanying them who didn't have tickets but still visited Toronto. Combined they received 80 per cent of the tax revenue generated, with Ottawa directly getting $10.6 million and Queen's Park getting $8.6 million. The city directly collected $7.1 million — a large portion of which was from the Municipal Accommodation Tax, a local levy applied to the price of short-term accommodations, while the rest was from such city services such as transit fees or parking. “While staging events are quite lucrative to the artists/hosting organizations and other orders of government, associated costs are primarily absorbed by the municipal government.” Some of the main lessons include having “as much lead time as possible” when planning large-scale events and streamlining the number of city departments and agencies involved to “reduce redundancy and issues with staffing and reporting.” The Eras Tour also underscored the need for a more “robust” emergency management strategies including “detailed contingency plans, efficient communication systems and comprehensive training exercises,” the note said.

Donald Trump has issued fresh warnings to countries hours after capturing Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. The United States accused Maduro of criminal activities, including narco-terrorism charges. Maduro entered a not guilty plea on Monday in front of US District Judge Alvin K Hellerstein. Trump has meanwhile warned other countries of possible attacks, including those that are set to participate in the 2026 World Cup. Trump has now warned Mexico, Colombia, Greenland, Iran and Cuba. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has been one of Trump's fiercest critics. On Mexico, Trump has always insisted that they are not doing enough to stop the drugs trade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Declan Rice is a byword for consistency with Arsenal and England Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images As we enter a World Cup year, England manager Thomas Tuchel will have a clear idea of the squad he wants to take to North America. He may indeed know the core of his ideal starting XI to face Croatia on June 17 in Arlington, Texas. Depending on injuries, captain Harry Kane is a certainty and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford will be No 1. Rice has been the epitome of consistency under Mikel Arteta and a driving force in Arsenal's Premier League title challenges. Tuchel will hope he can do likewise for England in their bid to win a first World Cup on foreign soil. Rice built his reputation as a defensive midfielder at West Ham United. His form prompted a £100million move to Arsenal in 2023, yet recently he has been playing more of an attacking role for club and country. In an era obsessed with systems and players being tagged in very specific roles, Rice has become a throwback to midfielders of old. A box-to-box, all-action midfielder who is effective in both penalty areas. Historically, England have often possessed players who boast a knack of timing their runs to score goals. At Bournemouth on Saturday, Rice showed he could become that type of player for Tuchel's England. His four goals this season take him to within one of Leandro Trossard and Viktor Gyokeres as Arsenal's top scorers this season, and his three assists put him only behind Trossard (four). Rice is revelling in getting forward and he ranks fourth for Arsenal in total shots on goal (27) and shots on target (10). He is also Arsenal's second-highest chance creator with 32, just behind Bukayo Saka's 37, and he has created the most big chances (nine) — golden opportunities to score that are expected to be taken — than any of his colleagues. Given the freedom, Rice is extremely effective in open play, but he has played a significant role for Arsenal from set pieces too. One of Arsenal's many strengths in recent seasons is their effectiveness at set pieces. “Declan Rice is unbelievable,” defender Gabriel told Amazon Prime after Arsenal's 4-0 Champions League victory against Atletico Madrid in October. “I'm watching Arsenal and every time they get a corner, my head is in my hands,” former Liverpool defender and pundit Jamie Carragher said in October on the Sky Sports Premier League Podcast. Rice has forged a promising partnership with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson for England, with the latter providing the holding platform that allows Rice to break forward. Set pieces could be a defining factor in the tournament this summer. He overcame a knee injury to face Bournemouth and showed no signs of the knock hindering his performance. With Arsenal still involved in four competitions and competition likely to be long and as gruelling as ever, the only concern for Tuchel will come after the season. Despite his all-action style, any fatigue could be overcome by the buoyancy of what promises to be a memorable campaign for the Premier League leaders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footy Headlines has leaked the home jersey of the US men's soccer national team for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and its design is classic and innovative. The design presented by Nike is based on the national flag and on two previous jersey designs of the USMNT. The jersey features a bold interpretation of the classic American stripes of the national flag. The predominant colors, clearly, are red and white, and they have some details in navy blue on the collar, sleeve cuffs, and the Nike swoosh. The leaked photo shows the badge of the US women's soccer national team, but the cited portal assures that it is also the design that the USMNT will use at the 2026 World Cup. According to the Footy Headlines report, this jersey is expected to be announced shortly, as they indicate it will be available for purchase early in 2026. "The Nike USA 2026 World Cup home jersey will be available from early 2026," they wrote in the leak article. The US Soccer 2026 Home Jersey will be available for purchase in multiple stores, both physical and online, with the most prominent being Nike and Fanatics.
