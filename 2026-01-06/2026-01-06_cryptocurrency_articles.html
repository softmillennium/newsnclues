                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered above $91,000 per token on Tuesday as recent momentum sparked optimism that the brutal fourth quarter sell-off may be behind it. 'We believe with reasonable confidence that Bitcoin and broader digital asset markets have bottomed," analyst Gautam Chhugani and his team said in a note on Tuesday, pointing to $80,000 in late November as the bottom. Chhugani points out that despite bitcoin's 6% decline in 2025, the year was positive for crypto-related stocks and IPOs. Looking ahead, a tokenization "supercycle" led by highfliers Robinhood (HOOD), Coinbase (COIN), Figure (FIGR), and Circle (CRCL) will continue to drive institutional adoption and lift the crypto sector. On Sunday, 10X Research noted technical indicators signaled "Bitcoin has entered a bullish trend." The cryptocurrency ended December down for a third consecutive month, a pattern seen only 15 times historically, often setting up the token for January gains. “There is a good opportunity for a tactical rally,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital assets at Fundstrat, on Monday night. Farrell points to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion and a drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA), similar to the US government's checking account, as positive signs for bitcoin. “We have liquidity improving, flows improving, and we've finally seen a couple of days of outperformance versus equities,” said Farrell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Riot Platforms (RIOT), a publicly listed bitcoin mining company that develops and operates large-scale data centers, stepped up its bitcoin selling at year-end, offloading 1,818 BTC ($161.6 million) and 383 BTC ($37 million) in November. While bitcoin miner sales of coins can occur for various reasons, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, suggested that funding for the company's AI build-out could be at play. Sigel added that the AI trade and bitcoin are increasingly linked, arguing that miners have been among the largest marginal sellers of BTC as they fund AI related capex, especially when credit conditions tighten. It could be one of many reasons for bitcoin's decline during 2025. Riot shares are lower by 2% on Tuesday alongside a 1.2% retreat in the price of bitcoin to $92,500. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market. The technical breakdown erased earlier gains as DOT plunged through $2.19 support on heavy volume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It solves long-standing problems, including fraud, documenting the history of an artwork, and fairly distributing artists' income. A panel discussion at Art Basel's annual Conversations series in Basel, led by journalist Tim Schneider, brought together artist Simon Denny, Verisart CEO Robert Norton, and TRANSFER founder Kelani Nichole to explore the practical and artistic uses of blockchain. This event shows how Art Basel is encouraging conversations about how to use crypto in art, which is similar to how blockchain is changing the world by making transactions safer and more open and by creating new types of digital value. In addition to these insights, academic research shows how blockchain can help enforce resale royalties (known as droit de suite) and make it easier for people in the EU, US, Australia, and China to create and trade art. This shows blockchain's capacity to change things, but it won't be easy. This article examines these changes from a research perspective, drawing on expert perspectives and scholarly analysis to show how blockchain is transforming the art world. The Fine Arts Expert Institute in Geneva released a 2014 report stating that more than half of the works of art they examined were either fake or misattributed. This stops hacking or corruption from happening in one place. Experts stress the practical applications of blockchain at Art Basel's crypto-focused events. Scholarly studies support this, stating that blockchain's ability to trace the origins of items reduces the risk of forgeries common in traditional marketplaces, where uncertain ownership histories can lead to disputes. Blockchain builds confidence by putting transaction information in a ledger that can't be changed. This might make the art market less secretive and encourage more collectors who are worried about fraud to get involved. Art Basel's crypto events have shown how blockchain can be used to create new kinds of art and attract a new group of collectors. Digital collectibles are turning art ownership into a game, as shown by projects like CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game where players can buy, breed, and sell virtual cats. This shows that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are popular as unique digital assets. There are also blockchain-inspired works of art, such as French artist Youl's The Last Bitcoin Supper, which sold for almost $3,000 on eBay in 2014, and Plantoids, which are artificial plants that interact with people through cryptocurrency donations. The panellists in Art Basel's Conversations series provided important insights into this change. Robert Norton said that those who buy CryptoKitties “don't want to buy traditional art… What they're buying is a new kind of digital collectible.” He said this is because people who don't like traditional art forms are drawn to it. He is part of a new movement that includes Bitcoin graffiti and works with cryptocurrency themes. However, it is still hard to get these gamified works into traditional galleries because they are similar to Takashi Murakami's infinite editions but are not widely accepted by cultural collectors. NFT platforms like OpenSea let creators set royalty terms in smart contracts, which automates 5–10% resale fees and makes it easier for more people to own a piece of art by enabling fractional ownership. Blockchain's smart contracts are changing the way resale royalties work by automating payments to artists on secondary sales and fixing problems in traditional markets. The Copyright Agency and other groups have made $11 million under Australia's Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009. At Art Basel events, people talk about how well blockchain works in this field. Smart contracts ensure artists receive their fair share of sales (for example, 2.5% on OpenSea) by tracking transactions in a way that can't be altered. This technology makes things more open and secure by eliminating middlemen and enabling the enforcement of rules worldwide, even when laws differ across jurisdictions. Experts at Art Basel and elsewhere point out the bigger picture: the “code is law” idea of blockchain makes distribution easier, but it needs consistent rules to address legal problems. Blockchain is making art more accessible by eliminating barriers to entry. This lets artists and purchasers from all around the world interact without traditional gatekeepers. For example, China's digital Dunhuang collections promote cultural heritage while following stringent rules. Tokenisation enables fractional ownership, making high-value art accessible to smaller investors and helping make the global art scene more open to everyone. The Bitcoin panels at Art Basel criticise how this change has made things more like products. “This is a different kind of transaction; it's based on relationships,” they said, cautioning against putting assets first as they do with software companies. Blockchain has significant potential, but it faces challenges in the art industry. There are concerns due to technical problems, such as relying on “code is law” for enforcement, and regulatory problems, such as China's bans on unregulated NFTs. These talks will help blockchain become more widely used, which might be good for art in a broader cultural sense if Art Basel continues to sponsor crypto events. What is blockchain's primary benefit in the art market? NFTs enable unique digital ownership, as seen in projects like CryptoKitties, attracting new collectors through gamified, accessible formats. What role do smart contracts play in resale royalties? Smart contracts automate royalty distributions on resales, allowing artists to embed percentage fees (e.g., 5-10%) directly into transactions. Issues include privacy concerns, legal differences across countries, and a focus on monetization over cultural value, as experts have critiqued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Queues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge. In one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks. At the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated. Lower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium' — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books. When queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity. When queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. Staking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize. Ethereum's DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama. The network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality. Incremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself. That fragmentation matters because Ethereum's strongest bull arguments used to be simple. In the current regime, however, a meaningful chunk of user activity can happen on layer-2 networks where fees are cheaper and experience is smoother, but the value capture that accrues back to ETH can be less obvious to spot markets at the moment. "If ETH is treated primarily as a trust asset to be staked rather than actively used, it weakens the burn mechanism: less ETH gets burned, issuance continues, and sell-side pressure builds over time. "Over the past 30 days, Base has generated significantly more fees than Ethereum itself. That gap between activity and value capture is showing up in prediction markets. On Polymarket, traders assign just an 11% chance that ETH reaches a new all-time high by March 2026, despite higher active addresses and a still-dominant share of DeFi TVL.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When investors talk about building a crypto position, they rarely mean one coin only. But as the market looks ahead to 2026, more people are scanning for a new crypto that can sit next to BTC, not replace it. It is still priced under $0.1, it has a clear product roadmap, and its token sale has already built a large holder base. This is why some market commentators suggest MUTM is becoming a next pick in the potential best crypto to buy now. Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $91,100 with a market cap near $1.80T. Many traders expect BTC to test that zone again as market sentiment improves. BTC remains the top crypto for liquidity and long-term trust. It is the asset many investors use as a base layer. That size can make the next multi-x move harder to achieve quickly, even in a bullish phase. It is the idea that upside may be steady rather than explosive from here. It is just not the type of return that smaller tokens can sometimes deliver when they are early in their cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a non custodial lending and borrowing protocol. The goal is to let users supply assets, borrow under clear rules, and manage collateral without relying on a centralized operator. The project describes a dual-market design so it can support different lending needs as adoption grows. This matters because lending protocols are not just tokens. A system becomes valuable when people use it repeatedly. Users supply, borrow, repay, and adjust positions over time. Mutuum Finance has said V1 is being prepared for Sepolia testnet first, then finalized for mainnet, with timing described as coming shortly. It has also said the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral are expected to include ETH and USDT. That V1 step matters because it shifts the project from build mode into trackable readiness. Market watchers stop guessing and start watching execution. Current presale figures show Mutuum Finance moving into later-stage distribution. Funding has reached $19.6M, supported by around 18,700 holders and roughly 822M MUTM already sold. MUTM is priced at $0.04 in presale Phase 7. Mutuum Finance also references an official launch price of $0.06. The staged format matters because it changes behavior. That means later entry points come with fewer tokens per dollar, and it is one reason late phases often feel more competitive. This is also crucial for investor trust because the sale shows a clear, trackable progression instead of a flat price with unclear demand signals. A growing holder base spread across stages can suggest broader participation, not just a small cluster of wallets. The steady climb from stage to stage also acts as a public record of follow-through, since the price only moves higher when prior allocations are absorbed. In plain terms, it is easier for investors to see where the project stands, how far distribution has advanced, and how much of the sale supply has already moved into circulation. Security is not a side story for lending protocols. Mutuum Finance states that Halborn Security completed an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol. It also includes unusual token behavior that can cause accounting errors. Independent review helps reduce uncertainty around whether the core logic can hold up once liquidity grows. For investors, this is crucial because it separates “concept” from “checked code.” It does not guarantee that nothing can go wrong, but it is one of the strongest readiness signals a developing DeFi crypto project can show before broader usage. This is also why some market commentators say projects with visible audits tend to get added to watchlists more often. A smaller token is the upside layer. With $500, an investor could place the full amount into BTC and expect slower, steadier returns. Or they could split it, keeping BTC as the base and adding a smaller position in a new cryptocurrency that has clearer early-cycle pricing. In crypto investing terms, that pairing gives exposure to both long-term trust and early-stage repricing potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Ateev Bhandari Jan 6 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is seeking regulatory approval to launch exchange-traded funds tied to the price ​of cryptocurrency tokens, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and ‌Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the first such move by a big U.S. bank. Regulatory clarity under U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged mainstream finance companies to embrace digital assets, which were ⁠once considered merely speculative instruments. Several investors prefer holding crypto via ETFs, which provide greater liquidity and security, and simplified regulatory compliance compared to managing the underlying asset ​directly. "It's interesting to see Morgan Stanley move into a commoditized market, and I ‌suspect that means they want to move clients that invest in bitcoin into their ETFs which could give them a fast start despite their late entrance," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "A bank entering the crypto ETF market adds legitimacy to it, and others could follow." In the two years since the SEC ⁠approved the first U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, a ​wide array of financial institutions - mostly asset managers - ​have stepped up to issue such funds. U.S. banks, which have mostly only acted as custodians of client investments, are looking to evolve ‍from cautious facilitators to ⁠active advisers. Bank of America ⁠followed suit, allowing its wealth advisers to recommend allocations to crypto in client portfolios from January, ‌without any asset threshold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee may have just given his most bullish predictions yet. Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine chairman Tom Lee has begun the new year with what may be his most bullish outlook yet, predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb as high as $250,000 in 2026 and that Ethereum (ETH) could post similarly dramatic gains. Speaking in recent CNBC interviews  and shareholder communications, Lee argued that traditional crypto market cycles may be breaking down, a shift he believes could unlock extraordinary upside for Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Lee said Bitcoin's next major rally could defy its long-established four-year halving cycle, which has historically been followed by steep drawdowns. “In 2026, if Bitcoin gets to $200,000 or $250,000, it would be breaking the four-year cycle,” Lee said on CNBC's Squawk Box. Under the classic cycle framework, Lee acknowledged that Bitcoin “should be down this year,” but said recent developments have materially altered the outlook. “I think there are tailwinds that are building,” he said, adding that leverage in the system was largely reset after a sharp market shock in October. He pointed to ongoing institutional adoption, Wall Street's continued development of blockchain-based products, and what he described as growing U.S. government support as key drivers that could propel Bitcoin higher. Lee also addressed concerns that Bitcoin has lagged gold and silver during recent rallies in precious metals. In addition, Lee said certain macro indicators have historically aligned with Bitcoin rallies, even if the relationships are not widely understood. “And we also found that the ISM, as it moves from below 50 to its peak, has coincided with Bitcoin entering its sort of rally stage.” Lee has been equally bullish on Ethereum, arguing that its performance relative to Bitcoin could ultimately drive substantial upside. “We believe Ethereum is the future of finance,” he said. In more aggressive scenarios, Lee suggested Ethereum's valuation could climb far higher. “If Bitcoin gets to a million, that would value ETH at $250,000,” he said. Lee's latest forecasts have drawn sharp criticism, most notably from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff. Schiff dismissed Lee's argument that rising gold prices are bullish for Bitcoin, arguing that the two assets have historically competed rather than moved together. In a separate post, Schiff argued that Bitcoin's recent rebound reflected speculative momentum rather than improving fundamentals. Despite the criticism, Lee has reiterated that recent strength in precious metals supports a constructive outlook for digital assets. Pointing to silver's sharp gains over the past month and gold's strong rise over the past year, Lee questioned whether skepticism toward crypto remains justified. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” he wrote. The comments prompted further backlash on X, where some users cited Lee's previous forecasts. One urged him to “stick to equities,” while another said Lee had previously argued Bitcoin and Ethereum would not fall further shortly before prices declined.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Ethereum (ETH) attempts to turn a crucial level into support, some analysts have shared a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, which could send its price above the $4,000 barrier in the first quarter of 2026. On Monday, Ethereum broke above the $3,200 barrier for the first time in nearly a month, hitting a four-week high of $3,259. Amid this performance, some market observers shared a potential setup that could lead to a significant rally during the next three months. In an X post, analyst Niels affirmed that Ethereum's quarterly close in the red is “not as bearish as it looks.” Notably, the altcoin recorded its worst Q4 in six years after closing the quarter with a negative return of 28.28%, according to CoinGlass data. This marks ETH's first negative Q4 close since 2022, and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019, when it registered a negative return of 28.9%. Nonetheless, Niels highlighted that this opens the door for an “interesting” setup ahead of the altcoin's expected seasonality. “History tells an interesting story: every single time ETH has finished Q4 in the red, the next Q1 has closed green,” the analyst explained, asserting that “year-end weakness has usually acted as a reset, not a reversal.” As the price records an 11% weekly surge, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the cryptocurrency is about to face an important zone that has served as resistance for nearly two months. “A reclaim of this level will pump Ethereum towards the $3,800-$4,000 level,” where the next major resistance is located, Ted explained on Monday morning. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez discussed the altcoin's consolidation, pointing to a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on its chart. According to the analyst, Ethereum has been compressing between the pattern's ascending and descending trendlines since November, awaiting a 30% move. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,253, a 3.4% increase in the daily timeframe. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences slated for February were cancelled, citing significant losses after the NFT market cap dropped by nearly $7B in a year. Even though the developments had a positive impact on the Dogecoin price prediction, many meme traders chose DeepSnitch AI, not only for its upside potential but also for its meme-friendly utility. Raising $1M amid market turmoil, DeepSnitch AI built up organic hype and sparked multiple 100x projections on the strength of its AI-powered prediction and analytics suite. Organizers behind NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences announced the cancellation of these events with a month's notice, citing market collapse as the primary reason. This is reflected in the Dogecoin price prediction, despite many traders opting for either newly-graduated meme tokens or high-potential presale projects. While it has a solid $0.03269 entry that is reminiscent of the prices of most meme coins, DeepSnitch AI is a full-fledged AI project. By integrating five AI agents into a single analytics and prediction suite, the platform aims to help retail traders make consistent trades. Meme traders, specifically, will love the SnitchScan agent for its ability to scan new tokens for rug pull risks, insider activity, and upside potential. All of this provides DeepSnitch AI with staying power and a significant upside potential. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE settled in the $0.15 area on December 5. On December 5, XRP surged by 12% and rose above the $2.30 territory to start a test of the $2.40 resistance, according to CoinMarketCap.For those not confident in the Dogecoin price prediction, XRP may provide a bit more substance. Alternatively, the rally could speed up if accumulation pushes the price above this crucial level, allowing XRP to surge past $3 in January. As the market recovers in the first weeks of January, the Dogecoin price prediction turned bullish, providing meme traders a way to grow their bags while the hype lasts.However, savvy traders are looking elsewhere and are prioritizing long-term potential and a larger upside.Priced at $0.03269 and raising over $1M, DeepSnitch AI's utility provides real value for traders in the meme sector while also reinforcing a 100x narrative that led to massive levels of hype. The Dogecoin price prediction is cautiously bullish after DOGE reclaimed the $0.15 level, with analysts targeting a potential move toward $0.19 if buying pressure remains strong. As NFT market capitalization dropped from roughly $9B to $2.7B year-over-year, speculative capital rotated toward meme coins, helping boost sentiment and short-term price action. DeepSnitch AI combines meme-friendly appeal with AI-powered analytics and prediction tools, offering higher upside potential and utility beyond traditional meme coins, which helped it surpass $1M during its presale.
