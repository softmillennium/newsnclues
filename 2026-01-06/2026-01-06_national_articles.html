Fox News' Howard Kurtz joins ‘Fox News Live' to react to President Donald Trump's $1 billion threat to sue the BBC and to weigh in on the political fallout from the government shutdown. EXCLUSIVE: The White House published a new website Tuesday detailing the timeline of the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, taking aim at Democrat lawmakers for allegedly promoting a "gaslighting narrative" surrounding the protest to silence their political opponents. "The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as ‘insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump—despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government," the new website states. "All while (then-Speaker of the House Nancy) Pelosi's own security lapses invited the chaos they later exploited to seize and consolidate power," the website continues. "This gaslighting narrative allowed them to persecute innocent Americans, silence opposition, and distract from their own role in undermining democracy." The new website works to shed accurate light on the events of the protest following years of Democrats describing it as a dark moment in U.S. history. The new site boasts the historic date with black and white images of Democrats and others who investigated the breach, a timeline of Trump supporters gathering in Washington, D.C., ahead of and after the breach, and how the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report reviewing the breach uncovered "critical security failures on January 6, 2021, that were largely due to politicized decisions by Democratic leadership and the Pentagon." The committee became a lightning rod of criticism for Trump and Republicans, who accused the congressional body of "deleting and destroying" evidence related to the investigation, which was detailed in the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report published in December 2024. Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump hugs his wife Melania, as they stand next to Barron Trump, at Donald Trump's victory rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida on November 6, 2024. The timeline walks users through the events of the day, including excerpts focused on: "President Trump Delivers Powerful Speech," "Patriots March to the Capitol," "Capitol Police Response Escalates Tensions," "President Trump Urges Calm," and "Leaked Pelosi Video Exposes Security Lapses." Supporters of Trump gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress was set to certify the Electoral College vote that determined President Joe Biden was elected to the nation's highest office. "Leaked footage captured by Nancy Pelosi's daughter shows the Speaker during the chaos admitting, 'I take responsibility,' for security failures," the White House website states. "The video exposes Pelosi's catastrophic failure to prepare, including rejecting President Trump's reported advance offers of 10,000 troops to maintain security. Pelosi's daughter's own footage shows she knew security was so limited under her watch, exposing the deliberate refusal to accept offered reinforcements that could have prevented or delayed required reinforcements." "Numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed again and again that Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination on January 6th," Krager said. "We must speak plainly: January 6th was an attempted coup. It was an effort to nullify millions of lawful votes and subvert the will of the American people," Pelosi wrote in the statement published Tuesday. "But the attack failed because of the courage of public servants who gave proof through the night that our flag was still there by refusing to bend to pressure, threats, or intimidation. Jan. 6, 2021, thrust Trump into a legal and political storm that followed him out of office, fueling his second impeachment and years of courtroom battles. Democrats cited his words and actions surrounding the Capitol riot as grounds for "incitement of insurrection," while prosecutors later built separate cases probing election interference and efforts to overturn the 2020 results. Biden called Jan. 6 a "dark moment" and "an assault on the citadel of liberty" back in 2021, while former Vice President Kamala Harris said during the 2024 presidential debate that it was "the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War." Trump has hit back at Democratic rhetoric, defending that he told supporters to march "peacefully and patriotically" outside the Capitol, while also describing the day as "a day of love" and casting many defendants as unfairly targeted. The president granted clemency to all individuals convicted or awaiting trial over the breach, roughly 1,600 people, upon his return to the Oval Office in January 2025. The new White House website page argues in one section that "President Trump Corrected a Historic Wrong—freeing Americans Who Were Unjustly Punished and Restoring Fairness Under the Law." (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post via Getty Images) "With his triumphant return to the White House, President Trump wasted no time righting one of the darkest wrongs in modern American history," the site states. "On Inauguration Day 2025, he issued sweeping pardons and commutations for the vast majority of January 6 defendants—patriotic citizens who had been viciously overcharged, denied due process, and held as political hostages by a vengeful regime." The major legal cases targeting Trump that were tied to claims he worked to overturn the 2020 election were later dropped after Trump returned to office, while a Georgia election-interference prosecution against Trump and others was also dismissed. The BBC is currently wrapped up in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit leveled by Trump in a Florida federal court over a documentary the outlet published ahead of the 2024 election that included an edited clip of Trump's 2021 speech on Jan. 6. The outlet has apologized for an "error of judgment" regarding editing the speech, but has rejected demands for financial compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Venezuelan ministry spokesperson said “no confrontation occurred.” Sigue nuestra cobertura en español. • Renewed focus on Greenland: Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Greenland and Denmark in a joint statement issued earlier today after President Donald Trump said the US “needs” the island. Trump said he considers himself in charge of Venezuela. “We firmly believe that Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive external interference,” it said. After the US's attack on Venezuela on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry condemned what it called an “act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” calling any “excuses” given to justify such actions “untenable.” “President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security, and he is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told CNN in a statement. “The President is committed to establishing long-term peace at home and abroad,” she added. The European leaders said in their statement that “Greenland belongs to its people.” Venezuelans are entering a time of uncertainty following the US military operation that ousted leader Nicolás Maduro. While some are relieved to have Maduro no longer in power, there is also growing anxiety about what the US' role will be in the country moving forward. The United States is “almost starting a war with an allied country” in its pursuit of Greenland, Danish parliament member Rasmus Jarlov told CNN's Becky Anderson today. “It is quite shocking that a person who's in charge of this completely illegitimate land claim on Greenland knows so little about the history and the background of why Greenland belongs to Denmark,” Jarlov said, referencing White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who last night said that nobody would fight the US if it tried to seize the autonomous Danish territory. It has never been disputed by the United States themselves, and they really should know these things before almost starting a war with an allied country,” Jarlov continued. For context: US President Donald Trump has renewed his public calls for the autonomous Danish territory after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. “So this talk about needing Greenland for security is complete nonsense,” he added. Neither China nor Russia are threatening Greenland,” he said. Should the US attack Greenland militarily, Denmark “will defend it, and in that case, we would be at war,” Jarlov said. “We would be fighting each other, which is completely absurd,” he continued. “But you cannot disagree that if the United States attacks a NATO country, there is no alliance.” Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's inner circle of bodyguards were Cuban. Watch to learn more about what could be next for Cuba amid escalating tensions: CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains what's next for Cuba as political turmoil rocks the country's close ally, Venezuela, after the US capture of Nicolás Maduro. The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, called Tuesday for a “fair trial” for the ousted president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who was captured on January 3 along with his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas after a US military intervention, and then transferred to New York, where they face drug trafficking charges. “In this case, now that President Maduro has been detained, what one asks for is always a fair trial. That is what must be requested, so that truly in everything, for everyone and in any circumstance – and in this particular case – there must be speed and justice,” the president said during her morning press conference. She recalled that Mexico defends “non-intervention, the peaceful resolution of disputes,” and noted that even “if a country is very small internationally, we are all equal.” International cooperation for development, which is what I mentioned yesterday. The best way to help a country is international cooperation for development. Respect, protection, and promotion of human rights,” she asserted. Since Maduro's detention on January 3, Mexico has expressed its rejection of Washington's military intervention in Venezuela and has defended the sovereignty of nations. On Sunday, it issued a joint statement with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Spain, and Uruguay rejecting “the military actions unilaterally carried out on Venezuelan territory” and expressing “concern about any attempt at governmental control, administration, or external appropriation of natural or strategic resources.” Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab demanded the release of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, saying that he has “diplomatic immunity.” Saab also urged Hellerstein to “cease all human rights violations that have been carried out against the president, his wife, and obviously against the Venezuelan people.” The Trump administration's recent rhetoric about Greenland in light of its actions in Venezuela is harming American security, according to John Bolton, US President Donald Trump's former national security adviser. When asked by CNN's Kate Bolduan about comments made by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller yesterday that “nobody's gonna fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Bolton said that Miller was making a “simple-minded statement.” “Of course, nobody's going to fight us over (Greenland), but it doesn't mean we should take territory from a treaty ally. And if we do that or if, frankly, this conversation goes on much longer, I think the NATO alliance is in grave jeopardy,” he said. On Venezuela: Bolton also reiterated that the Trump administration was making a “big mistake” by choosing not to support opposition leader María Corina Machado as the new leader of Venezuela. Machado and fellow opposition leader Edmundo González “are the people who can help provide stability,” Bolton said, not those who were a part of the regime ran by ousted President Nicolás Maduro. Trump recounted several operational details to Republican lawmakers, indicating the US cut electricity to major parts of Venezuela just before entering the country. “And on the other side, a lot of people were killed.” Trump went on to criticize Democrats for airing concerns about the decision to capture Maduro, complaining that few in the party were congratulating him. Colombian Foreign Minister Yolanda Villavicencio confirmed Tuesday that she will submit a note of protest to the United States over threats made by President Donald Trump against Colombian President Gustavo Petro. “We want them to understand that he is our democratically elected president. On Sunday, Trump described Petro as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.” When pressed by a reporter on whether those comments meant there could be an “operation” in Colombia in the future, Trump responded, “Sounds good to me.” Petro subsequently refuted Trump's claims and defended his government's record on combating drug trafficking in a lengthy post on X. The minister said she has been in contact with the Venezuelan government, without giving details of those conversations, and said that Colombia has not received asylum requests from Chavista leaders. CNN's Tim Lister and Hira Humayun contributed to this report. In a post on X, the SNTP reported that 13 foreign journalists and one Venezuelan journalist were detained on Monday in Caracas before later being released. The union said that journalists had their equipment and messaging apps checked. If you're just joining us, catch up on the latest developments: CNN's Catherine Nicholls, Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, Jack Guy contributed to this report. Stephen Miller asserts Trump administration's position is Greenland should be part of the US. ET in the Senate SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility), according to a source familiar with the meeting and a notice sent to Senate offices. The briefing will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, CIA Director Ratcliffe and Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine. The House is also expected to receive a similar classified briefing. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. These remarks came following US military action on foreign soil, and were met with consternation from European allies. When the President of the United States speaks of ‘needing Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it is not only wrong. It is disrespectful,” Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen said yesterday. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that there would be consequences should the US try to seize Greenland, saying in televised remarks that “if the US chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, everything stops, including NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of World War II.” In a joint statement released today, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and Denmark reiterated that “Greenland belongs to its people. CNN's Rhea Mogul, Kit Maher, Tim Lister and Matthew Chance contributed to this reporting. Tensions appear to be rising in Venezuela in the aftermath of US military action to capture President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, with rights groups reporting checkpoints and media repression as security forces patrol the streets. Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital Caracas. In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!” Yesterday saw ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro make an appearance at a New York court, after he was captured alongside his wife Cilia Flores in a US operation over the weekend. As you can see in the images below, he was escorted to the court by armed police and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, traveling both by motorcade and helicopter to move from a Brooklyn detention center to the Manhattan courthouse. The ambassadors of China, Russia and Iran — key allies of Venezuela — were among the first dignitaries to congratulate Delcy Rodríguez when she was sworn in. The United Nations has said it is “deeply worried” about what comes next for Venezuela following the US capture of President Nicolas Maduro. “It is clear that the operation undermined a fundamental principle of international law – that states must not threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Tuesday. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize in October last year for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.” In addition to being a staunch proponent of democracy and a vocal supporter of Trump, Machado is also an avowed capitalist who previously ran on a campaign to privatize most Venezuelan public assets, including in the sectors of health, oil and education. In an interview with CNN before Venezuela's contested 2024 elections, she repeatedly called for the country's markets to be opened, saying: “we need to create conditions that are so competitive, so attractive that international resources will be invested in a country, despite what happened in the previous regime.” Yesterday, Machado said that, following the US' capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, her country “will be the United States' main ally in matters of security, energy, democracy and human rights.” In an interview with Fox News the same day, Machado said she hadn't spoken to Trump since October, after her Nobel Peace Prize win. CNN's Christian Edwards, Char Reck, Billy Stockwell, Stefano Pozzebon, Rocío Muñoz-Ledo and Lex Harvey contributed to this reporting. Leaders from major European powers have just expressed support for Denmark and Greenland in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by US President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory. A US military operation at the weekend, which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario. Some context: Greenland is the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports. The 56-year-old has spent more than two decades as one of the leading figures of Chavismo, a socialist ideology founded by influential leftist leader Hugo Chávez, which also values Venezuela's sovereignty as something to be protected from “imperialist” powers. But on Sunday, she extended an invitation to the United States government to collaborate on an “agenda of cooperation,” saying that Venezuela will “prioritize” moving toward “balanced and respectful international relations” with the US and the region. Yesterday, US President Donald Trump did not say whether he has yet spoken directly to Rodríguez, but told reporters that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been speaking with her in fluent Spanish on the phone and that their “relationship has been very strong.” CNNE's Mauricio Torres, CNN's Helen Regan and Kit Maher contributed to this reporting.</p>

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican is seeking to tighten the screws on the U.S. immigration system in the wake of multiple investigations into alleged fraud within Minnesota's social services system. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people from Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Somalia. Immigrants from those countries currently in the U.S. on refugee status would be forced to self-deport within 180 days of the bill's enactment. "It's important that we ensure that those entering our country are properly vetted, and they clearly have not been properly vetted. Demonstrators rally outside a Target location on Dec. 4, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minn. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) Part of his impetus for introducing the bill now, Hunt said, was the increased scrutiny on Minnesota's Somali community as federal prosecutors investigate what they believe could be billions of dollars of fraud targeting social programs in the Midwestern state. Federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged multiple people with stealing more than $240 million from the Federal Child Nutrition Program through the Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future. The probe has since widened to multiple state-run programs being investigated for potential fraud, however. Childcare providers receiving state funding, mainly within the Somali community, are also under scrutiny. Pressure from the growing scandal pushed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to drop his bid for a third term. "Every minute that I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity, and the cynics who want to prey on our differences," Walz said. There certainly is more to come out of this situation," Hunt said. That's why he's not seeking reelection, and so there's a lot of 'there' that's there, and it needs to be exposed, needs to be investigated." He added, "Making sure that we revoke these TPS designations is the beginning of cleaning up this mess." Tim Walz holds a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Jan. 5, 2026. Hunt argued that his bill would help hasten the timeline for President Donald Trump's move to end TPS for foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota. "As somebody that has lived under Sharia law, somebody that has deployed to the Middle East, this is also a broader conversation about keeping people that hate our country out of here," Hunt said. Hunt is currently running for U.S. Senate in Texas. Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mainstream liberal foundations, private charities with histories of supporting terrorist-linked groups, a Chinese Communist Party-aligned businessman, and an array of left-wing activist organizations with histories of operating in Latin America have, in recent years, united by bankrolling the organizations taking to the streets to protest America's arrest of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. To voice their opposition to the military action, the groups have organized street protests in cities across the country while flooding social media with messaging accusing the U.S. of colonialism, violating international law, and comparing it to past U.S. military adventures — talking points that have since been adopted by mainstream Democrats. These three groups share considerable ties owing to their shared leadership and sources of funding. Their mobilization this week in the aftermath of Maduro's arrest, as previously documented by journalist Asra Nomani, was rapid. However, much of the funding they receive is anonymous, as, while charitable foundations are legally required to disclose their giving, individuals are allowed to remain anonymous, prompting speculation that foreign donors could be funding domestic activism. People's Support Foundation, a left-wing grantmaking organization run by CODEPINK co-founder Jodie Evans, was the single largest donor recorded in public disclosures, giving $5 million to The People's Forum in 2024. Evans's husband, Neville Roy Singham, is a self-described socialist who sold his software firm for approximately $785 million in 2017. Since then, he has been accused of using his immense wealth to advance the interests of America's adversaries, chiefly China. A 2023 New York Times report linked Singham to Chinese government-backed propaganda efforts, but the former tech executive has denied having a relationship with the CCP. Singham has praised former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, describing the country under his rule as a “phenomenally democratic place.” Another CODEPINK co-founder, Medea Benjamin, is the source of funds for Arc of Justice, which provided CODEPINK with $606,000 between 2020 and 2022. Benjamin has a history of supporting America's adversaries, including the communist Viet Cong and the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Many of the organizations pouring funds into groups protesting Maduro's capture have also financially supported entities linked to terrorist organizations. In March 2025, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) announced a congressional investigation amid allegations that multiple leaders of American Muslims for Palestine have strong ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups. Among these was AMP's former executive director, who served as “secretary general” of the Islamic Association for Palestine, which court records show was founded with funds from senior Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook. Other individuals flagged by the senator included AMP's current executive director, who worked for IAP's media operation and interviewed top Hamas leaders; a former AMP board member, who served as the “Michigan representative” for IAP; and the organization's accountant, who served as IAP's president. Additionally, multiple individuals associated with AMP were also involved with the Holy Land Foundation, which, according to U.S. government estimates, sent “$12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to willfully contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.” USCPR held a conference in May 2024 that was endorsed by a founding member of the PFLP and has produced reams of material supporting Hamas, including its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel. The Yoosufani Family Foundation, similar to the Alalusi Foundation, is run by a Texas-based Pakistani businessman and gave $100,000 to CODEPINK in 2024. That same year, the foundation cut five-figure checks to AMP, USCPR, and a media organization called the “Electronic Intifada.” For instance, The People's Forum accepted a $33,000 donation from the Alliance for Global Justice at some point between April 2023 and March 2024, after the organization began taking criticism for its ties to Islamic terrorists. The People's Forum grant was earmarked specifically for supporting Cuba's left-wing regime. The Justice and Education Fund is a left-of-center grantmaking network that bankrolls “popular education schools” in South America to boost support for left-wing ideas in the region. It provided nearly half a million dollars to CODEPINK between 2020 and 2022. While receiving funding from organizations sympathetic to terrorist-linked groups and left-wing radicals, CODEPINK also counted on institutions close to the mainstream liberal movement for support.</p>

Mickey Rourke's career has been defined by extremes, including self-imposed detours, legal drama, comebacks and recurring controversy. Now, Rourke has found himself in legal trouble again. He was recently served an eviction notice after allegedly falling behind on nearly $60,000 in rent on his Los Angeles home. A member of Rourke's management team seemingly launched a GoFundMe to help the action film star raise the money to stay in his home. The fundraiser had over $70,000 in donations after 24 hours. Rourke later denied he was involved in setting up the fundraiser and urged fans not to donate. "Something's come up that I'm really frustrated, confused, and I don't understand," Roruke said in a video shared on Instagram. "Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money, like charity. I don't go to outside sources like that. Mickey Rourke's career has swung from early Hollywood success to physical injury, legal trouble and financial strain. Here's a look back at Mickey Rourke's tumultuous career: After seeing success in the film industry with "Body Heat," "Diner," "9 ½ Weeks" and "Angel Heart," Mickey Rourke chose to take his talent a different route. He opened up about the injuries he suffered while boxing in a 2009 interview with the Daily Mail. "I had to have cartilage taken from my ear to rebuild my nose and a couple of operations to scrape out the cartilage because the scar tissue wasn't healing properly." He claimed most of his cosmetic operations were "to mend the mess of my face because of the boxing, but I went to the wrong guy to put my face back together." Mickey Rourke, once a rising Hollywood star, later left filmmaking to pursue a professional boxing career that resulted in multiple facial injuries. Rourke was arrested in 1994 after he allegedly slapped his then-wife, knocked her down and kicked her during a visit to the couple's publicist's office. Rourke later pleaded not guilty before the charges were dropped after Carre Otis failed to appear in court multiple times. Otis later wrote about the passion she experienced while dating Rourke. "Already in those early days, my craving for him was at its strongest when we weren't together," she wrote in her memoir, "Beauty, Disrupted." "We'd be separated for a few hours, and I could think of nothing else but being with him again. We both loved the drama of it all, loved the fantasy of being head over heels in love, unable to be apart. When people ask why I would end up staying with him for so long, this is a huge part of the answer. Rourke was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in November 2007. A Miami Beach police report said Rourke had made an illegal U-turn while driving a green scooter, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Rourke's performance in the Darren Aronofsky film is widely regarded as one of the most dramatic and celebrated comebacks in modern film history. Rourke earned a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and grabbed an Academy Award nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Randy "The Ram" Robinson. Rourke's career continued steadily after his mainstream comeback. "The young guys are cool," he told Fox News Digital in 2022. I could be standing across from any f---ing actor. And I know that motherf---er has not seen, done or been through what I've been through." Mickey Rourke faced multiple arrests in the 1990s and 2000s, including domestic abuse allegations and a DUI-related charge, before later mounting a mainstream comeback. Rourke agreed to leave the reality TV show "Celebrity Big Brother UK" in April over controversial behavior. "Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior," a spokesperson for "Celebrity Big Brother UK" told People magazine at the time. No physical altercation took place, but Rourke reportedly used "threatening and aggressive" language. Shortly before his exit, Rourke received a warning after his remarks about fellow contestant JoJo Siwa's sexuality. Now, decades after his rise and fall, Mickey Rourke is facing eviction from a Los Angeles rental property amid ongoing controversy. Now, Rourke is facing eviction from a bungalow in Los Angeles after he failed to pay nearly $60,000 in rent. Rourke rented the property earlier this year, agreeing to pay $5,200 a month, which later went up to $7,000 a month, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by Fox News Digital. Rourke rented the property around the same time he agreed to leave "Celebrity Big Brother UK" earlier this year following a warning from producers over conduct they deemed inappropriate on the show. A GoFundMe was started on Rourke's behalf by a member of his team to help raise funds to pay his rent. "Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original," the GoFundMe reads. "In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn't just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From Diner to Rumble Fish to 9½ Weeks, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture. "Mickey's life never followed a safe or protected path. At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort. "What followed were years of struggle not defined by spectacle, but by survival: health challenges, financial strain, and the quiet toll of being left behind." "Today, Mickey is facing a very real and urgent situation: the threat of eviction from his home. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening. It is the story of someone who gave everything to his work, took real risks, and paid real costs."

The National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing its charitable foundation, the NRA Foundation, of misusing $160 million in donations. The NRA alleged the foundation used its trademarks without authorization and diverted donations intended for NRA charitable programs. "The Foundation has been seized by a disgruntled faction of former NRA directors who lost control of the NRA's Board following revelations of financial improprieties, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty and member trust," attorneys for the NRA wrote in the complaint. A National Rifle Association (NRA) logo is displayed at the NRA annual national convention in Dallas, Texas, May 18, 2024. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's former chief, resigned in January 2024 as he was set to face trial in a corruption case brought by Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. Prosecutors alleged that NRA executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips. Former NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre smiles during the NRA annual meeting of members in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 27, 2019. A jury found the organization liable for financial mismanagement, ordering LaPierre to repay the group $4,351,231. Then-President of the National Rifle Association Bob Barr, center, speaks during the NRA annual meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, April 26, 2025. Bill Bachenberg, right, succeeded Barr as president a short time later. A judge later decided not to assign an outside monitor to oversee the NRA, but banned LaPierre from employment with the organization for ten years. It also seeks to block conduct that could lead the public to believe the foundation's activities are "sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by, or associated or connected with" the NRA.

Several 911 calls reveal the frantic moments before police found a Columbus, Ohio, dentist and his wife dead at their home, including one caller bluntly telling dispatchers "there's a body," as investigators search for the person who killed the couple shortly before their fifth wedding anniversary. Officials said police responded to the house around 10 a.m. on Dec. 30 when they found Spencer Tepe, 37 and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. Two young children were found at the house unharmed. Police do not believe their deaths were a murder-suicide and said there wasn't any sign of forced entry, adding that a gun wasn't recovered, according to WSYX. Fox News Digital obtained the four calls placed to 911 through a public records request. The first call came from Spencer's employer, Mark Valrose, who owns Athens Dental Depot. While Valrose said he was vacationing in Florida at the time, several of Spencer's co-workers became concerned after he didn't show up for work. "Spencer works with me and he did not show up to work this morning and we cannot get ahold of him or his family," Valrose said. "He is always on time and he would contact us if there is any issues whatsoever… we're very, very concerned because this is very out of character and we can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing." Spencer and Monique Tepe were preparing to celebrate their five-year wedding anniversary. At 9:56 a.m., another individual called 911 to report they could hear kids inside the Tepe household, but no one answered the door. One of Spencer's friends called 911 at 10:03 a.m, saying they came to the Tepes' house to do a "wellness check" and could see a body inside the house. "There's a body," the person can be heard saying. We just came here and he appears dead. I can't get closer to see more than that." Spencer and Monique Tepe were found dead on Dec. 30. "I can tell he's obviously not breathing or anything," the caller said. Spencer and Monique Tepe pictured in wedding photos. WATCH: Former homicide detective says piece of evidence left behind may lead police to Ohio couple's killer Former homicide detective Ted Williams told Fox News Digital he thinks "someone they know" killed the couple. "The investigators in Columbus, Ohio, they're having to work backwards from that crime scene, and this is what we know. We do know that there was no signs of forced entry. So, if there's no sign of forced entry, that tells me that they either knew their victims, meaning the perpetrator, or the Tepes may very well have left their doors open," Williams said. He's seen in what appears to be a dark coat and light-colored pants. In a statement released Friday, the couple's family said they are "heartbroken beyond words," and called the deaths "tragic and senseless." "They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others," read the statement. Spencer and Monique Tepe pictured on their wedding day. Monique was described by family members as a "loving, patient and joyful mother whose warmth defined her." Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX that the couple was going to celebrate their five-year anniversary next month after getting married in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arctic air is moving south into the UK, plunging thermometers below zero. It might not be good news with travel plans hit and school closures, but passionate skaters are hitting the ice in East Anglia to revive an historic Fenland tradition. The French capital was hit by heavy snow on Monday as temperatures droped below 0 degrees Celsius. Temperatures were expected to fall, reaching -4 C overnight. Freshly fallen snow lies on the roofs of houses in Kronberg near Frankfurt, Germany, early Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Snow, ice and freezing temperatures hit parts of Europe on Tuesday, causing treacherous traffic conditions that left at least five people dead in France and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights from one of the continent's busiest airports. Authorities in the Landes region of southwestern France reported three dead in accidents, and at least two more people were reportedly killed in the Île-de-France region around Paris, where authorities ordered trucks off the road as snowfall caused huge traffic jams on Monday. Paris awoke Tuesday to a blanket of snow on its famous rooftops and sites, and children whose schools couldn't hold classes delighted in an unexpected day off. Air travelers were less happy, as heavy snowfall forced the closure of six airports in the north and west of France. As snow fell across the Netherlands, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport reported that some 600 flights were grounded during the day as crews worked to clear runways and de-ice planes waiting to depart. Dutch airline KLM warned travelers stranded at Schiphol that scammers posing as customer service staff were targeting passengers and incorrect phone numbers for the airline were circulating online. KLM also said it was running short of the glycol fluid it uses combined with hot water to de-ice planes before they take off. It said airports across Europe were facing similar problems after days of freezing temperatures. Just getting to and from the airport outside the Dutch capital was a struggle with frozen points and an early morning software glitch throwing the Netherlands' rail system into turmoil. Limited rail services resumed later in the morning but routes around Amsterdam remained largely closed because of the icy conditions, national railway company NS said on its website. Commuters forced to drive to work also faced time-consuming journeys as a combination of the snow and ice snarled traffic on some highways. Thijs Rademakers, an 18-year-old student, decided to ride his bike rather than wait for public transport. “It was tough, very slippery,” he said in the eastern city of Arnhem. In Rome, weeks of rain that have swollen the Tiber River over its banks again muted Pope Leo XIV's Christmas-time celebrations. St. Peter's Square was only partially full Tuesday as a few thousand people crowded under colorful umbrellas to hear Leo deliver his Epiphany blessing from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica. Rome has been soaked by steady rains since before Christmas, and Mayor Roberto Gualtieri issued an ordinance for Tuesday limiting public access to parks and other areas at risk for falling trees and flooding. A cold snap sent the temperature in northern parts of Britain down to minus 12.5 degrees Celsius (9.5 Fahrenheit) overnight, as snow disrupted rail, road and air travel and closed hundreds of schools. Horse races and soccer matches have been called off because of snow and frost, while a power failure caused by ice closed Glasgow's subway. Up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of snow was forecast Tuesday for northern Scotland, where some people have already been snowed in by previous falls. In neighboring Serbia, some western municipalities introduced emergency measures due to bad weather. Authorities in Serbia warned drivers to be very careful as many set off toward skiing resorts or elsewhere for Orthodox Christmas on Wednesday and the upcoming weekend. Video footage showed the sea sweeping through holiday cottages at Ada Bojana in southern Montenegro during a storm. Associated Press writers across Europe contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. President Donald Trump is ringing in 2026 with a new form of American imperialism. ► The US Army's Delta Force was dispatched to depose Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation Saturday. Now Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be part of “running” that oil-rich country, whatever that ends up meaning. ►  Leaders of neighboring countries, including Colombia and Mexico, were put on notice by Trump that he could take some kind of action against them, too — a clear warning to fall in line. ►  Trump on Sunday expressed a renewed desire to take over Greenland, claiming the US needs it for security purposes. “This is one of the oldest stories in American history,” said Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at Brown University's Watson School of International and Public Affairs. Maduro shares an important trait with other deposed Central and South American leaders over the past 100 years or so, Kinzer said. “These are leaders who do not accept the right of the United States to dominate their countries and their region,” said Kinzer, author of the book “Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq.” But that's true of some who are US allies. “Mohammed bin Salman (the crown prince of Saudi Arabia) has never won an election and chopped up his main critic into little pieces, but that's fine with us, because he's on our side,” Kinzer said with irony. A unique feature of the Maduro toppling — which may end up being more a decapitation of his regime than a full-scale regime change — is that he was essentially taken rendition-style from Caracas, according to Alexander Downes, director of the Institute for Security and Conflict Studies at George Washington University. See Trump's recent pardon of former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was actually convicted of trafficking drugs into the US. “Kidnapping (rival world leaders) while in office, however, strikes me as a bad idea if not illegal,” said Downes, author of the book “Catastrophic Success: Why Foreign-Imposed Regime Change Goes Wrong.” Downes added that the move may create a new precedent for other countries. How will the US react if China or Russia now simply kidnaps a rival leader? He had been seeking refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama City after US forces, including paratroopers, invaded his small country en masse. Noriega was later tried and convicted in US court, although he won the concession of being treated as a prisoner of war rather than a garden-variety drug trafficker. Venezuela is a much larger country with more rugged terrain. The US invasion of Panama may not be remembered by many Americans, but it cost hundreds of lives in the small country, and its anniversary is now treated as a national day of mourning. Views of the Panama invasion may have turned over time, but it remains among the most successful US regime change operations because it allowed the US to topple Noriega and a democratic government to take over. Defending democracy has long been a stated, if sometimes unbelievable, goal of recent US-led regime change, but Trump does not appear particularly interested in it. In that regard, Trump is recalling the first part of the 20th century, when presidents such as William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft were swinging “big stick” or “gunboat” diplomacy around the Caribbean. As soon as the Spanish were gone, we changed our minds and decided we wanted to rule Cuba,” Kinzer said. He then ticked through other US interventions at the behest of business that led to the overthrow, ouster or resignation of governments during the early 20th century, including in Nicaragua and Honduras. Later, as the Red Scare and Cold War consumed the US, administrations from both parties meddled abroad for more ideological reasons, such as fighting socialism and the spread of communism — but these moves also helped US businesses. Subsequent decades saw military juntas and mass killings. “What looks like an immediate success can turn into a long term failure,” Downes said, pointing to Iran as Exhibit A. “Washington has been dealing with the fallout, including the Iran hostage crisis, Iran's bid for nuclear weapons, and its hostility to Israel for almost 50 years.” The same could be said of the unintended consequences of more recent US actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Decades later, in 1973, the US helped overthrow the democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died in a coup. His successor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, led a repressive right-wing regime. For Trump, who has variously cited drug trafficking, immigration and other justifications for going after Maduro, the end goal may just be power. This is simply about maximizing US security and prosperity,” said Alan Kuperman, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, who has written about regime change. Trump has said he doesn't think opposition leaders can rule. Setting aside values like democracy and human rights, Kuperman said US-led regime change accomplishes its goals about half the time. It does not take much of a leap to see that while Trump mostly talks about drugs, his administration is also very much interested in opening more of Venezuela's oil fields to US companies. Taking out Maduro could be a step to regime change in Cuba. “It's amazing how Cuba has had such a hold on the United States and on the American imagination for so long. This little island has distorted our foreign policy over generations, and it's happening again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said President Donald Trump believes Gov. Leavitt's statement confirms speculation that the federal government is weighing whether to hold Walz responsible for his alleged mishandling of the fraud investigations in his state. “This is all hands on deck, rest assured. It's a top priority for President Trump,” she said on Fox News show Jesse Watters Primetime. 🚨 NEW: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt just went SCORCHED-EARTH on Tim Walz 🔥🚨“This is a man they cannot even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them.”“Trump believes that Governor Walz is criminally liable…… pic.twitter.com/gbEGRII6tK Earlier Monday, Trump suggested Walz would leave office before his second term ends early next year “because he was caught, REDHANDED, along with Ilhan Omar, and others of his Somali friends, stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars.” The president said he felt “certain the facts will come out.” “This is a man who can no longer even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them,” she added. As the Trump administration leads multiple investigations into alleged fraud in Minnesota's social services programs, various federal agencies are taking action; the Department of Health and Human Services froze child care payments going to Somali-run day care centers in the state, and the Department of Agriculture ordered the state to verify households receiving federal food benefits in an attempt to root out fraud. Meanwhile, federal law enforcement is leading an expanded immigration operation in the Minneapolis area. The White House press secretary noted that the Department of Justice has convicted and prosecuted nearly 100 defendants in Minnesota so far, hinting that there may be more charges forthcoming for others based on additional reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul said he once thought Trump was different from the two Bush presidents, who “wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas.” The Kentucky Republican expressed disappointment in Trump's burgeoning alliance with Graham, who is often described as a warmonger by critics. His criticism comes two days after Trump announced the U.S. military bombed Venezuela and detained Maduro, citing allegations that his authoritarian regime facilitated drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. Maduro is currently imprisoned in New York to face federal charges for those crimes. While Paul isn't opposed to the ousting of a socialist leader, he argued that Congress should have approved the operation resulting in Maduro's capture. “Time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost. “Let's hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.” Graham's response to the news about Maduro and Venezuela was much more generous toward Trump. “If you can't celebrate the fact that our military, under President Trump's command, bravely captured and brought to justice an evil, corrupt narcoterrorist dictator with American blood on his hands, then your hatred of President Trump denies you the ability to celebrate making America safer and creating a path for liberating the highly oppressed people of Venezuela,” he said. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, Trump hinted that Colombia and Cuba were next to be met with military force. Graham was present, nodding in agreement with the president. “Cuba is a communist dictatorship that's killed priests and nuns. “There should be a law that Lindsey Graham can only enter the White House every other week and that he's only to meet with mid-level people, not the president. “It's always been an anomaly because Lindsey Graham has been diametrically opposed to everything Trump has ever said on regime change.” Although Latin American nations were quick to denounce Maduro's arrest, some of them have not addressed the threat from Trump and Graham in a meaningful capacity. Cuba remains silent, but Colombian President Gustavo Petro vowed to “take up arms” in the event of a U.S. attack. It remains to be seen whether the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, will remain in power under U.S. control or will be ousted in a similar fashion as her predecessor.</p>

In this image taken from WCPO 9 News video shows officials inspecting broken windows and other property damage at Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home in eastern Cincinnati, Ohio, Monday, Jan. 5, 2026. A man who broke windows at Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home and caused other property damage was detained early Monday, the U.S. Secret Service said. William D. DeFoor, 26, is facing federal charges for allegedly damaging government property, engaging in physical violence against property in a restricted area and assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers, according to the United States Attorney's office in Ohio's southern district. DeFoor was detained shortly after midnight by Secret Service agents assigned to Vance's home, east of downtown Cincinnati, agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. The vice president and his family were not at home, having returned to Washington on Sunday after a weekend there, his office said. DeFoor was detained after he tried to flee from officers on foot. He is accused of causing around $28,000 in damage, the affidavit says. Public records list DeFoor as living in Cincinnati. Calls to the listings for possible relatives and an attorney who previously represented Defoor were not immediately returned. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. “I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home,” Vance tweeted. “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows.” Court records show that DeFoor faced an earlier charge of vandalism in 2024 and agreed to treatment under the county's Mental Health Court system. Throughout Vance's vice presidency, protesters have often gathered outside the home — clashing at one point last spring with Vance himself. He moved to Cincinnati after a stint in Silicon Valley following law school, and his half brother ran unsuccessfully for mayor there last year.
