                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Music Group has signed the latest in a string of contentious deals between major labels and artificial intelligence companies, this time partnering with the chipmaking tech giant Nvidia. The deal opens Universal's enormous catalog to the world's most valuable company: Nvidia will use its AI infrastructure to develop new ways to make, discover, and engage with music, all while protecting artists and rightsholders, a press release claims. At the heart of the partnership is Nvidia's large audio-language model Music Flamingo, designed to develop a “human-like understanding of songs” that accounts for “harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context,” Nvidia's research overview notes. The model's way of parsing “emotional narrative and cultural resonance” will enrich the experience of music discovery, the press release adds (though websites staffed by humans, with emotions and cultures of our own, can help with that too). The prospect of song generation is given less attention, but UMG and Nvidia promise to establish an “artist incubator” where real artists, songwriters, and producers will co-design and test AI-powered tools. According to the press release, the incubator will offer “a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs.” Lucian Grainge, UMG's chair and CEO, said in a statement that Nvidia would protect and respect copyright and human creativity. Richard Kerris, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of media, reiterated Grainge's assertion and added, “We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe—conversational, contextual, and genuinely interactive.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After landing Scarlett Johansson for a new role in The Batman Part II, director Matt Reeves looks to have snagged one of her Avengers co-stars for another new role in the upcoming sequel. Sources tell Deadline Sebastian Stan is in talks to join the highly-anticipated DC Studios sequel in a role which is unknown. If a deal closes, he would join Robert Pattinson, who is set to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader in the upcoming sequel that Reeves is writing and directing. The DC Studios pic is set to start production in the spring and will open in theaters on October 1, 2027. DC Co-bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran are producing. Reeves' The Batman was the first mega theatrical blockbuster for Warner Bros post-Covid after implementing a day-and-date release strategy on HBO Max. He also was recently seen in his critically acclaimed role as Donald Trump in The Apprentice, which earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the part.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allie got lots of screen time during the season 13 premiere on January 4, 2026, from her reunion with friends in Hope Valley to her slowly developing romance with Oliver. Miller, who's now 19, has stretched herself as an actress over the last couple of years with emotionally raw scenes on the series and by taking on additional movie roles. Her Hallmark colleagues have definitely noticed; some of the series' biggest stars have commented in recent weeks about how proud and impressed they are with Miller's growth, excited to see what she does next. “Our characters can go a long time before getting to have scenes together on the show,” he said of Hickam and Allie. Rosenbaum said Miller was so good playing a different and more vivacious character, Starla, that she “stole some scenes” in the movie. Rosenbaum added a cute GIF to his tweet, with a clip of comedian Billy Eichner aggressively stating, “You are overflowing with talent and I admire you!” In “When Calls the Heart,” longtime Hallmark star Kevin McGarry plays Allie's uncle and adoptive dad, Hope Valley Mountie Nathan Grant. He told the audience, “When Jaeda came on to … our show, seven years ago or whatever? I have seen Jaeda, because I work so closely with her, not only grow up as an actor, but as a person, as well, and bring all these life experiences that she's had to work and play off (of), and I've just seen her become this incredible actress.” “You don't get that (while working) on a four-week movie,” McGarry continued, adding that Miller has “an incredible storyline” for season 13, “and I can't wait for all you guys to see it.” Krakow, who happens to be married to Rosenbaum in real life, was part of the same Hallmark Christmas Experience panel as McGarry, and the “Suspenders Unbuttoned” podcast posted video (above) of her comments about working with Miller. Miller also took on a gritty role in the July 2025 Lifetime movie “Before Your Father Finds Us,” co-starring Hallmark alum Alexa PenaVega.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fortunately (or not, depending on your expectations of a Marvel movie), only the latter is the focus of the latest Marvel teaser, which reunites Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto for some threats over the King's Game. That's all I know for sure,” says McKellen in a voice-over as chess pieces move over a board telekinetically. “The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' We've known at least since the infamous chair reveal that McKellen and Stewart would return for Avengers: Doomsday, but this is the first visual proof we've had that these two pre-MCU franchise stars are back in the blue void for the next film. James Marsden as Cyclops also gets a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at the end of the clip. He was also confirmed at the chair announcement last March. “I've spent 20 years listening to people say, ‘When are you coming back? '” the actor told Vanity Fair last August. I'm going to have a tough time struggling to get into costume if they waited a couple more years… it's been a blast.” Avengers: Doomsday is slated for release on December 16, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The collaboration will allow fans and artists to go in-depth on the music they love and create an artist incubator to explore AI in human creation. The Universal Music Group has inked a new partnership with AI chipmaking giant NVIDIA “to pioneer responsible AI for music discovery, creation and engagement,” the companies announced today (Jan. 6). Much of that collaboration will center on NVIDIA's Music Flamingo initiative, launched in November, which allows for in-depth analysis of music below the surface level, digging into elements such as harmony, musical structure, tempo, instrumentation, key, lyricism, musical theory, cultural and historical context and dynamics, among other metrics, including things like emotional resonance and chord progressions. Universal sees that as being additive to the musical discovery process for fans — allowing for deeper connections to different songs, albums or artists based on more than just genre, scene or surface-level signifiers. It also sees it as additive for artists — who can now use it for in-depth analyses of their own works — as well as for fans to more deeply engage in the music they already love, in addition to finding new music that resonates. We look forward to working closely with NVIDIA to direct AI's unprecedented transformational potential towards the service of artists and their fans as we work together to set new standards for innovation within the industry, while protecting and respecting copyright and human creativity.” That last part — human creativity — will be addressed in a second part of the partnership, which will involve a dedicated artist incubator supported by both UMG and NVIDIA. “By prioritizing hands-on artist involvement, the incubator develops solutions that enhance originality and authenticity — serving as a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs, and placing artists at the center of responsible AI innovation,” the companies said in a press release. That will also extend to creative labs in UMG's existing studios around the world, and UMG will utilize NVIDIA's AI capabilities within its corporate structure, too. The NVIDIA deal follows other AI agreements that UMG has cut with companies, including Splice, Udio, KLAY, BandLab and more. “We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual and genuinely interactive,” NVIDIA's vp/GM of media Richard Kerris said in a statement. “By extending NVIDIA's Music Flamingo with UMG's unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem, we're going to change how fans discover, understand and engage with music on a global scale.</p>

Now in its third year, The Popcorn List (TPL), an annual survey of acclaimed feature films currently without wide release, is offering up 25 films recommended by film festival programmers from across the United States. Those titles include some of our favorite films of the year, like Annapurna Sriram's “Fucktoys,” Brittany Shyne's “Seeds,” and Ian Bell's “WTO/99.” Founded in 2024 as a discovery and visibility project to amplify independent films that deserve a wider audience, TPL has quickly grown. Related Stories ‘The Housemaid' Is Already Getting a Sequel Production Designer Jack Fisk Could Never Have Enough Ping Pong Tables in ‘Marty Supreme' TPL exists as both an open, online database (check out its website right here) and as a Pop Up Series, bringing “fresh, hot films” to audiences around the country via sneak-peek screenings at art house cinemas and through a virtual format. Some stats: four films were recommended by more than one programmer, and 10 are included as Special Mentions (due to their distribution and release plans, or other mitigating factors). “As more filmmakers confront the flaws of the traditional system, TPL has likewise evolved its understanding of what ‘distribution' can mean. And that could look more like a choose-your-own-adventure model,” said TPL co-founder Lela Meadow-Conner in an official statement. “We've expanded our thinking around what ‘wide release' means to TPL: has the average viewer in any given U.S. city had access to your film at their local theater, on broadcast or VOD? We applaud filmmakers who are taking matters into their own hands, and recognize the value of their work.” “The opportunity to work with eight film teams to bring their films to audiences across the U.S. was a natural extension of TPL's mission,” said Kathy Susca, of The Film Collaborative, TPL's partner in the series and its fiscal sponsor.) We're emphasizing building the TPL brand for general audiences as a marker of quality, independent films that they can't find anywhere else.” You can also check out the Official List for full film information, festival programmer statements, festival premiere and awards, trailers, reviews, contact information, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The minute-long teaser, just released by Marvel, features Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his old nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) reuniting over a game of chess. McKellen, in his inimitable voice, intones: “Death comes for us all. The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' The trailer then cuts to Cyclops, played by James Marsden, tearing off his visor and unleashing the signature red beam from his eyes. The trio of actors, who first appeared together in 2000's X-Men, were all confirmed as part of the Doomsday cast last year. The Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to showings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie, premiering on December 18, 2026. Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.799 billion at the global box office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As long as we've known about him, we've heard that Robin Hood's thing is that he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. “People speak of Robin Hood, tell his stories… they're all lies,” we hear early in the clip. Of course, it's Robin Hood (Hugh Jackman) himself telling us these things, so perhaps he has an ulterior motive. “Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last,” reads an official synopsis for the film. “In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.” From the looks of it, at least some of this salvation will come from Robin's relationship with a little girl whom he teaches to use a bow and arrow. This leaves him conflicted, given his new distaste for murder and pillaging, so he later promises to keep her safe. The Death Of Robin Hood comes from A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig director and screenwriter Michael Sarnoski. Jackman stars alongside Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe. The film is slated for a 2026 release, though there's no firm theatrical release date as of this writing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Video Music Awards, when I grew up, was the thing,” Charles, 54, told Jimmy Fallon on Monday night's (Jan. 5) Tonight Show. Celine Dion Joins TikTok With Silly Video In Which She Reveals 'Suddenly I'm Becoming Cool' Now, here's where things got a bit dicey. Fallon asked Best Medicine star Charles about rumors that he “got into a fight” with Swift's fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, on the set of the video, a tale Hawke first shared last year on the Rich Eisen Show. During that appearance, Hawke said that Baltimore Ravens superfan Charles would not leave Kelce alone about the Chiefs' heartbreaking 17-10 win over Baltimore in the 2024 AFC Championship game. Specifically, Charles was worked up about a specific call he thought went the wrong way, with Hawke counseling his fellow actor to “let it go,” even as he praised Kelce being “super polite” about the awkward interaction. But that year they beat us in the AFC Championship game — they beat the Ravens — he was a real jerk that year. Describing the mood on set of the clip that also featured co-vocalist Post Malone, Charles said when he met Kelce he was blunt about his assessment of the sure-fire future football hall of famer, telling him, “‘You know I always liked you and this year you were kind of a d–k. Fallon couldn't believe it, shocked that Charles would confront the three-time Super Bowl champ, and legendarily good guy baller, saying, “You said that to Travis Kelce? He's one of the most lovable people I know!” “He got one of our veterans to commit a personal foul. In the end, Charles admitted that Kelce was “actually great. We talked all different kinds of football… Such a good dude. I really like him a lot.” And even though Charles now really likes Kelce the man, when it comes to the gridiron, the star said his feelings still run purple, black, gold and red. “I'll root against him,” Charles doubled-down of the football star who may have played his final game on Sunday, which the Chiefs lost in a 14-12 heartbreaker against the three-win Las Vegas Raiders. And while Charles' beloved Ravens won't be making a Super Bowl run this year, he can take solace that Kelce will also be watching from home as the Chiefs will miss the playoffs for the first time in a decade this year after a dismal 6-11 season.

Michael Sarnoski is just two films into his directing career, but everything he has touched so far has turned to gold. assignment into a box office phenomenon with “A Quiet Place: Day One.” But his upcoming film “The Death of Robin Hood” seems like his most ambitious project yet.

After “The Death of Robin Hood” comes out, Sarnoski will turn his attention to a packed development slate that includes an adaptation of Hideo Kojima's acclaimed video game “Death Stranding” for A24. In a 2024 interview with IndieWire, the filmmaker also expressed openness to returning to the world of “A Quiet Place” while making it clear that he wants to balance original projects with his work on existing franchises. “I'm definitely going to do something original next, [but] one of the great things about the ‘Quiet Place' universe is that you have this sort of fundamental creature, and beyond that, you can explore any human story you want to in that world,” Sarnoski said. “I would definitely be open to that if I found that kind of in again, but you can tell a thousand different stories in this world because it's just about the characters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several of the network's most prolific movie directors have posted tributes to Atchison, including her dear friend Gail Harvey, who shared via Facebook on January 5, 2026, that she'd been “crying off and on now for four days” over Atchison's passing. Harvey, who worked with Atchison on seven movies, including “Christmas on Cherry Lane” and “Happy Holidays From Cherry Lane,” wrote that Atchison had been hospitalized over the holidays for an undisclosed illness, noting, “I was hoping to fly to Vancouver when I got home to see her one time but she was gone so quickly. Oliver wrote, “As a script supervisor on half a dozen of my movies filmed in Vancouver, Canada, Holly was an integral part of my directing team, responsible for everything from timing to logic to story elements, and she did it with charm and skill and the kind of creative integrity we seem to be losing in our industry.” We shared a love for our pups and a good martini, and without her in my life it is safe to say that what I refer to as my ‘career' wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as much fun. Another longtime Hallmark director, David Winning, also shared his heartbreak via Facebook on January 4, writing that he and Atchison had worked on 12 movies and two series together, including Hallmark's “The Nine Kittens of Christmas” and “Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead.” Sharing multiple photos of them on set over the years, Winning wrote, “My Rock xo So sad to hear this news. From the top of Frosty Mountains at Manning, to boxes full of Christmas KITTENS to OUTER SPACE | By my side for SO MANY years. Winning's tribute received over 100 comments from people in the industry stunned to learn of Atchison's death, including La Vonne Girard, a longtime Hallmark movie set decorator who wrote, “Oh my goodness. Holly, Bob and I worked on sooooo many projects together. As a script supervisor, Atchison was responsible for ensuring continuity from scene to scene, closely monitoring the dialogue and set from filming through editing. Her first script supervisor jobs in the 90s, according to IMDb, included working on hit feature films like “Ace Venture: When Nature Calls” and four episodes of “Stargate SG-1.” In addition to working behind the scenes on all eight episodes of Hallmark's 2024 series “Holidazed” and a 2019 episode of “When Calls The Heart,” Atchison worked on over 30 Hallmark movies.

The saga of Mickey Rourke‘s latest round of financial woes has taken another bizarre turn as the actor has released a video denouncing a GoFundMe set up in his name by his longtime manager, allegedly with his permission. The fundraiser, launched early Sunday morning, is nearing its $100,000 goal — money meant to help Rourke remain in his home after being served an eviction notice for falling $60,000 behind in rent. Mickey Rourke's Manager Reveals Details Behind Actor's Controversial GoFundMe Mickey Rourke Approves GoFundMe to Prevent Eviction (Exclusive) “Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger,” he continues. As reported exclusively by The Hollywood Reporter, the account was created by Liya-Joelle Jones, assistant to Kimberly Hines, Rourke's manager for a decade. Hines and Jones both told THR that the GoFundMe was created “with Mickey's permission.” Hines now tells THR that Rourke may not have been completely clear on the details of how a GoFundMe works and is now embarrassed that the effort has become worldwide news. Rourke, however, is denying any knowledge of who created the fundraiser and insists he would never turn to fans for financial help, an act of desperation he calls “humiliating,” “I would never ask strangers or fans for a nickel,” Rourke says. It's humiliating and fucking embarrassing… I want you to get your money back. “There's only one person I can think of that would do such a thing. Speaking to THR from Europe, Hines details the events that led to the GoFundMe launch and offers more background on Rourke's current living situation.

In a video posted to Instagram on Monday night, Rourke said he is “frustrated” and “confused” by the situation. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger. I don't go to outside sources like that.” He added that it is “embarrassing.” “But I'm sure I'll get over it like anything else,” Rourke said.

I don't want anybody to send me money. I want you to get your money back.” As of early this morning, the GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $97,000. The page states, “Life doesn't always move in a straight line, and despite everything Mickey has given through his work and his life, he is now dealing with a challenging financial moment that has put his housing at risk. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent eviction.” “Mickey is going through a very difficult time right now, and it's been incredibly touching to see how many people care about him and want to help,” she said.

While Rourke has continued to maintain a steady stream of roles over the past decade, he's largely appeared in direct-to-video films. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimmel reminded viewers that Trump hosted the the Kennedy Center Honors, which aired in December to notably low ratings. “After boasting about what a great host he is and how much better he is than I am and how huge his ratings would be, Trump hosted the lowest rated Kennedy Center Honors telecast of all time,” Kimmel said. He added, “I'd hate to be the White House intern who had to tear that headline out of all the papers and eat 'em. left for its break, Trump posted on Truth Social 556 times. “Behold the ramblings of a madman,” he said, displaying all of the social media posts on a video wall behind him. “He was in an especially festive mood on Christmas Eve.” That evening, Trump threatened to “terminate” the broadcast licenses of news networks and late-night shows. “This is the vision of sugar plums that are dancing in his head as he goes to sleep,” Kimmel quipped. Trump then posted, “Merry Christmas to all, including the many sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein.” Trump closed his Christmas Eve post with, “Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.” “What is he trying to tell us?” Kimmel asked. Elsewhere in his monologue, Kimmel recounted how Trump enlisted Vanilla Ice to perform at his New Year's Eve party for the third time in five years. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time And that lasted for just under two days. Kimmel closed his monologue by taking the cognitive test that Trump has repeatedly bragged about acing. “Let's find out just how difficult this big, beautiful test is,” Kimmel said. “And how my brain stacks up against our stable genius president's.” Spoiler alert: Kimmel received a perfect score. “So I could be president,” he confirmed.

He added, “Most of all, I want to thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump, without whom we would be going home empty-handed tonight. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's hard, these days, to move through the world feeling optimistic. But I've more often found myself hitting play on The Velvet Underground and Rowan, a brilliant and irreverent underground pop album released last summer that's edgy but not irony-poisoned, silly but not unserious, darkly funny and giddily joyful. Its 14 songs, totaling just over 30 minutes, brought the skip back to my step and the song back to my heart like little else in recent memory. Fincham and Miles are part of the '00s-fetishizing London scene that tangentially includes fakemink and Bassvictim, but The Velvet Underground and Rowan makes the pair feel like a scene of two: They may give entertaining and slightly crazy interviews, maintain messy Instagram pages, and put on hyped shows with little advance notice—and Fincham may live, or have lived, with Bassvictim's Ike Clateman—but their music is a melange of hyper-uncool early-'10s indie references and pathos-heavy lyrics, delivered with Donny & Marie Osmond-level chumminess. In this sense, The Velvet Underground and Rowan feels of a piece with Callahan & Witscher's Think Differently, pairing two underground musicians who put a cheeky, throw-everything-at-the-wall spin on relatively unfasionable sounds. But where Callahan & Witscher use their '90s rock pastiche in service of blackpilled anti-Boomkat nihilism, Fincham and Miles seem like optimists. “Wrote this song just so you'd know/To love yourself no matter what,” yelps Miles on the sweet, glitchy “Love Yourself,” before, a few verses later: “Leo wrote this song for you/Sorry that I fucked your dude.” Fincham's production is inherently bright, and his maximalist approach allows for surprising emotional range: The glitch-pop of “B-Side Story” and “Sound-waves” is dazed bordering on goofy, while “Hey Marshmallow” is directional and euphoric, building toward a punch-the-air orchestral hook halfway through. (Someone is screaming in the background at the same time; it doesn't sound like David Comes to Life, but it does sound like what I remember David Comes to Life as sounding like.) “You can press skip, pause, and add it to a playlist!” A lot of so-called indie sleaze warrants blasé nihilism because it sounds louche and unbothered. “Do you still want me to stay in this room where you keep the window closed/Lay in bed and blow your loads?” she sings. “Nut on me, nut on me/Can't you ever do it on me?” It is a deeply unromantic love song for exceptionally unromantic times, rendered with nostalgia for a time when couples like Matt & Kim and Dave Longstreth and Amber Coffman were headlining festivals. It's easy to be skeptical about music that's so indebted to past sounds when a good chunk of what's being released now is designed as a game of spot-the-reference. The Velvet Underground and Rowan is more confrontational than your average pastiche: Rather than imagine a universe in which they were hitting Misshapes at 14 or palling around with Uffie and Busy P, Fincham and Miles have chosen to trawl the depths of that scene's less cool, far less sexy aftermath. It might feel awkward to look back on that period now, but Worldpeace DMT and Rowan Please find pleasure in the discomfort.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Field of Dreams” alum Amy Madigan, who pulled off a surprise supporting actress win for her work as Aunt Gladys in the horror film “Weapons,” breezed into the winners circle with a glazed donut in hand. After some requests from photographers, she reluctantly swapped the pastry for her silver starred trophy, waving it around and hamming it up for the cameras. Ah, I don't care!” she said with a giggle. “KPop Demon Hunters” singer-songwriter Ejae, who took home best original song for the smash hit “Golden” alongside Mark Sonnenblick, reflected on how the song has evolved over the past year. It gave me hope that one day my dreams would come true. In the TV world, “The Studio” won big for lead actor Seth Rogen, supporting actor Ike Barinholtz and best comedy series.

As a screen in the press room showed Jacob Elordi taking the stage for his “Frankenstein” supporting actor win, Rogen quipped, “Elordi won? Barinholz was quick to correct Rogen's literary faux-pas: “He's not Frankenstein! Jimmy Kimmel, who snagged the award for outstanding talk show, took a moment to ask some questions of his own to the photographers and reporters in the room. You all take the exact same picture of me, then it's a competition to see whose photos get used?” After a resounding “yes” from the peanut gallery, he quipped: “And do you all hate each other?” to laughs from all the photographers (who assured him that they prefer to help each other out, not just compete for the best shot). Not every winner made their way to the backstage press room: the Leonardo DiCaprio-led “One Battle After Another” crew, which took home trophies for best picture and best director Paul Thomas Anderson, opted to skip the photo op, as did “Marty Supreme” best actor victor Timothée Chalamet.</p>
