                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation today revealed compelling new research pointing to major healthcare access challenges and financial burdens disproportionately affecting young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The national survey, conducted by the Foundation, assessed healthcare and financial experiences across three groups: young adults aged 18-25, adults aged 26-64, and caregivers of pediatric patients under 18. The findings, published today in Crohn's & Colitis 360, are based on responses from over 1,700 IBD patients and caregivers. These numbers demonstrate a clear gap in support and guidance for young adults as they transition from pediatric care and begin managing their own health insurance. Laura Wingate, Chief Education, Support & Advocacy Officer, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation "The research highlights a need for targeted educational resources, improved insurance navigation assistance, and policy attention to mitigate the unique challenges faced by young adults with IBD," said the study's lead author, Ross Maltz, MD, pediatric gastroenterologist, Nationwide Children's Hospital. The Foundation is calling on partners, advocates, and the broader healthcare community to help amplify these findings and promote equitable access to care for all age groups.

The information contained is for informational purposes only and should not be considered validated by independent peer assessment. An antibody activates the immune system's cellular and cytoplasmic defence to combat a pathogen. This occurs via interactions of the Fc (CH2-CH3) region to activate three effector function pathways and impacts half-life of antibody (Figure 1). All three effector function pathways and half-life mechanism triggered by the Fc region. Image Credit: Damelang et al "Impact of structural modifications of IgG antibodies on effector functions", Diagram created on BioRender Bridge the gap in literature by producing combined Fc effector function and half-life extension mutations to investigate how these may affect the biophysical/functional properties of the therapeutic mAb being developed. All Phase III mutants have been developed on the Trastuzumab backbone. These were characterised by a range of biophysical and functional assays. Q combined mutations have also reported a lower melting temperature (Tm). Mutation D is hydrophobic and introduces hydrophobicity in Fc combination mutants. * Q is a half-life extension tested in previous phases of the effector function toolbox. * R is a CDC increasing mutation, also tested in previous phases. * P is a mutation that reduces all effector functions, also tested in previous phases. Trastuzumab Fc mutants were screened for their functional activity on the following assays: Note: Refer to Table 1 for Fc mutations nomenclature, described in the below results.

It has not undergone peer review but has been reviewed to meet AZoNetwork's editorial quality standards. The information contained is for informational purposes only and should not be considered validated by independent peer assessment. Digital microfluidics enables highly miniaturized electroporation for cell engineering. DropGenie digital microfluidic (DMF) cartridges (left) use patterned electrodes and a modular top plate to manipulate nanoliter-scale droplets. Cross-sectional schematic (bottom) illustrates the DMF architecture, with cells and reagents confined between the coated top plate and PCB substrate. This platform enables 100× miniaturization compared to conventional systems, reducing input requirements to as few as 10,000 cells per edit. Guides are deposited onto the DropGenie Chip using an ECHO acoustic dispenser (BCLS), and cells with payload are loaded into the cartridge with a Liquid Handler (Integra Assist+). The system runs with user-defined parameters, after which cells are plated for culture and recovery. Transfection efficiency is then assessed via flow cytometry, sequencing, or fluorescence microscopy. Miniaturized DMF electroporation enables efficient TRAC knockout in primary human T cells. Representative flow cytometry gating strategy (top left) shows singlet, live, and CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cell populations used to quantify TCRα/β knockout efficiency. Example plots demonstrate loss of TCR expression following TRAC sgRNA editing compared to non-targeting control (NTC). Editing efficiency (top right) was robust in both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ subsets, reaching ~88–90 % KO across 40 replicates, while controls exhibited only background signal. Cell viability (bottom left) remained >90 % across all conditions. Summary statistics (bottom right) confirm high knockout efficiency with low variability (CD4⁺ mean 88.4 % ± 4.9 %; CD8⁺ mean 89.8 % ± 4.2 %) and strong reproducibility across donors. A total of 10,000 cells per edit were used, representing a 100× reduction in input compared to conventional electroporation systems. Platform used for Research Use Only (RUO). DropGenie has optimized the miniaturization and parallelization of cell engineering reactions using patented chip technology. This is achieved by precisely delivering a wide range of editing reagents into diverse cell types at low volumes, enabled through intelligent tuning of electrical parameters and a proprietary electrode configuration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Sophie O'Neil, Kyle Thompson, Rita Pereira, Emily Russell and Stuart McElroy and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with BioAscent Discovery Ltd and University of Glasgow. It has not undergone peer review but has been reviewed to meet AZoNetwork's editorial quality standards. The information contained is for informational purposes only and should not be considered validated by independent peer assessment. Multiple HEK-293T cell lines stably expressing human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors were generated at BioAscent via cationic lipid-mediated transfection and Hygromycin B selection. Receptor expression levels were quantified in all clones by RT-qPCR, and three clones per receptor were progressed, based on a range of expression levels (Figure 1), for full pharmacological characterisation using intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation FLIPR (Figure 2) and xCELLigence label-free impedance (Figure 3) assays. Quantification of 5-HT2A/5-HT2B receptor expression by RT-qPCR. 10 ng of cDNA was used for qPCR with PowerUpTM SYBR Green Master Mix. Transcript levels were normalised to GAPDH and expressed relative to the lowest expressing clone using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Mean triplicate expression data ± SEM is shown. Schematic overview of the Ca2+ mobilization assay. Image Credit: Adapted from product insert R8190, Molecular Devices, 2019. Principle of the cellular impedance xCELLigence assay. Mean duplicate data from three independent runs (n=2/N=3) is shown ± SEM. 5-HT2 agonists produce positive dose-dependent impedance responses. Normalised cell index traces (A, C) from 5-HT2A Clone #1 following stimulation with 5-HT (A) and Psilocin (C). Normalised cell index values were converted to ‘% Impedance Response' relative to the baseline and 10 μM 5-HT responses, and plotted as dose-response curves for 5-HT2A Clones #1 and #2 (B; 5-HT, D; Psilocin). The 5-HT2A inverse agonist, Volinanserin, produces a negative dose-dependent impedance response in 5-HT2A clones with high receptor reserves. Baseline normalised cell index values for all three clones were plotted against Volinanserin concentration, to generate inverse agonist dose-response curves (D) at the peak negative impedance response. We show that differences in receptor levels significantly alters the pharmacological profiles of 5-HT2A/2B ligands across different assay technologies. Failure to account for receptor density/reserves may lead to underestimation of partial agonism/inverse agonism and off-target toxicity in pre-clinical screens, especially for CNS-active compounds like psilocin/norpsilocin. These findings underscore the necessity to incorporate multiple physiologically-relevant models and assay approaches into pre-clinical drug safety/efficacy profiling, to ensure accurate predictions of clinical outcomes.

With no vaccine against it, this study aims to design a multi-epitope vaccine to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. The researchers have screened the full proteome (5,563 proteins) to identify non-human homologous, stable, non-allergenic, adhesive, and immunogenic proteins. Furthermore, shortlisted proteins (Probable coat protein A of bacteriophage Pf1, alkaline phosphatase L, and a secreted protein) were evaluated for B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes. Six multi-epitope constructs (DV1–DV6) with different adjuvants were designed, followed by structural validation and assessment through docking with TLR2/TLR4 and molecular dynamics simulation studies. Among them, DV5 (HBHA-conserved adjuvant) showed the strongest receptor interactions, high stability, and 98.47 % predicted global HLA coverage. Hence, our results conclude that DV5 is a promising multi-epitope vaccine candidate against P. aeruginosa, utilizing reverse vaccinology in combating MDR pathogens. RMSD and RMSF analysis confirmed DV5 as the most stable construct, with strong structural integrity and receptor binding. a Projected population coverageb Avg no. of epitope hits / HLA combinations recognized by populationc Min no.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The maternal microbiome and immune system have both independent and synergistic effects on fetal brain health - changes in the mother's immune system have been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The research team, led by Brian Kalish, MD, Physician in Medicine in the Division of Newborn Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital, discovered notable sex-specific responses, including vulnerability for a specific immune pathway in the male brain that could be a potential target for early intervention. Our study establishes a detailed spatial transcriptomic resource of immune gene networks during a critical window of embryonic brain development. Unlike previous atlases focused on the adult brain, our dataset captures dynamic immune signaling interactions at a stage when the brain is highly vulnerable." The team integrated in situ spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) with single cell RNA-seq data. This dual-modality approach enabled them to (1) create a developmental cell atlas of immune gene expression in the embryonic mouse brain during mid- and late-gestation; (2) map the spatial location of neurodevelopmental-relevant genes in the developing brain; (3) reveal sex-specific responses of the developing brain to maternal gut-immune disruptions; (4) nominate a specific pathway – known as the CXCL12/CXCR7 signaling pathway - as an important mediator of abnormal neural differentiation. "As a neonatologist, this work adds to our understanding early-life environmental factors that may impact neurodevelopmental potential and lends insights for potential interventions", added Kalish. Spatial transcriptomics of the developing mouse brain immune landscape reveals effects of maternal immune activation and microbiome depletion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who were in endoscopic remission, achieving intestinal ultrasound (IUS) transmural healing was associated with decreased risks for CD relapse, hospitalization, and perianal complications. Absence of transmural healing was associated with relapse. Intestinal ultrasound transmural healing “could become a new target in CD patients, reflecting a broader shift from endoscopic remission toward objective measures of deeper remission,” the authors wrote. It was published online in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics. The study was limited by the lack of centralized reading for endoscopies and IUS. Only patients with mucosal healing were included. The study did not report any specific funding. Two authors reported receiving consultant and lecture fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team from the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) has uncovered a key biological mechanism that explains how exercise maintain strong bones, paving the way for novel treatments for osteoporosis and bone loss in people who are unable to engage. 'Current treatments rely heavily on physical activity, which many patients simply cannot perform. This study is a critical step towards that goal.' According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 suffer a fracture due to weak bones. In Hong Kong, the problem is significant as the population ages, with 45% of women and 13% of men aged 65 and above affected by osteoporosis. Ageing involves the natural weakening of bones, which become less dense and more porous. Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow have the potential to develop into either fat cells or bone tissue. These stem cells are highly sensitive to external factors, like exercise and pressure. During the ageing process, they tend to differentiate into fat cells. This switch acts like an exercise sensor, detecting mechanical signals from physical activity that helps keep bones strong and preventing them from becoming frail as we age. Conversely, when this protein is missing, it triggers signals that cause stem cells to accumulate fat, leading to increased bone loss. The absence of Piezo1 also promotes the release of certain pro-inflammatory signals (Ccl2 and lipocalin-2), making stem cells more likely to convert into fat cells, which hinders bone formation. Blocking these signals can help restore bone health. 'We have essentially decoded how the body converts movement into stronger bones,' said Professor Xu Aimin. This gives us a clear target for intervention. Dr. Wang Baile, Research Assistant Professor from the same department, who co-led the research, added, 'This discovery is especially meaningful for older individuals and patients who cannot exercise due to frailty, injury or chronic illness. Our findings open the door to developing "exercise mimetics" - drugs that chemically activate the Piezo1 pathway to help maintain bone mass and support independence.' 'This offers a promising strategy beyond traditional physical therapy,' remarked Professor Eric Honoré, Team Leader at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, French National Centre for Scientific Research, who co-led the research. 'In the future, we could potentially provide the biological benefits of exercise through targeted treatments, thereby slowing bone loss in vulnerable groups such as the bedridden patients or those with limited mobility, and substantially reducing their risk of fractures.' The research team is now working to translate these findings into clinical applications, with the goal of developing new treatments to preserve bone health and improve the quality of life for an aging population and those confined to bed. Piezo1 activation suppresses bone marrow adipogenesis to prevent osteoporosis by inhibiting a mechanoinflammatory autocrine loop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hepatic IRI occurs when blood flow is temporarily cut off and then restored-common during liver resection or transplant-triggering oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. While antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have shown some benefit, effective clinical therapies remain limited." The team's findings demonstrate that nicotinic acid matches or even exceeds NAC's protective effects by targeting the root cause: damaged mitochondria. In experiments using both mice and primary hepatocytes, pretreatment with nicotinic acid markedly lowered markers of liver injury (ALT, AST, LDH), suppressed inflammation, and reduced cell death driven by ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death. "It did not just act as an antioxidant-it actively promoted mitophagy (the cleanup of broken mitochondria) and mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new ones)," says Yao. "This dual action stabilized the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, boosted ATP production, and rebalanced cellular redox status." The authors noted that given its safety, low cost, and widespread availability, nicotinic acid could be rapidly translated into clinical use-potentially improving outcomes for patients undergoing liver surgery. Human trials are now being planned to confirm these benefits in real-world settings. Nicotinic acid protects against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury via suppressing mitochondrial damage-induced ferroptosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every year, millions of infants and children undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the world. Its exposure during brain development has been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and cause cognitive dysfunction in animal models. Normal neurogenesis constitutes the neurobiological foundation for higher-order brain functions, such as learning and memory. Lipid metabolism is crucial for the regulation of neurogenesis. "Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) is a key molecule in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and PPARα serves as the principal regulatory factor of CPT1a. However, the potential alterations in FAO mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/CPT1a pathway in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) following sevoflurane exposure, and its potential role in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive dysfunction, remain unclear. NSPCs, NE-4C cells, and postnatal day 7 rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 hours. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify whether sevoflurane exposure inhibits neurogenesis. The Morris water maze was employed to explore whether sevoflurane exposure impairs cognitive function. Untargeted lipidomics, FAOBlue staining, RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, CPT1a enzyme activity assay, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to validate the impact of sevoflurane exposure on FAO in NSPCs. Octanoate pretreatment, CPT1a overexpression, PPARα agonist palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and FAO substrate carnitine pretreatment were collectively employed to reveal the role of FAO and PPARα in NSPCs on sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment. In NSPCs, sevoflurane exposure caused extensive changes in lipid metabolism intermediates, inhibited the mRNA expression of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), acyl-CoA oxidase 3 (ACOX3), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase beta subunit (HADHB), CPT1a, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short-chain (ACADS), and solute carrier family 22 member 5 (SLC22A5), suppressed FAO activity, and decreased the protein expression and activity of CPT1a. Enhancing FAO activity in NSPCs attenuated sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis impairment. Previous work has not investigated whether or how FAO participates in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive decline. Our study showed that sevoflurane inhibited neurogenesis and impaired cognitive function likely by inhibiting FAO in NSPCs through the PPARα/CPT1a pathway.This study reveals a new potential mechanism of sevoflurane neurodevelopmental toxicity. Future research is needed to clarify the role of FAO in NSPCs in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment, and to explore the mechanisms that execute this FAO-dependent effect. Sevoflurane impairs neurogenesis and cognitive function by inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation in neural stem/progenitor cells of neonatal rats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They applied detailed data on the dynamics of the two infectious diseases to a computer model to simulate their spread using known patterns of air travel and commuting, as well as potential superspreading events. They focused on over three hundred metropolitan areas in the U.S. In the simulations, both pandemics were widely circulating in most of the metro areas within weeks, before government interventions or early case detection. Their spread was largely driven by air travel rather than commuting, though random dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, which makes it hard to predict where the outbreaks will happen in real time. Expanding wastewater surveillance coverage coupled with effective infection control could potentially slow the initial spread of future pandemics." Sen Pei, PhD, study's senior author, assistant professor of environmental health sciences, Columbia Mailman School Many studies have pointed to the benefits of wastewater surveillance programs. Beyond reconstructing the historical spread of the last two pandemics, the study also provides a generalizable framework to infer early epidemic dynamics that may be applied to other pathogens. While mobility, particularly air travel, is a key driver of pandemic spread, the researchers caution that other factors also play a role, including community demographics, school schedules, winter holidays, and weather conditions.
