                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new paper posits that advanced alien civilizations may communicate through subtle flashes, like fireflies do on Earth. The thought experiment suggests that we need to avoid human biases in our search for extraterrestrial life. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. However, while this thought experiment raises interesting questions about alien intelligence, it does not provide any evidence that these signals actually exist. So far, the quest to uncover alien intelligence has focused on finding evidence of distant human-like civilizations. However, some scientists believe that these searches suffer from an "anthropocentric bias" — meaning we're trying to understand nonhuman entities through a distinctly human lens — and do not account for potential civilizations that are wholly different from our own. Due to this bias, we may be overlooking promising signs of life. In the new study, uploaded Nov. 8 to the preprint server arXiv, researchers proposed a new way that an alien civilization could communicate — by flashing to one another like fireflies. These flashing signals could be used for specific and complex communications. However, the researchers argue that they are more likely being widely broadcast to other civilizations, like a luminous repeating beacon. (This paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but is now under consideration for publication in the journal PNAS.) On Earth, fireflies communicate via a series of regularly repeating flashes caused by internal chemical reactions. But while these signals are simple, they do allow distinct firefly species to tell each other apart. The researchers argue that similar flashing could be used as "here we are" signals by an alien civilization. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In the new paper, researchers analyzed the flashes of more than 150 pulsars — rapidly spinning, highly magnetized neutron stars that shoot out regular beams of electromagnetic radiation — as a proxy for what these signals may look like. The study team argues that these signals could be more likely to evolve in long-lasting alien civilizations that progress past the need for widespread use of radio waves. A similar progression is already happening on Earth, where the use of communications satellites with more specific and concentrated radio signals is making our planet appear more "radio quiet" from afar, the researchers wrote. —Alien 'warp drives' may leave telltale signals in the fabric of space-time, new paper claims —7 potential 'alien megastructures' spotted in our galaxy are not what they seem "Communication is a fundamental feature of life across lineages and manifests in a wonderful diversity of forms and strategies," study co-author Estelle Janin, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, recently told Universe Today. "Taking non-human communication into account is essential if we want to broaden our intuition and understanding about what alien communication could look like, and what a theory of life ought to explain." This is just one example of what non-human signals may look like, and the researchers encourage others to think outside of the anthropocentric box to come up with other ways that a non-human-like civilization could communicate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples: Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail. Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..." While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature. Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling. Rectangular Craft Sighting: "Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom." Corroboration: "I might have seen this at the end of December. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. Triangular Craft Sighting: ["I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One day in 1961, father of four and Korean War veteran George Carroll went out to buy a packet of cigarettes. Or so his wife Dorothy told their young children. ‘Don't even think about him,' Dorothy assured them, later silencing their natural curiosities. However, decades later a series of astonishing events revealed the dark secret behind their father's disappearance. In a new documentary, The Secrets We Bury, the truth behind George's vanishing, which wife Dorothy took to her grave when she died of cancer in 1998, is laid bare for the first time. ‘My mother literally turned her head, winked at me, never said a word and then passed away.' Their father's fate had long puzzled the children. It seemed odd that he'd left his wallet and car behind and hadn't cashed his final pay cheque. There were rumours that he'd returned to a girlfriend he had in Korea during the war there in the 1950s, or that he'd been murdered by the Mob – but nothing concrete. Mike was only eight months old when George vanished and barely remembered him. Curiously, his older siblings who did remember their dad could not recall any drama leading up to the actual moment he vanished. After George vanished, Dorothy swiftly remarried and the children had a stepfather, Richard Darress, a newspaper photographer who lived locally. Although the children didn't like Richard, family life continued. Curiously, when a young Mike then got a job delivering newspapers, one of his customers Mr Yagel appeared at the door of their family home with a box of old share certificates that had belonged to George Carroll. Life continued, Mike got married and had children with his wife Debbi and later, when his mother – a gregarious ‘frustrated actress' who put on comedy shows in her large garage – was struggling financially, they moved into the family home to help her out. But there were signs that Dorothy had secrets. When Debbi and Mike divorced in 1995, Dorothy warned Debbi that ‘something would happen' to her daughter-in-law if she tried to take the house away from her in the divorce settlement. Debbi is clear that she believed Dorothy was entirely serious. It seemed that this wasn't such a ‘normal' family after all. Mike realised he had been delivering newspapers for years to the older man, Mr Yagel Sr, without ever knowing he was his grandfather. His newfound uncle explained that George had been digging up his house to add an extension when he disappeared. She decided to consult a medium – a plan that other family members, who didn't believe in such things, dismissed. However, Mike accompanied her to a séance in 2010. The medium spent an hour talking about other family matters until Mike – distinctly unimpressed – impatiently told her he only wanted to learn about his father. ‘She goes, “Oh, when it comes to the “M” word, I normally don't say anything until you give me the permission to do it,'” he says in the documentary. Jean was puzzled by what she meant, but Mike remembered a target used to hang on the wall at which they'd fire pellet guns when he was little, although it had long been taken down. When he asked who did it, she replied with ‘Richard'. They were in no doubt she meant their former stepfather, Richard Darress, but dreaded breaking the news to his son, Richard Jr, with whom they'd grown up. Asked about the theory that his father killed George, he says: ‘Is it possible? Jean even had a distinct memory of waking up one morning, around the age of seven before her father's disappearance, to find a man sleeping on the living room sofa. She later learned he was her soon-to-be stepfather Richard Darress Sr. Darress had just got out of prison for theft and after meeting in a bar her father had offered him a place to sleep in return for help with the building work on his home. So did Darress Sr and Dorothy have an affair while he was dossing on the sofa? Meanwhile, only siblings Jean and Mike believed that there could be something under the basement. Mike started digging, using only hammers and chisels to break through the concrete. After spending months digging a huge 8ft hole without finding anything, they discovered an underground cinderblock wall on the edge of the excavation area. Breaking through it, they found a cavity which turned out to be a vault for the old house's water pump. Then as they scrabbled away at the earth, it was revealed to be part of a complete human skeleton. It was Halloween, October 2018 – 57 years after George Carroll had vanished. ‘Everyone had said I was wrong,' says Mike. After many years during which everyone believed he and Jean were unhinged and needed to simply accept their father deserted them, this was ‘payday', he says. Richard Darress Jr describes the discovery as ‘probably the most emotional day of my life – your whole body turns numb, you start reflecting on your entire life. He rushed back from a business trip in Chicago to be with them, aware that they had little doubt that his father had killed theirs. Investigators confirmed that the victim was indeed George Carroll, who had died from blunt force trauma to the head. That suspect, Darress Sr, had died just three months earlier – infuriatingly, before the family had been able to talk to him about George's fate. Parroting what he says he was told by his paternal uncle, Richard Jr believes George had been abusive towards Dorothy and that Richard Sr had been ‘defending her'. He tells the documentary: ‘I've heard stories about George Carroll. Richard Jr's half-siblings accepted there was some truth to this as their mother claimed George had been ‘rough with her' – with scars to prove it – after possibly suffering post-traumatic stress in the Korean War. But, crucially, did she conspire with Darress Sr to kill George? Some of her family cling to the hope that she knew nothing about the killing, although the fact she never filed a missing persons report and kept her children away from George's family is certainly suspicious. And yet there's another explanation in this labyrinthine story. Darress Sr's stepchildren claim he sexually molested the girls in the family – Jean and Pat – and that even while George was still alive, Darress repeatedly exposed himself to the Carroll children. Jean remembers Darress as an ‘evil' and ‘manipulative' sexual ‘predator'. Is it possible, asks Steve Carroll, Jean's other brother, that George was murdered after he confronted Darress in the house over his predilections? He certainly believes so, although he adds that – if this was the case – why on earth did his mother allow such a monster to remain in her home? It doesn't exactly help that all of the siblings have wildly divergent theories as to who did what and why. George's children accept that they will never know for certain which of them – if any – is correct although they can at least find small consolation in the fact that their father didn't abandon them after all. The Secrets We Bury is available on Discovery+, HBO Max and Prime Video.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The problem is that there aren't a ton of feature-length films that really use liminal space to its fullest potential. At least, that's what I thought before feasting my eyes on 1974's Messiah of Evil. I have to give credit where it's due, as I first heard about Messiah of Evil after running a YouTube search for “Liminal Horror.” That rabbit hole led me to a channel called Nightmare Movies, which sold me on streaming the film after breaking it down so succinctly. If you're a fan of liminal horror and you've slept on Messiah of Evil like I had, it's in your best interest to check it out on Tubi. It's streaming there for free, and it will take you to a strange place in the uncanny valley that threatens to swallow you whole. The main thread follows Arletty Lang (Marianna Hill), who travels to the small beach town of Point Dune in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged father, Joseph (Royal Dano). Joseph is a troubled artist who has lived in the town for years, but has become increasingly unstable as of late. These writings also describe the increasingly vivid nightmares Joseph has been experiencing, which slowly bleed into something far more ominous. While talking at Thom's motel, they have a run-in with a local vagrant named Charlie, who warns them about an upcoming blood moon. After Charlie ominously claims that her father is “one of them now,” Arletty's curiosity turns into alarm, pushing her to dig deeper into what's actually happening in Point Dune. People who appear perfectly normal are suddenly shown feasting on raw meat in grocery stores, only to snap into pursuit once they spot someone who hasn't turned. For me, the liminal spaces these moments take place in make Messiah of Evil genuinely horrifying. Gas stations, Ralphs grocery stores, movie theaters, and other familiar third places feel menacing specifically because of their emptiness as Arletty searches for answers about her father. Joseph's artwork lurking in the background makes you hypervigilant as a viewer, never quite sure whether those paintings are playing tricks on your eyes or watching you back. There's a constant sense that something is wrong just outside the frame. Much of that dread forms in your own head rather than being spelled out for you. For nearly its entire runtime, the film sustains that feeling. The zombie attacks are just an added bonus. Messiah of Evil, which is currently streaming for free on streaming services like, Tubi, PlutoTV, and Hoopla, is one of those movies that rewards multiple viewings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across 15 seasons, Supernatural wove a veritable tome of demonic lore. A power angels and demons alike wielded was possession. Both species could only walk the mortal realm via a human body, and while demons would typically force their way into whichever unsuspecting victim they preferred, angels had a moral obligation to only possess willing individuals. Demons were also restricted from possessing anyone with specific markings, which was how Sam and Dean remained free from any unwelcome body guests. One of Supernatural''s demon rules was seemingly broken after a single episode, but upon further examination, there was a logical reason it didn't last. That wasn't how the trope began, however. While Azazel was part of Supernatural lore from the earliest scenes, season 1 episode "Phantom Traveler" marked the first time a demon featured prominently. This was also the episode that introduced the idea of possession, as the plot revolves entirely around Sam and Dean tracking down a demon hiding inside a plane passenger. Contradicting later lore, this episode established the notion that demons possess humans by flying in through their eyes. This idea never resurfaced again in Supernatural, and subsequent demonic characters would reliably take the oral route instead, creating the show tradition we all know and love. In hindsight, it's easy to dismiss season 1's eye possession as a Supernatural plot hole. The inconsistency certainly could have come about due to Supernatural not yet having a firm foundation for its demon rule book in season 1, and the show's creative team changing its mind. One could argue that it makes no sense for a disaster demon to access a host through their eyes when even high-ranking hellions like Lilith are forced to go through the mouth like a commoner, but the distinction still works as a canon explanation for why we never see demons possess humans via the eyes again. This is the only disaster demon shown in Supernatural, leaving nothing to contradict the rules "Phantom Traveler" created.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jupiter's moon Europa may be less hospitable to life than scientists once hoped At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Jupiter's moon Europa, long considered a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its vast subsurface ocean, may not be as habitable as once thought, according to new research. A study published in Nature Communications suggests that Europa's rocky seafloor is likely too mechanically strong to support the tectonic and volcanic activity crucial for generating life-sustaining nutrients and chemical energy. On Earth, such geological processes facilitate interactions between rock and seawater, producing essential chemicals for microbial life. However, after modelling Europa's conditions, researchers concluded that its seafloor probably lacks these dynamic features. Their evaluation, indicating little to no active faulting at the moon's seafloor, suggests this environment would be challenging for life. "On Earth, tectonic activity such as fracturing and faulting exposes fresh rock to the environment where chemical reactions, principally involving water, generate chemicals such as methane that microbial life can use," explained planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis, the study's lead author. "Without such activity, those reactions are harder to establish and sustain, making Europa's seafloor a challenging environment for life." Life may have emerged on Earth billions of years ago in the dynamic environment around seafloor hydrothermal vents, features that Europa may lack. "Based on our findings, the seafloor would probably not contain major tectonic landforms, such as long ridges or deep troughs. There would likely not be any underwater volcanoes or seamounts, and we would not have any hydrothermal activity such as black smokers. Despite these new findings, Europa possesses several traits that have long fuelled hopes of habitability. Its subsurface ocean is believed to be 40-100 miles deep, potentially holding double the water present in Earth's oceans, beneath an icy shell 10-15 miles thick. It is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, with a diameter of roughly 1,940 miles. "There are three major factors thought to be critical for supporting life: liquid water, organic chemistry and energy," Mr Byrne noted. "The effect of this tidal heating drops off quickly with distance, so although there's enough tidal heating to keep Europa's ocean from freezing solid, according to our calculations at least there's not nearly enough to tectonically deform the ocean floor. So, in short, there probably isn't the kind of thing happening on Io taking place deep within Europa," Mr Byrne explained. Mr Byrne suggested a nuanced possibility: "There are reasons to think that Europa might once have been much more geologically active than it is today, albeit a few billion years ago. So perhaps for a time that world really was just not habitable but actually inhabited, before those conditions changed and the chemical energy for life ran out." Despite these new insights, Mr Klimczak maintains that "Given what we know about Europa, it is still the best place to look for extraterrestrial life."

Over 1,000 people on the Treasure Coast have encountered law enforcement regarding immigration out of nearly 12,000 people across Florida, mostly with the Martin County Sheriff's Office.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement's “suspected unauthorized alien encounters” online dashboard listed 1,067 encounters across the tri-county area from Aug. 1, 2025, through Jan. 6.

The Martin County Sheriff's Office had the most encounters for sheriff's offices across the state at 778, followed by Polk County Sheriff's Office at 725 and Lee County Sheriff's Office at 666.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for your daily dose of dope. Bush confirmed aliens are here and known to insiders. A bombshell new disclosure reveals former President George H.W. Bush learned that space aliens came face-to-face with U.S. military personnel at a New Mexico airbase more than 60 years ago, but kept mum about the mind-boggling meeting, RadarOnline.com can reveal. The explosive revelation comes from Dr. Eric Davis, a top astrophysicist who worked for the Pentagon's since-disbanded Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Bush described a 1964 UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in 'The Age of Disclosure.' "A non-human entity deboarded the craft ... and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," Davis said Bush, who died in 2018 at the age of 94, told him. But when Bush asked his aides for more details, he was curtly told "he did not have a need to know" and so kept it secret, said Davis. Marco Rubio questioned assumptions about presidential access while discussing UFO secrecy in the documentary. The bombshell revelation jibes with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told the film's producers, "There's this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say, 'All right, take me to Roswell [New Mexico], show me the alien bodies [that allegedly were pulled from a downed UFO there in 1947]. "I think that really is a naive understanding of how our government works." The program, Davis said, investigated an incident where several ETs were said to have been pulled from the wreckage of a large tic tac-shaped UFO in Russia in 1998.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has abandoned his 2026 reelection campaign. In his announcement Monday, Walz pointed to right-wing conspiracy theories about the state's Somali immigrant community as having played a part in his decision. It has been nine years since Pizzagate, and yet such conspiracy theories have gotten worse—and as they have further eroded many people's sense of shared political reality, combating them has only become harder. Late in December, YouTuber Nick Shirley recorded himself going to several childcare centers in Minnesota, an attempt to “prove” that Somali immigrants have been using the centers to steal public money. When Shirley showed up, at least one childcare center did not open its door, one owner said, “because we thought it was ICE.” The resulting video was quickly rebutted and fact-checked: The state's Department of Children reported the childcare centers he descended upon were “operating as expected.” It didn't matter. Workers at the childcare facilities Shirley targeted said they had received “hateful” and “threatening” messages. One day care center reported a break-in, and sensitive documents were found missing. The conspiracy theory was always thin, and never actually implicated Walz. He called Shirley a “conspiracy theorist” and he accused Trump, accurately, of “demonizing our Somali neighbors.” But he was still leaving the race: “I can't give a political campaign my all,” said Walz. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.” It's all too easy to see the parallels to real-world chaos caused by Pizzagate, and the incident nine years ago that signaled to the public how right-wing conspiracy theories had become more serious and dangerous. Then, in 2016, a gunman entered a Washington, D.C. restaurant, convinced by Twitter conspiracy theorists like Jack Posobiec that he could save children who were being trafficked for sex in its basement by a ring they claimed was organized by and for Democrats. The restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, did not have a basement. For most people, news of the gunman's arrest was their first exposure to such gruesome sex-trafficking conspiracy theories, which to that point were largely the province of marginal media figures feeding them to their growing online audiences. It has often felt as if Pizzagate never ended. The conspiracy theories motivated Trump to take swift action. (The man indicted for Hortman's murder and currently awaiting trial also targeted other Democrats and abortion providers, and is reportedly a Trump supporter who considered himself to be engaged in spiritual warfare.) This has been building for nearly a decade, while attempts to counter them can barely keep up, and don't seem to stop them. Over the last decade, each time such conspiracy theories take hold, break containment, and begin to widely circulate, a whole host of anti-misinformation experts, researchers documenting the far right, historians and journalists tracking the rise of Christian nationalism, fact-checkers and defenders of legacy media, and lobby groups for online and child safety attempt to respond. It is increasingly common, however, for those who benefit from the rise of conspiracy-theory politics (influencers, content creators, and even elected officials and the mainstream of the Republican Party), to then target those misinformation experts and fact-checkers. But since then, Republicans have mainstreamed the idea that they are under attack not from conspiracy theorists but from content moderators. They have made dismantling infrastructure for combating misinformation and disinformation a major part of their agenda. It should be a wake-up call: Misinformation and disinformation have potentially pushed a state governor out of seeking reelection, and appear to be on the cusp of taking away childcare from more than 20,000 children in Minnesota, thanks to the Trump administration halting federal funds over these fictions. Now the administration is reportedly planning to cancel funding for children and other social services to four additional Democrat-led states, premised on the same stories about immigrants stealing. It's why you can't fact-check your way out of a conspiracy theory or disinformation. It's true now, with Trump in power again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shaun Baland 14 hours ago Events, News, Reviews Leave a comment The atmosphere immediately signals something darker, stranger, and more daring. This is a fully immersive blend of circus arts, horror aesthetics, and dark comedy, designed to push boundaries and keep the audience slightly on edge from start to finish. The production leans heavily into its horror theme with dramatic lighting, heavy music, and striking costumes, but it never feels cheap or reliant on jump scares. Instead, it builds tension through mood, character, and unpredictability. The level of talent on display is genuinely impressive—gravity-defying aerial acts, jaw-dropping contortion, feats of strength, and acrobatics that feel both dangerous and elegant. What makes these acts even more effective is how seamlessly they're woven into the show's twisted narrative rather than feeling like isolated performances. Their interactions with the audience are unscripted enough to feel spontaneous, keeping everyone engaged and occasionally uncomfortable in a fun way. There's always something happening—visually, emotionally, or musically—which keeps the energy high throughout. While some moments are intentionally provocative or shocking, they feel purposeful rather than gratuitous, aligning with the show's identity instead of distracting from it. This is absolutely not a family-friendly circus and shouldn't be approached as one. Paranormal Cirque is geared toward adults who appreciate horror, edgy entertainment, and performances that challenge expectations. If you enjoy Halloween haunt vibes, alternative theater, or shows that aren't afraid to take risks, this is well worth your time. Overall, Paranormal Cirque delivers a bold, memorable, and highly entertaining night. It's strange, thrilling, funny, and impressive in equal measure—and unlike anything else currently touring.

An FBI investigation into an alleged terror plot in Southern California bears the familiar hallmarks of the bureau's long-running use of informants and undercover agents to advance plots that might not otherwise have materialized. It is still unclear how the FBI first identified the group or how long the informant had been embedded before the bomb plot emerged — a period defense attorneys say is central to any serious examination of entrapment, whereby defendants are coerced into crimes they would not otherwise commit, a frequent criticism of stings involving paid informants and undercover agents. A previous sting operation [involved] the so-called Newburgh Four, in which an aggressive and prolific FBI informant steered four poor Black men into a scheme to bomb synagogues and attack an Air Force base. Note: The FBI has had a notorious history of manufacturing terrorist plots, often targeting vulnerable minors who have significant cognitive and intellectual disabilities yet no history of harming anyone. Read more about terrorism plots hatched by the US government, including cases in which alleged terrorists were acting on behalf of the CIA. This process not only pads arrest and prosecution statistics but also helps justify big budgets by misrepresenting the threat of terrorism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. A person I know has, for the past year or more, been trying to convince me that Earth has been visited by UFOs, and that, indeed, some of those spacecraft have been captured along with the bodies of the piloting extraterrestrials. Further, the bodies of the pilots (bipedal like us, I'm told) are being examined to see what kind of life they represent. As to why this is all being kept secret, I'm informed that there are important security considerations. But I'm not told which considerations are important enough to keep this  huge story secret. I have read a lot of the information sent to me supposedly supporting this claim, and ultimately it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others who supposedly have seen the extraterrestrials and their craft. It's instructive to look up Grusch on Wikipedia, where you read stuff like this: David Grusch is a former United States Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official who has claimed that the U.S. federal government, in collaboration with private aerospace companies, has highly secretive special access programs involved in the recovery and reverse engineering of “non-human” spacecraft and their dead pilots, and that people have been threatened and killed in order to conceal these programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have both denied Grusch's claims, stating there are no such programs and that extraterrestrial life has yet to be discovered. No evidence supporting Grusch's UFO claims has been presented and they have been dismissed by multiple, independent experts. Grusch also appears in an infamous 2½-hour hearing by the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs on “Unidentified and Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs”. The hearing starts at 18:00, several True Believers gives testimony, and Grusch first appears at 46:45 and also later (I have not listened to the whole thing today). On June 5, 2023, independent journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal provided a story detailing Grusch's claims of a UFO coverup by the government to The Debrief, a website that describes itself as “self-funded” and specializing in “frontier science”. The New York Times and Politico declined to publish the story, while The Washington Post was taking more time to conduct fact-checking than Kean and Blumenthal felt could be afforded because, according to Kean, “people on the internet were spreading stories, Dave was getting harassing phone calls, and we felt the only way to protect him was to get the story out”.According to Kean, she vetted Grusch by interviewing Karl Nell, a retired Army colonel who was also on the UFO task force, and “Jonathan Grey” (a pseudonym) whom Kean described as “a current U.S. intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC)”. Grusch claims that the U.S. federal government maintains a highly secretive UFO retrieval program and possesses multiple spacecraft of what he calls “non-human” origin as well as corpses of deceased pilots. He also claims there is “substantive evidence that white-collar crime” took place to conceal UFO programs and that he had interviewed officials who said that people had been killed to conceal the programs. He said that UFOs could be coming from extra dimensions; that he had spoken with intelligence officials whom the U.S. military had briefed on “football-field” sized crafts; that the U.S. government transferred some crashed UFOs to a defense contractor; and that there was “malevolent activity” by UFOs. During a July 26, 2023, Congressional hearing, Grusch said that he “was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program to which I was denied access”and that he believed that the U.S. government was in possession of UAP based on his interviews with 40 witnesses over four years. When Representative Tim Burchett asked him if he had “personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal” the government's possession of “extraterrestrial technology”, Grusch said yes, but that he was not able to provide details except within a SCIF (Sensitive compartmented information facility). So it's not just the government that knows this stuff, but private companies, who apparently retain for study the craft and jars of pickled aliens, or “biologics.” (It may be relevant that Grusch has a history of mental disorders, for which he's been committed twice to institutions.) At any rate, you can see above that not just Grusch, but also two other people who have had respectable military or government jobs, testify to the credibility of extraterrestrial craft. To me all that means is that three people believe in UFOs and extraterrestrials, and yet fail to present convincing evidence. I have no objections to a hearing, because if there were credible evidence of this stuff, the government would like to know about it. So would the rest of us, especially biologists and physicists. Both the government and other experts who aren't True Believers have heard the verbal evidence, but for some reason material evidence never surfaces. I'll revert to Wikipedia for the last time: Grusch's assertions are primarily based on alleged documents and his claimed conversations, rather than testable evidence. Frank writes that he does “not find these claims exciting at all” because they are all “just hearsay” where “a guy says he knows a guy who knows another guy who heard from a guy that the government has alien spaceships”. [JAC: that's an apt critique of the claims.] Frank also said of the Grusch account that “it's an extraordinary claim, and it requires extraordinary evidence, none of which we're getting”, adding “show me the spaceship”. You can go down the rabbit hole of these claims for days, but all I'll say is I will remain skeptical until genuine evidence comes to light—and by that I mean production of the “biologics” and their craft. The failure of proponents to provide such evidence, which is always “kept elsewhere” and is “a secret matter of national security importance”, make me think that what we have here is true conspiracy theory. Again, reporters and skeptics should look at this evidence, but they've always come up with bupkes. When I asked my friend why the greatest news story in the history of humanity has not been broken by mainstream news, I get answers involving extreme secrecy. But give me a break: there existed pickled aliens and spacecraft remains, and none of it has been verified by mainstream news outlets, not in decades? Finally, when I'm told that the very testimony of people with decent credentials proves that they're correct, I respond with this: “Well, there are lots of people with decent credentials who said they have had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.” Plenty of Americans believe in the literal truth of the divine-Jesus story and have had Jesus Encounter Experiences, despite the lack of evidence—even historical, extra-Biblical evidence for a divine, crucified-and-resurrected Son of God. These people far outnumber True Believers in UFOs. Should we then take their testimony about Jesus seriously? I haven't followed this controversy closely, and perhaps readers, or people like Michael Shermer, have something to say about it. But until I see those pickled aliens, I think it's more parsimonious to think that their existence is about as likely as that of the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot. I believe they're supposed to look something like the picture below. If so, it would be a remarkable example of convergent evolution following two independent origins of life on two different planets. Yeah, they've been making these claims for decades. Every day there are more than a million take off and landings, every one of those planes carrying people with cameras. Conspiracies can work if only a handful of people are involved. But this is a secret kept by thousands over decades? who had extensively interviewed many of the scientists and technicians at NASA who would have had to have been involved in anything extraterrestrial, study or coverup. They, and other experts like them, were the last people to keep a secret and sit tight lipped on a huge scientific discovery for years. it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others. In the 90s, there was an adult film actor named Ben Dover. Now, his daughter has become an adult film actor. Do believers explain how a culture with the technology to travel the distances required to reach Earth always crash or are taken hostage by Earthlings, with our far more primitive technologies? Or how how hundreds of people over the span of 80 years have all agreed to keep mum about extraterrestrials? Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague. I know the call for students to be taught “critical thinking ” sounds tiresome by now, but any educated person ought to be able to ask rational questions and dismiss this type of belief. “Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague.” Right, and. it's all nonsense and crank stuff but never underestimate the  Credentialed Brave Independent Thinkers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_from_Space Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have this covered. Because these thoughts do not occur to them. And when these inconsistencies are pointed out, they either do not comprehend them, or ignore them out of some great emotional need for this story to be true. Ok, so apparently aliens advanced enough to master interstellar travel visited ancient Egyptians, who just knew simple metallurgy and could quarry and construct basic stone structures. You can only imagine the disappointment of these Egyptians, enviously watching these aliens with their seemingly god-like technology. Will we now be able to fly like a bird, or instantly communicate with others very far away, or cure any wound, or any number of these incomprehensible abilities that they possess? Aliens: “My dudes, today is your big day.” Aliens:  “They are…slightly more advanced ways of building stone structures! See how you can only make a pyramid about 100 cubits high. And, with a bit more precision on the stone blocks…let's get those tolerances down. I don't know if believers in these types of conspiracies (i.e. ones that are not only very improbable, but internally inconsistent) suffer from deficits in basic thinking power, have psychological quirks that make them vulnerable to ideas of this type, or some combination of the two. Aliens built the Easter Island statues: I've seen that one, too. Part of that claim used to rest on the breathless assertion that, like the Tycho Monolith in 2001, no trace of quarrying on Easter Island had ever been found. (I think that was a claim from Chariots of the Gods.) Some of the quarries contain partially worked moai. The volcanic tuff isn't all that hard to work. I've always wondered about the sci-fi scenario of alien microbes causing a plague. It is probably true that our immune systems would be helpless to attack an alien microbe, but wouldn't the alien microbes be equally unable to exploit our alien biochemistry? But it seems to me that if a truly alien microbe entered my body it would simply perish for lack of sustenance. Wouldn't my proteins be useless or perhaps poisonous to it? Not that I would volunteer to test this theory on myself. I'm at my comment limit for the thread but just wanted to follow on to this…as yes I've always wondered this myself. Wells “War of the Worlds”, the aliens successfully invade us but then are thwarted by our microbes, which we are resistant to (because of co-evolution as you point out) but they are not. But then…wouldn't these advanced aliens have known this would be a problem to begin with??? Book and movie each one of my absolute favorites! The book is so great because it has realistic data output from – IIRC – protein sequencing, X-ray crystallography/scattering, etc…. Chrichton was a clever man and wrote intriguing books. A more accurate rendition is, I think, In the Dick Tracey comics where the moon people show up, at least so far as I can glean from the Comics Curmudgeon website. I'm impressed that they can walk around with those gigantic heads without toppling over. Carl Sagan thought that they looked like fetuses. As Bryan points out in Comment 11 below, there is a religious element in how many people view aliens. People assume that if aliens come here, they will be wise, all-powerful beings who want to help us. even alluded to Michelangelo's “Creation of Man,” with E.T. “Starman” features Jeff Bridges as another alien who can perform miracles. He impregnates a human woman and tells her that she will give birth to a son who will be a great teacher; she protests that she is infertile, but he assures her that the seemingly impossible conception is true, and he then ascends to the heavens. In “Cocoon,” aliens heal (restore vitality to) a group of senior citizens and end up taking them to a place where “they won't ever get sick, they won't get any older and they won't ever die.” When my mother saw this on TV, she said “People don't believe in Heaven any more, so they make movie9s like this.” I don't think she was wrong. I wonder if science fiction in non-western cultures (one where Hinduism, say, is the dominant religion) is influenced by the religion in that culture? As for how aliens can travel the necessary distances, Shirley MacLaine explained it to Johnny Carson on an episode of The Tonight Show: Thought can travel faster than light, and the fastest thought is love. The starships are powered by thought, specifically love. My first boyfriend, who had been brought up in a strict Ukrainian Orthodox family, was a fervent believer in UFOs and alien visitors. He thought the aliens were here to teach us and would give us the secrets of everlasting life. It always seemed to me that he had shed his religious upbringing but needed a “science-y” substitute. Johnny Carson even attempting to keep a straight face would have caused great mirth in the studio audience. Michael Shermer and Skeptic is the best for everything UFO. But it is dawning on me that … IMHO … UFO stuff is a modern pseudoscientific version of ancient Gnostic cult thought, perhaps driven by certain incentives. IOW human nature and its ‘bugs' have not changed in centuries.. millennia…. perhaps categorized as psychological aberration, but at root a consequence of human nature… ? Yep, Michael does a good demolition job of this nonsense here : The saying “Three may keep a secret, if two are dead” springs to mind. It's a conspiracy theory, like the covid lab leak, but far less plausible. So possibly hundreds, even thousands, of individuals are walking around with this information, and no one is leaking credible clues or documenting this in a way that would be convincing to a skeptic? Information that would be the most incredible discovery in human history has been given to members of PRIVATE organizations, and somehow not one person is coming forward? The probability of this is close to zero. I truly think that people who believe in conspiracies of this type have either a general intelligence deficit, or some psychological trait that renders them very bad at assessing probability from basic facts and premises. I wonder if studies have been done on the cognitive capabilities of hard-core conspiracy theorists. (The infinite ascending chain aspect of this is admittedly a difficulty, but there are workarounds.) Examples: ● Big Tinfoil (Y) covertly fosters many conspiracies (X), some of them patently ridiculous, so that sales will increase. the Greatest Replacement Ever) can more easily neutralise those few Insightful humans who know The Truth, by means of remote detection and detonation of tinfoil hats. ● The Aliens (Y) also either covertly influence (via mind control) or bribe or threaten some humans to make sarcastic comments about all conspiracies (X) so that the Insightful will be ridiculed, ignored, and generally reduced as a threat. (The Aliens are not barbarians — they kill only when other methods fail.) The idea that intelligent life has only existed on just one doesn't seem very likely. The notion that aliens might visit our planet does not seem completely farfetched. However, I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that in this case, ‘almost all' is all. On the other hand, I have never been to Area 51. But we don't know the probability of life occurring. And even if simple life is prevalent, there are many other improbable steps after that to get to a space-faring species. Perhaps an intelligent species did pass by, but it was 50 million years ago. If technologically advanced species arise and fall at different times, and the distances between them are vast and the speed of light represents a genuine speed limit, then the chances of interactions are almost zero. I agree but the problem is we don't know how likely intelligent life is to arise (we have a data sample N=1). And even if life did arise, the likelihood is that the distance from us would make communication, let alone visitation, virtually impossible. One assumption behind the Fermi paradox is this: “If Earth-like planets are typical, then some may have developed intelligent life long ago.” But we don't have the slightest idea how likely it is for an Earth-like planet to produce intelligent life. “what we have here is true conspiracy theory” I can understand that a few people might sincerely believe this stuff for their own reasons. But I find more disturbing the fact that reporters, Congress, and other serious folks give these claims credence despite so little evidence supporting them and so a low probability of them being true. It seems to me there is a serious hole in our education system; we have produced a crop of leaders who are not very good at weighing evidence or at even understanding what constitutes evidence. A parallel to religion just occurred to me, the way aliens in UFO conspiracies always look like humans – this is the inverse of Imago Dei (man created in the image of god) / but instead, human creation of aliens in their own image – “man” as god creating alien .. which themselves could be god of “man” … the Gnostic Ouroboros with Aliens ad infinitum… Starry Messengers used to be angels, now they are Greys. “I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise, We climbed aboard their starship, and headed for the skies!” An excellent song reference, Come Sail Away by Styx. When he wasn't home I'd sneak into my older brother's room and listen to this album (Grand Illusion) on his audiophile headphones, close my eyes and be transported to another world. Thanks for the correction; I was just going from memory. This is why I can't take these claims seriously. If aliens exist they would be fundamentally different from us in their body plan and maybe even in their biology. • “Corporate wants you to tell us the difference between these two pictures” • picture: | Imago Dei | Greys | • “It's the same picture“ The lack of material evidence leaves me uncommitted. The nature of what is being claimed leaves me skeptical. I do not, however, dismiss the idea that government programs can be kept secret for decades—they can, they have, they do—though this is far more common for inactive programs. Anyone who has worked in or around such a program knows that to reveal convincing details would only make you a criminal, while anything short of that could make you look like a kook. If you ever want to get caught up in the details, one of the best websites is Metabunk: It was originally started by Mick West, but it's grown a decently large community that looks into a lot of specific claims of various UFO/UAP sightings. If you remember the trio of Pentagon released videos that made a splash a few years ago, they've got pretty good explanations of what all of those videos probably were in reality (spoiler: not alien spacecraft). To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin from Poor Richard's Almanack, the only way three people can keep a secret “is if two of them are dead.”  A similar calculus would seem to apply to numbers greater than three. Another relevant observation about human nature is that it's no fun to have a secret unless you let someone else know you're keeping it. Confidentiality tells No one Nothing Never Nowhere on land, air, or sea Not in any measure “No one” means no one at all Even the trust-worthy Promising that they won't tell — You leaked, so then why – won't – they? © 2024, no charge for noncommercial use, all other rights reserved. Appeal to acceptance in popular culture (or history); 6. Discoverer is “independent” of colleagues, associations, agencies, etc. Needs new laws of Nature to support claim. I count at least 5 on a quick review of his claims! All of this requires faster than light travel, which remains theoretical. People don't pay enough attention to Douglas Adams: Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. Yes, it would require something like “warp speed.” The probability that members of another civilization have visited Earth is practically zero. There is no evidence of worm holes, folded space to game the speed of light for faster interstellar travel, or “warp fields”. If black holes rending suns apart and spitting matter out of its poles in jets of particles cannot exceed the speed of light nor gravitational waves from cosmic collisions, then nothing at human scale building contraptions is going to. Interstellar travel is a fiction stemming from human wishful thinking and my knowledge of physics strongly suggests that no creature will be capable of it. Maybe robotic missions within a few lighyears of a home planet over hundreds or thousands of years but for us humans, ask yourself – how many fascinating ET creatures live not within the Milky Way galaxy but within 200 light years of Earth TO visit? The “relying on documents he has but can't share” reminds me strongly of the Mormon Golden Tablets that Joseph Smith claimed to have but could never share. Why can't he share the documents — was this clear to Jerry or his friend? This is a timely post as we are just leaving the Santa Claus season and won't get to Easter Bunny time for a while. Perhaps I should say that I am skeptical for the sake of bend-over-backwards formality, but the claims are so incredibly bogus to me that I am more in the camp of people who say this definitely is pure fantasy. Akin to the chances of there being unicorns and angels. One is asking for 1000's of people, over generations, to keep an explosive secret. Threats and even assassinations won't be enough. And why even try to keep it secret? I don't think that interstellar space travel is even possible for organic beings. there is a propulsion system, even in the range of nearby sci-fi fantasy, that can move such a mass at the required speeds for this to work. To say nothing of the ripplingly intense radiation that would be experienced, the relative energy of which only increases with speed. Individuals with respectable military or government jobs might have a bachelor's degree. And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves. “And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves.” True, but I can't help thinking: Like all those people with post-graduate degrees who believe boys can be girls, and girls can be boys; think it unevidenced that men have a general advantage in most athletic competitions; believe that they had a 25%+ chance of dying if infected with COVID; thought that tales of Biden's demise were conspiracy theory; and found Kamala the fount of joy and competence? We could go on with the follies all day long. As an aside, all officers today will have bachelor's degrees and most will have master's degrees within ten years of commissioning (though of highly varying quality). Moreover, pilot trainees are drawn disproportionately from the top performers at the Academy and among ROTC distinguished graduates (top 10%); the average will have a STEM degree, and SAT scores well above 1400 (old scale or new) are commonplace. See Michael Shermer's book Why People Believe Weird Things, especially chapter 18, “Why Smart People Believe Weird Things”. My father was a USAF officer with sufficient rank to know pretty much all the secrets. He told me that if we had, the information would be highly classified, and he could not share it with anyone. However, he pointed out “I do not believe in UFOs”. If I were an alien in charge of investigating Earth I'd make sure that each UFO I sent out carried a demolition charge that could be triggered remotely in the event of a crash. One alien to another: “let's crash land on that little blue dot” you have the technology and can traverse over light years, but when you have a problem you can't fix it because Dozo down in the engine room left the spare part at home?. Kurt Vonnegut's brilliant Sirens of Titan explains the purpose of all of human history: our whole history was guided to produce a spare part for a broken alien spaceship. Influenced by cultural memes of the times (sci-fi books, movies, etc). The odds of us seeing or interacting with an alien species are so low that it is not much different than believing in a god. There could very well be other life in the universe but the chances of us crossing paths with it are astronomically low. Space aliens are the modern day version of angels. They watch over us stealthily, highly concerned with our welfare, and visit a privileged few only under mysterious circumstances. If they leave a message, it's usually a warning about something we're worried about – pollution and nuclear war being favorites.
