Sleep is a conserved behavior across all animals with a nervous system, ranging from cnidarians to humans. Considering the survival risks, why sleep evolved in basal lineages and what essential benefits it provides to the simple nerve net of nocturnal and diurnal invertebrates remain elusive. We used behavioral criteria to empirically define sleep in the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea andromeda and the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Light and homeostasis were the primary drivers of sleep in C. andromeda, which slept at night and napped at midday in both the laboratory and the natural habitat. In contrast, both the circadian clock and homeostatic processes regulated sleep in N. vectensis, which increased sleep at dawn. Similar to humans, C. andromeda, wild-type (WT) and Clock mutant (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis slept about one-third of the day, irrespective of the daily timing and architecture of sleep, and melatonin promoted sleep in accordance with the species-specific chronotype. Notably, sleep deprivation, ultraviolet radiation, and mutagens increased neuronal DNA damage and sleep pressure, while spontaneous and induced sleep facilitated genome stability in both the diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. These results suggest that DNA damage and cellular stress in simple nerve nets may have driven the evolution of sleep. Sleep is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved behavioral state prevalent across the animal kingdom, ranging from cnidarians to insects and mammals, suggesting that sleep is a Cambrian metazoan adaptation1,2,3,4,5,6. Sleep deprivation (SD) and disturbances are associated with increased risks for health decline in bilaterian animals7,8. The roles of sleep range from cellular repair and energy restoration to synaptic plasticity9,10,11,12. Nevertheless, the evolution of sleep came with major fitness compromises, such as reduced awareness of the environment and vulnerability to predation, and the fundamental conserved cellular functions of sleep remain elusive1,2,13. Sleep is defined by behavioral criteria and neuronal activity patterns. In most non-mammalian animals, sleep is characterized solely by distinct behavioral criteria, including consolidated periods of behavioral immobility accompanied by an increased arousal threshold in response to external stimuli and species-specific postures1,2,14,15. Sleep is regulated by the circadian process, which determines sleep timing, and by the homeostatic process, which compensates for SD. The presence of sleep and these regulatory processes in basal and derived nocturnal and diurnal species suggests a common evolutionary origin of sleep regulation16,17. Sleep plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity: it reduces DNA damage, which accumulates during wakefulness in neurons of flies, fish, and mice18,19,20,21. The causes of DNA damage are diverse and include the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the inadvertent action of nuclear enzymes, and neuronal activity20,22,23. The non-dividing and irreplaceable mature excitable neurons may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. This cell type evolutionarily emerged in basal metazoans24 and may require sleep to facilitate cellular maintenance. Indeed, sleep-like behavior has recently been observed in two diurnal cnidarians, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea and Hydra vulgaris (H. vulgaris)3,4, suggesting that the development of simple nerve nets in cnidarians25,26 coincided with the emergence of sleep. Cnidarians represent one of the most ancient animal lineages possessing neurons, which extend neurites throughout the endodermal and ectodermal layers, and contain conserved neurotransmitters and neuropeptides27,28. The jellyfish Cassiopea, which lives in obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates, exhibits rhythmic daily activity that peaks during the day4. In contrast, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (N. vectensis), which lacks symbiotic eukaryotes, is considered nocturnal29,30. However, sleep architecture has not been empirically defined in Cassiopea, and sleep has not been characterized in N. vectensis. Thus, the mechanisms that drove the evolution of sleep in these model animals are unknown. To dissect the origin of animal sleep and its core cellular drivers, we defined and analyzed sleep architecture in Cassiopea andromeda (C. andromeda) and N. vectensis. We found that the light/dark cycle and homeostatic pressure are the primary regulators of sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda, whereas the circadian clock and homeostatic drive are the predominant regulators of sleep in the crepuscular (active at dusk) N. vectensis. Notably, the results demonstrated that the capacity of sleep to relieve neuronal DNA damage is an ancestral trait shared by both symbiotic diurnal and non-symbiotic crepuscular cnidarians. We suggest that sleep may have evolved to enable consolidated periods of neural maintenance. In Cassiopea, a sleep-like state has been characterized by monitoring the rate of pulsation activity of the jellyfish umbrella, which reduces during the night4. To quantify sleep, it is essential to determine the threshold of the pulsation frequency, which can differentiate sleep from wake behavior. An infrared (IR) camera was used to track the simultaneous behavior of multiple C. andromeda during the day and night (Fig. Pulsation events were determined by monitoring the changes in pixel intensity, which reflected expansion and contraction of the C. andromeda bell diameter (Fig. Consistent with its diurnal nature, locomotor activity consistently reduced during the night in C. andromeda under 12 h light:12 h dark (LD) conditions with a mean pulsation rate of 36.4 ± 1.6 and 31.9 ± 1.4 pulses/min during the day and night, respectively (mean ± SEM; Fig. The constant pulsing behavior31 precluded the use of quiescence to define sleep in C. andromeda. To identify the arousal threshold distinguishing sleep from wake in C. andromeda, we applied a brief light stimulus at night and measured the response latency (Fig. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (Fig. We found that C. andromeda, which pulsed fewer than 37 times per minute (Fig. 1f–h) for more than 3 min (Fig. Thus, this threshold was used to characterize sleep in C. andromeda. Applying this criterion revealed that the average sleep time increased during the night (63.7%) compared to the day (45.3%) under LD in C. andromeda (Fig. Notably, similar to findings in primates and flies32,33, a midday nap was also observed in C. andromeda (Fig. The daily average sleep time rhythm was 24.2 h (Fig. However, rhythmic locomotor activity was abolished under constant darkness (DD) and robustly dampened under constant light (LL) conditions (Supplementary Fig. These findings showed that sleep is primarily driven by the light/dark cycle in C. andromeda. To determine whether sleep in C. andromeda is regulated by a homeostatic process, we sleep-deprived the animals for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) using computer-controlled alternating repeated water turbulence at night (Supplementary Movie 2). Following SD, C. andromeda displayed sleep rebound, i.e., sleep-deprived animals slept 1.5-fold more than control animals during the day (Fig. In contrast, SD during the active period (ZT5-11) did not induce sleep rebound (Supplementary Fig. These findings show that sleep is regulated by light and homeostatic drive in the diurnal symbiotic C. andromeda. a Behavioral recording setup. b Pulsations detected from normalized pixel-intensity change.

To generalize the sleep criteria found in the laboratory to Cassiopea's natural habitat, we monitored the pulsation behavior of wild animals (Supplementary Fig. 1 m) during day and night ( ~ 15 h L: ~9 h D) in shallow water adjacent to the seashore of Key Largo, FL. The findings revealed a strong negative association between the size of Cassiopea and their pulsation rate (Fig. We therefore normalized the average activity according to the size of each group and showed elevated activity during the day at the sea (Fig. Notably, the pulsation threshold used to detect sleep under controlled laboratory conditions (37 pulses/min, Fig. 1f–h) closely matched the average daytime pulse rate observed in the lab (36.4 pulses/min, Fig. Given this similarity, we approximated the sleep threshold in the field by the average daytime pulse rate, adjusted according to the bell diameter, as a proxy to differentiate sleeping and awake animals. Utilizing this model, we found that the sleep architecture of Cassiopea is similar in the laboratory and the sea. In their natural habitat, the animals primarily sleep at night and nap during midday (Fig. These results enable the quantification of sleep in various sizes of Cassiopea living in the laboratory and in their natural habitat at sea. Although rhythmic locomotor activity has been described in N. vectensis29,30,34, sleep was not characterized in sea anemones, including N. vectensis. To detect the state of sleep, we used an IR camera and monitored the behavior of 18 N. vectensis placed individually in three 6-well plate arenas (Fig. We quantified the levels of movement by calculating pixel change above a quiescence threshold, which was set based on MgCl2-paralyzed animals (Fig. We analyzed 6 h bins (Supplementary Fig. 4) but chose 12 h windows (ZT18-6 and ZT6-18) because they encompass the full crepuscular (i.e., active at dusk) behavioral pattern and align with the 12 h light/dark periods used for C. andromeda (Fig. In contrast to C. andromeda, under LD, N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity (Fig. These results indicate that N. vectensis is a crepuscular animal. Notably, the exposure to a sudden artificial dark-to-light transition transiently induced locomotor activity (ZT0-2, Fig. This robust response to light was used as a stimulus to identify increased arousal threshold in sleeping animals. During daytime (ZT2), N. vectensis was exposed to various light intensities and showed a negative correlation between the light intensity and response latency (Fig. Using the intermediate-intensity light stimulus and optimization algorithm (Fig. 2g), we found a slower response in N. vectensis individuals that were quiescent for more than 8 min prior to the light stimulus (Fig. To validate this arousal threshold, we tested the response to an additional sensory stimulus, i.e., a food cue. 2f-h), quiescence lasting at least 8 min resulted in a slower response and could differentiate sleep from quiet wakefulness (Fig. Thus, we defined sleep in N. vectensis as a quiescence state of at least 8 min, which is associated with reversible behavior and increased arousal threshold. a Behavioral recording setup. b Normalized pixel change was used to quantify movement.

This characterization of sleep enabled us to convert mobility data to sleep time (Supplementary Fig. The crepuscular N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity and an average sleep duration of 25 ± 2.3 min during ZT18-ZT6 and 14 ± 1.8 min during ZT6-ZT18, with a sleep period of 23.4 h under LD conditions (mean ± SEM). Similarly, the rhythmic sleep period was 22.5 h under DD (Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that sleep is regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis. To further differentiate between light- and circadian-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep under forced desynchrony (LDLD). While the rhythmic period of locomotor activity was 22.2 h and controlled by the clock, sleep period was 11.7 h (Supplementary Fig. These results suggest that although sleep is primarily regulated by the circadian clock it can also be modulated by light in N. vectensis. To understand the hierarchy of light- and intrinsic clock-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep in NvClkΔ mutant34 (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis. NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis showed bimodal sleep/wake rhythms (periods of 12.25 h and 25.24 h) under LD and this rhythm was abolished under DD (Fig. Under LDLD, the sleep/wake cycle followed the 6 h alternating light/dark rhythm (Supplementary Fig.3k, l). These findings demonstrate that the transcription factor NvClk is essential for maintaining clock-controlled sleep in N. vectensis. To further characterize sleep, we examined species-specific association with posture. Sleep time was monitored in animals displaying closed or open tentacles (Fig. Although close or open tentacle posture did not strictly differentiate sleep from wake state; i.e. animals with closed tentacles can be awake and vice versa, the closed tentacle N. vectensis slept 2.1-fold more than open tentacles N. vectensis at the peak of the sleep period (ZT23, Fig. To test whether homeostatic process regulates sleep, we sleep-deprived the N. vectensis for 8 h during sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) using gradual and gentle water exchange once per hour (Supplementary Movie 4). Following SD, sleep-deprived animals slept 1.24-fold more than control animals (Fig. 2t, u), indicating a homeostatic sleep drive. In contrast, control SD during the activity period (ZT8-ZT16) did not induce a sleep rebound (Fig. Altogether, while sleep can be modulated by light, a combination of circadian and homeostatic processes are the primary regulators of sleep in the crepuscular N. vectensis. The establishment of sleep criteria in two cnidarians, which sleep at different times of the day, enabled us to study species-specific changes in sleep architecture and regulatory mechanisms. The analysis of sleep time revealed nocturnal sleep in C. andromeda, and a crepuscular rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in WT N. vectensis, which was abolished in NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis under constant conditions (Fig. However, total sleep time over 24 h was similar in C. andromeda, WT and NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (Fig. To determine sleep patterns, we quantified the length and number of sleep bouts during the sleep and wake periods of each species. We found longer sleep bout durations and a higher number of sleep bouts at ZT18-6 compared to ZT6-18, under LD, in both WT (Fig. Similarly, under LD conditions, sleep bout length and the number of sleep bouts increased during the night (ZT12-0) in the diurnal C. andromeda (Fig. Inter-species comparison of sleep architecture revealed that although total sleep time was similar (Fig. 3a), the average sleep bout length was shorter by 2.8 min (Fig. 3h), and the mean number of sleep bouts was approximately two-fold higher (Fig. 3i) in C. andromeda compared to N. vectensis. These results show that, like humans, both cnidarian species spend approximately one-third of their lives sleeping (Fig. However, sleep is more consolidated in N. vectensis, i.e., longer and less fragmented sleep bouts, compared to C. andromeda. a Total sleep time during 24 h in WT, NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (gray) and C. andromeda (white) (n: N. vectensis: WT = 33, NvClkΔ/Δ=34, C. andromeda = 26). b Mean sleep bout length in WT N. vectensis (n = 33; ****p < 0.0001) during the wake (ZT6-18) and sleep (ZT18-6) periods. c Mean number of sleep bouts in WT N. vectensis (n = 33; *p < 0.05) during the wake (ZT6-18) and sleep (ZT18-6) periods. d Mean sleep bout length in NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (n = 34; *p < 0.05) during the wake (ZT6-18) and sleep (ZT18-6) periods. e Mean number of sleep bouts in NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (n = 34; *p < 0.05) during the wake (ZT6-18) and sleep (ZT18-6) periods. f Mean sleep bout length in C. andromeda during the wake (ZT0-12) and sleep (ZT12-0) periods (n = 26; **p < 0.01). g Mean number of sleep bouts in C. andromeda during the wake (ZT0-12) and sleep (ZT12-0) periods (n = 26; *p < 0.05). h Mean sleep bout length over 24 h in WT N. vectensis (gray) and C. andromeda (white) (n: N. vectensis: WT = 33, C. andromeda = 26; **p < 0.01). i Mean number of sleep bouts over 24 h in WT N. vectensis (gray) and C. andromeda (white) (n: N. vectensis: WT = 33, C. andromeda = 26; ***p < 0.001). j–u The changes in sleep architecture post melatonin (Mel; 100 mM) or ethanol control (Ctl).

Wilcoxon signed-rank test (one-tailed) for (b-g). Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon (two-tailed) for (a,h–i). The presence of circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in cnidarians suggests a common neuroregulatory mechanism. The melatonin hormone is secreted from the pineal gland during the night and mediates rhythmic daily physiological and behavioral processes in vertebrates35,36. However, its role in invertebrates remains poorly understood37,38. We tested the effect of melatonin on sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. While melatonin treatment did not affect sleep during the rest periods of N. vectensis (ZT3) and C. andromeda (ZT13) (Fig. 3j–l, s–u), sleep time, sleep bout duration, and the number of sleep bouts increased during the active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. These results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role of melatonin in sleep regulation across animals with different chronotypes. The presence of sleep in cnidarians indicates that sleep evolved independently of the brain. Studies in fish have shown that sleep decreases DNA damage and is essential for the health of single, non-dividing neurons18,19. To investigate cellular factors that might have driven the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians, we monitored DNA damage levels in single cells of N. vectensis and C. andromeda during the sleep/wake cycle and following SD (Fig. We hypothesized that DNA damage would peak and decline following extended wake and sleep, respectively. To identify the time points of maximal and minimal sleep pressure, we calculated the average sleep time over the past 12 h that preceded each time point. 4a, b), where wake and sleep accumulation peaked (Fig. DNA damage was quantified using immunohistochemical assays with an antibody against the phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a well-established biomarker of cellular response to DNA damage39. The number of nuclear γH2AX foci was quantified in the neuron-enriched mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue40, located adjacent to individual rhopalium of C. andromeda (Fig. 4e, g), and in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)27 N. vectensis (Fig. Under LD, the number of γH2AX foci increased at the end of the wakefulness period in C. andromeda (ZT11) and N. vectensis (ZT17) and reduced at the end of the sleep period in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) (Fig. The opposite timing of DNA damage reduction between C. andromeda and N. vectensis was aligned with their species-specific chronotype and daily timing of sleep. To determine the effect of homeostatic sleep pressure, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were sleep-deprived for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) and 8 h (ZT20-ZT4), respectively. Following SD, the number of γH2AX foci increased in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) and subsequently decreased to baseline levels following sleep recovery in both species (Fig. These results demonstrate that DNA damage accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep in both diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. Furthermore, these findings suggest that decreasing DNA damage during sleep is an evolutionarily conserved cellular function that may have contributed to the emergence of sleep in early metazoans. a,b Average sleep time during 36 h under LD in C. andromeda (a) and N. vectensis (b).

The correlation between sleep drive and cellular stress (Fig. 4) raised the possibility that environmental and intrinsic factors, disrupting DNA integrity, promote sleep in cnidarians. UV radiation is a potent DNA damage agent and an ancient pervasive atmospheric stressor impacting marine invertebrates41,42,43. To determine the effect of UV radiation on DNA damage and sleep, we exposed C. andromeda and N. vectensis to 15 min and 60 min, respectively, of UVB radiation44 (312 nm) during the day (ZT8). In C. andromeda and N. vectensis, the number of γH2AX foci increased one hour after UV exposure (Fig. Subsequently, nighttime and daytime sleep increased in C. andromeda (Fig. Notably, following sleep recovery, the animals remained viable, and two days later, the levels of DNA damage reduced in C. andromeda (Fig. These results suggest that UV-mediated induction of DNA damage increases sleep pressure. Since UVB may also affect the behavior of cnidarians in alternative pathways45, we treated N. vectensis with the mutagenic compound Etoposide46. While UVB induces oxidative stress and damage to DNA bases, Etoposide inhibits the topoisomerase II enzyme and stabilizes DNA double-strand break formation. Similar to the effect of UV, Etoposide treatment abruptly increased the number of γH2AX foci (Fig. The animals then increased sleep during the following day and night (Fig. 5o, p), and DNA damage was reduced (Fig. Consistent with these findings, melatonin treatment, which promoted sleep during the species-specific active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. 3m, p), reduced γH2AX foci levels in both species (Fig. Together, these results show bidirectional interactions between sleep and DNA damage in early divergent lineage. Moreover, these inter-species comparative findings suggest that environmental factors, such as UV radiation and soluble mutagenic compounds, which can induce DNA damage and cellular stress, may have contributed to the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians. a–e Representative images of γH2AX staining (magenta) in cells (DAPI, gray) of C. andromeda (a, d; scale bar 4 μm) and N. vectensis (b, c, e; scale bar 3 μm) treated with UV (a, b), Etoposide (Eto, c), and melatonin (d, e; Mel). f–h Normalized number of γH2AX foci per nucleus at ZT7 (Baseline), ZT9 (1 h post-treatment), and ZT7 (48 h post-treatment) after UV (f, g) or Eto (h) treatments, in C. andromeda (f) and N. vectensis (g, h). f Red triangle represents the end of the UV treatment (15 min post ZT7).

C. andromeda: n=rhopalia from 11 animals per time point (f) and 8 animals per melatonin group (i); n=animals (k, l). Sleep is a vulnerable behavioral state, yet it is ubiquitous across animal species with a nervous system. This study proposes that sleep is an adaptive solution to the cellular cost of wakefulness. Wakefulness is associated with continuous sensory inputs and activity of irreplaceable neurons, enhanced cellular metabolism, and increased locomotion9,10,11,12. Particularly when combined with exposure to environmental mutagens, extended wakefulness can result in cellular stress. To investigate the evolution of sleep function, we characterized the sleep architecture of two cnidarians: the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. Like humans, both species require a total of approximately 8 h of sleep per day. While sleep is regulated by homeostatic pressure in both species, it is also regulated by the light and the circadian clock in C. andromeda and N. vectensis, respectively. Despite their divergent chronotype, both natural and melatonin-induced sleep reduce DNA damage levels, which increase during wakefulness, in both species. The relationship between sleep and DNA damage is bidirectional, and the induction of DNA damage can promote sleep pressure. Altogether, these findings suggest that sleep evolved to support cellular maintenance and preserve genomic integrity in ancient cnidarians possessing a simple nervous system. In mammals, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and behavioral criteria are used to define sleep47. In most non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, EEG-based diagnostics are limited, making behavioral criteria the primary method for defining sleep1. Nevertheless, the behavioral sleep criteria have been supported by corresponding changes in neuronal activity in a few non-mammalian animals5,48,49. The recent identification of sleep-like behavior in cnidarians suggests that sleep predates the evolution of centralized nervous systems. Sleep-like states have been documented in Cassiopea4 and H. vulgaris3, and behavioral quiescence was observed in corals and box jellyfish in their natural habitat50,51,52. However, sleep had not previously been identified in the Anthozoans, and a specific arousal threshold was not determined in C. andromeda. Using arousal threshold experiments, we defined sleep as a minimum of 8 min of quiescence state in N. vectensis and 3 min under 37 pulses/min in C. andromeda. Although we observed a correlation between tentacle contraction and sleep in N. vectensis, both closed and open tentacle postures were observed during both sleep and wake states. In addition, C. andromeda maintained low but continuous pulsation activity while sleeping, supporting the idea that sleep cannot be defined solely by immobility or tentacle posture50,53. Likewise, migrating birds and marine mammals can sleep while moving, utilizing unihemispheric sleep54,55. The quantitative measure of sleep enabled us to monitor sleep in the natural habitat, providing insights into how organisms regulate sleep under ecological conditions. In C. andromeda, we developed a predictive model for sleep duration across different organism sizes in wild populations inhabiting Key Largo, FL. These animals exhibited similar sleep duration and architecture as in controlled laboratory conditions, including short midday naps despite differences in salinity and temperature. These findings suggest that internal, species-specific cellular mechanisms shape the sleep pattern. Accordingly, we characterized the hierarchy of sleep regulatory mechanisms in two cnidarian species adapted to distinct ecological niches. Light and homeostatic drive were the predominant sleep regulatory processes in C. andromeda, while homeostatic drive and the circadian clock control sleep in N. vectensis. The light-dependence regulation may be attributed to the C. andromeda symbiosis with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, because photosynthesis-driven byproducts, such as ROS, increase cellular stress, DNA damage56,57,58,59 and sleep pressure. The rhythmic activity of the symbiotic algae is likely physiologically deficient under constant light or dark conditions, potentially disrupting the light-dependent rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in C. andromeda. In contrast, the sleep/wake cycle is regulated by the clock even under constant environmental conditions in the non-symbiotic and crepuscular N. vectensis. Indeed, oxygen consumption, and possibly also ROS levels, are regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis60, supporting the idea that intrinsic molecular clocks control the timing of sleep in cnidarians lacking photosymbiosis. The neuroendocrinological mechanisms that regulate sleep in cnidarians is unknown. We showed that despite their opposing chronotypes, melatonin treatment promoted sleep and reduced DNA damage levels in both species during their respective active phases, suggesting a conserved role for this hormone in sleep modulation. Future extended monitoring of sleep for several days may reveal an additional circadian phase-shifting effect of melatonin. Similarly, exogenous melatonin promoted sleep in diurnal species, such as zebrafish61, and reduces locomotor activity and increases sleep in nocturnal species, such as flatworms62 and mice63, respectively. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland and binds to melatonin receptors in vertebrates35,36. However, although endogenous melatonin production was demonstrated in basal metazoans64, the mechanism of action is less understood in invertebrates. In the roundworm C. elegans, melatonin activates a specific potassium channel65, and similar channels may play an evolutionarily conserved role in mediating the sleep effect of melatonin in cnidarians. Future research in cnidarians, including genetic manipulations, may determine the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant, explain the mechanisms underlying its regulation and elucidate how pharmacological melatonin treatment contributes to sleep and DNA damage regulation in both nocturnal and diurnal animals. In both C. andromeda and N. vectensis, we observed the accumulation of neuronal DNA damage during wakefulness, which was alleviated during sleep, whereas SD impaired this recovery process. These results in simple nerve nets support findings in other evolutionarily derived animals and humans18,20,21,66 and suggest that the balance between DNA damage and repair is insufficient during wakefulness, and sleep provides a consolidated period for efficient cellular maintenance in individual neurons. Across evolution, as the number of neurons and the complexity of neuronal networks increase67, sleep may have evolved to confine unsynchronized cellular maintenance, and coordinate neuronal activity and maintenance across interconnected circuits, ensuring functional stability. Understanding which homeostatic internal and environmental factors drive sleep in basal animals could shed light on the evolutionary emergence of sleep behavior. In worms, flies, fish, and mice, sleep is necessary to recover from cellular stress, induced by factors such as ROS and UV light8,19,68,69. The symbiotic diurnal C. andromeda inhabits shallow tropical waters and are exposed to high levels of UV radiation70. In accordance, we found that UV exposure increased sleep pressure in C. andromeda. However, a similar effect was observed in the crepuscular N. vectensis, which inhabits estuarine environments with fluctuating light exposure, often burrowing in sediment during the day. Thus, we suggest that a downstream mechanism, i.e., UV-mediated DNA damage, is a homeostatic driver of sleep in cnidarians. Indeed, we showed that Etoposide, a pharmacological inducer of DNA damage, promoted sleep in N. vectensis, suggesting a positive correlation between DNA damage accumulation and sleep pressure across evolution. These findings are supported by our work in zebrafish showing that UV radiation, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nuclear proteins, and neuronal activity can induce DNA damage and promote sleep18,19. Moreover, sleep-dependent reductions in DNA damage have been reported also in flies, mice, and humans20,21,71, and melatonin improved the repair of oxidative DNA damage in night shift workers66. Cnidarians are emerging as genetically tractable, translucent models for studying evolutionary neuroscience26,72. We showed that sleep supports neuronal recovery in cnidarians. Beyond cellular repair, neuronal health is likely tied to additional sleep functions, such as learning and memory consolidation73. Associate learning has recently been demonstrated in N. vectensis and box jellyfish72,74, and future studies in cnidarians can elucidate how sleep optimizes cellular maintenance and consolidation of memory at the level of single cell within simple nerve nets of live animals. The molecular tools developed in our work and in other cnidarian studies75 offer a unique opportunity to identify conserved sleep-associated cellular markers, which could help characterize sleep at the cellular level. Since sleep has traditionally been classified based on movement and arousal thresholds in invertebrates, uncovering molecular signatures of sleep in cnidarians may help to characterize sleep in additional basal organisms, such as coral colonies, which consist of thousands of interconnected polyps. Whether coral polyps sleep simultaneously or in a coordinated alternating manner remains unknown, but studying their nerve net dynamics could provide clues about the evolutionary origins of local sleep regulation76. Moreover, considering that the interplay between the circadian clock and genomic stability has been shown in non-neuronal mammalian cultured cells, fungi and cyanobacteria77,78,79,80, sleep-like states may have preceded the evolution of neurons, originally evolved to support synchronized and consolidated periods of cellular maintenance. C. andromeda jellyfish were initially collected from the Gulf of Eilat and later raised and reproduced in the laboratory. The animals were reared in artificial seawater (ASW, OmegaSea, 39-40 ppt) at a 24 °C–25 °C with a pH of 8.1–8.3. A water cooler and heater were used to maintain a constant temperature. A deuterium-depleted water (DDW) compensation system was used to maintain salinity levels. Animals were raised under a 12 h day/12 h night cycle (LD) using 2400 W Metal Halogen 14,000 K light sources providing approximately 100 PPFD at the animal level, located 20 cm above the water surface. The animals were housed and monitored in a 113-liter closed water system equipped with a waste filtration system and a protein skimmer. C. Andromeda were fed daily with brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii) at noon. Animals with bell diameters of 5-7.5 cm, in a relaxed state, were randomly assigned to each experimental group. The C. Andromeda genotype was validated by sequencing the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene81. Whole genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50), and DNA fragment amplification was performed using the following degenerated primers: Forward: 5'-ACNAAYCAYAAAGATATHGG-3', Reverse: 5'-TGGTGNGCYCANACNATRAANCC-3'. N. vectensis were raised in ASW (OmegaSea, 12ppt) in a closed system at 17 °C under constant darkness and fed daily with Artemia nauplii at noon. Spawning of gametes and fertilization was performed according to established protocol82. In brief, the temperature was raised to 25 °C for 9 h, and males and females were exposed to strong white light. 3 h later, oocytes were mixed with sperm to enable fertilization. To genotype NvClkΔ mutant and WT N. vectensis, genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50). A fragment of the NvClk gene was amplified using the following primers: forward 5'-ACCCCACTGAGTGACCTCTT-3' and reverse 5'-ATACGCCTGCGCTATACACC-3'. The PCR products were then loaded on a 3% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel supplemented with GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The genotype of each animal was determined based on the size of the PCR products: NvClkΔ/Δ - 120 bp; WT - 100 bp. The gel-based genotyping was confirmed by sequencing in selected animals. Two modular water systems (Aquazone Ltd, Israel) were designed to monitor the behavior of 9 or 16 jellyfish simultaneously while maintaining controlled light, temperature, and salinity conditions. The systems consisted of 9 or 16 clear perspex chambers of 10 x 10 x 10 cm or 7 x 7 x 10 cm for individual jellyfish, respectively (Fig. These apparatuses were kept inside a 55 x 50 x 30 cm tank, connected to a waste filtration system, a protein skimmer, a water heater, and a DDW water compensation system. C. andromeda were kept under 12 h of light (five 50 W LED lights providing 100–200 PPFD at the animal level) and 12 h of darkness (LD) and constantly illuminated with low-intensity IR LED lights. Prior to each experiment, C. andromeda were acclimated in the recording system, one individual per chamber, for 2-3 days. An IR camera (Dahua Technology, Hangzhou, China) with an IR filter was used to record mp4 videos at resolution of 1920 × 1200 and 20 frames per second (fps). The mp4 videos were converted to avi files using the FFmpeg software (FFmpeg, Irvington, NJ, USA). MATLAB Version: 9.8.0 (R2020a)83 and a lab-made script were used to determine pulsation behavior. The change in the average pixel intensity was measured for each frame, producing a pulse trace. A rectangular region of interest (ROI) was selected for each jellyfish. The smoothed average pixel intensity was calculated using a Gaussian moving window and was subtracted from the data to control for low-frequency oscillations of the data. Pulsation events were counted using the peak of the pulse trace (Fig. 1b), and the mean activity was analyzed during the first 20 min of each hour along day and night. Jellyfish that changed their horizontal to a vertical position or anomalous animals exhibiting pulsing behavior three standard deviations below or above the mean were excluded. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) from the ‘Lomb' library84 on R85 with a p < 0.01 threshold. To assess the change in arousal threshold, the jellyfish were stimulated repeatedly every hour at night (ZT13-ZT19) using a 1 s 100–200 PPFD light pulse. A response was defined as a reduction of 2 standard deviations in the inter-pulse intervals (IPI) compared to the distribution of IPIs before the stimulation, within a time window of 10 s after the stimulus. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. For each candidate threshold (e.g., pulsation rate), responses were split into two groups: below and above the threshold. We then summed all Euclidean distances of these responses from the mean value of their respective groups (i.e., error value). Thus, the behavioral value that optimally divided a group of fast responses and slow responses results in the lowest error value. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated repeatedly with a gentle water pulse using thin tubes connected to a water pump and a computer clock. These 10 min pulses of water were applied every 10 min for 6 h at ZT17-ZT23. Field experiments were conducted in May in the native habitat of Cassiopea at Key Largo, FL. Light intensities ranged between 400-1500 PPFD at a depth of 0.3–1.5 m at the peak of the day, salinity was 31.5 ppt and Temperature was 26.8 °C. The pulsation rate was monitored manually by counting the number of pulses per minute every hour in 30–40 animals during the day and night (total of 662 animals). Subsequently, the diameter of the relaxed bell of each individual was measured. Locomotor activity of individual N. vectensis was monitored using a custom-made temperature-controlled (20 °C) water system equipped with an IR camera (Dahua, Binjiang District, Hangzhou, China). Animals of similar size (1-2 cm), genetic background, and age were distributed individually into wells of four six-well plates (Fig. 2a) and were subject to alternating white light Illumination with intensity of 17 PPFD (Sylvania Lightning Solution, Wilmington, MA, USA). MATLAB script was generated based on H. vulgaris sleep tracking methodology3 to analyze the locomotor activity and sleep. We measured changes in the pixel value between two consecutive frames at 5 s intervals (Supplementary Fig. Noise was reduced by subtracting the minimum pixel change of the individual. To set the minimum threshold of locomotor activity, pixel changes of MgCl2-treated paralyzed animals were quantified. These changes were considered immobility. The ratio of frames with detectable movements was calculated in a 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement) and defined as quiescence if movement was not detected in more than 50% of the frames per 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement<0.5). To assess the change in arousal threshold, the polyps were stimulated with either light or food. Polyps were stimulated with three different light intensities ( + 5, +50, +500 PPFD, above the 17 PPFD baseline) during the day (ZT10) for 30 min (Supplementary Fig. Food stimulation was performed by application of “Reef Energy Plus” solution (Red Sea, Israel). A response-to-stimulus was defined as 30 s of continuous movement above the threshold. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. 2g, j) as is described for C. andromeda. Sleep durations were summed in hourly bins, and the average and standard errors were calculated for all tested animals. Since N. vectensis showed crepuscular behavior (i.e., active at dusk), we used a data-driven approach to define sleep (ZT18-6) and wake (ZT6-18) periods in a 12 h time window. Sleep architecture data were analyzed using continuous 60 h movies starting at ZT18. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated by gentle water exchange once per hour during their peak of sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) and peak of activity period (ZT8-ZT16; Supplementary Movie 4) and sleep was monitored before and after the SD. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using Fourier analysis-based software LSP with a p < 0.01 threshold. Open or closed posture was manually annotated from a single video frame. Animals were categorized based on the number of tentacles deployed outside of their body. Animals that showed at least two visible tentacles were classified as ‘open'. For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. In the C. andromeda system, water circulation was terminated one hour prior to melatonin treatment due to the high volume of constant water exchange in the system. Both species were treated with either 100 μM melatonin (diluted in ethanol) or ethanol for control, at ZT3 and ZT13. In C. andromeda, behavior was recorded 30 min before and during melatonin administration. In N. vectensis, behavior was recorded 60 min before and during melatonin treatment. 3j–u) was calculated by subtracting the mean post-treatment values from the mean pre-treatment values of either melatonin or ethanol treatment. In DNA damage quantification assays, animals were treated with melatonin for 3 h, starting at ZT13 for N. vectensis and ZT3 for C. andromeda at their respective wake period, and were then fixed in 4% PFA. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, three independent rhopalia were dissected from each animal (total of eight animals per Ctl and Mel groups) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium. For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. A dark plastic barrier divided and isolated UV-treated animals from controls in the behavioral monitoring systems. For C. andromeda, sleep was recorded for 30 h; for N. vectensis, 42 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were exposed to 312 nm UVB (Spectroline® E-Series UV lamp, 20 cm above the animals): 15 min in C. andromeda and 1 h in N. vectensis. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, UV-treated and control C. andromeda and N. vectensis were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the UV irradiation. All UV assays were performed in two independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and the cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, 2–3 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (11 animals per time point; ZT7, ZT9, ZT7 Day3) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium. N. vectensis were habituated for 72 h and entrained to LD cycle in six-well plates. Sleep was recorded during 54 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were treated with 10 μm Etoposide (E1383, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and half with control 0.01% DMSO. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, Etoposide-treated and control animals were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the treatment. Etoposide assays were performed in two independent experiments. The upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells located in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. In both species, animals were habituated in their video monitoring system for 72 h and entrained to an LD cycle. SD was applied as described above. To quantify DNA damage, animals were fixed in 4% PFA at each time point. All LD and SD assays were performed in three independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- animal was mounted on a slide, and neurons in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. DNA damage quantification analyses were performed in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons at ZT17, ZT8, and ZT17 Day 2. For C. andromeda, 2-4 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (8-10 animals per time point; ZT11, ZT23, and ZT11 Day 2) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located on the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium. tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- and wild type N. vectensis were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 2XPBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. The umbrella tissues of C. andromeda surrounding the rhopalium were sampled and fixed for 5 min in 2% PFA in ASW at room temperature, followed by a 6 h fixation in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. For both species, the tissues were incubated with 2 μg/mL protein kinase (PK) for 10 min, then washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum with 1% DMSO, and diluted in PBS + 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, in N. vectensis, tissues were incubated with a primary antibody: rabbit anti-γH2AX (GTX127342, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) 1:200 dilution and antiDsRED (Living Colors® mCherry Monoclonal mouse Antibody, Clontech, Cat# 632543) 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer for 72 h at 4 °C, while in C. andromeda, tissues were incubated with the rabbit anti-γH2AX 1:200 dilution. Then, for both species, samples were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min. N. vectensis were incubated for 1 h with a goat polyclonal secondary anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 646 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. C. andromeda were incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. Next, both species were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min and the slides were mounted and prepared for imaging and cellular quantification. All imaging experiments were conducted on fixed dissected tissue mounted on slides in glycerol for both species. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 inverted and a LSM980 upright confocal/two-photon microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with ×63, 1.4 NA objective. γH2AX puncta were automatically counted using an ImageJ macro code utilizing the Analyze Particles built-in ImageJ plugin (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), within DAPI-based ROIs to focus on nuclear signal. Between 10-100 cells were analyzed in each C. andromeda rhopalia and N. vectensis. In addition to DAPI and γH2AX signal, a third channel was used to detect the fluorophore mOrange expressed in the nervous system of tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX) N. vectensis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mammals aren't known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. However, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies. Within the human body, it's mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn't explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. “The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn't wholly unexpected. “Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University's Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.” While the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail's eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.

(2026)Cite this article The catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers constitutes a recognized synthetic challenge as it is traditionally considered to arise from a non-concerted reaction pathway via formation and recombination of radical pairs. Here we show a catalytic enantioselective solution to this challenge, demonstrating that [1,2]-Wittig products are generated via an alternative reaction cascade to traditional dogma. The developed process employs a chiral bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst to promote an initial enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. A subsequent base-promoted, stereoconvergent, fragmentation–recombination process that proceeds with high enantiospecificity and retention of configuration, formally equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden thermal [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, generates [1,2]-Wittig products in up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio. Supported by extensive quantum chemistry calculations, this chirality transfer process will have broad implications for fundamental stereocontrol in organic transformations. Sigmatropic rearrangements are useful and reliable atom-economic reactions, with their ability to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds through well-defined and predictable transition states1 making these processes attractive for the synthesis of complex targets2. Among this broad set of reaction processes, [2,3]- and [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangements are of synthetic and mechanistic significance3,4. The rearrangement of allylic ethers under basic reaction conditions typically leads to product mixtures proposed to arise from the thermally allowed concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic Wittig rearrangement, alongside a competitive non-concerted [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement generally thought to arise from homolytic fragmentation of the anionic intermediate to form a geminate radical pair and their subsequent recombination5,6 (Fig. As representative examples, both Rautenstrauch7 and Baldwin8 have shown that treatment of benzyl allyl ether 1 with nBuLi gives rise to a mixture of [2,3]- and [1,2]-products 2 and 3, respectively, with increased [1,2]-product observed at higher temperatures. Although not widely recognized, sporadic control reactions have demonstrated the feasibility of converting [2,3]-Wittig products to [1,2]-Wittig products (formally via a [1,3]-rearrangement), although the generality, mechanism and configurational consequence have not been established9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The concerted or dissociative (via ionic or radical intermediates) nature of both the [1,2]- and [1,3]-processes has been much debated. For example, Danheiser considered a concerted [1,3]-pathway to account for the inversion observed in the ring expansion of cis-cyclobutanol 416. However, Gajewski17 and Cohen18 both postulated a non-concerted fragmentation pathway via an intermediate allylic anion that accounts for the observed in situ isomerism of cis-4 to trans-6, and that use of enantiomerically pure cis-4 or trans-6 leads to racemic product 5 (Fig. Applying the Woodward–Hoffmann rules indicates that a concerted [1,2]-rearrangement is forbidden, while a thermal [1,3]-rearrangement is symmetry allowed but geometrically challenging, with a suprafacial carbon shift expected to proceed with inversion of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon1. Interestingly, Houk has previously shown that anionic Cope and amino-Cope reactions proceed through a stepwise dissociation–recombination process20, consistent with competitive non-concerted [1,3]-rearrangements observed in related systems21,22. Given the mechanistic ambiguity surrounding these processes the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is a recognized challenge and is currently unknown despite its synthetic potential23. a, Traditional mechanism and dichotomy between [2,3]- and [1,2]-Wittig rearrangements. b, Stereochemical ambiguity of [1,3]-rearrangement reactions via concerted or fragmentary pathways. c, This work: the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement cascade. HMPT, hexamethylphosphoric triamide; THF, tetrahydrofuran. In this Article, the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is developed (up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)) and is shown to proceed through a cascade process consisting of an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement (up to >99:1 e.r.) promoted by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyst. The resultant tertiary carbinol bearing an α-branched allylic substituent is transformed to the linear [1,2]-Wittig isomeric product with retention of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon (equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement) through a dissociative intramolecular fragmentation–recombination event with high enantiospecificity (Fig. Substitution reactions that proceed with retention of configuration are rare, although recognized for alcohols via an SNi mechanism that proceeds via contact ion-paired intermediates24,25,26. Traditionally the stereospecificity of nucleophilic substitution processes leads to inversion of configuration in SN2 reaction processes at secondary centres and partial or complete racemization in SN1 processes at tertiary centres. However, recent advances have showcased stereospecific substitution at tertiary and even quaternary centres in which stereochemical information is conferred despite ionization of a substrate27,28,29,30,31,32. In this context, the high enantiospecificity of the observed chirality transfer protocol that leads to [1,2]-products with retention of configuration, while proceeding through an ionic fragmentation and recombination process, holds promise for the elucidation of alternative reaction pathways for generating chiral products with high enantioselectivity. Building upon the observation that disubstitution at the allylic ether terminus typically leads to increased preference for [1,2]-rearrangement products14, the use of BIMPs as organocatalysts to promote the enantioselective [1,2]-rearrangement process was considered. Originally developed by Dixon, BIMPs have shown widespread use in a plethora of stereoselective transformations33, possessing a Brønsted superbasic iminophosphorane with a hydrogen-bond donor to assert stereocontrol. Rearrangement of an allylic ether upon an oxindole skeleton was chosen, given the prevalence of this motif in natural products and bioactive molecules, as well as expected acidity. Following initial screening of the effect of N-substituent (N-Me, N-Bn, N-trityl), BIMP catalyst, solvent and temperature variation (see Supplementary Information Section 2) using N-trityl-substituted allylic ether 8 and tBu-BIMP catalyst 7 showed that rearrangement to 9 in mesitylene led to selective formation of the [1,2]-product in excellent yield and promising enantioselectivity after 24 h (Fig. As [1,2]-Wittig products are traditionally expected to be generated via a radical recombination mechanism, the effect of adding 20 mol% of 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxopiperidinium (4-NHAc-TEMPO) as an additive was probed. Formation of the [1,2]-product was not significantly inhibited, giving 9 in 73% yield and improved 95:5 e.r., with no 4-NHAc-TEMPO adducts observed34. The mass balance consisted of the aldol side product 10 (>95:5 diastereomeric ratio (d.r. that was isolated in 5% yield; addition of 1.0 equivalent of 4-NHAc-TEMPO was also tested, affording 9 in a further reduced 59% yield but enhanced 97:3 e.r. Control experiments indicated that taking a 1:1 mixture of allylic ether 8 and N-tritylisatin with tBu-BIMP 7 gave aldol product 10 in 71% yield (>95:5 d.r., 75:25 e.r. ), consistent with in situ formation of N-tritylisatin derivative in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO. Further experiments showed that addition of 1.0 equivalent of TEMPO led to 9 in 57% isolated yield (97:3 e.r.) with 10% of TEMPO-allyl adduct (T-a) isolated as well as 11% N-tritylisatin. Intrigued by these observations, in situ temporal reaction analysis monitored consumption of allylic ether 11 (40 mm) upon treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 (20 mol%) to give [1,2]-Wittig product 13 in d8-toluene using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.1). The rearrangement showed a first-order consumption in substrate 11 (which was racemic throughout the reaction process), with a transient mixture of diastereoisomeric [2,3]-rearrangement products 12 detected (δH = 5.15 and 4.87 ppm) that accumulated to a maximum concentration of ≈15 mm and was subsequently transformed into the [1,2]-rearrangement product 13, consistent with 12 being an intermediate in the generation of 13. On a synthetic scale, stopping the reaction of allylic ether 8 after 1 h gave, at 75% conversion, a 63:37 mixture of [2,3]-product 14 and [1,2]-product 9 (96:4 e.r.). Purification gave 14 (89:11 d.r., both diastereoisomers 99:1 e.r.) in 21% yield whose absolute configuration was determined by N-trityl deprotection and subsequent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Information Section 6). The absolute configuration within 9 was confirmed by chemical synthesis (Supplementary Information Section 8.8), indicating stereoconvergence and retention of configuration at C(3) in the rearrangement of diastereoisomers 14 to 9. Separate control experiments validated the [2,3]-rearrangement products 14 as intermediates to the [1,2]-product 9 (Fig. with tBu-BIMP 7 and 4-NHAc-TEMPO for 5 h gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 60% yield (99:1 e.r.) alongside 10% of N-tritylisatin, while treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 and TEMPO gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 43% yield (97:3 e.r.) alongside 12% of TEMPO-adduct (T-a) and 15% of N-tritylisatin. Treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 alone gave 9 in 83% yield (96:4 e.r.) with 12% of N-tritylisatin observed, while the use of achiral base 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) on 14 also promoted rearrangement, but to moderate 50% conversion, giving 9 in 36% yield but with high enantioselectivity (96:4 e.r.). This is consistent with DBU or tBu-BIMP 7 acting as a base and not notably influencing enantiospecificity in this [1,3]-rearrangement process. Consistent with this observation, monitoring the conversion of 14 (89:11 d.r.) to 9 upon treatment with racemic or enantiopure BIMP derivatives did not lead to significant rate differences (Supplementary Information Section 5.2) implying no matched and mismatched reactant combinations. Taken together these experiments are consistent with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO leading to enhanced enantiospecificity in the base-promoted stereoconvergent [1,3]-rearrangement. This is consistent with selective fragment trapping within this process leading to enhanced selectivity, with the origin of this phenomenon discussed in ‘Mechanistic analysis'. The [2,3]-product 14 could also be transformed into the [1,2]-Wittig product 9 when heated at 100 °C without the addition of base, albeit with reduced yield (31%) and enantioselectivity (92:8 e.r.). Crossover experiments (Fig. 2d) using a 50:50 mixture of ethers 15 and 16 either with tBu-BIMP 7 alone (conditions a), or with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO (conditions b), resulted in only [1,2]-products 17 and 18, consistent with an intramolecular process in operation, with enhanced product enantioselectivity again observed in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO. a, Initial observations of [1,2]-Wittig reaction products and additive effect. b, In situ reaction monitoring of [1,2]-Wittig cascade by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Having identified a viable reaction pathway, the scope of the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig cascade was examined (Table 1). Changing the C(3′)-alkyl substituent from methyl to ethyl was tolerated, giving 19, while using a C(3′)-cyclopropyl-substituted allylic ether as a radical probe generated only [1,2]-rearrangement product 20 (40% yield, 96:4 e.r.) with the cyclopropyl ring intact. Although indicative, the absence of ring-opened products does not exclude a radical mechanism since in-cage carbon–carbon radical recombination (rate constant typically estimated to be >1011 s−1) is considered much faster than ring opening of a cyclopropyl methyl radical (k = 1.3 × 108 s−1)35. Increasing the steric hindrance through incorporation of a C(3′)-phenyl substituent resulted in moderate conversion (Supplementary Information Section 4). This necessitated changing the N-trityl substituent to an N-benzyl for increased reactivity, giving 21 in 61% yield but reduced product enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r. ), consistent with screening studies that necessitated N-trityl substitution for optimal enantioselectivity (Supplementary Information Section 2). A limitation of this process showed that both a (Z)-configured allylic ether and a dimethyl terminal allylic ether returned only starting material under the reaction conditions. Variation of the C(3′)-aryl substituent showed that the incorporation of halogens (4-F, 4-Cl and 4-Br), electron-withdrawing (4-CF3) as well as electron-donating (4-Ph, 4-Me, 4-MeO) substituents were tolerated, giving the [1,2]-rearrangement products 13, 18, 22–26 in high yields and enantioselectivity. The incorporation of 3-Me and 2-Me substituents (27, 28) was also tolerated, although with lower yields for the 2-Me-substituted example. In addition, 2-naphthyl-, thien-2-yl- and thiazol-2-yl-substituted ethers all afforded the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products 29–31 in 71% to 82% yields with 93:7 to 94:6 e.r. Substituent variation within the 4-, 5- and 6-positions of the oxindole included the incorporation of halogen (5-F, 5-Cl, 5-I, 6-Br, 6-Cl), electron-withdrawing (5-O2N) and electron-donating (5-Me, 5-MeO) substituents that gave the corresponding products 17, 32–39 in 67% to 80% yield and up to 96:4 e.r. While N-tritylation of 7-chloroisatin was unsuccessful, the N-benzyl analogue was prepared and tested, giving 40 in 81% yield but reduced enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r. To further probe the generality of this transformation, the effect of incorporating C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substituents within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. In contrast to the parent C(3′)-methyl series, treatment of 41 and 43 with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature gave exclusively the corresponding [2,3]-rearrangement products 42 (91:9 d.r., 98:2 e.r.) with no formation of the [1,2]-product. To convert these enantioenriched [2,3]-products to the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products increased reaction temperatures (≥100 °C for 42 and 44) and the addition of stoichiometric DBU (1 equiv.) was required. For example, stereoconvergence of the separable diastereoisomers (3S,1′S)- and (3S,1′R)-44 upon treatment with DBU in mesitylene at 120 °C was observed, with both giving (E,S)-[1,2]-Wittig product 45 in 94:6 and 93:7 e.r., respectively. Solvent polarity has a substantial effect upon the enantiospecificity of the [1,3]-rearrangement at these increased reaction temperatures (Supplementary Information Section 3) with highest product enantioselectivity observed in solvents of low polarity (toluene and mesitylene) rather than polar solvents (DMF or MeCN). Rearrangement with retention of configuration is still observed, although addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO does not lead to increased product e.r. in this series (Supplementary Information Section 3). Having demonstrated that high temperatures are required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement of the initially formed [2,3]-products, a telescoped process to allow one-pot access to [1,2]-Wittig products was developed that utilized toluene as a solvent (Fig. Treatment of a range of allylic ethers with tBu-BIMP 7 promoted enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, which was followed by the addition of DBU (1 equiv.) and heating to between 60 °C and 100 °C. Following this procedure, in the C(3′)-F series, inclusion of Ph-, 4-MeC6H4-, 4-MeOC6H4- and 4-F3CC6H4-substituted allylic ethers, as well as 4-Cl, 5-F, 5-NO2, 5-MeO and 6-Cl substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, giving the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products (46–54) with good to excellent enantioselectivity (91:9 to 97:3 e.r.). In the C(3′)-H series, variation of the aryl substituent within the allylic ether showed that Ph-, 4-MeOC6H4, 4-F3CC6H4, 4-FC6H4, 2-MeOC6H4, 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl substitution, heteroaromatic 3-thienyl and C(2′)-methyl substitution, alongside 4-Cl, 5-OMe and 6-Br substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, allowing the formation of enantioenriched [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement products 45, 55–65 (87:13 to 95:5 e.r.). Notably, lower product yields (41% to 73%) were observed in this one-pot process than noted in Fig. 3, reflecting the propensity for competitive decomposition at the elevated reaction temperatures required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement. a, Observations with C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substitution; selective formation of [2,3]-rearrangement product and temperature required to promote [1,3]-rearrangement. b, Substrate scope and limitations of the telescoped [1,2]-Wittig process; all e.r. values determined by HPLC analysis on a chiral stationary phase; all yields are isolated yields; tBu-BIMP 7 (20 mol %) used to prepare 62. Having demonstrated the scope of this transformation, consideration to the mechanism of this cascade was given. Initial association of tBu-BIMP 7 to substrate I by hydrogen bonding is assumed to direct deprotonation of the allylic ether–BIMP complex II to give III, with subsequent concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement giving IV with high stereoselectivity (Fig. Protonation and catalyst release gives isolable V. A subsequent base-promoted (tBu-BIMP or DBU), anion-accelerated [1,3]-rearrangement from IV36, which proceeds with retention of configuration at the carbinol centre, generates [1,2]-Wittig product VI. Computational methods were used to gain mechanistic insight into the [2,3]- and [1,3]-rearrangement processes. Eight binding modes between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate were considered (Supplementary Fig. 19) and conformationally searched using CREST (GFN2-xTB; Ar = Ph, X = Me)37,38,39. The lowest energy conformer from each search was then optimized in Gaussian 1640 using ONIOM41,42 to reduce the computational complexity for this large system. The peripheral components of both catalyst and substrate were treated with semi-empirical quantum mechanics and placed in the low layer, while the atoms involved in bond breaking and forming were treated with density functional theory (DFT). Full DFT single point energies were performed on all stationary points (Supplementary Information Section 7). These calculations were conducted on substrate 8 (Ar = Ph, X = Me; Fig. 4a) in the presence of catalyst 7 unless otherwise stated (Fig. Previous studies have shown that there is good agreement between ONIOM and full DFT calculations for other organocatalytic systems43,44,45,46,47,48,49. a, Plausible mechanisms considered for the [1,2]-Wittig cascade. b, Lowest energy [2,3]-rearrangement TSs (M06-2X/Def2-TZVPP/IEFPCM(mesitylene)//ONIOM(M06-2X/6-31+G(d):AM1)) leading to the formation of the four possible stereoisomers; images were created in CYLview2063. Relative free energies are listed below each structure. Distances in Å. c, Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) plot for the [1,3]-fragmentation TS (S,S)-TS IVF (ONIOM(M06-2X/6-31+G(d):AM1)), (Ar = 4-FC6H4). To study the origins of stereoselectivity, transition states (TSs) leading to each of the four possible stereoisomers for the BIMP-catalysed [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement were located (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Consistent with experimental results (Fig. 2c), the calculated lowest energy exo-TS forms the (S,S)-stereoisomer, with the difference in free energy between this and the lowest energy exo-(R,R)-TS (1.57 kcal mol−1; Fig. 4b) resulting in a computed e.r. The diastereomeric ratio computed from the exo-(S,S)- and endo-(S,R)-TS III energies (ΔΔG‡ = 1.16 kcal mol−1) is 86:14. These ratios are consistent with the experimentally observed levels of stereoselectivity in the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. To gain insight into the origins of enantioselectivity, the structures of exo-(S,S)- and exo-(R,R)-TS III were compared, revealing key differences in hydrogen bonding capability between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate. In exo-(S,S)-TS III, three stabilizing NH···O hydrogen bonds from the catalyst to the substrate oxygen atoms are observed, while in exo-(R,R)-TS III, only two NH···O hydrogen bonds are seen alongside an unusual, longer and weaker NH···C interaction with a reacting carbon atom (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. The origins of diastereoselectivity can be understood by comparison of exo-(S,S)-TS III and endo-(S,R)-TS III. A shorter distance between the centroids of the allylic aryl substituent and an N-trityl Ph substituent in exo-(S,S)-TS III (4.74 Å) relative to endo-(S,R)-TS III (5.12 Å) is observed, suggesting a more favourable T-shaped π-stacking interaction, leading to the preference for the (S,S)-stereoisomer51 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. Computational analysis subsequently studied the feasibility of a concerted rearrangement or a stepwise fragmentation followed by a recombination process (Fig. 4a) for the onwards reaction of (S,S)-IV (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Although examples of [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements are reported52,53,54,55,56,57,58, despite extensive efforts it was not possible to locate concerted TSs for this [1,3]-rearrangement process, even with constraints between the bond-forming and bond-breaking atoms; some unconstrained attempts resulted in geometries that resembled TS IV (fragmentation). Optimization of fragmentation TSs was possible but attempts to locate a TS that connects the fragment complex and the recombination product were all unsuccessful. An energy scan starting from the recombination product up to a fragment complex (Supplementary Fig. 23) showed no peak in the potential energy surface between 1.6 and 3.5 Å, which suggests that VI forms via a near-barrierless recombination event. Reoptimization of the lowest energy (S,S)-TS IV conformer with unrestricted methods showed no appreciable spin density on any atom, which is consistent with an ionic rather than a homolytic fragmentation. The lowest energy conformer of (S,S)-IV and (S,S)-TS IV were then reoptimized with Ar = 4-FC6H4, X = Me such that the calculated reaction barrier could be directly compared to that derived from in situ reaction monitoring (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4 and 7.3). The intrinsic reaction coordinate data for the reoptimized 4-FC6H4 TS ((S,S)-TS IVF) is shown in Fig. 4c (for optimized structures of (S,S)-IVF, (S,S)-TS IVF and fragment complex see Supplementary Fig. The computed barrier for the fragmentation step of this [1,3]-rearrangement (ΔG‡comp = 20.97 kcal mol−1) closely matches that derived from kinetic fitting of the reaction profile generated via in situ monitoring of 11→12→13 (ΔG‡exp = 21.90 kcal mol−1; see Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4). To experimentally probe the validity of this proposed fragmentation–recombination pathway, taking isolated racemic [2,3]-rearrangement products that differed in the electronic effect of C(1′)-aryl substituents with tBu-BIMP 7 showed that inclusion of electron-withdrawing substituents led to enhanced reaction rates. Hammett analysis (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Information Section 5.2) revealed a ρ value of +0.76 when plotted against the substituent constant σ−. Although small, this ρ value is consistent with the build-up of partial negative charge within the rate-limiting TS of the reaction and the proposed anionic fragmentation. Notably, no significant difference in reaction rate was observed when using BIMP catalysts with either racemic or enantioenriched [2,3]-rearrangement products (Supplementary Information Section 5.3). Building on this observation, the effect of incorporating an electron-withdrawing ester substituent at C(3′) within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Information Section 3). Treatment of 66 (R1 = Me) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature promoted initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, leading to [1,2]-product 67 in 55% yield (98:2 e.r.) alongside aldol product 68 (15%, 75:25 d.r., 88:12 e.r.) and N-tritylisatin (7%). Notably, treatment of 69 (R1 = H) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature for 1 h, followed by warming at 40 °C for 2 h led to facile fragmentation, giving [1,2]-product 70 in 48% yield (95:5 e.r.) in conjunction with ethyl crotonate (22% yield) and N-tritylisatin (26%). The generation of ethyl crotonate 71 and N-tritylisatin is consistent with the ester substituent facilitating anionic fragmentation from an initially formed [2,3]-product, with protonation and isomerization giving 71. Building on these observations, the observed [1,3]-rearrangement with retention of configuration and high enantiospecificity is consistent with anionic fragmentation from an alkoxide·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ complex generating an intimate ion pair consisting of an allylic anion and N-tritylisatin·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ (Fig. Recombination at the terminal allylic position upon the Re-face of the isatin occurs at a faster rate than ion pair dissociation, or conformational change and bond rotation, to allow Si-face addition of the isatin that would lead to reduced product enantioselectivity. Given this anionic fragmentation–recombination mechanism the observation of improved product enantioselectivity on addition of TEMPO derivatives (Fig. 2a) is ascribed to initial single-electron transfer oxidation of an anionic carbanion intermediate by TEMPO as it dissociates from the intimate ion pair, followed by trapping with a second equivalent of TEMPO, consistent with observations by Studer and co-workers alongside others59,60,61,62. Alternative mechanisms involving radical fragmentation and subsequent recombination, or anionic fragmentation and protonation, followed by C-H abstraction by TEMPO and subsequent radical recombination were ruled out (Supplementary Information Section 3). a, Hammett analysis of the [1,3]-rearrangement. b, Effect of anion-stabilizing ester substituents. To conclude, a cascade process that allows the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers has been developed, providing enantioenriched homoallylic tertiary alcohols with high enantioselectivity. Contrary to existing dogma, mechanistic studies and quantum chemistry calculations strongly support a cascade mechanism for this process that involves an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement of the allylic ether catalysed by a chiral tBu-BIMP catalyst. This is followed by a base-promoted anionic fragmentation–recombination pathway (base, tBu-BIMP or DBU) that proceeds with high levels of enantiospecificity even at elevated reaction temperatures. Substitution of the allylic fragment markedly affects the effectiveness of the fragmentation–recombination pathway, with anion-stabilizing ester substituents facilitating fragmentation, and with C(3′)-alkyl substitution leading to enhanced rates of [1,2]-product formation over C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substitution. Given the importance of understanding fundamental reaction processes that lead to stereochemical control, the enantiospecificity observed in this non-concerted pathway will have broader implications for a plethora of other related synthetic transformations. Typical procedures for the [1,2]-rearrangement cascade at room temperature and upon heating are exemplified below. The allylic ether substrate 8 (52.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), tBu-BIMP 7 (14.7 mg, 0.02 mmol) and 4-NHAc-TEMPO (4.3 mg, 0.02 mmol) were added to a flame-dried Schlenk tube and the tube was flushed with N2 three times. Mesitylene (2 ml, 0.05 M) was added through the septum under a positive pressure of N2. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h until completion as indicated by thin-layer chromatography analysis. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product, which was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent hexane:EtOAc = 4:1→3:1) to afford 9 (38.0 mg, 73%) as a colourless amorphous solid. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALCEL OD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 7.0 min, retention time (major) =8.7 min; 5:95 e.r. The allylic ether substrate 43 (101.5 mg, 1.0 equiv.) and tBu-BIMP 7 (14.8 mg, 10 mol%) were added to a vial before the addition of toluene (4 ml, 0.05 M). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, then DBU (28 μl, 1.0 equiv.) was added, and the mixture was then heated to 100 °C and stirred for 16 h, then quenched by addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl and diluted with EtOAc. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent 80:20→75:25 petrol:EtOAc) to afford 45 (58 mg, 57%) as a yellow amorphous solid. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALPAK AD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 12.5 min, retention time (major) =14.6 min; 5:95 e.r.

Immune molecules and their cognate receptors are developmentally regulated in brain and dynamically expressed in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the importance of immune molecules to brain wiring, a comprehensive map of the neuroimmune landscape is lacking in developing brain. Here we employed multiplexed in situ spatial transcriptomics to measure the expression of major immune ligands and receptors in developing mouse brain during mid and late gestation. Given the importance of maternal environment in shaping fetal neurodevelopment, we determined how embryonic neuroimmune landscape was altered after maternal immune activation (MIA) and maternal microbiome depletion. Our study revealed notable sex-specific patterns in gene expression and spatial architecture within developing brain. We observed changes in the CXCL12/CXCR7 chemokine network after MIA and microbiome depletion, suggesting a potential common mechanism underlying neural progenitor abnormalities. This resource underscores how the maternal environment programs precise regulation of immune molecules in developing brain, highlighting sex-specific vulnerability.

Nature Chemical Biology (2026)Cite this article Assessing drug–target engagement in living cells is essential for verifying the activity of pharmacological agents. Traditional binding assays often overlook key factors such as permeability, intracellular distribution and complex formation that influence target occupancy in cells. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based probes enable direct, quantitative assessment of small-molecule binding to proteins in live, intact cells. BRET provides sensitive detection of target engagement across a wide range of target classes, including less-tractable proteins in membrane compartments. Compared to other existing methods, BRET offers quantification of drug occupancy at steady state and open system regimens. Recent innovations in this platform have expanded its utility beyond occupancy confirmation to include applications in polypharmacology and mechanism-of-action studies. Here, we provide an updated perspective on BRET target engagement assays as versatile tools for chemical biology and early-stage drug discovery.

Surface terminations critically govern the properties of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes), yet a universal strategy to obtain MXenes with uniform and controllable terminations remains elusive. Here we introduce a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching strategy that employs iodine vapour, halide molten salts and MAX phases to produce MXenes with pure and precisely tunable halogen terminations (Cl, Br, I or their combinations). In this process, halide molten salts dissolve iodine via interhalogen anion formation while efficiently transporting etching by-products. The resulting MXenes retain excellent structural integrity, yielding uniformly ordered surfaces. As a representative example, Ti3C2Cl2 shows a 160-fold enhancement in macroscopic conductivity and a 13-fold enhancement in terahertz conductivity relative to conventional Cl/O-terminated Ti3C2, attributed to minimized electron trapping and scattering. Beyond single-halogen terminations, the gas–liquid–solid approach enables dual- and triple-halogen termination control, providing a general platform for tailoring MXene surface chemistry towards advanced (opto)electronic applications. Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, also known as MXenes, have emerged as a large group of multifunctional materials, characterized by the chemical formula Mn+1XnTx (M: transition metal, X: carbon or nitrogen, Tx: surface terminations)1. The partially filled d-orbitals of transition metals endow MXenes with a wealth of free electrons, resulting in outstanding electrical conductivity. The intrinsic metallic nature makes MXenes particularly appealing for applications where efficient charge transport is essential, such as electrocatalysis2, energy storage devices3, electromagnetic interference shielding4, terahertz detectors5 and various (opto)electronic devices. A distinguishing feature of MXenes is their adjustable surface terminations, which cover the exposed metal atoms on the MXene surface. These surface terminations have been shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to determine the intrinsic intralayer charge transport properties of MXenes by manipulating the electronic structure of the surface metal atoms6. In addition, they can markedly impact macroscopic charge transport in MXene films composed of multiple nanoflakes or grains7, with intergrain electron hopping being identified as the dominant mechanism8. However, the currently reported MXenes often possess mixed and mostly randomly distributed terminations, leading to surface disordering that causes severe electron trapping and scattering, consequently compromising the intrinsic charge transport9. Moreover, the lack of MXenes with uniform terminations poses a substantial obstacle to experimentally determining the impact of specific terminations on both intrinsic charge transport and intergrain electron hopping. Achieving this fundamental understanding is crucial for optimizing MXene properties and broadening their range of applications. The random arrangement of terminations on MXenes stems from the intricate top-down etching synthesis process used to produce these materials from layered ternary metal carbides/nitrides (MAX phases). Typically, the synthesis process involves selectively removing the A-layers (for example, Al or Si) of MAX using strong acidic etchants, which exposes the transition metal atom layers to the surface. Anionic species in the reaction environment tend to bond with the exposed transition metal atoms for charge balance, acting as terminations on the MXene surface. The most common method employed is wet-chemistry etching using F- or Cl-containing aqueous acids, which generally yields MXenes with mixed terminations (–OH, –O or –F/–Cl) arranged randomly10,11. An alternative approach uses Lewis-acid halide salts as etchants in conjunction with molten salts to create a ‘solid–liquid' reaction environment under inert gas protection12,13,14. This approach also requires subsequent washing steps using aggressive oxidizing agents to eliminate side products, which inadvertently introduces O terminations and causes termination disordering. A few additional etching methods have also been proposed, including electrochemical and hydrothermal etching15,16. However, these approaches similarly result in MXenes characterized by mixed and randomly distributed terminations. Recently, a bottom-up approach was developed to synthesize Ti2CCl2 MXene with uniform terminations17, marking an important step towards MXene synthesis. Nonetheless, this method is currently limited to a few selected types of MXene. It is highly desirable to develop synthesis methods that can be universally applied to diverse MXenes, while ensuring ordered and uniform terminations. In this work, we develop a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching protocol (denoted GLS) that is capable of synthesizing diverse MXenes characterized by uniform and controllably orchestrated halogen terminations. The etching reaction involves solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salt and gas-phase I2 vapour. Iodine is selected as the etching agent because the generated by-products (for example, AlI3 and KI) can be readily removed through simple washing. The effectiveness of iodine as an etchant has been previously verified both in wet-solution phases and in a high-temperature vapour phase18,19,20. The halide molten salt acts as a crucial intermediate that dissolves the I2 etchant by forming interhalogen anions, creates a solid–liquid interface and facilitates the transport of side products for effective etching. After the etching reaction, a simple ethanol wash is able to completely remove generated side products and unreacted reactants, preventing contamination and disordering of the MXene terminations. We showcase the versatility of the GLS method by synthesizing MXenes from eight distinct types of MAX phase. Using Ti3C2 MXene as a representative example, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis of Ti3C2 with uniform Cl, Br and I terminations by utilizing different halide salts. The highly ordered and pure terminations of the yielded MXenes are confirmed by atomic-resolution ultralow-energy secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations. Importantly, our study highlights the critical role of uniform halogen terminations in substantially improving the charge transport properties of MXenes. For instance, the achieved Ti3C2Cl2 with ordered Cl terminations exhibits a 161.6-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity and a 12.7-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity compared with Ti3C2 with mixed Cl/O terminations (denoted ClO-Ti3C2). These enhancements are attributed to the mitigation of electron trapping and scattering, facilitated by the high structural ordering associated with the uniform Cl terminations. Six examples of Ti3C2 with varying proportions of mixed halogen terminations are successfully synthesized. This tunability opens avenues for further termination modifications with chalcogens or organic groups, as highlighted in previous studies6,21, thereby broadening their functional versatility. We started by synthesizing MXenes with mono-halogen terminations using our GLS etching method. Typically, the GLS synthesis was conducted in a sealed glass tube containing iodine, potassium halide salt (KI, KBr or KCl), and MAX as the precursors (Fig. Upon annealing, the precursors underwent a transformation into a triphasic system, comprising a solid-phase MAX phase, liquid-phase molten potassium halide and gas-phase I2 vapour. The molten potassium halide acted as a crucial reaction intermediate, facilitating the dissolution of I2 vapour by forming interhalogen anions (TI2−, T = I, Br or Cl), which enabled solid–liquid etching and aided in the transport of etchant (TI2−) and side products (AlI3 and KI). During the etching process, halogen anions from the molten salt attached to the exposed metal atoms of MXene, resulting in uniform and impurity-free terminations. Using Ti3AlC2 as a representative example, Fig. 1b illustrates the overall reaction process to obtain Ti3C2 MXenes with uniform halogen terminations (Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2). The overall reaction can be described by equation (1). The side products (AlI3) and unreacted I2 are highly soluble in ethanol, allowing easy removal by washing with ethanol in a glovebox. The generated KI and unreacted potassium halide salts are also soluble in ethanol and can be removed through iterative ethanol washing (Supplementary Fig. The overall synthesis process of MXenes does not involve any hazards or oxidative compounds, effectively avoiding termination contamination. The synthesis yields of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 from 1 g of Ti3AlC2 are calculated to be 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively. We demonstrated the synthesis of up to 10 g of Ti3C2Cl2 in a single batch using a custom-designed laboratory set-up, highlighting its strong potential for industrial-scale production (Supplementary Fig. In addition, apart from Ti3AlC2, our GLS approach also works for seven additional MAX phases, including Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, TiNbAlC, Nb2AlC, Nb4AlC3 and Mo2Ga2C. With an I2–KCl–MAX combination, we exemplified the successful synthesis of Ti3CNCl2 (Supplementary Fig. To validate the synthesis mechanism, we conducted annealing time-dependent ex situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å) analysis to track the compound evolution during the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. Given the strong hygroscopic nature of AlI3, all samples underwent rapid ethanol washing before PXRD measurement, during which AlI3, together with I2, can be completely removed. By examining the (0002) peaks of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Cl2, we observed a gradual conversion from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2Cl2. After annealing for 54 h, Ti3AlC2 was fully converted to Ti3C2Cl2. In addition, with increasing annealing time, the intensity of characteristic KCl peaks exhibited a continuous weakening trend, while the intensity of characteristic KI peaks gradually increased. This phenomenon indicates the consumption of KCl during the reaction to form Cl terminations on MXenes, generating KI as the side product, thus confirming the reaction mechanism depicted in equation (1). In addition, the formation of interhalogen anions during the synthesis process was confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy analysis, macroscopic colour changes on the annealing products and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. The presence of interhalogen anions was identified as a crucial factor in promoting etching efficiency. As a control study, PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig. 13) shows that potassium halide salts alone do not etch the MAX phase to yield MXenes in the GLS system. Moreover, we attempted to synthesize Ti3C2I2 MXene with a solid–gas biphasic system of I2 and Ti3AlC2. After 54 h of annealing, although the formation of Ti3C2I2 was detected in the synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) pattern, the presence of Ti3AlC2 was still evident, contrasting with the complete conversion of Ti3AlC2 achieved using our triphasic GLS method for the same duration of reaction (Supplementary Fig. Like MXenes synthesized through other methods, the obtained Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 15), display an accordion-like morphology, which is distinguished from the bulk morphology of Ti3AlC2. These layered MXenes can be further delaminated into single- or few-layer nanoflakes using a liquid-phase chemical exfoliation approach with n-butyllithium (Fig. The Ti3C2Cl2 nanoflakes suspended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) present a noticeable Tyndall effect when illuminated by a laser pointer. Meanwhile, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image discloses the single- or few-layer character of the exfoliated flakes, with the thickness of a single layer measuring approximately 1.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. a,b, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ti3C2Cl2 crystals (scale bar, 2 μm) (a) and the exfoliated single- or few-layer nanoflakes (scale bar, 2 μm) (b).

Ti K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were next collected to evaluate the chemical and local coordination environments of Ti atoms in the three MXenes. In the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 2c), all three Ti3C2 MXenes exhibit a similar spectrum shape to their corresponding metal carbide reference, TiC. The noticeably higher E0 of Ti3C2Cl2 compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 suggests stronger hybridization between the surface Ti and Cl orbitals, probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms. Besides, Ti K-edge Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) R-space spectra were derived22 (Supplementary Fig. 17), and wavelet-transform analysis of EXAFS in R and k spaces was further performed for Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. The contour intensity reveals the coordination environment around Ti atoms, including the first-shell metal-termination scattering (1.67 Å for Ti–Cl, 1.73 Å for Ti–Br and 1.76 Å for Ti–I in R space) and second-shell Ti–C–Ti scattering (2.41 Å for Ti3C2Cl2, 2.55 Å for Ti3C2Br2 and 2.57 Å for Ti3C2I2 in R space). Overall, different halogen terminations cause slight changes in the Ti-termination distance and the Ti3C2 backbone thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of mono-halogen terminations in all three MXene samples (Supplementary Fig. No iodine signals were detected in Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2, indicating that the terminations are entirely dependent on the molten salts used in the synthesis. It is important to note that the O 1s signals are attributed to C–O bonds, which may arise from lattice oxygen within the carbon layers, as previously reported6,23. To elucidate the crystalline structures, SXRD patterns (λ = 0.4142 Å) of the three MXenes were collected, and their atomic structures were determined using DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig. 2g, the SXRD pattern of Ti3C2Cl2 aligns well with a hexagonal structure characterized by the P63/mmc space group, exhibiting lattice parameters of a = b = 3.16 Å and c = 22.19 Å. 2i) both exhibit a hexagonal structure. We further sought to reveal the atomic arrangement of the three Ti3C2 MXenes by using quantitative atomic-resolution ultralow-energy SIMS23,25. This technique utilizes low-energy Cs+ ions to achieve layer-by-layer sputtering towards the sample surface at a high incident angle, enabling the elemental distribution to be resolved over the sample with atomic-depth resolution. As expected, the Ti3C2 backbone was distinctly identified in the quantitative SIMS analysis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. O signals were detected only in the C layers, consistent with the previous reports8,23. Notably, on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone, a monolayer of halogen atoms is visualized as the terminations, with no impurity elements detected between the Ti3C2 layers. Importantly, taking Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, depth profiling across multiple layers further verifies that each termination layer is uniformly Cl-terminated (Supplementary Fig. For comparison, we synthesized ClO-Ti3C2 through the classic Lewis-acid molten salt approach12. By contrast, strong Cl and O signals were observed at the termination positions of ClO-Ti3C2 (Supplementary Fig. These findings underscore the uniform nature of the terminations on MXenes synthesized via our GLS method. a–c, Quantitative atomic-resolution SIMS depth profiles of Ti3C2Cl2 (a), Ti3C2Br2 (b) and Ti3C2I2 (c). d–f, Cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images of Ti3C2Cl2 (d), Ti3C2Br2 (e) and Ti3C2I2 (f) (scale bars, 1 nm), with the corresponding enlarged views (scale bars, 0.5 nm). In addition, high-resolution TEM images and selected area electron diffraction patterns confirm the excellent crystallinity and hexagonal structure of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) was further used to obtain atomic-resolution cross-sectional images of the MXenes. 3d), three distinct Ti layers in the Ti3C2 backbone are clearly identified. By contrast, the heavier atomic masses of Br and I in Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 3f) are more clearly visible in the HAADF-STEM images, where they appear as distinct monolayers on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone. The interlayer distances of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 were determined to be 1.12 nm, 1.21 nm and 1.28 nm, respectively, in close agreement with the SXRD analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 26) reveal a uniform distribution of Ti, C and halogen elements within individual MXene particles. Quantitative analysis (Supplementary Table 3) indicates that the chemical formulas of the three MXenes can be represented as Ti2.9±0.3C2.0±0.2Cl2.0±0.3O0.1±0.03, Ti3.2±0.3C1.8±0.1Br1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04 and Ti3.3±0.3C1.9±0.1I1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04, closely resembling the ideal Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 formulas. A small amount of oxygen detected is attributable to lattice oxygen in Ti3C2, consistent with our SIMS analysis. In addition, to systematically evaluate the air-oxidation resistance of MXenes synthesized via our GLS method, we conducted time-dependent XPS and atomic-resolution SIMS on Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Figs. All samples were obtained from the same batch and stored under ambient conditions for defined periods before testing. The results consistently show that MXenes produced by the GLS method remain stable in air for at least 8 weeks, with no substantial structural changes, particularly in the termination layers. The highly pure and ordered terminations are expected to minimize electron trapping and scattering in MXenes, potentially leading to a substantial improvement in their charge transport properties. We first assessed the direct-current conductivities σdc of MXene pellets utilizing the temperature-dependent van der Pauw method (Fig. In general, macroscopic charge transport in MXene-based pellets is dominated by thermally activated intergrain electron hopping, leading to a continuously increasing conductivity as the temperature rises9,26. However, both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 exhibit metallic behaviour from 300 K down to ~100 K, with conductivity decreasing as temperature increases. Below 100 K, conductivities of both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 rise with increasing temperature. Hall effect measurements on ultrathin Ti3C2Cl2 film further confirmed this phenomenon (Supplementary Fig. 30a,b), which can be attributed to electron localization effects. A similar transition from high-temperature metallic to low-temperature localized electron transport has previously been observed in highly controlled epitaxial thin films of related materials27. Notably, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibited the highest electrical conductivity (51,380 S m−1 at 300 K), compared with Ti3C2Br2 (11,126 S m−1 at 300 K) and Ti3C2I2 (4,149 S m−1 at 300 K). Moreover, we measured the electrical conductivity of previously reported ClO-Ti3C2 (ref. 12) and Ti3C2 MXene synthesized via the conventional wet-chemistry hydrofluoric acid (HF)-etching method10 (denoted HF-Ti3C2) for comparison. Impressively, the Ti3C2Cl2 achieved approximately 160-fold and 13.5-fold increases in macroscopic electrical conductivity relative to ClO-Ti3C2 (318 S m−1 at 300 K) and HF-Ti3C2 (3,815 S m−1 at 300 K), respectively. To better compare the macroscopic electrical conductivity with reported literatures, we fabricated MXene thin films from delaminated MXene flakes and measured their conductivity using the van der Pauw method (Supplementary Fig. These values are comparable with those reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, time-dependent electrical conductivity measurements further demonstrated that Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits superior oxidation resistance compared with ClO-Ti3C2. After 4 weeks of air exposure, the conductivity of the Ti3C2Cl2 film decreased by only 12.5%, whereas that of ClO-Ti3C2 dropped by 86.5% (Supplementary Fig. Data points are the average of ten measurements. Error bars are the combined uncertainties from standard deviation, electrical noise and thickness measurement. b, Average terahertz conductivity values derived from frequency-resolved static terahertz conductivity plots of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2, Ti3C2I2 and ClO-Ti3C2. c, Time-resolved terahertz photoconductivity (∆σTHz, proportional to the pump-induced relative changes in the transmitted field, −ΔE/E) normalized to the absorbed photon density (Nabs) for Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2, Ti3C2I2 and ClO-Ti3C2. d, Simulated primitive cell, band structure and density of states (DOS) of Ti3C2Cl2. e,f, Simulated electron transport and scattering patterns from left (L) to right (R) electrodes across the Ti3C2Cl2 (e) and ClO-Ti3C2 (f) lattices. g, Simulated current–voltage curves for Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2. We further explored intraflake transport in our MXenes using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, leveraging the transient nature of the terahertz electric field to probe short-range charge transport properties at the nanoscale9,28,29. We first conducted frequency-resolved static terahertz conductivity across a ~0.3–2.1 THz range (Supplementary Fig. 32), with the average terahertz conductivity values derived and compared in Fig. Compared with ClO-Ti3C2 (397 S m−1), Ti3C2Cl2 achieved a 13-fold increase in terahertz conductivity, highlighting a substantial enhancement in its intrinsic intraflake conductivity. Considering the 160-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity, we conclude that the uniform Cl terminations in Ti3C2Cl2 also substantially enhance intragrain electron hopping compared with ClO-Ti3C2. Optical pump–terahertz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy elucidated the charge carrier dynamics and mechanisms governing the intrinsic intraflake charge transport of MXenes. In the OPTP measurement, additional charge carriers were photogenerated in MXenes using an optical pump pulse (1.55 eV laser pulse with ~50 fs duration) and then probed by a single-cycle terahertz pulse. Figure 4c illustrates the photoconductivity dynamics of our three MXenes in comparison with ClO-Ti3C2. In each sample, a transient increase in photoconductivity signifies the generation of free carriers, followed by rapid decay due to recombination or trapping effects9. Moreover, ∆σTHz is correlated with the charge carrier mobility (µ) as described by equation (2), where N, e, ϕ and Nabs represent the charge carrier density, elementary charge, photon-to-free-charge conversion quantum yield and absorbed photon density, respectively. Assuming a similar ϕ for all MXene samples, the highest photoconductivity per absorbed photon density (∆σTHz/Nabs) observed in Ti3C2Cl2 (9.3 × 10−18 S m) indicates its largest charge carrier mobility, while that of ClO-Ti3C2 is 2.6 × 10−18 S m. Quantitatively, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates a 3.6-fold enhancement in charge carrier mobility compared with ClO-Ti3C2. DFT calculations were used to simulate the band structures of Ti3C2 MXenes, providing deeper insights into how Cl terminations enhance charge transport properties. We noticed that different halogen terminations substantially alter the band structure of Ti3C2 MXene, with Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 4d) exhibiting the highest electron density around the Fermi level compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. This effect is probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms, which enhances hybridization between the surface Ti and halogen orbitals. We also simulated the band structure of ClO-Ti3C2 (with a Cl/O ratio of 0.6/1.4; Supplementary Fig. 34), which presents minimal differences compared with Ti3C2Cl2. To further assess the impact of termination purity, electron transport through Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2 lattices was simulated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method in a two-probe pattern. Clearly, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates superior electron delocalization across the probes, whereas ClO-Ti3C2 shows notable electron localization near the left probe, leading to strong electron scattering. This interpretation is further supported by the quantified current–voltage curves (Fig. 4g) and electron transmittance patterns (Supplementary Fig. Together, these experimental and theoretical findings emphasize the critical role of uniform Cl terminations in enhancing the charge transport capabilities of MXenes. Electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the practical applicability of the halogen-terminated samples30. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36a, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits strong EMW absorption in a frequency range of ~14–18 GHz, with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −51.4 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 4.6 GHz. Meanwhile, Ti3C2Br2 exhibits strong absorption in the ~12–17 GHz range, with an RLmin of −54.6 dB and an EABmax of 4.6 GHz (Supplementary Fig. In comparison, Ti3C2I2 shows weaker EMW absorption, mainly in the ~16–18 GHz range, with an RLmin of −27.5 dB and an EABmax of 4.7 GHz (Supplementary Fig. This RLmin value is much higher than the previously reported Ti3C2Tx (~−20 dB) prepared by wet-chemistry methods31,32. By contrast, ClO-Ti3C2 shows its primary absorption at lower frequencies of ~6–9 GHz, with a RLmin of −61.4 dB and an EABmax of 4.4 GHz (Supplementary Fig. These results demonstrate that tuning the surface terminations can effectively shift the primary EMW absorption frequency range of Ti3C2 MXenes. This result suggests a promising strategy for designing MXene-based absorbers tailored to specific frequency bands for various practical applications. The strong dependence of MXene charge transport properties on termination type further motivated us to pursue controllable orchestration of halogen terminations on MXenes through our GLS synthesis method. In particular, DFT calculations not only revealed that mixed-halogen terminations are thermodynamically stable, but also demonstrated that they possess a more stable structure compared with single-halogen terminations (Supplementary Fig. We noticed that the termination type of MXenes is directly determined by the chosen molten salt in the GLS synthesis. While mono-type potassium halide salts were initially used to achieve single-halogen terminations, we further employed mixed molten salts to synthesize MXenes with dual- and triple-halogen terminations. Specifically, we synthesized Ti3C2 MXene with mixed halogen terminations: I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. 5c) and I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1 (Fig. In addition, taking Ti3C2 with mixed I/Br terminations as a model, we demonstrated precise control over the I/Br termination ratio with I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. These examples showcase the capability of our GLS method in controllably orchestrating halogen terminations, which would further expand the MXene family and offer a venue to precisely customize the intrinsic properties of MXenes. Finally, Supplementary Table 5 compares the GLS method with previously reported MXene synthesis approaches, underscoring its unique advantages in termination chemistry, structural stability, production scalability and electrical conductivity. a–f, SEM images, EDX mapping images and EDX spectra of Ti3C2 MXenes with mixed halogen terminations, including I:Br = 1:1 (a), I:Cl = 1:1 (b), Br:Cl = 1:1 (c), I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1 (d), I:Br = 1:2 (e) and I:Br = 2:1 (f). In summary, we have demonstrated a triphasic GLS etching method that is applicable to eight different types of MAX phase, enabling the production of their corresponding MXenes with uniform halogen terminations. This process integrates solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salts and gas-phase I2 vapour. The resulting MXenes are characterized by highly pure and ordered halogen terminations (Cl, Br or I). As a representative case, Ti3C2Cl2 synthesized via this method exhibited a 160-fold improvement in macroscopic charge transport, a 13-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity and a 3.6-fold rise in charge carrier mobility, compared with ClO-Ti3C2. These enhancements are attributed to the uniform Cl terminations with superior structural ordering, which effectively reduces electron trapping and scattering. In addition, the GLS synthesis demonstrated the capability for controllable orchestration of dual- and triple-halogen terminations on MXenes. Beyond broadening the MXene family with finely adjustable properties, controlled halogen terminations offer the potential for further surface functionalization, such as selective postsubstitution or covalent grafting on specific halogen terminations6,21. We envision that our GLS method will accelerate the development of MXenes with customized properties for advanced (opto)electronics and beyond. Ti3AlC2 and Nb2AlC MAX phases were purchased from Carbon-Ukraine. Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, TiNbAlC, Mo2Ga2C, Ti2AlN and Nb4AlC3 MAX phases were purchased from Jilin 11 Technology. Elemental iodine (I2), 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution in hexane, N-methylformamide (NMF), ethyl acetate (EA), HNO3, cellulose and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexane, tetrahydrofuran, potassium iodide (KI) and potassium bromide (KBr) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. High-purity ethanol (absolute, analytical reagent grade) was bought from Fisher Chemical. All chemicals were used directly without any purification. The GLS method used MAX phase, elemental iodine and halide salts to create a triphasic system for MXene synthesis. Taking the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, typically, 500 mg Ti3AlC2, 1,956 mg I2 and 575 mg KCl were mixed (molar ratio of 1:3:3) and placed in a home-made glass tube (Supplementary Fig. The tube was connected to a Schlenk line, purged with Ar gas three times to completely remove air and then vacuum-sealed to 10−2 mbar. The tube was flame-sealed with a butane torch (model: CHF CF211). Due to the volatility of I2, precursor materials were kept at the bottom of the glass tube in an ice-water bath during sealing to prevent iodine vapourization. The sealed glass tube was calcined at 600 °C in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for 54 h. After the reaction, the product was removed from the glass tube and washed eight times with high-purity ethanol to remove by-products such as AlI3 and KI, as well as unreacted KCl and I2. Each washing step involved 10 min of sonication in an ice-water bath to assist in dissolving any remaining salts. These washing steps were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox to prevent MXene oxidation. Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at room temperature for 24 h to obtain Ti3C2Cl2. Ti3C2I2-GS was synthesized following the same method as Ti3C2I2 but without the inclusion of any halide salts. The synthesis of ClO-Ti3C2 was conducted according to a previously reported procedure12. The delamination process of MXenes was carried out using an intercalation method8. Initially, 50 mg of MXenes and 1 ml of 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution were mixed in an Ar-filled glovebox and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Following this, the material underwent washing steps with high-purity hexane and tetrahydrofuran. The washed sample was then transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of anhydrous NMF and sonicated in an ice-water bath (<5 °C) for 40 min. The solution was centrifuged at 360g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min to isolate MXene nanoflakes, which were then dispersed in anhydrous NMP for subsequent use. XPS was analysed by an Axis Supra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). PXRD was performed by the AERIS XRD system (PANalytical) using Cu Kα. SEM images were collected using Zeiss Gemini S4 500. TEM investigations were conducted using a Talos F200X transmission microscope at 200 kV. The measurements were carried out in a STEM mode using the high-angle annular dark-field detector. EDX was used for chemical composition analysis. SIMS was performed via CAMECA IMS SC Ultra instrument with a Cs+ primary-ion beam23. The primary ion beam featured an ultralow impact energy of 100 eV, a moderate current of 6 nA and a standard spot diameter of 30 µm. Measurements were conducted using a negative detector polarity. Initially, a parallel beam of primary Cs+ ions was applied to gently remove surface impurities and promote the formation of a flat, clean crystal surface. Subsequently, low-energy Cs+ ions were directed towards the sample at a high incident angle to ensure selective interaction with only the topmost atomic layer. During this bombardment, atoms from the sample surface were sputtered off and detected as secondary ions. Synchrotron XAS measurements were conducted at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The XAS spectra were acquired in transmission mode at room temperature with photon energies centred around the Ti K edge (4,966 eV). The incident, transmitted and reference X-ray intensities were recorded using gas ionization chambers. A titanium foil standard was simultaneously measured with the samples and used for energy calibration. Before measurements, all powder samples were pressed into 8-mm pellets, homogeneously mixed with an appropriate amount of cellulose, and sealed between Kapton tapes inside an Ar-filled glovebox. The collected XANES and EXAFS data were subsequently processed and corrected using the Athena software (version 0.9.26)22. The EXAFS oscillation function, χ(k) (k-weights: 2), was extracted as a function of the photoelectron wave number k, within the selected radial range of 0–6 Å (Rmin = 0, Rmax = 6). The Morlet function was chosen as the mother wavelet, with parameters set to kappaMorlet = 10 and sigmaMorlet = 1. SXRD measurements were performed at the BL04 beamline of the ALBA synchrotron facility using an incident energy of 35 keV (λ = 0.4142 Å) and a high-angular-resolution multicrystal analyser detector set-up. The MXene powders were loaded into 0.3-mm-diameter glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH) and mounted on the dedicated sample stage provided by the beamline. The macroscopic direct current temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the MXene pellets was measured using the van der Pauw method in a commercial Physical Property Measurement System cryostat equipped with the electrical transport option and automatic contact switching (Quantum Design). Ohmic contacts were established using gold-plated spring-loaded probes on the clean surfaces of the MXene pellets. MXene pellets were made by using compressed powders with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of less than approximately 1 mm. MXene ultrathin films used for the conductivity measurement were prepared as follows. First, exfoliated MXenes were dispersed in NMF to form a stable suspension (~1 mg ml−1). After thorough mixing, 2 ml of EA was introduced, and the beaker was covered to approximately 90% of its opening, allowing the EA to evaporate slowly. Once the EA had completely evaporated, the MXene nanosheets spontaneously self-assembled into a continuous single-layer ultrathin film at the water-air interface. These films were subsequently transferred onto gold prepatterned four-probe SiO2/Si substrates and dried under vacuum. To minimize cracks or discontinuities, two layers of film were transferred for each sample. Terahertz spectroscopy was conducted using a commercial regenerative amplified mode-locked Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser system (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace, seeded by Mai Tai and pumped by Empower). The laser produced ~50-fs pulses centred at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Terahertz radiation was generated via optical rectification in a nonlinear zinc telluride (ZnTe) crystal oriented along the (110) direction. The transmitted THz electric field was detected using a second ZnTe crystal through the electro-optic sampling technique, probed by an 800-nm gating pulse. This configuration allowed frequency-resolved measurements in the range of 0.2−2.5 THz. To determine the terahertz conductivity of MXene thin films without photoexcitation, the transmitted terahertz pulse through the sample (Esample) was compared with that through a reference substrate (Ereference). When the film thickness (d) is much smaller than the terahertz wavelength (d/λ << 1), the thin-film approximation can be applied, as illustrated in equation (3). For OPTP measurements, the terahertz absorption induced by photoexcited charge carriers (excitation wavelength 800 nm) was monitored by fixing the sampling beam at the peak of the terahertz electric field. Time-dependent, pump-induced terahertz absorption was recorded by varying the temporal delay between the pump and terahertz probe pulses. To eliminate interference from water vapour absorption, the entire terahertz set-up was continuously purged with dry nitrogen. During measurements, the samples were either maintained under a dry nitrogen atmosphere or kept under vacuum (<2 × 10−4 mbar). The time-resolved photoconductive response (∆σTHz) of charge carriers was determined from the time-dependent change in the transmitted terahertz field (∆E) using the thin-film approximation, as expressed by equation (4), where Epump and E0 correspond to the peak amplitudes of the transmitted terahertz field with and without optical excitation, respectively. Similar to previously reported methods30, all samples were mixed with paraffin and fabricated into concentric rings with an inner diameter of 3.04 mm and an outer diameter of 7 mm for testing. The measurements were carried out using a standard coaxial-line method, using a vector network analyser (N5222B) to record the electromagnetic parameters, including the complex permittivity (εr = ε′ – jε′) and permeability (μr = μ;′ – jμ′). Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)33,34, based on the plane-wave projector augmented-wave method. Van der Waals interactions were taken into account by using the Grimme (DFT-D3) method36. An energy cut-off of 500 eV was set for all the simulations. We used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with single-zeta plus polarization numerical basis sets for all the transport simulations. A fast Fourier transform solver was used to address the system's Poisson–Schrödinger equation in a self-consistent manner. The transport calculations were performed at T = 300 K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface." SWOT was launched in December 2022 as a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Its main goal is to deliver the first global survey of Earth's surface water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes. Ruiz-Angulo said he and co-author Charly de Marez had spent more than two years studying SWOT data to understand everyday ocean features such as small eddies. "[We] had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami." In simple terms, this means the wave is expected to travel as a single, stable form rather than breaking into multiple waves that spread out over time. "The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run," Ruiz-Angulo added. "This 'extra' variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before." The researchers also noticed a mismatch between tsunami arrival times predicted by earlier models and the actual measurements recorded by two DART tide gauges. Their analysis suggested the earthquake rupture extended farther south than previously thought and stretched about 400 kilometers -- significantly longer than the 300 kilometers estimated by other models. "Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip," said study co-author Diego Melgar. Since that 2011 disaster, Melgar's research group and others have worked to better integrate DART buoy data into earthquake and tsunami analyses. Since then, Melgar's lab and others have been working on ways to include DART data in inversions, "but it is still not always done because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different than the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data. The Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone has produced some of the largest tsunamis on record, including a devastating event in 1952 triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. "With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting," Ruiz-Angulo said.
