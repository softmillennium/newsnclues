                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz battle Maria Sakkari and Stefanos Tsitsipas for a spot in the final four, the season heats up with Amanda Anisimova and Jessica Pegula making their highly anticipated debuts in Brisbane. Two compelling United Cup quarterfinals play out Wednesday in Perth as the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz continues its opening stretch, with the United States taking on Greece, followed by unbeaten Switzerland facing Argentina. Team USA captain Michael Russell was asked how he assessed the dramatic tie. “Look, the team fought so hard like we do. As Group A winner, Team USA was meant to play Perth's best runner-up -- Argentina -- but they already met in group play. Play begins with Gauff taking on a resurgent Maria Sakkari. Gauff and Harrison clinched both U.S. wins in mixed doubles. Sakkari and Tsitsipas -- both looking to reestablish themselves near their peak career rankings -- have guided Greece to the quarterfinals for the third time in four years. “Maria was the reason I really believed at first,” he said. That reignited a new flame inside of me. … I can't help but be proud that we're both in this together.” Sakkari is already off to a far brighter start than last season's 20-27 campaign, with strong wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. A year ago, Belinda Bencic was steadily working back from maternity leave. “We're living in Belinda's world again,” Stan Wawrinka said after Switzerland's win over Italy. Bencic is 4–0 across singles and doubles, including the deciding mixed doubles win with Jakub Paul to send Switzerland into the quarterfinals. She opens against Solana Sierra in their first career meeting. Wawrinka has also been outstanding, producing two long matches including a deciding-set tiebreak win over Arthur Rinderknech. Argentina's dominant 3-0 win over Spain -- and their 4-2 overall match record -- pushed them through. Mixed doubles: Bencic / Wawrinka vs. Maria Lourdes Carle / Guido Andreozzi Poland, last year's finalist, can clinch the Group F title and a quarterfinal berth against Australia. 2 Iga Swiatek faces Suzan Lamens at Ken Rosewall Arena. Swiatek needed two-and-a-half hours to defeat Eva Lys on Monday, improving to 12-2 overall at the United Cup and winning for the 31st time in her past 32 matches against players ranked outside the Top 40. 97, pushed Swiatek to three sets at last year's US Open. Another star-packed day as several headliners make their season debuts: No. [WTA] NB 2:00 p.m.: Paula Badosa / Aryna Sabalenka vs. Cristina Bucsa / Ellen Perez [WTA] Hsieh Su-Wei / Jelena Ostapenko vs. [WC] Priscilla Hon / Karolina Muchova Iva Jovic headlines Wednesday as the 18-year-old American continues her breakthrough week. While Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz battle Maria Sakkari and Stefanos Tsitsipas for a spot in the final four, the season heats up with Amanda Anisimova and Jessica Pegula making their highly anticipated debuts in Brisbane.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marta Kostyuk had an intentional offseason, taking an extended break to recharge and focusing on precision strength to increase power. 26 is ready to blow past her career-high No. Marta Kostyuk had quite the eventful offseason. She rested and recharged in the Maldives -- her "happy place" -- went on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje (a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina), returned to the Ukraine and ended up in Dubai before heading Down Under for the start of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season. The 23-year-old took advantage of her team's decision to take a longer break than usual after the season ended, in a year where she played a jam-packed schedule consisting of 22 tournaments (including Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers, and then the BJK Cup Finals five months later). "It was a team decision," the World No. 26 said before heading to Brisbane for her first tournament of the year. A post shared by Marta Kostyuk • Марта Костюк (@martakostyuk) Working with her fitness coach, Jolanta Rusin, for a third straight preseason, the pair homed in on Kostyuk's precision strength, which is more about explosive movements than being able to lift a ton of weight. Rusin created a series of intense, intentional workouts that incorporated speed, endurance and strength, specifically eccentric and isometric exercises. It was challenging work, Kostyuk says, though she and Rusin have been working towards this evolution of her fitness and power over the last three years. "I needed two years of work so my body can handle what we are doing right now," she says. "And it's not like everyone is going to see my strength or my power in the first week of the year. It's something that we have just started building up, and it's going to come in time." With time and reps, Rusin and the rest of the team have gotten to understand Kostyuk's body more intricately, and they've used that valuable information to not only build up the Ukrainian's power, but also help her prevent injuries. (Despite a wrist injury that sidelined her from the Cincinnati Open last summer, she played a full schedule in 2025.) A post shared by Marta Kostyuk • Марта Костюк (@martakostyuk) Ahead of her first tournament of the year in Brisbane, Kostyuk says she feels the effects of her offseason training, and is not merely excited about what it could mean for her performance on court -- she's also amazed. "It's amazing to see how things come together and you become this incredibly fast human being," she said. And every time I go through it as an athlete, it's just so mesmerizing to me." Beyond feeling physically fit and energized, Kostyuk also gets life from the Australian swing, a part of the year where she's enjoyed some breakthrough moments and tends to shine. She's had more than a few wonderful memories in Australia: her girls' singles title in Melbourne, when she was 14 -- the first Grand Slam she ever played -- is one of them. More recently, in 2024, she had her best result at a major when she reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. That's due, in large part, to a Ukrainian family that Kostyuk met at the tournament some years ago. She sees them every year at the season's first Slam, and considers them her Australian family. She'll make her season debut in Brisbane against Yulia Putintseva, after receiving a first-round bye. It will be their first career meeting. I feel happy to be traveling again for the tournaments, and I start from my favorite place, Australia. As she begins her ninth season on the WTA Tour, she's aiming to get back there, and then blow past it and into the Top 10. It's the first time she's had a specific, concrete benchmark like that in mind. I still don't think it's the right thing to do, to focus on the rankings, because the most important thing is to develop yourself and your game. "But it's something that I keep in my head. It's still good to have something like this in your head, because it's a direction that you want to go. The ultimate goal, of course, is to win a Grand Slam. Though even that takes a backseat to being a quality human being and role model. "[It's more important] than what kind of player you are. This is what we, as a whole team, work on every day, too. I think at times it is an even more difficult job than being a tennis player." Marta Kostyuk had an intentional offseason, taking an extended break to recharge and focusing on precision strength to increase power. 26 is ready to blow past her career-high No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite Czechia's Barbora Krejcikova's straight-set victory over Maya Joint, Australia's Alex de Minaur defeated Jakub Mensik, and carried that momentum into mixed doubles with Storm Hunter to win Group D. Czechia still advances as Sydney's top runner-up. Host nation Australia advanced to the United Cup quarterfinals after a comeback 2-1 victory over Czechia on Tuesday. After two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova defeated Maya Joint in straight sets to give Czechia the early lead, Australia faced an uphill climb to qualify on home soil. Alex de Minaur responded in front of a lively Ken Rosewall Arena crowd, defeating Jakub Mensik 6-4, 6-1 to level the tie. He then teamed with Storm Hunter to clinch the result, beating Miriam Skoch and Dalibor Svrcina 6-2, 6-3 in mixed doubles to secure the 2-1 win and top Group D. 63 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, jumped out to a 4-1 lead against Australian No. 1, who had missed her country's opening tie of the competition due to illness. "I'm very happy with my performance," Krejcikova said on court. It was a little up and down in the first set, but I'm happy to come through. I was trying to be aggressive from the start, and it's nice to have some matches under my belt. I felt a little better on the court today." In men's singles, de Minaur delivered a composed performance to defeat Mensik 6-4, 6-1 in 1 hour and 31 minutes and level the tie at 1-1. "I didn't start the year the way I wanted to," said de Minaur, who fell to Casper Ruud in his first group match. Mensik produced moments of flair early in the second set, highlighted by an audacious front-facing tweener set up by a booming first serve. But de Minaur remained relentless, saving all four break points he faced and improving his record to 5-0 against the Czech in their head-to-head series. Despite Czechia's Barbora Krejcikova's straight-set victory over Maya Joint, Australia's Alex de Minaur defeated Jakub Mensik, and carried that momentum into mixed doubles with Storm Hunter to win Group D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France's Arthur Rinderknech saved two match points to stun Flavio Cobolli and eliminate Italy from United Cup quarter-final contention Tuesday in Perth. Wednesday's quarter-finals will see defending champion United States play Greece in the morning and Argentina play Switzerland in the evening session. After saving two match points on serve at 5-6 in the second set, Rinderknech rallied from a break down in the third set to close out a courageous 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-5 win in three hours and 21 minutes. “I don't know if it was seriously good, but it was seriously tough, that's for sure,” the top-ranked Frenchman said. I was able to find a way somehow like Stan found a way against me three days ago. Rinderknech survived 14 Cobolli forehand winners in the second set, when he came from within a point of going down a set and 1-5. He trailed 2-4 in the third before digging deep to win five of the last six games, finishing with 13 aces and saving seven of 11 break points faced. “I couldn't do anything else but try to the last shot. He is now at a career-high mark of No. Although both Italy and France have been eliminated from quarter-final contention, play continues inside RAC Arena with Jasmine Paolini taking on Leolia Jeanjean, with mixed doubles to follow. It was an unenviable task for Jasmine Paolini, stepping on court just moments after Italy was eliminated from quarter-final contention at the United Cup following Cobolli's loss to Rinderknech. While the scoreline suggests a routine win, Paolini had to navigate more than a few challenges to secure her first victory of 2026. 8 also had to withstand a blistering start on serve by Jeanjean. Despite entering as the underdog, Jeanjean fired six aces in her first two service games to take a 2-1 lead. Paolini responded by reeling off five straight games to claim the opening set in 40 minutes. She did so behind the strength of her own serve, winning 80 per cent of her own first-serve points in the first set. She finished the match at an even more impressive 88 per cent. Even with Italy eliminated before she took the court, Paolini maintained her trademark positivity postmatch. “We fought until the last ball and there's still mixed doubles, so we're going to be there to cheer for them. Sometimes it's sport, but we have to keep going, [keep] fighting, because that's the right way to finish this competition.” With both teams already eliminated and only bragging rights remaining, Italy's Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori defeated France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 7-6(6), 7-6(6) to clinch the tie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Team Belgium earned a stunning 3-0 sweep of Team Canada Tuesday in Sydney at the United Cup to win Group B and claim a place in the quarter-finals. After Zizou Bergs and Elise Mertens earned impressive singles victories to clinch the tie, the Belgians partnered to defeat Cleeve Harper and Victoria Mboko 6-3, 3-6, 10-5 in a critical mixed doubles match to top the group. "We small Belgians, we are so proud of each other today what we did as a team, especially after a rough first encounter with China. The Belgians woke up this morning knew to win their group they needed to sweep Canada. That was a difficult task considering Canada swept China, which beat Belgium earlier in the event. That proved inconsequential inside Ken Rosewall Arena, where Bergs and Mertens found a way to keep their United Cup alive. "I trust this team 100 per cent and I think we can do it and we actually did it," Mertens said. "Nothing is impossible, so very happy about the doubles we played. Bergs earned the biggest win of his career to start the day, upsetting World No. I think this shows also our strength we have. “This is what we do, and I'm also very thankful to have that team around me.” Bergs claimed his second Top-10 victory (2-10) in one hour and 28 minutes, having also defeated then-World No. “I actually forgot this was my second Top-10 win, so that's really huge, actually, especially with a convincing way of playing,” Bergs said. “I just looked at it as a match. We still have to win a lot of matches today, so that was more the focus and today I just had to get the job done.” He looked sharp in his first match of the season against Zhang, but was unable to dominate the same way against Bergs, who saved all five break points he faced. After coming from a set behind to defeat China's Zhu Lin in her opening match of the week, there was no similar escape for the 19-year-old Mboko against Mertens. The Belgian rode a stellar serving performance to a one-set lead, holding at love in each of her first four service games and breaking Mboko decisively to love in the sixth game as well. Mertens earned the decisive break of serve in the fourth game from a 30/0 deficit, and won a staggering 93 per cent of points played behind her first serve overall. I'm very happy with the point for Belgium," Mertens said. I really wanted to get that point, and of course, I had the team behind me. I got a little bit of experience already, but of course you always feel a little bit nervous. Your data will be used in accordance with the ATP Privacy Policy and WTA Privacy Policy.
