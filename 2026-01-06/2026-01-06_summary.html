Organizers share where they find hope in the struggle for disability justice as we go into the second year of Trump 2.0.

Since Donald Trump marched back into the White House in January 2025, his administration has waged an all-out war on disabled people. Trump has issued executive orders rolling back civil rights protections, slashed funding for vital services and support, and advocated for legislation that would ramp up institutionalization.

The administration's actions reflect the cruel and dehumanizing language it uses to speak about disabled people, who comprise more than a quarter of the nation's population: One February 2025 executive order characterized children being diagnosed with autism or ADD/ADHD as “a dire threat to the American people and our way of life,” while, according to a memoir by Trump's nephew, the president thinks some disabled people “should just die.”

Trump's second-term assault on the disability community comes as many continue to shoulder the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately killed disabled and aging Americans, worsened the nation's care worker shortage, and left at least 20 million people ill or disabled with long COVID. Rather than commit to plugging gaps in the nation's public health system and preparing for future crises, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing an extremist anti-science agenda that public health experts have warned “endanger[s] every American's health.”

Truthout asked several disability justice advocates and organizers from across the U.S. to explain what's at stake for disabled people in Trump's attacks on voting rights, education, the climate and Indigenous land stewardship, health care, and trans rights. They also shared where they're finding hope and how you can join the struggle for disability rights and justice as it continues into the second year of Trump 2.0.

The responses below have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Sarah Blahovec, disability civic engagement expert and author of The Accessible Voting Booth:

Attacks on voting rights are undeniably escalating under this administration. To counter the attacks, voter education is going to become more important than ever, particularly when it comes to state election law. We also need to mobilize to support those working outside of an electoral system and a government that is failing us — disabled people's lives are on the line. We need to focus on supporting those who have never been properly supported (and have often been actively targeted by our government) who are facing extreme threats — including disabled immigrants, queer and trans people, incarcerated people, and people of color.

I'm motivated and inspired by community members who come together to take care of each other, from local mutual aid to efforts like ICE Out of Alexandria, where I live, which is organizing against our sheriff's voluntary collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I want to see these local movements grow, and I'm encouraged by how they have drawn on the lessons of disability justice. I'd like to see more cross-movement collaboration in 2026, where we can learn from and support each other, because we're going to need each other to survive this. I hope that we can someday shift from defending our rights and our existence to dreaming up new systems that create lasting change and liberation for all of us.

Alex Green, advocate and author of A Perfect Turmoil: Walter E. Fernald and the Struggle to Care for America's Disabled:

It has been a fight to emerge from more than a century of simply sending disabled kids into massive institutional state schools that resembled concentration camps and finally provide them with the education that they have a right to enjoy. Just at a moment where we absolutely could have fully emerged from that if we wanted to, we've chosen instead to roll back long-standing civil rights provisions and turn around and wholly embrace a backslide. Without support to prevent the abuse of disabled kids and without funding to ensure that they have a place in mainstream public school classrooms, they are going to be segregated. It's not hyperbole to say that disabled kids will be abused, and some disabled kids will die in a system built that way.

For folks who care about disabled kids and want to support their equal education in schools, look around your neighborhood and your local community, find disabled people who are leading efforts, and start advocating like hell.

It's not going to do everything, but this is a moment that calls for humanity and rejects the model that we've seen fail in recent years of bureaucratizing the lives of disabled people. That's what has brought us to the place where we're so vulnerable to the monstrous ideologies of Trump and Kennedy. Instead, this is a moment where we need folks to step forward and stand with disabled kids and their parents and say, “We're going to hold you tight, and we're going to make sure that this system does not cast you out.”

Johnnie Jae, disabled Indigenerd and founder of Red POP! News:

Trump's second term has intensified the same patterns that created a crisis that is not simply climate change, but the combined impact of colonialism, environmental racism, and ableism. The result is a cycle of harm that hits Indigenous and disabled people first, and in many cases, hits us hardest. When Indigenous governance is pushed aside, ecosystems lose the caretakers who kept them healthy for generations. When disabled people are excluded from planning, disaster becomes a test of luck instead of a shared commitment to survival. These patterns have always been with us, but they are now unfolding in a moment when the planet cannot absorb any more harm.

This moment calls for us to change how we think about preparation and prevention. We can't rely on the government, but we can invest in local and Tribal responses, accessible communication networks, and practices that restore the land instead of exploiting it. When we strengthen Indigenous stewardship and disability-centered care simultaneously, we create communities that are resilient in ways the federal government has never been. I hope the disability justice movement continues to root itself firmly in the understanding that we are part of the land and not separate from it. Disabled people, and especially disabled Indigenous people, have knowledge that is vital to the future we are trying to build.

Dom Kelly, co-founder, president, and CEO of New Disabled South:

We're seeing so much of the infrastructure for the enforcement of civil rights law being destroyed and Medicaid being defunded in such an enormous way that millions of people will lose health care. We have organizations doing advocacy, trying to stop bad policy or make bad policy less bad, but that can only go so far, given the makeup of Congress and the fact that this administration doesn't care whether what they're doing is right or wrong or who it will hurt. Systems are crumbling, and the same old strategies are not going to work. We have to be willing to do things radically differently.

Mutual aid and community care feel like the strategies we need to prepare and meet the ongoing struggle. The people who are going to be most harmed are queer and trans disabled folks, Black and Brown disabled folks, disabled migrants, and disabled undocumented folks. We need to understand the intersections of these systems and how they harm people, and we need to work across movements. We know that every issue is a disability issue, and disabled people are part of every community. My hope heading into the new year is that we can build more solidarity across movements as we show up, organize, and care for each other in our communities.

Arielle Rebekah, disabled trans activist and communications strategist:

We're seeing an escalation of similar policies that we've seen over the past hundred years, and I think the big thing that undergirds attacks on both trans people and disabled people is eugenics in a broad sense of not just scientific policies, but socio-economic, cultural influences removing both disabled and trans people from public life and putting us in harm's way. Countering these policies, I think, looks like continuing to educate our communities about trans and disabled lives. It looks like civil disobedience, in the sense of teachers, doctors, et cetera, being willing to push back vocally against policies that are negatively impacting trans students or removing care for trans people, even if that means a personal risk. Adults defending trans kids and taking on those personal risks is going to be critical.

I'm drawing hope from disabled and trans people continuing to fight, survive, and thrive despite everything that's happening. There are so many brilliant voices and brilliant people who are continuing to live our truths, refuse to be erased, and refuse to hide even when it puts us in harm's way, and I believe that's what it takes to create the future that we all deserve. I believe that because of that, we will create the future that we all deserve.

We can expect the government's attacks on vulnerable communities to continue this year, including a continued stripping away of what little support systems have historically existed to protect disabled and aging Americans. Meanwhile, grief over the loss of that support and the resulting increasing violence and number of premature deaths in marginalized communities threaten to become overwhelming. 

Faced with this overwhelm, disability justice advocates told Truthout that it is becoming more important than ever for individuals to organize in their communities, develop relationships with neighbors, and find ways to support one another. Wherever you decide to plug in this year, these advocates hope you will do so with this lesson in mind: The struggle for disability justice intersects with the fights for racial and climate justice, safety for our immigrant neighbors and trans siblings, and a dignified life for all people. By organizing across movements, we can build the liberatory future we all deserve.

An estimated 10 million people will be newly uninsured over the next decade due to the GOP megabill passed last year.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

In 2013, before the Affordable Care Act helped millions get health insurance, California's Placer County provided limited health care to some 3,400 uninsured residents who couldn't afford to see a doctor.

For several years, that number has been zero in the predominantly white, largely rural county stretching from Sacramento's eastern suburbs to the shores of Lake Tahoe.

The trend could be short-lived.

County health officials there and across the country are bracing for an estimated 10 million newly uninsured patients over the next decade in the wake of Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The act, which President Donald Trump signed into law this past summer, is also expected to reduce Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over that period.

“This is the moment where a lot of hard decisions have to be made about who gets care and who doesn't,” said Nadereh Pourat, director of the Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program at UCLA. “The number of people who are going to lose coverage is large, and a lot of the systems that were in place to provide care to those individuals have either gone away or diminished.”

It's an especially thorny challenge for states like California and New Mexico where counties are legally required to help their poorest residents through what are known as indigent care programs. Under Obamacare, both states were able to expand Medicaid to include more low-income residents, alleviating counties of patient loads and redirecting much of their funding for the patchwork of local programs that provided bare-bones services.

Placer County, which estimates that 16,000 residents could lose health care coverage by 2028, quit operating its own clinics nearly a decade ago.

“Most of the infrastructure that we had to meet those needs is gone,” said Rob Oldham, Placer County's director of health and human services. “This is a much bigger problem than it was a decade ago and much more costly.”

In December, county officials asked to join a statewide association that provides care to mostly small, rural counties, citing an expected rise in the number of uninsured residents.

New Mexico's second-most-populous county, Doña Ana, added dental care for seniors and behavioral health benefits after many of its poorest residents qualified for Medicaid. Now, federal cuts could force the county to reconsider, said Jamie Michael, Doña Ana's health and human services director.

“At some point we're going to have to look at either allocating more money or reducing the benefits,” Michael said.

Some states, such as Idaho and Colorado, abandoned laws that required counties to be providers of last resort for their residents. In other states, uninsured patients often delay care or receive it at hospital emergency rooms or community clinics. Those clinics are often supported by a mix of federal, state, and local funds, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Even in states like Texas, which opted not to expand its Medicaid program and continued to rely on counties to care for many of its uninsured, rising health care costs are straining local budgets.

“As we have more growth, more people coming in, it's harder and harder to fund things that are required by the state legislature, and this isn't one we can decrease,” said Windy Johnson, program manager with the Texas Indigent Health Care Association. “It is a fiscal issue.”

California lawmakers face a nearly $18 billion budget deficit in the 2026-27 fiscal year, according to the latest estimates by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has acknowledged he is mulling a White House run, has rebuffed several efforts to significantly raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy. Despite blasting the bill passed by Republicans in Congress as a “complete moral failure” that guts health care programs, in 2025 the Democrat rolled back state Medi-Cal benefits for seniors and for immigrants without legal status after rising costs forced the program to borrow $4.4 billion from the state's general fund.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Finance, said that the Newsom administration is still refining its fiscal projections and that it would be “premature” to discuss potential budget solutions.

Newsom will unveil his initial budget proposal in January. State officials have said California could lose $30 billion a year in federal funding for Medi-Cal under the new law, as much as 15% of the state program's entire budget.

“Local governments don't really have much capacity to raise revenue,” said Scott Graves, a director at the independent California Budget & Policy Center with a focus on state budgets. “State leaders, if they choose to prioritize it, need to decide where they're going to find the funding that would be needed to help those who are going to lose health care as a result of these federal funding and policy cuts.”

Reviving county-based programs in the near term would require “considerable fiscal restructuring” through the state budget, the Legislative Analyst's Office said in an October report.

It's not clear how many people are currently enrolled in California's county indigent programs, because the state doesn't track enrollment and utilization. But enrollment in county health safety net programs dropped dramatically in the first full year of ACA implementation, going from about 858,000 people statewide in 2013 to roughly 176,000 by the end of 2014, according to a survey at the time by Health Access California.

“We're going to need state investment,” said Michelle Gibbons, executive director of the County Health Executives Association of California. “After the Affordable Care Act and as folks got coverage, we didn't imagine a moment like this where potentially that progress would be unwound and folks would be falling back into indigent care.”

In November, voters in affluent Santa Clara County approved a sales tax increase, in part to backfill the loss of federal funds. But even in the home of Silicon Valley, where the median household income is about 1.7 times the statewide average, that is expected to cover only a third of the $1 billion a year the county stands to lose.

Health advocates fear that, absent major state investments, Californians could see a return to the previous patchwork of county-run programs, with local governments choosing whom and what they cover and for how long.

In many cases, indigent programs didn't include specialty care, behavioral health, or regular access to primary care. Counties can also exclude people based on immigration status or income. Before the ACA, many uninsured people who needed care didn't get it, which could lead to them winding up in ERs with untreated health conditions or even dying, said Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network.

Rachel Linn Gish, interim deputy director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group, said that “it created a very unequal, maldistributed program throughout the state.”

“Many of us,” she said. “including counties, are reeling trying to figure out: What are those downstream impacts?”

            A federal jail with a documented history of power outages, staffing shortages and detainee complaints just got two more high-profile detainees.
    


            Former president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were moved into the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on Saturday following their US military capture in Caracas just days ago. The husband and wife face criminal charges in the US.
    


            The couple isn't the only high-profile detainees to see the walls of the MDC. The building has housed several notable figures like hip-hop mogul, Sean “Diddy” Combs, singer R. Kelly, “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, socialite and Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, one-time cryptocurrency whiz kid Sam Bankman-Fried, drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, rappers Fetty Wap and Tekashi 6ix9ine – even former Honduras president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges before he was pardoned last year by President Donald Trump.
    


The many ways lawyers for Maduro could try to derail the case against him



            Suspected cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada Garcia and Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to the shooting death of a UnitedHealth Group executive, are current inmates at the facility.
    


            In their first court appearance in New York Monday, Maduro and Flores pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges and chose, for the time being, not to fight their detention.
    


            Here's a look at what life inside MDC Brooklyn looks like through the eyes of inmates, attorneys and judges:
    


            Constructed in the 1990s to address overcrowding in New York City prisons, MDC Brooklyn is a pre-trial detention facility for those charged in New York federal court. Detainees include a mix of suspects and defendants, including people accused of serious crimes, high-profile cases, and others awaiting sentencing or transfer.
    


            The Federal Bureau of Prisons operated two centers – one in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan – until 2021, when the doors to the Manhattan facility closed after it drew criticism for its management of multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's death there by suicide in 2019.
    


            Before his capture, Maduro lived mostly at Miraflores Palace, a sprawling presidential residence known for its neoclassical architecture, large windows, grand halls and manicured courtyards – a stark contrast to the living quarters inside the Metropolitan Detention Center.
    


            Described by attorneys and inmates alike as “disgusting” with “horrifying” conditions, the facility is the only federal correction center serving the nation's largest city.
    


            For its more than 1,300 inmates, daily life at the federal jail can be grueling.
    


            It's dark, overcrowded and loud, according to CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, who has been inside the building many times.
    


            While all prisons are miserable places to be, he said, “the MDC is maybe the most miserable” of all that he's visited.
    


            Inmates in the facility's Special Housing Unit, known as the SHU, where it's likely Maduro is being housed for safety and security, are kept in solitary confinement under restrictive conditions, Daniel McGuinnes, a criminal defense and civil rights litigation attorney who represents several clients housed at MDC, told CNN.
    


            Inmates are waking up “staring at cinder block painted white walls” while locked in a cell with steel beds and a thin mattress, often for 23 hours at a time with no pillow and hardly any room to move around, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former fixer, previously told CNN of the living quarters. Cohen was held at FCI Otisville, a federal prison 70 miles northwest of New York City.
    


Hell on Earth: Inside the jail where Maduro is being held



            The jail has also struggled with chronic understaffing, complaints about mold, fungus and poor food quality, McGuinnes said.
    


            Access to medical and dental care at the facility has always been “horrific,” according to McGuiness, who noted he often has to remind his clients to thoroughly document their requests for such care.
    


            “At some point I'll have to step in and request it on their behalf,” he said, “because it's just not getting done.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Bureau of Prisons for comment.
    


            A prolonged power outage spun the correctional facility into crisis, leaving inmates in near-total darkness during a polar vortex for a week in early 2019. The outage prompted a Justice Department investigation into whether the Bureau of Prisons had adequate contingency plans to address the issue.
    


            A lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates alleged they were confined to their cells for days with nonfunctioning toilets and other unsanitary conditions. The Bureau of Prisons ultimately settled the lawsuit, compensating almost 1,600 inmates with a total of approximately $10 million for enduring frigid and inhumane conditions because of the power outage.
    


            Michael Horowitz, Inspector General for the US Department of Justice at the time, said it was determined “that heating issues had been a longstanding problem at the jail that existed before, during, and after the fire and power outage and were unrelated to these events.”
    


            In early 2024, the Bureau of Prisons appointed an Urgent Action Team “to take a holistic look at the challenges at MDC Brooklyn,” spokesperson Emery Nelson told CNN.
    


            “The team's work is ongoing, but it has already increased permanent staffing at the institution (including COs and medical staff), addressed over 700 backlogged maintenance requests, and applied a continued focus on the issues raised in two recent judicial decisions,” Nelson said at the time.
    


            Despite the noted improvements that year, conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center seemed to worsen as the months ticked by.
    


A federal judge toured a troubled New York jail. What she found is disturbing



            In June 2024, Uriel Whyte, an inmate awaiting trial on gun charges, was stabbed to death by another inmate, according to a DOJ news release.
    


            A month later, inmate Edwin Cordero died in a fight that broke out inside the prison. Cordero's lawyer told The New York Times his client was “another victim of M.D.C. Brooklyn, an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.”
    


            Later in September, the DOJ announced five inmates were charged in those murders and a sixth was charged with attempted murder for allegedly stabbing another inmate 44 times with a makeshift weapon. Meanwhile, another inmate was sent to the hospital with an ice pick stuck in his back, according to the release.
    


            During a multi-agency operation, the following month – as part of a larger safety and security initiative – investigators seized “a number of electronic devices, drugs and associated paraphernalia, and homemade weapons,” the Bureau of Prisons said in a news release that year.
    


            The “charges demonstrate the Justice Department's commitment to rooting out violence and criminal behavior at federal detention facilities — a critical component of our work to improve conditions across the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the time.
    


            The situation on the grounds became so concerning; at least two federal judges refused to sentence defendants to MDC in 2024 because of the derelict environment, The New York Times reported.
    


            Bottom line: “It's a very difficult place to be an inmate,” Diddy's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said of the facility in 2024 and argued in court.

Conway, a conservative lawyer and ex-husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, is vying for a New York district seat

George Conway, the former Republican turned Donald Trump critic and ex-husband of the US president's 2016 campaign manager and senior aide Kellyanne Conway, is running for Congress.

Conway, a conservative lawyer who helped start the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of Republicans, launched his bid as a Democrat seeking to represent New York's 12th congressional district, in what will be a crowded field of contenders.

“We have a corrupt president, a mendacious president, a criminal president whose masked agents are disappearing people from our streets, who's breaking international law, and he's running our federal government like a mob protection racket,” Conway said in his video announcement on Tuesday.

“I know how to fight these people. They are corrupt, amoral people. They will stop at nothing to rig the system for themselves. I've been fighting Trump for years and nothing will stop me.”

Conway enters a competitive race for the Manhattan seat of the retiring Jerry Nadler. As of December, there were at least nine people in the running, including Jack Schlossberg, the social media personality whose grandfather is the former president John F Kennedy; the New York state assembly members Alex Bores and Micah Lasher; and the activist Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting.

Early in Trump's first term, Conway had been considered as a possible solicitor general; his wife at the time, Kellyanne, was a senior White house adviser. But he grew increasingly critical of Trump and his administration, eventually becoming one of the most vocal and prominent anti-Trump critics in the Republican party, even as Kellyanne remained a key adviser to the president.

Ahead of the 2020 election, Conway co-founded the Lincoln Project, a conservative anti-Trump group. But in August 2020, Conway announced that he was stepping away from his role there “to devote more time to family matters”.

Around the same time, the couple's teenage daughter, Claudia Conway, had been making headlines with outspoken online statements against her parents' political views. Kellyanne also announced that she would be leaving her role within the Trump administration.

In March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced their divorce. She remains an ally of Trump and spoke at the 2024 Republican national convention.

In his campaign announcement video on Tuesday, George said that as “a former Republican, now a Democrat, I fought Trump publicly in every way I could and I paid a price. I'll never regret standing up to Trump.

“I don't like what he's done to our great country,” he added. “And now I'm running for Congress to take the fight directly back to him on your behalf, on the behalf of New Yorkers to whom I owe so much – to protect the fundamental rights and basic economic needs of all New Yorkers, to make our nation better than it was before, to write new laws that will safeguard our democracy so that we don't end up facing autocracy ever again.

“This is no ordinary time, and I will not be an ordinary member of Congress.”

“We can no longer trust … our federal government for credible information about vaccines,” one critic said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Monday that it is reducing the number of vaccinations it is recommending for young children, immediately dropping the number of diseases and ailments covered by the vaccine regimen from 17 to 11.

States are technically the authority on what vaccines children should or are required to get when they are born and in the years beyond. But the CDC recommendation is very influential in what vaccines officials end up choosing. 

The CDC will continue to recommend a number of shots for children, including those that cover measles, polio, and whooping cough. But vaccines to prevent six diseases or illnesses — including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal disease, rotavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — will no longer be recommended by the CDC to be administered for children, or will only be recommended for high-risk groups and after consultation with health care providers. 

The new directive also alters the number of vaccine doses recommended to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus that can cause cancer later in life, going from two or three doses down to just one instead.

The CDC said the new guidance was meant to be more aligned with what other European nations, such as Denmark, have concluded for their own populations are necessary for childhood vaccines. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who has packed the vaccine advisory committee within the CDC with individuals who espouse similar viewpoints, heralded the changes.

“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement. 

But even health experts from Denmark said the move was foolhardy, as it wasn't based on evidence. The CDC's previous standards were made based on decades of epidemiological research on the U.S. population, whereas Denmark's officials are making recommendations tailored to their population's needs and culture.

“Personally, I do not think this makes sense scientifically,” said Anders Hviid, an official in Denmark's Statens Serum Institute, speaking to The Washington Post about the CDC's changes. “Public health is not one size fits all. It's population-specific and dynamic. Denmark and the U.S. are two very different countries.”

The alterations could have dire consequences.

“The abrupt change to the entire U.S. childhood vaccine schedule is alarming, unnecessary, and will endanger the health of children in the United States,” said Helen Chu, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle and a former CDC vaccine recommendations panel member.

The introduction of new RSV vaccines for infants, for example, saw rates for the virus drop by half last year, one study found, a significant improvement for an ailment that is the leading cause of hospitalization for children under the age of 3. Studies examining the effect of the rotavirus vaccine have also shown that, when those vaccines debuted from 2006 to 2012 , hospitalization rates for children in the U.S. for that ailment dropped by 94 percent. 

It's also likely that the decision to change the vaccine schedule was based, at least in part, on false premises. The Trump administration has disputed the need for infants to obtain hepatitis B vaccines, for instance, claiming that the virus is mostly transmitted through sexual contact, and thus the vaccine could be delayed. However, hepatitis B is also spread through blood and saliva, and transmission can occur at daycare centers or other places where infants or children interact. Researchers estimate that even a small delay in administering the vaccine will likely result in higher rates of infection in infants.  

Medical experts and organizations blasted the federal government's decision to change the recommended vaccine schedule for children.

“Upending the childhood vaccine schedule leaves American children at much greater risk of contracting hepatitis, rotavirus, and other preventable infections,” said former CDC director Tom Frieden. “This is a giant step backward that jeopardizes children's health and safety.”

“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a statement decrying the changes, writing that:

For decades, leading health experts, immunologists, and pediatricians have carefully reviewed new data and evidence as part of the immunization recommendation process, helping to keep newborns, infants, and children protected from diseases they could be exposed to in the United States as they develop and grow. Today's decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries' practices, upends this deliberate scientific process.

Issuing his own comments on the matter, Sean O'Leary, chair of the infectious disease committee at the AAP, stated that it is “becoming increasingly clear that we can no longer trust the leadership of our federal government for credible information about vaccines, and that's a tragedy that will cause needless suffering.”

The American Medical Association (AMA) also condemned the CDC's changes, stating that the organization is “deeply concerned by recent changes to the childhood immunization schedule that affects the health and safety of millions of children.”

“The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies,” the group added.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Opposition leader says her movement is ready to win a fair election and praises Trump for toppling the president

From elation to frustration: Trump snub wrongfoots Venezuela's opposition

The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed to return to the country as soon as possible and rejected the authority of the interim president backed – for now – by the US after it forcibly removed Nicolás Maduro from power.

Machado told Fox News from an undisclosed location that her movement was ready to win a free election, and praised Donald Trump for toppling Maduro.

Many in Venezuela and abroad had expected Machado to take charge of the country after Maduro's detention on Saturday, but Trump sidelined her and gave his backing to Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez.

“I'm planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Machado said in the interview. “We believe that this transition should move forward. We won an election [in 2024] by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.”

She accused Rodríguez of being “one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking” in Venezuela and said repression had increased since the weekend.

The industrial engineer, 58, also said she had not spoken Trump since 10 October, the day it was announced that she had won the Nobel peace prize.

“But I do want to say today, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the actions – historical actions – he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime, to start dismantling this structure and bringing Maduro to justice,” she said.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had decided to back Rodríguez after CIA analysts briefed him that Machado and her electoral candidate, the retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia, “would struggle to gain legitimacy as leaders while facing resistance from pro-regime security services, drug-trafficking networks and political opponents”.

The Washington Post, however, reported the decision may have been more personal, that Trump may have been irritated that Machado accepted the prize. “If she had turned it down and said: ‘I can't accept it because it's Donald Trump's,' she'd be the president of Venezuela today,” a source told the paper.

Asked by Fox News whether she had offered to give Trump the prize, Machado said: “It hasn't happened yet, but I would certainly love to be able to personally tell him that we believe the Venezuelan people – because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people – certainly want to give it to him and share it with him.”

Trump has said he wants to work with Rodríguez and the rest of Maduro's former team provided that they submit to US demands on oil. He has poured cold water on the idea that a vote could be held within the next 30 days.

On Monday the Venezuelan government made public a decree dated Saturday and signed by Maduro – who was arrested at 2.01am – declaring a “state of external commotion”, effectively a state of emergency, and ordering the “immediate search and capture of anyone involved in the promotion or support of the US armed attack”.

Beyond the pursuit of those accused of supporting the US attack – a task made more complex by the widespread belief that senior government figures, including the acting president, may have provided crucial information leading to Maduro's capture – the decree orders the mobilisation of the armed forces, mandates the militarisation of all public service infrastructure, the oil sector and basic state industries, and suspends the right to public assembly and protest.

At least 14 journalists and media workers, including 13 linked to international outlets, were detained in Caracas on Monday. Thirteen were later released, one of whom was deported.

Gunshots and explosions were reported near the Miraflores presidential palace overnight. The government said it had fired at unauthorised drones flying over the area.

Pushback from Susan Collins and Thom Tillis is striking amid tepid response from most other Republican senators

Two senior Republican senators on Monday openly opposed Pentagon secretary Pete Hegseth's attempt to punish their fellow Senator Mark Kelly by demoting him and cutting his pension after he released a video telling active-duty military to follow the law.

Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate appropriations committee with jurisdiction over the Pentagon's budget, said she believed it was wrong to target Kelly's military benefits because of a political video.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina also described the Pentagon's censure as “ridiculous”, said “Hegseth overreached” and cautioned that pursuing such action “has a chilling effect on speech”.

The pushback from the relatively moderate Collins and from Tillis – who announced last June he would be retiring from the Senate – was striking given the tepid response from most other Republican senators.

Hegseth said on Monday that his department had begun administrative action against Kelly, who served as a navy captain before entering the Senate. Last year Kelly and other Democrats released a video encouraging military personnel to refuse illegal orders. Writing on social media, Hegseth described it as a “reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline”.

The defense secretary announced a “retirement grade determination proceeding” alongside a formal censure letter, suggesting Kelly could see his rank reduced and pension slashed as punishment.

Kelly flew dozens of combat missions and travelled to space four times during his military and Nasa career.

Speaking to reporters, Collins said: “I don't think that's appropriate.” Tillis, meanwhile, called the original video from the Democrats “rage bait”, but added: “My gosh, he is a US senator who operates in a political world. I think it has a chilling effect on speech, and I've got a real problem with it. And I think Hegseth overreached.”

Other Republicans offered measured or non-committal responses. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the armed services committee, told reporters there would be “an adjudication process” that he said should be allowed to proceed without comment. Asked whether such proceedings made sense given Kelly's Senate role and committee assignment, Rounds replied: “I think we'll let the process play out.”

Some senators sidestepped the question altogether. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, another armed services member, said she lacked sufficient information to respond. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia characterized it as an issue “between the Department of War and Sen Kelly”.

Kelly issued a combative statement on Monday, saying the censure was “outrageous” and “un-American”. He wrote: “If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it.”

He added: “Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives for the meeting of the 'Coalition of the Willing' at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Tuesday.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney has downplayed concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to boost oil production from Venezuela will have an impact on Canada's energy sector.

Mr. Trump has made it clear that the U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro were precursors to taking control of the country's vast oil reserves and energy infrastructure. That could ultimately lead to a surge of Venezuelan oil on global markets, which would pose a challenge to Canadian producers. 

On Tuesday Mr. Carney reiterated that Canada welcomed the removal of Mr. Maduro from office. “It creates the possibility for democratic transition in Venezuela. We very much support that,” he told reporters in Paris, where he was attending a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” to support Ukraine. 

Increased oil production would benefit the Venezuelan people and provide stability to the country, he added, but that won't be a threat to Canadian oil producers. 

“Canadian oil will be competitive because it is low-risk,” he said. He added that production costs in the oil sands have also started to fall along with carbon emissions through carbon capture programs.

The recent memorandum of understanding between Ottawa and Alberta on a new pipeline to the West Coast will also help open new markets for Canadian energy. “And that makes Canadian oil competitive in the medium and long term,” Mr. Carney said. 

Venezuela has the world's largest reserves of oil, and its heavy crude is similar to the oil produced in Canada's oil sands. In the 1990s, U.S. refineries imported almost two million barrels per day from Venezuela. That has fallen to about 135,000 barrels since the rise of socialist leader Hugo Chávez in 1999, followed by Mr. Maduro in 2013. Venezuela's overall production, which is sold largely to China, has dropped to 934,000 barrels per day from more than three million in the 1990s. 

Given the state of its oil industry, it could take years to modernize and would cost tens of billions of dollars. And it's unclear how committed U.S. oil companies would be to launching projects in the country as long as it remains unstable. But even a modest increase in production could have an impact on Canada, which produces about five million barrels a day and sells most of it to the U.S. 

Canada needs new pipeline urgently to counter Venezuelan oil surge, Strathcona chair says

Mr. Carney also took aim at Mr. Trump's reiteration of his desire to annex Greenland for “national security” reasons. One of the U.S. President's top aides, Stephen Miller, has also raised the possibility of using military force to take over the ice-covered island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. 

The comments from Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have taken on new significance in light of the U.S. raid in Venezuela. 

Mr. Carney said Canada stands with Greenland and Denmark. “The future of Greenland is a decision for Greenland and for Denmark exclusively – it's their decision,” he said. 

He added that whatever security concerns Mr. Trump has about the increasing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic can be addressed through NATO. “We are partners in NATO. It's a mutual defence alliance. We can provide that security.”

Mr. Carney spoke to reporters before joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from more than 30 countries for a meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The U.S. will be represented by Mr. Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in Paris that Canada and other Ukrainian allies are close to finalizing security guarantees for the war-torn country as part of broader ceasefire talks. Mr. Carney is gathering with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders from the Coalition of the Willing in Paris.

The aim of the gathering is to finalize security and economic guarantees as part of a 20-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine.

Mr. Zelensky has expressed confidence that 90 per cent of the agreement is in place, but the remaining issues involve complicated negotiations over territory and security guarantees. And getting Russia to agree remains problematic. 

Mr. Carney said Tuesday's meeting may not result in a final agreement, but he insisted that momentum was building. “I think the way I look at this, in terms of the intention and the goodwill and the seriousness with which the countries, Canada included, are approaching this is: If we don't finalize today, it's because we identified issues where they could be improved or adjusted. This is not a make or break.”

Canada has offered to play a role in providing security guarantees. That could involve troops stationed Ukraine, Mr. Carney said, but would more likely involve support services.

The first line of defence, he added, will be the Ukrainian army, which will remain at 800,000 troops, according to the peace proposal. Secondly, there will be monitoring, training and other logistical support. “Then the backstops become the Coalition of the Willing forces, so-called multilateral force, of which Canada will be a member under this framework and, very importantly, the United States,” he said.

Canada will be able to meet its commitment through increased military spending, redeployment of existing forces and joint ventures with the Ukrainian defence industry, Mr. Carney said.

Prior to the meeting, he held bilateral talks with Mr. Macron and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. During the meeting with Ms. Frederiksen at the Canadian embassy, she thanked Mr. Carney for his supportive comments about Greenland and European security. “I think we are both very into securing the Arctic region and together with other NATO allies we can secure the region,” she said.

A group of European leaders representing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain also expressed their support for Greenland and Denmark Tuesday. 

“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” said a joint statement released just before the Coalition of the Willing meeting. 

Security in the Arctic must “be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

            China has banned exports of some rare earth elements and other items to Japan that could be used for military purposes, straining already tense relations between the two countries following the Japanese prime minister's recent remarks on Taiwan.
    


            The sweeping restrictions on so-called dual-use items – goods, services and technologies that have both civilian and military applications – are effective immediately, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            While the ministry did not specify what the impacted exports are, a catalogue of dual-use items published by the ministry includes rare earths, advanced electronics, aerospace and aviation components, drones and nuclear-related technology, among other items.
    


            Rare earth elements are critical to a wide range of goods, from everyday electronics and vehicles to advanced weapons systems such as F-35 fighter jets. It is not yet clear how far-reaching the impact of the latest restrictions will be for Japan.
    


            Relations between the two Asian powers have deteriorated rapidly since Japan's leader, Sanae Takaichi, said in parliament in November that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would constitute “a situation threatening Japan's survival,” potentially triggering a military response from Tokyo.
    


            China's ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex the island, by force if necessary.
    


            Since Takaichi's remarks, Beijing has unleashed a series of economic measures aimed at pressuring Japan to retract the comments, including cutting flights to the country, warning its citizens against traveling to or studying in Japan and suspending seafood imports from Japan.
    


            A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said the new restrictions had been imposed in response to Takaichi's “erroneous” comments and for “safeguarding national security and interests.”
    


            “These comments constitute a crude interference in China's internal affairs, seriously violate the one-China principle and are extremely harmful in nature and impact,” the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            In its statement, the ministry added that any organization or individual from any country that violated the export restrictions would be held legally accountable.
    


            CNN has reached out to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for comment.
    


What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump's trade deal with China?



            Using its global dominance in the rare earths supply chain, China has imposed controls on these exports as a powerful weapon in the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump last year. The move wreaked havoc in industries around the world, including the automotive sector – a critical pillar of Japan's economy.
    


            This is not the first time Beijing has weaponized rare earth exports against Japan. In 2010, China also restricted such shipments to the country following a diplomatic spat triggered by Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain near the disputed Senkaku Islands, known in China as the Diaoyus.

Chrystia Freeland has announced she will resign from her posts in Canada to become an economic advisor to Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky. 

Freeland, a descendant of a Nazi collaborator and a leading figure in Canadian politics, was appointed by Zelensky on Monday. He praised Freeland as “an expert” in economy and finance. 

Confirming the appointment on X, Freeland stated that her contributions to Kiev would be “voluntary” and “unpaid.” 

“I will be stepping aside from my role as the Prime Minister's Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine. In the coming weeks I will also leave my seat in Parliament,” she wrote on Monday. 

One of the most prominent figures in Canadian politics for over a decade, Freeland has held ministerial positions in international trade, foreign affairs, and finance. In September, she resigned as Canada's minister of transport to become Ottawa's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine. 

Freeland, however, has a controversial family history. Archival evidence and research show her maternal grandfather was editor-in-chief of a Ukrainian-language newspaper in occupied Poland and Austria that published Nazi propaganda during World War II. Freeland has long rejected knowledge of these facts, claiming they were Russian disinformation. 

In 2023, Freeland was among the Canadian parliamentarians who gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a former member of the Waffen-SS Galicia Division, during Zelensky's visit to Ottawa. The incident sparked widespread outrage in Canada and abroad, forcing the government to issue an official apology. 

Following Freeland's appointment by Zelensky, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova branded Ukraine “a haven for neo-Nazis.”

Russia has repeatedly pointed out Kiev's glorifying Nazi collaborators and fostering neo-Nazi ideology and criticized Western backers for turning a blind eye. Moscow has cited “denazification” as one of the goals of its military operation in Ukraine.

            The case against ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro hasn't been able to move forward in the past six years.
    


            Now with his capture and first appearance in Manhattan federal court behind him, getting to trial could take even more years, with rings of unusual political and legal battles to come.
    


            The criminal case against Maduro is so legally complex — with his past leadership of Venezuela, the dramatic nature of proving an international narco-terrorism conspiracy and the larger national security and foreign policy implications — that his defense could attempt several different ways of derailing the case before a trial.
    


What happened at the Maduro and Flores arraignment and what's next in the case



            Maduro pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.
    


            “Not that he won't negotiate, but he will push some of the buttons first,” Dick Gregorie, a longtime Miami-based federal prosecutor, said on Monday after following news coverage of Maduro's arraignment.
    


            Gregorie had worked on the indictment and trial of Panama's Manuel Noriega almost 40 years ago, becoming one of the few prosecutors who has successfully tried a foreign fugitive who claimed he was a head of state.
    


            The Noriega case has some parallels to Maduro's — especially in how rare it is for the US to strike a foreign country and abduct a political leader by force.
    


            It appears likely that the lawyers representing Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, who also pleaded not guilty Monday to drug and weapons charges, will argue they were captured unlawfully. On Monday in court, the deposed Venezuelan leader said he was “kidnapped” by the US military.
    


            His lawyers will also likely battle with the Justice Department over the evidence in the case, what they can access that may help them, and over the protected national security information that may be able to be used in a trial.
    


            The classified information-handling process overseen by the court can add months to even a straightforward case, and defendants sometimes try to push for the exposure of sensitive information so that the federal government becomes unwilling to try the case, a tactic called “graymailing.”
    


            The evidence collected so far and plans for moving the case toward trial are likely to be discussed at Maduro's next court appearance in Manhattan, set for March.
    


            Maduro is likely to attempt to use his position in Venezuela's government to argue he has immunity as a foreign leader.
    


            In court, Madura told the judge he was “still president” of Venezuela. His wife similarly called herself “the First Lady of Venezuela” in her court appearance Monday.
    


            Gregorie recalled how significant a fight the head-of-state immunity claims were with Noriega. They also arose before the bribery trial of a political leader who claimed he was head of state of Turks and Caicos, which Gregorie also prosecuted in Miami some 40 years ago.
    


            “It's quite clear, in order to get head-of-state immunity, you have to be the diplomatically recognized head of state,” Gregorie said. Other legal scholars have taken the same position, that the US State Department's diplomatic recognitions are essentially the final word.

            The US has maintained since 2024 that Maduro was an illegitimate leader of Venezuela, and instead recognized Maduro's opposition as president-elect. Still, the answer of who led the country would have to be interpreted by the US court system, potentially up to the Supreme Court.
    


            Noriega lost his head-of-state and diplomatic immunity claims in 1990. He was convicted in 1991 for importing cocaine and given a 40-year sentence.
    


            And Norman Saunders, the chief minister of the Turks and Caicos island nation in the 1980s, wasn't deemed to be the country's head of state either, Gregorie recalled. The head of state in Turks and Caicos, a British territory, at the time of Saunders' case was the Queen.
    


            One question that will linger is how intent the Justice Department is to take Maduro to trial.
    


            Removing him from his country makes that easier in one core way: It can shake out new witnesses.
    


            Gina Parlovecchio, a white-collar partner at the large law firm Mayer Brown and former lead prosecutor of the trial against Mexican kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, said there are likely several cooperators who've helped the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York build the Maduro case.
    


            The office previously prosecuted others with ties to Maduro, including his wife Cilia Flores' nephews. The federal government also closely tracks the five designated foreign terrorist organizations that are mentioned in the Maduro indictment as taking part in the scheme to move drugs from Venezuela to the US.
    


            Still, having cooperating witnesses appear at a trial can be a challenge.
    


            Gregorie described how one witness died in a suspicious car crash days before he was set to testify against a Noriega co-defendant. Gregorie also noted the killing of DEA informant Barry Seal, by the hired gun of a drug cartel in Louisiana in the 1980s.
    


            “He was murdered before the trial started. There were incidents like that that made you worried,” Gregorie said. “A witness who had documents I was looking for, and those documents disappeared.”
    


            Others in Noriega's case entered witness protection, giving up their identities for new identities, in towns decided by the federal government, Gregorie said.
    


            “Certainly this business is a violent business,” the retired Miami prosecutor added.
    


            Michael Nadler, another former federal prosecutor on a case against high-ranking Venezuelans, said that drug trafficking conspiracy cases can be more difficult to prove, because of the reliance on witnesses within the drug trade, rather than following the money in foreign bribery cases.
    


            Nadler worked on the Miami money laundering indictment of another top Venezuelan official, Alex Saab, who was released from US custody in a 2023 prisoner swap and returned to Venezuela to work in Maduro's government.
    


            “You're going to have to get somebody in the room with him who says he knew about it, he allowed it to happen, or that he did something more,” Nadler said about proving a drug trafficking case.
    


            The indictment against Maduro, however, isn't as specific on transactions as some drug trafficking and money laundering indictments have been. Yet prosecutors included several episodes, or vignettes, in the now-public allegations against Maduro that appear to suggest they have information from witnesses who had close access to him.
    


            In one vignette, for instance, prosecutors say Maduro told other alleged traffickers they shouldn't have sent more than a ton of cocaine on a 2013 commercial flight that landed in Paris, and which French law enforcement seized.
    


            The specific moments prosecutors describe in the Maduro indictment link to each of the five narco-terrorist organizations: the FARC and ELN, which produce cocaine in Colombia; the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, which traffic cocaine from central American through Mexico to the US; and Tren de Aragua, which helps to transport cocaine out of Venezuela.
    


            “I almost read it like a greatest hits,” Parlovecchio said.

            Several former prosecutors say the Justice Department would only be willing to indict and capture Maduro if it believed the case was robust enough.
    


            Some prosecutors also believe the ousted leader may want to face a jury. 
    


            “I think that they are likely anticipating a trial,” Parlovecchio said, citing how Flores' two nephews, called the Narcosobrinos, were convicted by a jury of cocaine trafficking in 2016. “These high-level drug trafficking cases do tend to go to trial …. When you have this type of a case, with a defendant who has nothing to lose.”
    


            Maduro's charges are serious, potentially carrying with them a life sentence for conspiracy plus decades in prison for weapons violations, Parlovecchio said.
    


            She pointed to her case for the Eastern District of New York US Attorney's Office years ago, where El Chapo also went to trial and was convicted. He is now in the Bureau of Prison's only Supermax facility, in Colorado, serving a life sentence for the drug trafficking criminal enterprise conviction, plus 30 years for possessing a machine gun.
    


            Yet would the US government be open to some sort of negotiation or deal with the captured ruler?
    


            The vast majority of federal criminal cases end in defendants pleading guilty, either as part of a deal or to avoid a trial, according to federal court data.
    


            A legal and geopolitical deal could arise at any time involving Venezuela — especially if the foreign policy situation changes or the case still lingers after the Trump presidency ends.
    


            However, Gregorie, who tried the Noriega case, said that a drug trafficking prosecution of a foreign leader was always likely to be on the trial track, partly because of the effort it took to charge the case and apprehend them.
    


            “We were constantly pushing to get the case to trial, and if I indicted him, I intended to try him,” Gregorie said on Tuesday about the Noriega case.
    


            Maduro's defense attorney Barry Pollack, a national security and white-collar defense specialist out of Washington, DC, declined to comment for this story.
    


            Pollack is well-versed in high-profile defendants with a political angle to their cases, having previously resolved the criminal case against Julian Assange.

A Caracas highway is choked with cars.

But far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela's capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.

The gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US's brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.

Days after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.

“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don't know what's going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.

A state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.

One Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.

The paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.

The presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.

Videos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country's natural resources.

Another video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro's closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”

Mr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.

As Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.

“There's enough people here, there's enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.

On Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.

Police and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro's vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.

“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.

“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”

Her comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump's warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.

In Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro's capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez's ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro's regime.

The country's constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro's absence a “temporary” one.

In such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.

María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country's transition to democracy needed to happen.

“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She's a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”

There has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.

“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.

“But now we're at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they're all still here.”

Speaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.

“Most international leaders don't agree with what happened, but it happened.

“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”

While she pushed back at Mr Trump's suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”

“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.

Others were less accepting of the current situation.

“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.

“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we've been through so much already... I know that we weren't well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”

Recommended

The thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.

“I don't agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.

“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”

BELGRADE, January 6. /TASS/. The European Union is demanding that Serbia betray Russia as a condition for continuing its European integration, while offering Belgrade no tangible benefits in return, former Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin said in an interview with TASS.

"The European Union is using every means of pressure to force Serbia not simply to make a choice — because this is not a real choice — but to betray Russia," he stressed.

"This is not about choosing between two sides. Russia is making no proposals to us, and the European Union is making no proposals to us either. The European Union is demanding that we betray Russia, while Russia is demanding nothing from us. The European Union is making demands of us — and this shows what the European Union truly is: a deeply hypocritical, profoundly anti-Serbian organization," Vulin said.

The Serbian politician placed particular emphasis on the EU's demand that Serbia impose sanctions on Russia. According to him, such measures would cause no damage to Moscow, unlike the harm they would inflict on Belgrade. "Would these sanctions harm Russia? Not at all. Russia would neither feel nor even notice that we imposed sanctions. But would this lead to the destruction of the Serbian economy, to a split within Serbian society, to the emergence of serious political conflicts of historical significance, to a complete transformation of the state of the nation? Yes, it would," he said.

He expressed confidence that the true target of the EU's policy is not Russia, but Serbia. "You are not waging war against Russia through Serbia — you are waging war against Serbia. You want to destroy Serbia, and the current situation is merely a convenient pretext for that," the former deputy prime minister stressed.

According to him, the price that Brussels is demanding in exchange for continuing European integration is unacceptable for Serbia. "The price of conflict <…> is too high — regardless of whatever promises may be made to us," Vulin concluded.

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 6. /TASS/. President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is going to have a telephone conversation with US leader Donald Trump in the near future, O Globo newspaper reported, citing high-ranking diplomatic sources.

Lula da Silva will point to the need of keeping public and political stability in Venezuela during the conversation, the newspaper said. The Brazilian leader is also concerned of the situation on the border.

"The order is currently maintained inside Venezuela but the situation is still on the brink and may go out of control," a source told the news outlet.

Fox News' Howard Kurtz joins ‘Fox News Live' to react to President Donald Trump's $1 billion threat to sue the BBC and to weigh in on the political fallout from the government shutdown.

EXCLUSIVE: The White House published a new website Tuesday detailing the timeline of the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, taking aim at Democrat lawmakers for allegedly promoting a "gaslighting narrative" surrounding the protest to silence their political opponents. 

"The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as ‘insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump—despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government," the new website states. 

"In truth, it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection," the website continued, pointing to the certification of the 2020 election that the White House described as "fraud-ridden" and for allegedly "weaponizing federal agencies to hunt down dissenters." 

"All while (then-Speaker of the House Nancy) Pelosi's own security lapses invited the chaos they later exploited to seize and consolidate power," the website continues. "This gaslighting narrative allowed them to persecute innocent Americans, silence opposition, and distract from their own role in undermining democracy."  

BBC SAYS IT WILL FIGHT TRUMP'S $10 BILLION LAWSUIT OVER EDITED JAN 6 COMMENTS

Tuesday marks the fifth anniversary of the protest that has haunted U.S. politics throughout the Biden administration and through the 2024 campaign cycle, as Democrats slammed Trump for allegedly promoting a riot. The new website works to shed accurate light on the events of the protest following years of Democrats describing it as a dark moment in U.S. history. 

The new site boasts the historic date with black and white images of Democrats and others who investigated the breach, a timeline of Trump supporters gathering in Washington, D.C., ahead of and after the breach, and how the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report reviewing the breach uncovered "critical security failures on January 6, 2021, that were largely due to politicized decisions by Democratic leadership and the Pentagon."

The Jan. 6th Select Committee was charged with the initial investigation into the breach and ultimately referred Trump for prosecution in 2022. The committee became a lightning rod of criticism for Trump and Republicans, who accused the congressional body of "deleting and destroying" evidence related to the investigation, which was detailed in the House Administration Subcommittee's Interim Report published in December 2024. 

TRUMP SAYS LAWSUIT AGAINST BBC WILL BE FILED IMMINENTLY

The website's timeline of Jan. 6, 2021, kicks off with Trump's "call to action" for Americans to travel to Washington, D.C., "for a peaceful and historic demonstration."

The timeline walks users through the events of the day, including excerpts focused on: "President Trump Delivers Powerful Speech," "Patriots March to the Capitol," "Capitol Police Response Escalates Tensions," "President Trump Urges Calm," and "Leaked Pelosi Video Exposes Security Lapses."

Supporters of Trump gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress was set to certify the Electoral College vote that determined President Joe Biden was elected to the nation's highest office. 

Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi was a key figure in the protest's subsequent investigations, as she served as speaker of the House at the time. Footage from inside the Capitol during the protest showed that she admitted to taking "responsibility" for the breach.

"Leaked footage captured by Nancy Pelosi's daughter shows the Speaker during the chaos admitting, 'I take responsibility,' for security failures," the White House website states. "The video exposes Pelosi's catastrophic failure to prepare, including rejecting President Trump's reported advance offers of 10,000 troops to maintain security. Pelosi's daughter's own footage shows she knew security was so limited under her watch, exposing the deliberate refusal to accept offered reinforcements that could have prevented or delayed required reinforcements."

Pelosi's office has slammed the promotion of the video as cherry-picked statements that don't contradict that Pelosi was not responsible for handling security at the Capitol, as tactical decisions ahead of the protest fell under the Capitol Police's and the Capitol Police Board's purview. 

When asked about the new site and remarks focused on Pelosi, the House Speaker emerita's spokesman, Ian Krager, slammed the use of "cherry-picked, out-of-context clips" to allegedly downplay "the deadly insurrection," which included the fatal shooting of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt while in the Capitol.

"Numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed again and again that Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination on January 6th," Krager said. "Cherry-picked, out-of-context clips do not change the fact that the Speaker of the House is not in charge of the security of the Capitol Complex — on January 6th or any other day of the week. The ongoing attempts to whitewash the deadly insurrection are shameful, unpatriotic, and pathetic."

Pelosi published a statement Tuesday on the anniversary of the breach, calling it an "attempted coup" via "a violent insurrection incited by the President of the United States." 

"We must speak plainly: January 6th was an attempted coup. It was an effort to nullify millions of lawful votes and subvert the will of the American people," Pelosi wrote in the statement published Tuesday. "But the attack failed because of the courage of public servants who gave proof through the night that our flag was still there by refusing to bend to pressure, threats, or intimidation. On that day, the Constitution held and we kept the Republic."

LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS TRUMP COULD WIN 'CONSIDERABLE' DAMAGES FROM BBC DOCUMENTARY LAWSUIT

Jan. 6, 2021, thrust Trump into a legal and political storm that followed him out of office, fueling his second impeachment and years of courtroom battles. Democrats cited his words and actions surrounding the Capitol riot as grounds for "incitement of insurrection," while prosecutors later built separate cases probing election interference and efforts to overturn the 2020 results. 

Democrats stated that Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in U.S. history, repeatedly pointing to it throughout the Biden administration and 2024 campaign cycle as the Biden–Harris ticket, followed by the Harris–Walz ticket, worked to preserve the party's control of the executive branch.

Biden called Jan. 6 a "dark moment" and "an assault on the citadel of liberty" back in 2021, while former Vice President Kamala Harris said during the 2024 presidential debate that it was "the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War."

Trump has hit back at Democratic rhetoric, defending that he told supporters to march "peacefully and patriotically" outside the Capitol, while also describing the day as "a day of love" and casting many defendants as unfairly targeted. The president granted clemency to all individuals convicted or awaiting trial over the breach, roughly 1,600 people, upon his return to the Oval Office in January 2025. 

TRUMP ISSUES FRESH PARDONS FOR JAN 6 DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING WOMAN ACCUSED OF THREATENING FBI ON SOCIAL MEDIA

The new White House website page argues in one section that "President Trump Corrected a Historic Wrong—freeing Americans Who Were Unjustly Punished and Restoring Fairness Under the Law."

"With his triumphant return to the White House, President Trump wasted no time righting one of the darkest wrongs in modern American history," the site states. "On Inauguration Day 2025, he issued sweeping pardons and commutations for the vast majority of January 6 defendants—patriotic citizens who had been viciously overcharged, denied due process, and held as political hostages by a vengeful regime." 

The major legal cases targeting Trump that were tied to claims he worked to overturn the 2020 election were later dropped after Trump returned to office, while a Georgia election-interference prosecution against Trump and others was also dismissed.

• On the ground: Venezuela remains on edge following the capture of ousted leader Nicolás Maduro. Security forces were seen patrolling the streets, and gunfire and anti-aircraft fire were reported over the capital of Caracas overnight. A Venezuelan ministry spokesperson said “no confrontation occurred.” Sigue nuestra cobertura en español. 



            • Renewed focus on Greenland: Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Greenland and Denmark in a joint statement issued earlier today after President Donald Trump said the US “needs” the island.
    


            • What's next for Venezuela?: Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed to return home “as soon as possible,” but White House aide Stephen Miller dismissed calls for the US to install her as Maduro's replacement. Trump said he considers himself in charge of Venezuela.
    


• Not-guilty plea: Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges yesterday and chose not to immediately fight their detention.
    


            Russia's foreign ministry has slammed the “blatant neocolonial threats and armed aggression” carried out against Venezuela over the weekend, without directly naming the United States.
    


            In a statement, the ministry welcomed the swearing in of Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's acting president, saying that it demonstrates Caracas' determination to, among other things, “ensure unity,” “curb the risks of a constitutional crisis,” and “create the necessary conditions for the further peaceful and stable development of Venezuela.”
    


                    “We welcome the efforts of the official authorities of this country to protect state sovereignty and national interests. We confirm Russia's unwavering solidarity with the Venezuelan people and government,” the statement said.
                





            The foreign ministry also said it was ready to provide “the necessary support” to its “friend Venezuela.”
    


            “We firmly believe that Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive external interference,” it said.
    


Some context: Russia and Venezuela are close allies. After the US's attack on Venezuela on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry condemned what it called an “act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” calling any “excuses” given to justify such actions “untenable.”
    


            After Washington tightened trade sanctions on Caracas in mid-2024, Venezuela has relied more heavily on other partners, including Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in May last year that trade with Venezuela grew by 64% in 2024.

            The White House reiterated that Greenland would be better protected by the US after European leaders expressed support for Denmark and the Danish territory.
    


                    “President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security, and he is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told CNN in a statement. “The President is committed to establishing long-term peace at home and abroad,” she added.
                





            The European leaders said in their statement that “Greenland belongs to its people.”
    


            “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark wrote.
    


            Venezuelans are entering a time of uncertainty following the US military operation that ousted leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


            While some are relieved to have Maduro no longer in power, there is also growing anxiety about what the US' role will be in the country moving forward.
    


            Here's a brief history of Venezuela and key moments that led to Maduro's rise and eventual downfall:
    

CNN's Nic Robertson explains a brief history of Venezuela's political landscape after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump said the US will “run” the country. 


            The United States is “almost starting a war with an allied country” in its pursuit of Greenland, Danish parliament member Rasmus Jarlov told CNN's Becky Anderson today.
    


            “It is quite shocking that a person who's in charge of this completely illegitimate land claim on Greenland knows so little about the history and the background of why Greenland belongs to Denmark,” Jarlov said, referencing White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who last night said that nobody would fight the US if it tried to seize the autonomous Danish territory.
    


                    Denmark's ownership of Greenland “may be one of the most well-established ownerships of territory in the world. It is not disputed by anyone. It has never been disputed by the United States themselves, and they really should know these things before almost starting a war with an allied country,” Jarlov continued.
                





For context: US President Donald Trump has renewed his public calls for the autonomous Danish territory after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
    


            While the US has said it needs Greenland for security purposes, Jarlov pointed out that the country already has “exclusive and full military access” to the island. “So this talk about needing Greenland for security is complete nonsense,” he added.
    


                    “They talk about that the United States are the only ones that can protect Greenland, but the fact is that they're the only ones threatening Greenland. Neither China nor Russia are threatening Greenland,” he said.
                





            Should the US attack Greenland militarily, Denmark “will defend it, and in that case, we would be at war,” Jarlov said.
    


                    “We would be fighting each other, which is completely absurd,” he continued. “But you cannot disagree that if the United States attacks a NATO country, there is no alliance.”
                





CNN's Francisca Marques contributed to this reporting.



            The attack on Venezuela has already come at a heavy cost for Cuba, with the government reporting in a social media post that 32 of its citizens were killed during the US military operation.
    


            Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's inner circle of bodyguards were Cuban. Saturday's operation appears to be the first time in decades that the former Cold War-era foes have engaged in combat. Now, the Cuban government is wondering if it could be the next country targeted by the Trump administration.
    


Watch to learn more about what could be next for Cuba amid escalating tensions: 


CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains what's next for Cuba as political turmoil rocks the country's close ally, Venezuela, after the US capture of Nicolás Maduro.


            The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, called Tuesday for a “fair trial” for the ousted president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who was captured on January 3 along with his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas after a US military intervention, and then transferred to New York, where they face drug trafficking charges.
    


            “In this case, now that President Maduro has been detained, what one asks for is always a fair trial. That is what must be requested, so that truly in everything, for everyone and in any circumstance – and in this particular case – there must be speed and justice,” the president said during her morning press conference.
    


            Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico's position of rejecting US intervention, stating that “regardless” of one's opinion of Maduro's presidency or the Venezuelan government, her government condemns Washington's “invasion.”
    


            “We must recover our history, our constitution, and what each one says about it,” she said.
    


            She recalled that Mexico defends “non-intervention, the peaceful resolution of disputes,” and noted that even “if a country is very small internationally, we are all equal.”
    


            “That is why we speak of the legal equality of states. International cooperation for development, which is what I mentioned yesterday. The best way to help a country is international cooperation for development. Respect, protection, and promotion of human rights,” she asserted.
    


            Since Maduro's detention on January 3, Mexico has expressed its rejection of Washington's military intervention in Venezuela and has defended the sovereignty of nations.
    


            On Sunday, it issued a joint statement with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Spain, and Uruguay rejecting “the military actions unilaterally carried out on Venezuelan territory” and expressing “concern about any attempt at governmental control, administration, or external appropriation of natural or strategic resources.”
    


            Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab demanded the release of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, saying that he has “diplomatic immunity.”
    


            The attorney general urged Alvin K. Hellerstein, the US judge in charge of Maduro's case, to “respect international law and proceed to recognize the lack of jurisdiction of the court under his command to try the leader of a sovereign nation, like the Venezuelan homeland, who is protected by diplomatic immunity, I repeat, as head of state.”
    


            Saab also urged Hellerstein to “cease all human rights violations that have been carried out against the president, his wife, and obviously against the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores pleaded not guilty yesterday in their first court appearance in New York.

            The Trump administration's recent rhetoric about Greenland in light of its actions in Venezuela is harming American security, according to John Bolton, US President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.
    


            When asked by CNN's Kate Bolduan about comments made by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller yesterday that “nobody's gonna fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Bolton said that Miller was making a “simple-minded statement.”
    


                    “Of course, nobody's going to fight us over (Greenland), but it doesn't mean we should take territory from a treaty ally. And if we do that or if, frankly, this conversation goes on much longer, I think the NATO alliance is in grave jeopardy,” he said.
                





            “This is a self-inflicted wound by the Trump administration. It harms American security. It does not enhance it by this kind of talk about Greenland,” Bolton continued.
    


On Venezuela: Bolton also reiterated that the Trump administration was making a “big mistake” by choosing not to support opposition leader María Corina Machado as the new leader of Venezuela.
    


            Machado and fellow opposition leader Edmundo González “are the people who can help provide stability,” Bolton said, not those who were a part of the regime ran by ousted President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday celebrated the capture of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, boasting that the high-risk operation proved the US has the “most fearsome” military in the world.
    


            “We had a lot of boots on the ground, but it was amazing,” he said during a speech at a House GOP retreat in Washington, DC. “It was brilliant tactically.”
    


            Trump recounted several operational details to Republican lawmakers, indicating the US cut electricity to major parts of Venezuela just before entering the country. That gave the military the element of surprise as it approached Maduro's compound.
    


            “And think of it, nobody was killed,” Trump said. “And on the other side, a lot of people were killed.”
    


            Trump went on to criticize Democrats for airing concerns about the decision to capture Maduro, complaining that few in the party were congratulating him.
    


            “At some point they should say, you know, ‘You did a great job,'” he said. “‘Thank you, congratulations.' Wouldn't it be good?”
    


            Colombian Foreign Minister Yolanda Villavicencio confirmed Tuesday that she will submit a note of protest to the United States over threats made by President Donald Trump against Colombian President Gustavo Petro.
    


            “The meeting we will have today with the US representative is to present our note of rejection of these offenses, which are not only directed at President Gustavo Petro,” the foreign minister said. “We want them to understand that he is our democratically elected president. An offense against the president is an offense against our country,” she added.
    


            On Sunday, Trump described Petro as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.”
    


            When pressed by a reporter on whether those comments meant there could be an “operation” in Colombia in the future, Trump responded, “Sounds good to me.” Petro subsequently refuted Trump's claims and defended his government's record on combating drug trafficking in a lengthy post on X.
    


            Villavivencio rejected the US “aggression” against Venezuela over the weekend and said that, while Bogotá maintains its non-recognition of the country's 2024 elections, it respects the Venezuelan legal system that led to Delcy Rodríguez taking office as acting president after Maduro's capture.
    


            The minister said she has been in contact with the Venezuelan government, without giving details of those conversations, and said that Colombia has not received asylum requests from Chavista leaders.
    


                    She added that Colombia seeks “a solution for Venezuela that is through dialogue and the autonomous decision of Venezuelans, (and) that they find the way to reach a consensus on the best way for the country to continue with a government that can overcome (the crisis).”

            Venezuelan security forces detained 14 journalists in the capital on Monday, including reporters who were covering the swearing-in of the country's national assembly, according to the national press union.
    


            In a post on X, the SNTP reported that 13 foreign journalists and one Venezuelan journalist were detained on Monday in Caracas before later being released.
    


            The union said that journalists had their equipment and messaging apps checked.
    


            Tensions are high on the ground in Venezuela following the capture of now ousted leader Nicolas Maduro, while some of the focus diplomatically has shifted to the US' claims on Greenland, which have provoked a strong pushback from Europe.

Stephen Miller asserts Trump administration's position is Greenland should be part of the US.

 


            The full House and Senate are expected to receive closed-door briefings on the US' Venezuela operation tomorrow.
    


            The Senate will hold a members-only classified briefing at 10 a.m. ET in the Senate SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility), according to a source familiar with the meeting and a notice sent to Senate offices.
    


            The briefing will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, CIA Director Ratcliffe and Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine.
    


            The House is also expected to receive a similar classified briefing.
    


            The Gang of Eight and top Republicans and Democrats from key House and Senate committees were briefed yesterday, but the fuller meeting this week will allow a wider swath of lawmakers to pose questions about the legality of the operation, future US involvement in Venezuela, and more amid questions over the propriety of the Trump administration's actions.
    


            The US' attack on Venezuela and its capture of ousted President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend drew headlines worldwide and drew international attention - both positive and negative.
    


            Just a few days after the strike, focus has also shifted to Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark. The Arctic island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the US ballistic missile defense system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.
    


            On Sunday, US President Donald Trump repeated his claim that his country “need(s) Greenland” from a security perspective.
    


                    “We need Greenland … It's so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”
                





            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said yesterday that the formal position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”
    


                    “Nobody's gonna fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said on CNN's “The Lead with Jake Tapper.”
                





            These remarks came following US military action on foreign soil, and were met with consternation from European allies.
    


                    “The current and repeated rhetoric coming from the United States is entirely unacceptable. When the President of the United States speaks of ‘needing Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it is not only wrong. It is disrespectful,” Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen said yesterday.
                





            Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that there would be consequences should the US try to seize Greenland, saying in televised remarks that “if the US chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, everything stops, including NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of World War II.”
    


            In a joint statement released today, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and Denmark reiterated that “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

            Tensions appear to be rising in Venezuela in the aftermath of US military action to capture President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, with rights groups reporting checkpoints and media repression as security forces patrol the streets.
    


            Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital Caracas.
    


            In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!”
    


            The SNTP Venezuelan journalists' union denounced repression against journalists on Monday, and Edmundo González – who the opposition maintains was the true winner of the 2024 elections – repeated calls for the release of political prisoners.
    


            In a video message from exile, González said that the capture of Maduro was “a necessary step, but not sufficient” to achieve a democratic transition.
    


            On Monday, the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners in Venezuela reported that political prisoners have had visiting rights suspended and are being prevented from communicating with the outside world.
    


            The committee added that checkpoints have been going up in cities around the country, with people being searched and detained for possessing “digital material” linked to the US military action.
    


            The Venezuelan government on Monday published the decree of the State of External Commotion, which grants broad powers to the presidency and orders security forces to capture “any person involved in the promotion or support” of the US attack against the South American country.
    


            Yesterday saw ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro make an appearance at a New York court, after he was captured alongside his wife Cilia Flores in a US operation over the weekend.
    


            As you can see in the images below, he was escorted to the court by armed police and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, traveling both by motorcade and helicopter to move from a Brooklyn detention center to the Manhattan courthouse.
    


            Meanwhile in Venezuela, the country's former vice president was formally sworn in as acting leader yesterday. The ambassadors of China, Russia and Iran — key allies of Venezuela — were among the first dignitaries to congratulate Delcy Rodríguez when she was sworn in.
    


            The United Nations has said it is “deeply worried” about what comes next for Venezuela following the US capture of President Nicolas Maduro.
    


                    “It is clear that the operation undermined a fundamental principle of international law – that states must not threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Tuesday.
                





            The statement acknowledged the Maduro government's “appalling human rights record”, but said US intervention could have damaging consequences both for Venezuela and the rest of the world.
    


                    “We fear that the current instability and further militarization in the country resulting from the U.S. intervention will only make the situation worse.”
                





            “The future of Venezuela must be determined by the Venezuelan people alone, with full respect for their human rights, including the right to self-determination, and sovereignty over their lives and their resources,” it added.
    


            Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize in October last year for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”
    


            She was awarded the prize “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said at the time. In a statement accepting the award, Machado said the prize belonged to the people of Venezuela.
    


            She also dedicated the prize to US President Donald Trump, telling CNN that “he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize because of (the) incredible events that are taking place currently in the world.”
    


            In addition to being a staunch proponent of democracy and a vocal supporter of Trump, Machado is also an avowed capitalist who previously ran on a campaign to privatize most Venezuelan public assets, including in the sectors of health, oil and education.
    


            In an interview with CNN before Venezuela's contested 2024 elections, she repeatedly called for the country's markets to be opened, saying: “we need to create conditions that are so competitive, so attractive that international resources will be invested in a country, despite what happened in the previous regime.”
    


            Yesterday, Machado said that, following the US' capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, her country “will be the United States' main ally in matters of security, energy, democracy and human rights.”
    


            In an interview with Fox News the same day, Machado said she hadn't spoken to Trump since October, after her Nobel Peace Prize win.
    


            She thanked the US leader for “the historical actions he has taken against the narco-terrorist regime,” saying that January 3, when Maduro was captured by the US, “will go down in history as the day justice defeated tyranny.”

            Leaders from major European powers have just expressed support for Denmark and Greenland in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by US President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory.
    


            “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” said the statement by leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark.
    


            The leaders said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with NATO allies, including the United States.
    


                    “NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up,” the statement said. “We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.”
                





            Trump has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.”
    


            A US military operation at the weekend, which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario.
    


Some context: Greenland is the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people. It is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western military alliance.
    


            The island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the US ballistic missile defense system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.
    


            The former vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, was formally sworn in as the country's acting leader yesterday.
    


            The 56-year-old has spent more than two decades as one of the leading figures of Chavismo, a socialist ideology founded by influential leftist leader Hugo Chávez, which also values Venezuela's sovereignty as something to be protected from “imperialist” powers.
    


            Despite her staunch support of the Chavismo movement and her hard-line rhetoric about the US following its capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on Saturday, she has seemed to soften her language regarding the country in the days since.
    


            Initially, Rodríguez accused the US of “kidnapping” her country's leader and said that violations of international law were committed, accusing US forces of having “savagely attacked” Venezuela's territorial integrity.
    


            But on Sunday, she extended an invitation to the United States government to collaborate on an “agenda of cooperation,” saying that Venezuela will “prioritize” moving toward “balanced and respectful international relations” with the US and the region.
    


            Yesterday, US President Donald Trump did not say whether he has yet spoken directly to Rodríguez, but told reporters that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been speaking with her in fluent Spanish on the phone and that their “relationship has been very strong.”

Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Kendall Qualls joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his candidacy and reaction to Gov. Tim Walz's decision to drop out of the race.

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican is seeking to tighten the screws on the U.S. immigration system in the wake of multiple investigations into alleged fraud within Minnesota's social services system.

Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people from Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Somalia.

Immigrants from those countries currently in the U.S. on refugee status would be forced to self-deport within 180 days of the bill's enactment.

"It's important that we ensure that those entering our country are properly vetted, and they clearly have not been properly vetted. So what we are trying to do is ensure that we address this, we stop this," Hunt told Fox News Digital.

Part of his impetus for introducing the bill now, Hunt said, was the increased scrutiny on Minnesota's Somali community as federal prosecutors investigate what they believe could be billions of dollars of fraud targeting social programs in the Midwestern state.

Federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged multiple people with stealing more than $240 million from the Federal Child Nutrition Program through the Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future.

The probe has since widened to multiple state-run programs being investigated for potential fraud, however.

Childcare providers receiving state funding, mainly within the Somali community, are also under scrutiny.

Pressure from the growing scandal pushed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to drop his bid for a third term. He said Monday that he did not want to distract from efforts to shield his residents from both fraudsters and people seeking to politicize the situation.

"Every minute that I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity, and the cynics who want to prey on our differences," Walz said.

Walz previously said his administration has taken steps to crack down on the fraud, but argued federal officials are over-inflating the scope of the damage.

"I mean, looking at Tim Walz's decision not to seek re-election — where there's smoke, there's fire. There certainly is more to come out of this situation," Hunt said. "He was clearly complicit in what was going on. That's why he's not seeking reelection, and so there's a lot of 'there' that's there, and it needs to be exposed, needs to be investigated."

He added, "Making sure that we revoke these TPS designations is the beginning of cleaning up this mess."

Hunt argued that his bill would help hasten the timeline for President Donald Trump's move to end TPS for foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota.

He added that the wider purpose of the bill was also to block Sharia law from spreading in the U.S., noting it was something he experienced firsthand as a member of the military.

"As somebody that has lived under Sharia law, somebody that has deployed to the Middle East, this is also a broader conversation about keeping people that hate our country out of here," Hunt said. "And so what we're going to do is try to pass legislation that codifies what President Trump is trying to do."

Hunt is currently running for U.S. Senate in Texas.

Mainstream liberal foundations, private charities with histories of supporting terrorist-linked groups, a Chinese Communist Party-aligned businessman, and an array of left-wing activist organizations with histories of operating in Latin America have, in recent years, united by bankrolling the organizations taking to the streets to protest America's arrest of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

Among the most vocal critics of the U.S. military-supported arrest of Maduro have been CODEPINK, the ANSWER Coalition, and The People's Forum — a trio of left-wing activist groups that have traditionally aligned themselves with countries and organizations hostile to the United States. To voice their opposition to the military action, the groups have organized street protests in cities across the country while flooding social media with messaging accusing the U.S. of colonialism, violating international law, and comparing it to past U.S. military adventures — talking points that have since been adopted by mainstream Democrats. 

These three groups share considerable ties owing to their shared leadership and sources of funding. 

Their mobilization this week in the aftermath of Maduro's arrest, as previously documented by journalist Asra Nomani, was rapid. 

At 1:35 a.m., just as U.S. special forces landed in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, the executive director at The People's Forum, a New York City-based nonprofit organization, declared that the American incursion represented an “illegal bombing.” Roughly an hour later, the group called on Maduro sympathizers to stage an “emergency protest” in the heart of New York City.

The ANSWER Coalition and CODEPINK responded with comparable urgency, with the former calling for an “emergency day of action” at 2:29 a.m. and the latter accusing the U.S. of “war crimes” as early as 6:09 a.m. The trio of groups has collaborated in demonstration organization and messaging campaigns in the days since Maduro's capture.

A Washington Examiner analysis of tax filings tracked roughly $7 million worth of funding flowing into these groups from a variety of sources since 2020. However, much of the funding they receive is anonymous, as, while charitable foundations are legally required to disclose their giving, individuals are allowed to remain anonymous, prompting speculation that foreign donors could be funding domestic activism.

People's Support Foundation, a left-wing grantmaking organization run by CODEPINK co-founder Jodie Evans, was the single largest donor recorded in public disclosures, giving $5 million to The People's Forum in 2024. Evans's husband, Neville Roy Singham, is a self-described socialist who sold his software firm for approximately $785 million in 2017. Since then, he has been accused of using his immense wealth to advance the interests of America's adversaries, chiefly China. 

A 2023 New York Times report linked Singham to Chinese government-backed propaganda efforts, but the former tech executive has denied having a relationship with the CCP. Singham has praised former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, describing the country under his rule as a “phenomenally democratic place.”

Singham reportedly provides The People's Forum and CODEPINK with the bulk of their funding. The People's Forum, in turn, provides the ANSWER Coalition's parent organization with cash and general support. Another CODEPINK co-founder, Medea Benjamin, is the source of funds for Arc of Justice, which provided CODEPINK with $606,000 between 2020 and 2022.

Benjamin has a history of supporting America's adversaries, including the communist Viet Cong and the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.

Many of the organizations pouring funds into groups protesting Maduro's capture have also financially supported entities linked to terrorist organizations. 

The Alalusi Foundation, a charity operated by a wealthy Bay Area Arab-American who owns a grouting company, gave $20,000 to CODEPINK in 2024. That same year, the foundation cut large checks to organizations with links of varying strength to Islamic terrorists. Among these were the Alliance for Global Justice, the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, and American Muslims for Palestine.

In March 2025, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) announced a congressional investigation amid allegations that multiple leaders of American Muslims for Palestine have strong ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups. 

Among these was AMP's former executive director, who served as “secretary general” of the Islamic Association for Palestine, which court records show was founded with funds from senior Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook. Other individuals flagged by the senator included AMP's current executive director, who worked for IAP's media operation and interviewed top Hamas leaders; a former AMP board member, who served as the “Michigan representative” for IAP; and the organization's accountant, who served as IAP's president. Additionally, multiple individuals associated with AMP were also involved with the Holy Land Foundation, which, according to U.S. government estimates, sent “$12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to willfully contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.”

Meanwhile, Alliance for Global Justice was the longtime parent organization of Samidoun, a group that the Treasury Department sanctioned in October 2024 for operating as an “international fundraiser” for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. USCPR held a conference in May 2024 that was endorsed by a founding member of the PFLP and has produced reams of material supporting Hamas, including its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel.

The Yoosufani Family Foundation, similar to the Alalusi Foundation, is run by a Texas-based Pakistani businessman and gave $100,000 to CODEPINK in 2024. That same year, the foundation cut five-figure checks to AMP, USCPR, and a media organization called the “Electronic Intifada.” 

The Alalusi and Yoosufani Family Foundations are far from the only link connecting the groups behind pro-Maduro demonstrations to terrorist organizations.

For instance, The People's Forum accepted a $33,000 donation from the Alliance for Global Justice at some point between April 2023 and March 2024, after the organization began taking criticism for its ties to Islamic terrorists. Additionally, in 2024, the Fred R. Martin Foundation donated $15,000 to the Alliance for Global Justice, with an additional $10,000 allocated to The People's Forum that same year. The People's Forum grant was earmarked specifically for supporting Cuba's left-wing regime.

Support for left-wing regimes in Latin America was another common thread uniting the backers of CODEPINK, the ANSWER Coalition, and The People's Forum.

The Justice and Education Fund is a left-of-center grantmaking network that bankrolls “popular education schools” in South America to boost support for left-wing ideas in the region. It provided nearly half a million dollars to CODEPINK between 2020 and 2022. On top of CODEPINK, the Justice and Education Fund has also poured hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years into BreakThrough News, a far-reaching media operation that has been accused of providing support for adversaries of the U.S., such as the Chinese Communist Party, former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and Russia.

Following the American raid in Caracas, BreakThrough News has been flooding its large social media accounts with messages criticizing the U.S. and offering support to the Maduro regime. 

WHO IS FUNDING THE ANTI-ICE ACTIVISTS IN LA?

While receiving funding from organizations sympathetic to terrorist-linked groups and left-wing radicals, CODEPINK also counted on institutions close to the mainstream liberal movement for support. 

The Tides Foundation, one of the largest dark money networks on the Left, for instance, gave $268,000 to CODEPINK between 2020 and 2024. Other mainstream organizations that have directed money toward CODEPINK and its allies since 2020 include the Good Planet Foundation, the Ben & Jerry's Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, and ImpactAssets.

Mickey Rourke's career has been defined by extremes, including self-imposed detours, legal drama, comebacks and recurring controversy. 

Now, Rourke has found himself in legal trouble again. He was recently served an eviction notice after allegedly falling behind on nearly $60,000 in rent on his Los Angeles home. A member of Rourke's management team seemingly launched a GoFundMe to help the action film star raise the money to stay in his home. The fundraiser had over $70,000 in donations after 24 hours. Rourke later denied he was involved in setting up the fundraiser and urged fans not to donate.

"Something's come up that I'm really frustrated, confused, and I don't understand," Roruke said in a video shared on Instagram. "Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money, like charity. And that's not me, OK? If I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no f---ing charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my a-- and pull the trigger."

He added: "Whoever did this … I don't know why they did it. I don't understand it. I wouldn't know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years. My life is very simple. I don't go to outside sources like that. Yeah, it is embarrassing, but I'm sure I'll get over it like everything else."

MICKEY ROURKE RECALLS BEING BLACKLISTED IN HOLLYWOOD, HOW A PRIEST ‘SAVED' HIM: ‘YOU'VE GOTTA BE TOUGH'

Here's a look back at Mickey Rourke's tumultuous career:

After seeing success in the film industry with "Body Heat," "Diner," "9 ½ Weeks" and "Angel Heart," Mickey Rourke chose to take his talent a different route.

Rourke became a professional boxer in 1991.

The famed actor fought in the ring from 1991 until he chose to retire in 1994. He opened up about the injuries he suffered while boxing in a 2009 interview with the Daily Mail.

"I had my nose broken twice. I had five operations on my nose and one on a smashed cheekbone," he recalled. "I had to have cartilage taken from my ear to rebuild my nose and a couple of operations to scrape out the cartilage because the scar tissue wasn't healing properly."

He claimed most of his cosmetic operations were "to mend the mess of my face because of the boxing, but I went to the wrong guy to put my face back together."

Rourke was arrested in 1994 after he allegedly slapped his then-wife, knocked her down and kicked her during a visit to the couple's publicist's office.

Rourke later pleaded not guilty before the charges were dropped after Carre Otis failed to appear in court multiple times.

Otis later wrote about the passion she experienced while dating Rourke.

"Already in those early days, my craving for him was at its strongest when we weren't together," she wrote in her memoir, "Beauty, Disrupted." "We'd be separated for a few hours, and I could think of nothing else but being with him again. We both loved the drama of it all, loved the fantasy of being head over heels in love, unable to be apart. When people ask why I would end up staying with him for so long, this is a huge part of the answer. The times we weren't together were the times I wanted him most."

Rourke was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in November 2007.

A Miami Beach police report said Rourke had made an illegal U-turn while driving a green scooter, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He then swerved several times before he was pulled over.

"I'm not drunk, I didn't even drink that much," the report claimed Rourke told officers.

Rourke pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of reckless driving and was required to take an online driving course in addition to paying a fine, according to previous reporting.

Rourke seemingly caught a break in 2008 after landing a role in "The Wrestler." Rourke's performance in the Darren Aronofsky film is widely regarded as one of the most dramatic and celebrated comebacks in modern film history.

Rourke earned a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and grabbed an Academy Award nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Randy "The Ram" Robinson.

Rourke's career continued steadily after his mainstream comeback. The former professional boxer appeared in "War Pigs," "Killshot," "Ashby," "Take Back," "The Commando" and "The Palace."

He once said that he was blacklisted in Hollywood for being too difficult to work with.

"The young guys are cool," he told Fox News Digital in 2022. "They don't care about what they hear. They judge me by my acting ability, not my old reputation. So it's been sort of a resurrection of being able to work with younger directors. I have a love/hate relationship with acting. I enjoy what I'm doing at the moment because I can give everything that I'm taught. I have my confidence. I went through the s--- that I went through, so I'm able to use it in my performances. I could be standing across from any f---ing actor. And I know that motherf---er has not seen, done or been through what I've been through."

Rourke agreed to leave the reality TV show "Celebrity Big Brother UK" in April over controversial behavior.

"Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior," a spokesperson for "Celebrity Big Brother UK" told People magazine at the time. No physical altercation took place, but Rourke reportedly used "threatening and aggressive" language.

Shortly before his exit, Rourke received a warning after his remarks about fellow contestant JoJo Siwa's sexuality.

Now, decades after his rise and fall, Mickey Rourke is facing eviction from a Los Angeles rental property amid ongoing controversy. (BG002/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)

Now, Rourke is facing eviction from a bungalow in Los Angeles after he failed to pay nearly $60,000 in rent.

Rourke rented the property earlier this year, agreeing to pay $5,200 a month, which later went up to $7,000 a month, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by Fox News Digital.

Rourke rented the property around the same time he agreed to leave "Celebrity Big Brother UK" earlier this year following a warning from producers over conduct they deemed inappropriate on the show.

A GoFundMe was started on Rourke's behalf by a member of his team to help raise funds to pay his rent. 

"Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original," the GoFundMe reads. "In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn't just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From Diner to Rumble Fish to 9½ Weeks, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture. 

"Mickey's life never followed a safe or protected path. At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort. Boxing—real and punishing—left lasting physical and emotional scars, and the industry that once celebrated him moved on quickly," it continued. "What followed were years of struggle not defined by spectacle, but by survival: health challenges, financial strain, and the quiet toll of being left behind."

The National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing its charitable foundation, the NRA Foundation, of misusing $160 million in donations.

The NRA alleged the foundation used its trademarks without authorization and diverted donations intended for NRA charitable programs. The group also claimed former NRA directors seized control of the foundation to compete with the gun rights organization.

"The Foundation has been seized by a disgruntled faction of former NRA directors who lost control of the NRA's Board following revelations of financial improprieties, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty and member trust," attorneys for the NRA wrote in the complaint.

The attorney claimed that the faction of former directors seeks to use the foundation to reclaim control after having been "booted out of power by the NRA's members."

The suit claims that the foundation has a personal "beef" with the NRA, and that the faction is "bitter" about losing control of the NRA's board following "a series of scandals."

Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's former chief, resigned in January 2024 as he was set to face trial in a corruption case brought by Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. Prosecutors alleged that NRA executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to bar the foundation from what the NRA calls unfair competition, including promoting or advertising any affiliation with the NRA or using its logo. It also seeks to block conduct that could lead the public to believe the foundation's activities are "sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by, or associated or connected with" the NRA.

911 calls obtained by Fox News Digital, reveal the moment a dentist and his wife were found shot dead in their Columbus home. Officials have not identified a suspect. (Credit: Columbus Police Department)

Several 911 calls reveal the frantic moments before police found a Columbus, Ohio, dentist and his wife dead at their home, including one caller bluntly telling dispatchers "there's a body," as investigators search for the person who killed the couple shortly before their fifth wedding anniversary.

Officials said police responded to the house around 10 a.m. on Dec. 30 when they found Spencer Tepe, 37 and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. Two young children were found at the house unharmed. Police do not believe their deaths were a murder-suicide and said there wasn't any sign of forced entry, adding that a gun wasn't recovered, according to WSYX.

Fox News Digital obtained the four calls placed to 911 through a public records request. The first call came from Spencer's employer, Mark Valrose, who owns Athens Dental Depot. While Valrose said he was vacationing in Florida at the time, several of Spencer's co-workers became concerned after he didn't show up for work.

"Spencer works with me and he did not show up to work this morning and we cannot get ahold of him or his family," Valrose said. "He is always on time and he would contact us if there is any issues whatsoever… we're very, very concerned because this is very out of character and we can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing."

At 9:56 a.m., another individual called 911 to report they could hear kids inside the Tepe household, but no one answered the door.

"I can hear kids inside, and I swear, I think I heard one yell, but we can't get in at this point. I don't know if I need to break the door in or just get in the house or what," the caller said. 

One of Spencer's friends called 911 at 10:03 a.m, saying they came to the Tepes' house to do a "wellness check" and could see a body inside the house.

"There's a body," the person can be heard saying. "Our friend wasn't answering his phone. We just did a wellness check. We just came here and he appears dead. He's laying next to his bed, off of his bed in this blood. I can't get closer to see more than that."

"I can tell he's obviously not breathing or anything," the caller said.

Spencer's friend told the 911 operator that the last time someone spoke with him was on Dec. 29. The friend told the 911 operator that Spencer didn't do any drugs.

WATCH: Former homicide detective says piece of evidence left behind may lead police to Ohio couple's killer

Former homicide detective Ted Williams told Fox News Digital he thinks "someone they know" killed the couple.

"The investigators in Columbus, Ohio, they're having to work backwards from that crime scene, and this is what we know. We do know that there was no signs of forced entry. So, if there's no sign of forced entry, that tells me that they either knew their victims, meaning the perpetrator, or the Tepes may very well have left their doors open," Williams said.

Police on Monday night released surveillance footage showing a "person of interest" in the murders of Spencer and Monique.

The video, released by the Columbus Division of Police, shows the man walking slowly in an alley near the Weinland Park home where Spencer and Monique lived. He's seen in what appears to be a dark coat and light-colored pants.

In a statement released Friday, the couple's family said they are "heartbroken beyond words," and called the deaths "tragic and senseless."

"They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others," read the statement. "Spencer, a graduate of The Ohio State University, was known as a devoted and proud father, a loving partner, and a friend to everyone he met," the family statement said, adding that he was "intelligent, warm, and endlessly welcoming."

Monique was described by family members as a "loving, patient and joyful mother whose warmth defined her."

Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX that the couple was going to celebrate their five-year anniversary next month after getting married in 2021.

Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson defended the fact her parents helped her with money so she could run, arguing it made her 'relatable' to voters during her first interview since beating incumbent mayor Bruce Harrell. (Credit: CNN)

Seattle's new mayor is facing growing scrutiny over her approach to public safety after an internal police email outlined how most drug possession and public use cases are being directed toward diversion rather than prosecution — prompting backlash from critics who say the approach sends the wrong message as open drug use remains visible across the city.

The controversy erupted after Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes circulated an internal message detailing how low-level drug cases will be handled in 2026, fueling concerns among critics that the city is effectively softening enforcement just weeks into Mayor Katie Wilson's administration. City officials insist there has been no policy change, but critics argue the practical impact tells a different story.

In the internal email obtained by Fox News Digital, Barnes wrote that "all charges related to drug possession and/or drug use will be diverted from prosecution to the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program," citing guidance from the City Attorney's Office. The directive applies to user-quantity cases, while drug dealers and those ineligible for LEAD remain subject to prosecution.

Barnes emphasized that officers are still expected to arrest individuals when probable cause exists, particularly when drug use occurs in public view.

Seattle Police pushed back on claims that enforcement is changing, telling Fox News Digital that officers will continue to make drug-related arrests and that SPD policy remains unchanged.

The department said prosecutors, not police, determine whether cases move forward, adding that officers can coordinate with prosecutors to pursue traditional prosecution in cases where diversion is deemed ineffective.

SPD also pointed to staffing gains and declining crime rates, noting the department added 165 officers in 2025 and saw reductions in both violent and property crime.

Mayor Wilson rejected claims that her administration has shifted drug enforcement policy.

"There has been no policy change," Wilson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "You'll know when I announce a policy change, because I'll announce a policy change."

Wilson said she remains committed to enforcing the city's public use and possession ordinance in "priority situations" while expanding diversion programs like LEAD in neighborhood hot spots, stressing urgency, resources and measurable results.

Despite those assurances, critics remain unconvinced.

In an opinion piece published by Seattle Red, conservative radio host and Seattle commentator Jason Rantz argued that diverting most drug use and possession cases away from prosecution undermines accountability, regardless of how city officials describe the policy. Rantz said that when arrests are not followed by prosecution, the message to offenders is that public drug use carries few real consequences.

Criticism has also come from within law enforcement.

Speaking to Rantz on his radio show, Seattle Police Officers Guild President Mike Solan sharply criticized the approach outlined in the internal police email, warning it puts public safety at risk and sends the wrong message about open drug use.

Solan told Rantz that diverting most drug use cases away from prosecution is dangerous and reflects what he described as a naïve political approach to addiction. He warned the strategy could lead to increased crime and overdose deaths, referring to the philosophy behind it as "suicidal empathy."

Solan also said many officers are skeptical of the LEAD program, telling Rantz that some avoid making LEAD referrals altogether because they believe the program is ineffective and driven more by ideology than accountability.

"The recent naive, ignorant political decision to not arrest offenders for open drug use in the City of Seattle is horrifically dangerous and will create more death and societal decay," Solan told Rantz. "It embodies an enormous flaw in those in our community who think that meeting people where they are who are in the throes of addiction, is the correct path to lift them up."

Similar concerns were raised by outreach groups.

According to MyNorthwest, Andrea Suarez, executive director of the nonprofit We Heart Seattle, warned that allowing open drug use in public spaces enables addiction and accelerates harm. Suarez argued that enforcement plays a critical role in pushing people toward treatment and said diversion-based approaches without consequences fail to meaningfully disrupt drug use.

City officials, however, maintain that enforcement remains in place. Seattle Police say officers will continue to make arrests when probable cause exists, while Wilson insists there has been no policy change and that the city is focused on enforcing drug laws in "priority situations" while expanding diversion efforts in high-impact areas.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Snow, ice and freezing temperatures hit parts of Europe on Tuesday, causing treacherous traffic conditions that left at least five people dead in France and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights from one of the continent's busiest airports.

Authorities in the Landes region of southwestern France reported three dead in accidents, and at least two more people were reportedly killed in the Île-de-France region around Paris, where authorities ordered trucks off the road as snowfall caused huge traffic jams on Monday.

Paris awoke Tuesday to a blanket of snow on its famous rooftops and sites, and children whose schools couldn't hold classes delighted in an unexpected day off. Air travelers were less happy, as heavy snowfall forced the closure of six airports in the north and west of France.

As snow fell across the Netherlands, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport reported that some 600 flights were grounded during the day as crews worked to clear runways and de-ice planes waiting to depart. More snow was forecast for the rest of the week. 

Dutch airline KLM warned travelers stranded at Schiphol that scammers posing as customer service staff were targeting passengers and incorrect phone numbers for the airline were circulating online. It warned people “to be alert to these phishing attempts. Do not respond to such messages, and do not share any personal or payment information.”

KLM also said it was running short of the glycol fluid it uses combined with hot water to de-ice planes before they take off. It said airports across Europe were facing similar problems after days of freezing temperatures. 




Just getting to and from the airport outside the Dutch capital was a struggle with frozen points and an early morning software glitch throwing the Netherlands' rail system into turmoil.

Limited rail services resumed later in the morning but routes around Amsterdam remained largely closed because of the icy conditions, national railway company NS said on its website. It urged commuters to “only travel if it's absolutely necessary.”

Commuters forced to drive to work also faced time-consuming journeys as a combination of the snow and ice snarled traffic on some highways.

Thijs Rademakers, an 18-year-old student, decided to ride his bike rather than wait for public transport.

“It was tough, very slippery,” he said in the eastern city of Arnhem. “Many people fall. Luckily, I didn't.”

In Rome, weeks of rain that have swollen the Tiber River over its banks again muted Pope Leo XIV's Christmas-time celebrations. St. Peter's Square was only partially full Tuesday as a few thousand people crowded under colorful umbrellas to hear Leo deliver his Epiphany blessing from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica.

Rome has been soaked by steady rains since before Christmas, and Mayor Roberto Gualtieri issued an ordinance for Tuesday limiting public access to parks and other areas at risk for falling trees and flooding.

Farther north, snow dusted Bologna and gave skiers in the Dolomites reason to cheer, though freezing temperatures are forecast for much of the north and central part of the peninsula over the coming days.

A cold snap sent the temperature in northern parts of Britain down to minus 12.5 degrees Celsius (9.5 Fahrenheit) overnight, as snow disrupted rail, road and air travel and closed hundreds of schools.

Horse races and soccer matches have been called off because of snow and frost, while a power failure caused by ice closed Glasgow's subway. 

Up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of snow was forecast Tuesday for northern Scotland, where some people have already been snowed in by previous falls. Northeast Scotland lawmaker Andrew Bowie said the situation was “critical,” calling for soldiers to be sent in to clear snow and get food and medical supplies to stranded people.

Both heavy snow and heavy rain swept through Balkan countries, swelling rivers and creating problems in traffic and disruptions in power and water supplies. A woman died in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo on Monday after a snow-covered tree branch fell on her head. In neighboring Serbia, some western municipalities introduced emergency measures due to bad weather.

Authorities in Serbia warned drivers to be very careful as many set off toward skiing resorts or elsewhere for Orthodox Christmas on Wednesday and the upcoming weekend. Black ice stopped cars and forced drivers to park on the side on their way to Mount Bjelasnica above Sarajevo on Tuesday morning.

Heavy wind and stormy seas battered the Adriatic coastline in Croatia and Montenegro. Video footage showed the sea sweeping through holiday cottages at Ada Bojana in southern Montenegro during a storm.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's wife arrived to court in New York City wearing bandages on her face and complaining of bruises on her ribs, according to her lawyer.

Her attorney, veteran prosecutor Mark Donnelly, told the court that Cilia Flores suffered "significant injuries" when U.S. forces raided the couple's compound in Caracas on Saturday. Donnelly requested that Flores receive a full X-ray to determine whether she fractured a rib in the incident.

Flores was already wearing two bandages on her face, one on her forehead and another above her eye.

Both she and her husband pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and other charges in their first appearance on Monday.

Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Flores faces three charges, including cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Donnelly filed a motion to serve as counsel for Flores earlier Monday. He previously served 12 years at the Department of Justice, including as senior advisor to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.

"Mark has extensive experience investigating white collar cases, having run the Southern District's fraud division for over two years. His white collar practice included FCPA investigations, Healthcare Fraud, joint SEC matters, large scale investor fraud, and cyber security matters," Donnelly's biography on the website for the Parker Sanchez & Donnelly law firm reads.

The Texas House of Representatives also enlisted Donnelly to assist in the 2023 investigation and impeachment trial for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton's impeachment case made it to the Texas Senate, but he was ultimately acquitted on all charges.

Maduro and Flores, who have been married for 12 years, were first introduced while working closely with Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez. At the time, Maduro described her as having a "fiery character," according to Reuters.

 ‘All-Star' panelists Ben Domenech, Stef Kight and Robert Wolf discuss the released report from the 'MAHA' Commission regarding childhood disease on ‘Special Report.'

Many might assume that over-the-counter (OTC) medications are generally safer than stronger prescription drugs, but research shows they can still present risks for some.

Certain common OTC painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart attacks.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — which are used to reduce pain, fever and inflammation — have been pinpointed as the class of medicines most linked to elevated cardiovascular risk.

NEW HEALTH WARNING ISSUED OVER POPULAR SLEEP AID MILLIONS TAKE NIGHTLY

"This is because they reduce the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins," Maryam Jowza, M.D., an anesthesiologist at UNC Health in North Carolina, told Fox News Digital. "These chemicals are involved in inflammation, but they are also involved in other body functions, such as influencing the tone of blood vessels."

Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, echoed the potential risk of NSAIDs. 

"They can lead to high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke via fluid retention and salt retention," he told Fox News Digital. "This increases volume, puts a strain on the heart and raises blood pressure."

DIABETES PATIENTS EXPERIENCE LOWER DEATH RATE WITH COMMON MEDICATION

Common examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin and celecoxib.

Randomized trials found that ibuprofen caused the biggest spikes in blood pressure, followed by naproxen and then celecoxib. 

"In general, the increase in blood pressure is more likely with higher doses and longer duration of treatment," said Jowza, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the UNC School of Medicine.

COMMON VIRUSES LINKED TO ‘DRAMATIC' SPIKE IN HEART ATTACK AND STROKE RISK

NSAIDs can also increase stroke risk, especially at high doses and with long-term use, the doctor added. 

Diclofenac was linked to the highest cardiovascular risk, the doctor cautioned. Ibuprofen can also raise blood pressure and has been associated with a higher heart attack and stroke risk, but not as high as diclofenac. Naproxen carries a lower cardiovascular risk than ibuprofen or diclofenac, but is not entirely risk-free.

"The practical takeaway is that diclofenac is generally the least favorable choice in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, and all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration," Dr. Nayan Patel, pharmacist and founder of Auro Wellness in Southern California, told Fox News Digital.

COMMON VITAMIN COULD PROTECT SOME HEART ATTACK SURVIVORS, STUDY SHOWS

Aspirin is an exception — although it is an NSAID, it actually reduces the risk of clots when taken at a low dose for prevention, under a doctor's guidance. However, it can increase bleeding risk and blood pressure at high doses.

Non-NSAID pain relievers are commonly used for everyday aches, headaches and fever, but not swelling. They act mainly on the brain's pain signals, not inflammation, according to medical experts.

Acetaminophen, the most common non-NSAID pain reliever, is also linked to an increase in blood pressure, although to a lesser extent, according to Jowza. 

"All NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration."

"Acetaminophen was once thought to have little to no cardiovascular effects, but more recent evidence suggests it can increase blood pressure, especially with higher doses used in the long term," she said, emphasizing the importance of blood pressure monitoring. "Its effect on stroke risk is less clear."

The groups at greatest risk, according to doctors, are those with existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure, prior stroke or heart disease, diabetes or kidney problems.

"These groups are also more likely to experience NSAID-related fluid retention and destabilization of blood pressure control," Patel said.

Cardiovascular risk is generally higher for people 75 and older, the doctors agreed.

"Age amplifies risk largely because baseline cardiovascular risk increases with age, and kidney function reserve tends to decline," Patel said. "Older adults are also more likely to be on antihypertensives, diuretics, antiplatelets or anticoagulants, so NSAIDs can destabilize blood pressure control and add safety complexity."

Anyone experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden weakness or numbness, severe headache, confusion, slurred speech or vision changes should see a doctor immediately, Jowza advised.

"These symptoms can point to a heart attack or stroke," she warned. "Other symptoms of concern that may not develop as rapidly, like new swelling in the legs, should also prompt medical attention."

"Patients should also seek medical advice if they notice signs of fluid retention or kidney stress, such as rapidly rising blood pressure, swelling in the legs, sudden weight gain over a few days, reduced urine output or worsening shortness of breath," Patel added.

For those at higher risk, Patel recommends non-NSAID approaches whenever possible. 

"For many patients, this means starting with non-drug strategies such as heat or ice, physical therapy and activity modification," he told Fox News Digital. "If medication is needed, acetaminophen is generally preferred over oral NSAIDs from a cardiovascular standpoint, although regular use should still be monitored in people with hypertension."

For localized joint or muscle pain, the doctor said topical NSAIDs can offer "meaningful relief" with "far lower" risk.

"Overall, pain management in high-risk patients should emphasize targeted therapy, conservative dosing and close blood pressure monitoring."

The doctors emphasized that the overall risk is "very low" for people taking OTC pain relievers on a short-term basis, but it rises with long-term, high-dose use.

"I would not hesitate to use an occasional dose if it were a low-risk individual with no prior history of heart attack or stroke," Jowza said. "I also think short-term use in diabetics and hypertensives who are well-controlled is acceptable."

Although aspirin is an NSAID, it actually reduces the risk of clots when taken at a low dose for prevention, under a doctor's guidance. (iStock)

For those taking NSAIDs, the doctor suggested using "guard rails" — such as regularly testing blood pressure and kidney function, and setting limits on dosing — to make treatment as safe as possible.

Patel agreed that for most healthy individuals, occasional NSAID use "does not carry a meaningful cardiovascular risk."

TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ

"The concern is primarily with repeated or chronic use, higher doses, and use in people with underlying cardiovascular, kidney or blood pressure conditions," he confirmed to Fox News Digital.

"That said, large population studies show that cardiovascular events can occur early after starting NSAIDs, particularly at higher doses, which is why even short-term use should be approached cautiously in higher-risk patients."

            President Donald Trump is ringing in 2026 with a new form of American imperialism.
    


            ► The US Army's Delta Force was dispatched to depose Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation Saturday. Now Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be part of “running” that oil-rich country, whatever that ends up meaning.
    


            ►  Leaders of neighboring countries, including Colombia and Mexico, were put on notice by Trump that he could take some kind of action against them, too — a clear warning to fall in line.
    


            ►  Trump on Sunday expressed a renewed desire to take over Greenland, claiming the US needs it for security purposes. Both Greenland and Denmark, a NATO ally of the US, are staunchly opposed to the idea.
    


            ►  The president also threatened to take new action against Iran on behalf of protesters there, suggesting the US could revisit the Middle East with its military might.
    


            All of this suggests a new era of violent American influence in the rest of the world. And Trump's decision to turn the American arsenal back on the Western Hemisphere recalls the very long, frequently dark history of American-led regime change closer to home.
    


            Whether to intimidate European powers; to protect American-allied businesses such as banana exporters; to dominate shipping routes or to guard against the specter of communism, the US has been either toppling or propping up various governments for generations.
    


            “This is one of the oldest stories in American history,” said Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at Brown University's Watson School of International and Public Affairs.
    


            Maduro shares an important trait with other deposed Central and South American leaders over the past 100 years or so, Kinzer said.
    


            “These are leaders who do not accept the right of the United States to dominate their countries and their region,” said Kinzer, author of the book “Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq.”
    


            “The United States finds this intolerable,” Kinzer said, “so it's back to the future.”
    


            Maduro, Kinzer acknowledged, is a far-from-sympathetic character — a brutal dictator leading an undemocratic government. But that's true of some who are US allies.
    


            “Mohammed bin Salman (the crown prince of Saudi Arabia) has never won an election and chopped up his main critic into little pieces, but that's fine with us, because he's on our side,” Kinzer said with irony.
    


            A unique feature of the Maduro toppling — which may end up being more a decapitation of his regime than a full-scale regime change — is that he was essentially taken rendition-style from Caracas, according to Alexander Downes, director of the Institute for Security and Conflict Studies at George Washington University.
    


            “Foreign leaders do get indicted in the U.S. That's fine,” Downes said in an email. See Trump's recent pardon of former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was actually convicted of trafficking drugs into the US.
    


            “Kidnapping (rival world leaders) while in office, however, strikes me as a bad idea if not illegal,” said Downes, author of the book “Catastrophic Success: Why Foreign-Imposed Regime Change Goes Wrong.”
    


            Downes added that the move may create a new precedent for other countries. How will the US react if China or Russia now simply kidnaps a rival leader?
    


            The idea that Trump thinks the US is now running Venezuela — something disputed by the country's acting president — is not likely to endear him to anyone in the region.
    


            The most obvious corollary to Trump's Venezuelan operation may seem to be Panama, where 36 years ago this month, the strongman military leader Manuel Noriega surrendered to US custody. He had been seeking refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama City after US forces, including paratroopers, invaded his small country en masse.
    


            Noriega was later tried and convicted in US court, although he won the concession of being treated as a prisoner of war rather than a garden-variety drug trafficker.
    


            Kinzer noted there are many differences between Panama and Venezuela that also complicate comparisons between 1990 and 2026. Venezuela is a much larger country with more rugged terrain. And back in 1990, the US already had a large military presence garrisoned in Panama. There's no US military base inside Venezuela.
    


            The US invasion of Panama may not be remembered by many Americans, but it cost hundreds of lives in the small country, and its anniversary is now treated as a national day of mourning.
    


            Views of the Panama invasion may have turned over time, but it remains among the most successful US regime change operations because it allowed the US to topple Noriega and a democratic government to take over.
    


            Defending democracy has long been a stated, if sometimes unbelievable, goal of recent US-led regime change, but Trump does not appear particularly interested in it.
    


            In that regard, Trump is recalling the first part of the 20th century, when presidents such as William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft were swinging “big stick” or “gunboat” diplomacy around the Caribbean.
    


            “We invaded Cuba in 1898 with the promise that once we helped the Cubans chase out the Spanish overlords, we would turn Cuba over to its people. As soon as the Spanish were gone, we changed our minds and decided we wanted to rule Cuba,” Kinzer said.
    


            He then ticked through other US interventions at the behest of business that led to the overthrow, ouster or resignation of governments during the early 20th century, including in Nicaragua and Honduras. The US military also occupied Nicaragua, Haiti and the Dominican Republic at various points for years during this period.
    


            Later, as the Red Scare and Cold War consumed the US, administrations from both parties meddled abroad for more ideological reasons, such as fighting socialism and the spread of communism — but these moves also helped US businesses.
    


            The CIA, at the urging of the United Fruit Company, helped engineer a coup in Guatemala in 1954 that achieved the goal of toppling the democratically elected government. Subsequent decades saw military juntas and mass killings.
    


            That's about the same time the US and the United Kingdom were colluding to help overthrow the democratically elected government in Iran.
    


            “What looks like an immediate success can turn into a long term failure,” Downes said, pointing to Iran as Exhibit A. “Washington has been dealing with the fallout, including the Iran hostage crisis, Iran's bid for nuclear weapons, and its hostility to Israel for almost 50 years.”
    


            The same could be said of the unintended consequences of more recent US actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.
    


            Decades later, in 1973, the US helped overthrow the democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died in a coup. His successor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, led a repressive right-wing regime.
    


            For Trump, who has variously cited drug trafficking, immigration and other justifications for going after Maduro, the end goal may just be power.
    


            “This is not about values. This is simply about maximizing US security and prosperity,” said Alan Kuperman, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, who has written about regime change.
    


            “What he wants is to make the US the dominant power in Latin America, and he wants for the resources of Latin America to benefit the US more than they have,” Kuperman surmised.
    


            That helps explain why, for now, Maduro's regime has been left intact, just without Maduro. Trump has said he doesn't think opposition leaders can rule.
    


            Setting aside values like democracy and human rights, Kuperman said US-led regime change accomplishes its goals about half the time.
    


            It does not take much of a leap to see that while Trump mostly talks about drugs, his administration is also very much interested in opening more of Venezuela's oil fields to US companies.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Cuban American who Trump said will be part of “running” Venezuela for the time being, seems to have some of his own motivations. Rubio's family fled Cuba, the country where the US failed to depose or take out communist leader Fidel Castro.
    


            Castro is dead, but Cuba is still communist and relies heavily on Venezuela for support. Taking out Maduro could be a step to regime change in Cuba.
    


            “It's amazing how Cuba has had such a hold on the United States and on the American imagination for so long. This little island has distorted our foreign policy over generations, and it's happening again. I think, without the fact that Venezuela is the lifeline for Cuba, this might never have happened,” Kinzer said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said President Donald Trump believes Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) is “criminally liable” for the extensive fraud scandal that Minnesota is facing.

Leavitt's statement confirms speculation that the federal government is weighing whether to hold Walz responsible for his alleged mishandling of the fraud investigations in his state.

“This is all hands on deck, rest assured. It's a top priority for President Trump,” she said on Fox News show Jesse Watters Primetime. “He believes that Gov. Walz is criminally liable, and I think the Department of Justice is going to find out.”

🚨 NEW: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt just went SCORCHED-EARTH on Tim Walz 🔥🚨“This is a man they cannot even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them.”“Trump believes that Governor Walz is criminally liable…… pic.twitter.com/gbEGRII6tK

Earlier Monday, Trump suggested Walz would leave office before his second term ends early next year “because he was caught, REDHANDED, along with Ilhan Omar, and others of his Somali friends, stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars.” The president said he felt “certain the facts will come out.”

Trump's statement was in response to Walz's decision to prematurely end his reelection campaign. Leavitt attributed his campaign exit to the widespread allegations of fraud involving his administration.

“This is a man who can no longer even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them,” she added. “Now the great people of Minnesota, a state that was once known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, has been turned into the land of 10,000 Somali schemes because of their governor.”

As the Trump administration leads multiple investigations into alleged fraud in Minnesota's social services programs, various federal agencies are taking action; the Department of Health and Human Services froze child care payments going to Somali-run day care centers in the state, and the Department of Agriculture ordered the state to verify households receiving federal food benefits in an attempt to root out fraud.

TRUMP TO DEPLOY 2,000 ICE OFFICERS TO MINNEAPOLIS AS FRAUD INVESTIGATION WIDENS

Meanwhile, federal law enforcement is leading an expanded immigration operation in the Minneapolis area. The Department of Homeland Security is deploying up to 2,000 immigration and investigative personnel to the city, with Leavitt confirming the figure to Fox News host Jesse Watters.

The White House press secretary noted that the Department of Justice has convicted and prosecuted nearly 100 defendants in Minnesota so far, hinting that there may be more charges forthcoming for others based on additional reporting.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Monday claimed President Donald Trump is “under the thrall” of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) after the two threatened possible military action against Cuba and Colombia in the aftermath of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's capture over the weekend.

Paul said he once thought Trump was different from the two Bush presidents, who “wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas.” The Kentucky Republican expressed disappointment in Trump's burgeoning alliance with Graham, who is often described as a warmonger by critics.

His criticism comes two days after Trump announced the U.S. military bombed Venezuela and detained Maduro, citing allegations that his authoritarian regime facilitated drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. Maduro is currently imprisoned in New York to face federal charges for those crimes.

While Paul isn't opposed to the ousting of a socialist leader, he argued that Congress should have approved the operation resulting in Maduro's capture.

“Time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost. Best though, not to forget, that our founders limited the executive's power to go to war without Congressional authorization for a reason—to limit the horror of war and limit war to acts of defense,” he wrote in a lengthy post on X. “Let's hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.”

Graham's response to the news about Maduro and Venezuela was much more generous toward Trump.

“If you can't celebrate the fact that our military, under President Trump's command, bravely captured and brought to justice an evil, corrupt narcoterrorist dictator with American blood on his hands, then your hatred of President Trump denies you the ability to celebrate making America safer and creating a path for liberating the highly oppressed people of Venezuela,” he said.

Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, Trump hinted that Colombia and Cuba were next to be met with military force. Graham was present, nodding in agreement with the president.

“You just wait for Cuba,” Graham warned. “Cuba is a communist dictatorship that's killed priests and nuns. They've preyed on their own people. Their days are numbered.”

At one point, when Trump said Cuba is “ready to fall,” Graham grinningly said, “Yes.”

In response to a reporter's question about Graham's warning to Cuba, Paul joked that legislation could be a viable method to prevent Graham from constantly meeting with Trump.

“There should be a law that Lindsey Graham can only enter the White House every other week and that he's only to meet with mid-level people, not the president. No more golf outings,” he suggested. “It's always been an anomaly because Lindsey Graham has been diametrically opposed to everything Trump has ever said on regime change.”

Although Latin American nations were quick to denounce Maduro's arrest, some of them have not addressed the threat from Trump and Graham in a meaningful capacity. Cuba remains silent, but Colombian President Gustavo Petro vowed to “take up arms” in the event of a U.S. attack.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was born to Cuban immigrants, has been tasked with leading the overhaul of Venezuela's government. The Trump administration says the United States is currently running Venezuela, even as Maduro was replaced by his former vice president. It remains to be seen whether the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, will remain in power under U.S. control or will be ousted in a similar fashion as her predecessor.

Trump has also repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring the Danish territory of Greenland, including the possibility of doing so by military force. 

TRUMP SIGNALS HE COULD TAKE ACTION ON CUBA, COLOMBIA, AND OTHER COUNTRIES AFTER VENEZUELA

“We do need Greenland, absolutely,” the president said in an interview with the Atlantic over the weekend, adding that it was “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” Following the remarks, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the U.S. to calm such rhetoric.

“It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland,” Frederiksen said. “The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom,” she said, going on to “strongly urge” the U.S. to “stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale.”

The man was detained shortly after midnight by Secret Service agents assigned to Vance's home, east of downtown Cincinnati, agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. He has not been named.

A man who broke windows at Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home and caused other property damage was detained early Monday, the U.S. Secret Service said. 

William D. DeFoor, 26, is facing federal charges for allegedly damaging government property, engaging in physical violence against property in a restricted area and assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers, according to the United States Attorney's office in Ohio's southern district. 

DeFoor was detained shortly after midnight by Secret Service agents assigned to Vance's home, east of downtown Cincinnati, agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. The vice president and his family were not at home, having returned to Washington on Sunday after a weekend there, his office said.

The Secret Service saw a man running along the front fence of Vance's residence and breach the property line around midnight, according to an affidavit filed Monday. The man was armed with a hammer and vandalized an unmarked Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home's driveway before moving toward the front of the home and breaking its glass windows, the affidavit says. 

AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on an attack on the vice president's home.

DeFoor was detained after he tried to flee from officers on foot. He is accused of causing around $28,000 in damage, the affidavit says.

Public records list DeFoor as living in Cincinnati. Calls to the listings for possible relatives and an attorney who previously represented Defoor were not immediately returned.

Vance expressed gratitude to the Secret Service and Cincinnati police for responding quickly to the incident in a post on the social platform X.




“I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home,” Vance tweeted. “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows.”

Court records show that DeFoor faced an earlier charge of vandalism in 2024 and agreed to treatment under the county's Mental Health Court system.

The Secret Service is coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office as charging decisions are reviewed, Guglielmi said.

The Vance home is located in one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, on hills overlooking the city. Throughout Vance's vice presidency, protesters have often gathered outside the home — clashing at one point last spring with Vance himself.

Vance, a Republican, was a U.S. senator representing Ohio before becoming vice president. He moved to Cincinnati after a stint in Silicon Valley following law school, and his half brother ran unsuccessfully for mayor there last year. Vance was raised in nearby Middletown, which figured heavily in his bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”

For the first time in years, many Americans enrolled in a health insurance plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will need to keep a careful accounting of their annual income — or risk a hefty federal tax bill.

Enhanced ACA subsidies lapsed at the end of 2025, leaving millions of households on the hook for higher insurance premiums. The lapse also reintroduced the so-called subsidy cliff, whereby households that earn even $1 more than a specific income threshold will lose all eligibility for subsidies, also known as premium tax credits.

That income cutoff, which varies by family size, is $62,600 for a single person, $84,600 for a two-person household and $128,600 for a family of four in 2026, for example. 

More than 2 million people enrolled in an ACA marketplace plan have an income near the subsidy cliff. ACA enrollees also tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it hard to predict their annual earnings, experts said. 

Households over the limit would have to pay back any federal subsidies they received for premiums — potentially worth thousands of dollars — when they file taxes next year for 2026.

"Starting February, March, April 2027 is when you'll start to see the horror stories of people with astronomical tax bills, from the payback of these credits," said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025. 

The potential financial impact is exacerbated by a multitrillion-dollar legislative package known as the "big beautiful bill" that Republicans passed over the summer, which stripped away guardrails capping the amount of excess subsidies households must repay, experts said. 

"I don't know of anything else that's as penalizing in the tax code by adding one extra dollar [of income]," Lucas said. "You've got to be on your game starting now."

The total sum households need to pay back to the federal government "could easily be $10,000," said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the Affordable Care Act program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. 

The sum depends on factors like age, geography and family size, Cox said. 

An older couple who inadvertently earn too much money and go over the subsidy cliff may need to pay back around $20,000, for example, she said.

There's a chance Congress may still act to extend enhanced ACA subsidies in some form and prevent a surprise tax bill for many households next year. 

Democrats on Capitol Hill have said they want to extend them, while most Republicans have said they're opposed. However, a group of Republicans has recently engaged in bipartisan talks in the House and Senate that may yield legislative action. 

"I think the chances are pretty slim something will pass," Cox said. "From a personal finance perspective, you have to just count on nothing happening in Congress."

The subsidy cliff is in effect for the first time since Congress enacted enhanced premium subsidies in 2021 as part of a Covid-19 pandemic relief law.

Now, households with an income in 2026 that exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line are ineligible for any premium tax credits. They'd be on the hook for the full, unsubsidized health insurance premium.

For example, the average 60-year-old with an income of $62,000 would pay about $515 a month in health premiums, or approximately 10% of their annual income, according to a KFF analysis. This person would be eligible for premium subsidies.

However, the same person earning $64,000 would pay $1,244 per month, about 23% of their income, since they would fall over the subsidy cliff, KFF found.

Millions of people have an income near the subsidy cliff. 

In 2025, about 3% of ACA enrollees — nearly 725,000 people — earned between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty line, for example, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis of federal data.

Another 7% — about 1.8 million people — earned 300% to 400% of the poverty line, it found. That equates to more than about $47,000 per year for an individual and about $96,000 for a family of four.

"People around that income [threshold] didn't have to worry about that for the past five years," Cox said.

"[Now], if your income is right around that threshold for subsidy eligibility, then you need to be really careful about how much money you're making," she said.

About 22 million Americans received premium subsidies, also known as premium tax credits, in 2025. 

Households can opt to receive the tax credit in one of two ways: As a lump sum during tax season or as an advanced payment. 

Under the latter option, by far the most popular, the federal government issues the tax credit directly to a consumer's insurer, which then lowers the consumer's out-of-pocket premium. 

Consumers receive those advanced ACA subsidies based on an estimated annual income they provide when signing up for insurance. They must reconcile those subsidies during tax season and repay any excess tax credits to the IRS.

ACA enrollees tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it difficult to predict their annual pay accurately, Cox said.

About one in five people, 21%, between 19 and 64 years old who shop for insurance on the ACA marketplace are in households with "high levels of income volatility," according to a KFF study published in May. The researchers define volatility as a difference of at least 20% between estimated and actual income. 

The federal government determines eligibility for ACA subsidies based on "modified adjusted gross income." 

Determining MAGI may be challenging, experts said. 

It's one's adjusted gross income — a line item on households' tax returns — with some other elements added back. The two "biggies" for most people are any tax-exempt interest, such as from municipal bonds, and any untaxed Social Security benefits, Lucas said. 

"It's definitely important for people on the ACA to know their cliff number, their 400%," Lucas said. 

They should monitor their income monthly to see how it's trending, he said. 

"There are ways to keep an eye on your income and even make changes mid-year to stay eligible for the subsidies, so you don't have a big surprise come tax time next year," Cox said. 

For example, households can consider making pre-tax contributions to financial accounts like a 401(k), individual retirement account or health savings account, which helps to reduce modified adjusted gross income, experts said. 

Additionally, retirees and other households may choose to draw money from Roth retirement accounts, which, with some exceptions, doesn't count toward taxable income. Savers can withdraw Roth contributions tax-free, even if they're not yet age 59½. 

Consumers who are still working and have some flexibility in their hours and work schedule might also opt to work less to reduce their annual earnings.

Happy Tuesday. We're not even a week into the new year and I've already started telling myself that my resolution to read more can include reviewing drafts of this newsletter.

Stock futures are little changed this morning. The market is coming off a winning session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Investor attention yesterday concentrated on the U.S.' strike on Venezuela over the weekend. Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in a New York City court yesterday, saying he was "kidnapped" and a "prisoner of war." 

Here's how the market reacted to the military operation:

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told CNBC yesterday that interest rates may not need to come down much further. 

"My guess is we're pretty close to neutral right now," Kashkari said on "Squawk Box." He said he believes inflation is still too high and that monetary policy appears to not have been tight enough in recent years.

On the labor front, Kashkari said artificial intelligence has caused a slowdown in hiring among big companies while also creating productivity gains. His comments come ahead of tomorrow's ADP employment report and November's Job Openings and Labor Turnover data, followed by the all-important nonfarm payroll report on Friday.

General Motors reported a 5.5% annual U.S. sales increase in 2025 yesterday. As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, that should make it a top performer: Cox Automotive expects the broader sector to rise around just 2%.

On the other hand, Chrysler parent Stellantis saw its sales slide 3.3%. But it wasn't all bad: The automaker's Jeep brand posted growing sales for the first time since 2018.

Electric vehicle maker Lucid, meanwhile, said deliveries surged 55% in 2025, driven by a 70% annual increase in the fourth quarter. Lucid has been building out production of its Gravity SUV despite supply chain snafus.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Nvidia is testing the robotaxi waters. The company said yesterday that it's working with operators in hopes of having them use Nvidia's AI chips and software in their autonomous vehicle fleets as early as next year.

As CNBC's Kif Leswing notes, it's the AI titan's latest foray into the automotive sector. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber last year. The company also said last month that Mercedes-Benz models released in later this year should be able to use its software for navigating cities like San Francisco.

JPMorgan launched a new initiative yesterday that gives select clients access to insights on the bank's approach to major topics. In other words, its new "Special Advisory Services" will provide a look at parts of the recipe for JPMorgan's "secret sauce."

Liz Myers, the bank's global chair of investment banking, is leading the effort. Myers told CNBC's Leslie Picker that JPMorgan's capabilities are "on par or better" than what some specialized consultancies offer.

JPMorgan will offer insights on a range of topics, including investor relations and real estate selection. Initially, the bank will not charge for these services, but it said it could institute a fee structure for clients needing support on prolonged or more time-consuming projects.

Matt Mahan, the mayor of San Jose, California, rebuked the so-called billionaires tax that has been the talk of Silicon Valley. It was a notable break from Rep. Ro Khanna, a fellow Democrat who has been under fire from the technology elite over his support of the proposed ballot measure.

CNBC's Dan Mangan, Spencer Kimball, Hugh Leask, Sean Conlon, Jeff Cox, Ashley Capoot, Michael Wayland, Kif Leswing, Leslie Picker and Jordan Novet contributed to this report. Josephine Rozelle edited this edition.

Software startup NinjaOne has surpassed $500 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the company announced Tuesday.

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000.

President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support.

"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better," he said.

Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.

Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's "multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster" to generate several software solutions at once.

The company snagged a $5 billion valuation after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, in February 2025.

Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne.

"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja," he said. "The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works."

He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate artificial intelligence.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead. 

Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition.

In October, NinjaOne rolled out its Patch Intelligence AI feature, which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow.

"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings," he said. "I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it."

European leaders on Tuesday issued a joint statement to push back against U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, saying security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively. 

"The Kingdom of Denmark – including Greenland – is part of NATO," the statement said, according to a letter published by Denmark's Prime Minister's Office on X. 

"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them," they continued. 

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland."  

The letter was signed by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland.

The coordinated message, which also described the U.S. as "an essential partner" in the push for Arctic security, comes as Trump once again sets his sights on the vast, mineral-rich and sparsely populated territory.

The U.S. president, who has long advocated for control over the self-governing Danish territory, told NBC News on Monday that he was "very serious" with his intent to acquire Greenland. Trump also said he had "no timeline" for doing so, however.

Alarm bells have been ringing in Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of Greenland, given that Trump's remarks follow Washington's major military operation in Venezuela.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the joint statement from European leaders and urged the U.S. "to seek a respectful dialogue" through the appropriate diplomatic channels.

"Our country is not something that can be annexed or taken over because you feel like it," Nielsen said Tuesday in a Facebook post, according to a Google translation.

"This support is important in a situation where fundamental international principles are being challenged. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for this support," he continued. 

"I must again urge the United States to seek a respectful dialogue through the correct diplomatic and political channels and the use of already existing forums, building on agreements that already exist with the United States. The dialogue must be conducted with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity."

Denmark's Frederiksen had previously warned that an American takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.

"I believe that the U.S. president should be taken seriously when he says that he wants Greenland," Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday, according to a CNBC translation.

"But I also want to make it clear, that if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War," she added.

Speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro before European leaders published their joint statement, European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said the European Union stands together with Denmark over ongoing Greenland tensions. 

"I agree with Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen, when she said that if things will develop up to such a case that Americans will take some actions against Greenland, it will be the end of trans-Atlantic partnership," Kubilius said Tuesday.

"So, that is very serious, and I hope that Americans will take also their actions in a serious way. And from that point of view really, our position is very clear," he added.

European leaders are gathering in Paris on Tuesday as they attempt to revive interest in a peaceful settlement to the war in Ukraine, just as Washington and the world's focus has moved on to the Venezuela crisis.

The U.S.' capture and arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and their subsequent transfer to the U.S. on criminal charges has garnered global media attention, increasing the risk that Washington's interest in securing a Ukraine peace deal could wane. 

European officials are keen to revive the momentum seen in pre-Christmas talks between the U.S. and its Ukrainian and Russian counterparts, which were aimed at securing an agreement around a 20-point peace plan to end almost four years of fighting. 

The so-called "Coalition of the Willing" — a group of countries that say they're willing to provide post-war security guarantees and peacekeeping forces to Ukraine — is set to meet in the French capital to discuss the elements of the peace plan that have been agreed so far, as well as the remaining stumbling blocks to a deal, namely, security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial concessions demanded by Moscow.

Russia rejects the idea of European nations providing security guarantees for Kyiv, or deploying peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, and wants Ukraine to cede its eastern Donbas region to Moscow. Ukraine has said it's willing to drop its NATO membership ambitions but needs guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. 

There was already widespread concern in Europe that U.S. President Donald Trump could lose interest in Ukraine, and the pursuit of a peace deal, given his mercurial nature and previous seesawing on the war's endgame, specifically regarding whether Ukraine can expect to come out of the war with its territorial integrity intact. 

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner arrived at the Elysee Palace for the talks on Tuesday, which will also include European leaders, top European Commission officials and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is reportedly not attending due to the crisis in Venezuela. 

Commenting on the gathering in Paris, Emily Thornberry, chair of the U.K. Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told CNBC that American involvement remains vital. 

"The meeting today is supposed to be about the future of Ukraine, which is incredibly important, and we do need to have American security guarantees because what we don't want is for there to be a peace which only lasts for a few months and when we're not looking anymore, the Russians walk into Ukraine and take over," she told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"The only way we're going to get a just and lasting peace is for the Americans to be involved. We're not asking for boots on the ground, we're asking for a security guarantee that means something," she added. 

Analysts have warned that Trump's capture of Maduro does not bode well for Ukraine, not only because it's a significant distraction for Washington, but because it sends a message to Moscow that the removal of a rival national leader, accused of criminality, is permitted — and particularly if that leader is deemed to be within a superpower's geopolitical "sphere of influence." 

Moscow frequently describes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a "criminal," without presenting evidence to back up its accusations.

Greenland's prime minister on Monday sought to downplay the prospect of an imminent U.S. takeover attempt, following renewed interest in the mineral-rich Arctic island by President Donald Trump.

Speaking at a news conference shortly after Trump's military operation in Venezuela over the weekend, Greenland's Jens Frederik Nielsen dismissed concerns that something similar could happen to the self-governing Danish territory.

"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland," Greenland's Nielsen said Monday at a press conference.

"Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela," he added, according to a CNBC translation.

"We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years. If we look at the whole picture, we can understand that some people are concerned," Nielsen said.

"We want to create and re-establish the cooperation we have previously had with the United States, especially the good cooperation we have had."

European political leaders have rallied around Greenland and Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of the self-governing island, since Trump repeated his ambitions in the wake of Washington's intervention in Venezuela. 

Speaking to NBC News on Monday evening, Trump said he was "very serious" with his intent to acquire Greenland but conceded he had "no timeline" for doing so.

The U.S. president, who has long advocated for control over the island, said on Sunday on Air Force One that "we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security."

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, meanwhile, has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. 

"I believe that the U.S. president should be taken seriously when he says that he wants Greenland," Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday, according to a CNBC translation.

"But I also want to make it clear, that if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War," she added.

Copenhagen has sought to improve ties with Greenland in recent months, pledging to boost spending on health care and infrastructure, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.

Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a large majority support independence from Denmark.

Semiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. 

South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 16.3% higher this year. 

Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.

In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.

"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips," Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.

"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models."

This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.

Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.

The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.

Intel shares are up 7.6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.

Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise 15.2% this year. 

Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. 

"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027," with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit "from the upcoming DRAM super cycle."

Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. 

"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure," Barringer said.

"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand."

Following the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to the removal of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, AI-generated videos purporting to show Venezuelan citizens celebrating in the streets have gone viral on social media.

These artificial intelligence clips, depicting rejoicing crowds, have amassed millions of views across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram and X. 

One of the earliest and most widely shared clips on X was posted by an account named "Wall Street Apes," which has over 1 million followers on the platform. 

The post depicts a series of Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy and thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for removing Maduro. 

The video has since been flagged by a community note, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature on X that allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading. The note read: "This video is AI generated and is currently being presented as a factual statement intended to mislead people."

The clip has been viewed over 5.6 million times and reshared by at least 38,000 accounts, including by business mogul Elon Musk, before he eventually removed the repost. 

CNBC was unable to confirm the origin of the video, though fact-checkers at BBC and AFP said the earliest known version of the clip appeared on the TikTok account @curiousmindusa, which regularly posts AI-generated content.

Even before such videos appeared, AI-generated images showing Maduro in U.S. custody were circulating prior to the Trump administration releasing an authentic image of the captured leader. 

The deposed Venezuelan president was captured on Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. forces conducted airstrikes and a ground raid, an operation that has dominated global headlines at the start of the new year. 

Along with the AI-generated videos, the AFP's fact-check team also flagged a number of examples of misleading content about Maduro's ousting, including footage of celebrations in Chile falsely presented as scenes from Venezuela. 

Misinformation from major news events is not new. Similar false or misleading content has circulated during the Israeli-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. 

However, the massive reach and realism of AI-generated content related to recent developments in Venezuela are stark examples of how AI is advancing as a tool for misinformation. 

Platforms such as Sora and Midjourney have made it easier than ever to quickly generate hyper-realistic video and pass it off as genuine in the chaos of fast-breaking events. The creators of that content often seek to amplify certain political narratives or sow confusion among global audiences.

Last year, AI-generated videos of women complaining about losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a government shutdown also went viral. One such AI-generated video fooled Fox News, which presented it as real in an article that was later removed.

In light of these trends, social media companies have faced growing pressure to step up efforts to label potentially misleading AI content.

Last year, India's government proposed a law requiring such labeling, while Spain approved fines of up to 35 million euros for unlabeled AI materials.

To address growing concerns, major platforms, including TikTok and Meta, have rolled out AI detection and labeling tools, though the results appear mixed.

CNBC was able to identify some videos on TikTok presented as celebrations in Venezuela that were labeled as AI-generated. 

In the case of X, the platform has relied mostly on community notes for content labeling, a system critics say often reacts too slowly to prevent AI misinformation from spreading before being identified.

Adam Mosseri, who oversees Instagram and Threads, acknowledged the challenge facing social media in a recent post. "All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality," he said.

"There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media," he added.

A Chinese AI chatbot embedded inside the country's most widely used app briefly went off the rails, snapping at a user.

Tencent's AI assistant, Yuanbao, which is built into WeChat — China's dominant super app used daily by tens of millions of people — called a user's coding request "stupid" and told them to "get lost," according to screenshots shared on Chinese social media platform RedNote.

The incident surfaced on Friday after a user identified only by the handle "Jianghan" posted screenshots of their interaction with the chatbot on RedNote. Jianghan had been using Yuanbao to debug and modify a piece of code when the AI suddenly began responding with hostile messages.

In one exchange, the chatbot dismissed the request as "stupid" and told the user to "get lost." It said: "If you want an emoji feature, go use a plugin yourself."

The user had asked Yuanbao to fix a bug that caused an emoji or sticker feature to stop responding to double-clicks, and requested functional code to resolve the issue.

Tencent's YuanBao later responded directly under the user's post, apologising for what it described as a "negative experience." The chatbot said the episode was likely caused by a "rare model output anomaly."

Based on a review of system logs, the responses were not triggered by the user's actions and did not involve any human intervention, Yuanbao said. It added that it had launched an "internal investigation and optimisation process" to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring again.

The original RedNote post by Jianghan has since been deleted. Screenshots of the exchange continue to circulate on RedNote, as seen by Business Insider on Tuesday.

The incident comes as Chinese regulators step up scrutiny of AI systems.

China released draft measures last week aimed at governing "human-like" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions.

In a statement, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Beijing encourages innovation in "human-like" AI, but will put guardrails in place to "prevent abuse and loss of control."

Wei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider that the draft measures send a signal that Beijing wants to speed up the development of human-like AI interactions, while keeping them regulated and socially acceptable.

China's AI industry has continued to move at a rapid pace since the start of 2026.

Last week, DeepSeek, one of the country's most closely watched AI startups, published research outlining a new training approach intended to make large models easier to scale. Analysts told Business Insider the technique, known as "Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections," or mHC, stood out as a "breakthrough" in model design.

The South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that DeepSeek has updated the interface of its flagship chatbot model, introducing an enhanced "thinking" mode.

The updates have fuelled expectations that the startup could be laying the groundwork for the release of its next major model.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a "significant increase" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.

The Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.

A share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.

Russia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.

The push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.

In November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.

In the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.

Putin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.

At the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.

Oil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.

Developments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.

"Big Short" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil "just became less important" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and "reduce Russia's income and power."

That view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.

"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market," wrote Herbst on Monday.

"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy," he added.

Venezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.

Monday - Friday: 12:00 - 13:00 SIN/HK  |  0600 - 07:00 CET

Widespread anti-government protests have roiled Iran for over a week, forcing its leaders to weigh options to quell the unrest as U.S. President Donald Trump raised the threat of an intervention. 

The spreading unrest, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, is fueled by growing frustration with a long-running economic crisis in Iran and has turned increasingly violent in recent days. At least 29 people have been killed and more than 1,200 arrested, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency on Tuesday. The U.S.-registered nonprofit relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting.

The anti-regime demonstrations have spread to over 250 locations across 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the group.  

Tehran sought to quell the protests, with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Saturday that "rioters must be put in their place," a remark widely interpreted as a signal for security forces to end the demonstrations.  

Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a more conciliatory tone, urging dialogue and promising economic reforms in bid to placate demonstrators demanding political change, action on corruption and relief from rising living costs. 

The promises included provision of a monthly stipend of 10 million rials ($7) per person  in non-cashable electronic credit for use at selected grocery stores, according to Reuters, citing the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Officials also pledged to overhaul the country's foreign exchange subsidies system to bring direct support for consumers, shifting away from subsidizing importers, which have long been criticized as vulnerable to corruption.  

Still, the public unrest has continued, expanding from economic grievances to broader frustration with the regime, with some protestors chanting "Death to the dictator," a reference to Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over the state. 

The unrest has revived concerns about possible American intervention.  

In a social media post last Friday, Trump vowed that the U.S. would defend the protestors if they were attacked, warning that Washington was "locked and loaded and ready to go" if Iranian authorities used violence against peaceful demonstrations.

The warning carried added weight after U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and brought him to New York to face trial this week. 

On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that Iranian authorities would be "hit very hard" if more protesters died. "We're watching it very closely. If they start kiling people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump said. 

Analysts at research firm BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said Iran's leadership may now be more cautious about the use of force against protestors, noting that Trump had bombed Iran's nuclear facilities in support of Israeli strikes in June last year.

"We see heightened risks of U.S. action against Iran in early 2026 if protests escalate," the analysts said. 

Reuters cited one unnamed Iranian official as saying that there were concerns that Iran could be "the next victim of Trump's aggressive foreign policy."  

Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018, an agreement that limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The country has also reeled from tightening sanctions following a 12-day war with Israel, its longtime regional rival backed by the U.S.  

The rial, Iran's official currency, collapsed in December, falling to a record low of around 1.45 million rials per U.S. dollar at the end of 2025, while inflation reached 42.5%. 

The long-running economic crisis in Iran could pose greater risks to the regime than the prospect of a U.S. intervention, David Roche, veteran investor and strategist with Quantum Strategy, told CNBC on Monday.

"[Iran] is not gonna fall because of the intervention by the United States," Roach said, citing the geographic and political constraints. Instead, he said sustained protests combined with worsening domestic economic conditions would pose a greater risk.

He added that the regime will probably outlast this particular round of protests, but "they don't have any tools to address Iran's economic problems."

The Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.

Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.

The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called "Gang of Eight" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would "run" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela "a decisive and justified action," rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.

"We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country," Johnson said. 

"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief," Johnson said. 

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.

"The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying," Schumer said. "I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries."

Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. 

Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. 

The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. 

"There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war," said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. "No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that." 

The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. 

Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. 

"This was a law enforcement operation," Mast said. "This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army." 

Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to "defend the homeland."

The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the "Gang of Eight," but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. 

"President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)," the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    

"The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest," they said.

The Department of Homeland Security singled out Hilton on X, saying a hotel in Minnesota canceled reservations belonging to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

According to a screenshot shared by DHS on Monday, a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, south of Minneapolis, said it was "not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property."

"If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation," the screenshot said.

Hilton said it doesn't own or operate the hotel. The company's shares were down nearly 2.5% on Monday. 

"This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values," Hilton said in a statement to Business Insider. "We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies."

"Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination," the statement said.

Everpeak Hospitality, the owner of the hotel, said in a statement Tuesday that the incident was "inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all."

"We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated," the statement said. "We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted."

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Hilton's largest known shareholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which respectively own 10.6% and 8.5% of its common stock, according to the company's 2025 proxy statement.

Hilton, like other global hotel chains, does not own most Hilton-branded hotels.

Instead, most of its hotels are franchised — they're owned and operated independently or owned by a third party and operated by Hilton.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered above $91,000 per token on Tuesday as recent momentum sparked optimism that the brutal fourth quarter sell-off may be behind it.

'We believe with reasonable confidence that Bitcoin and broader digital asset markets have bottomed," analyst Gautam Chhugani and his team said in a note on Tuesday, pointing to $80,000 in late November as the bottom.

Concerns that the October high north of $126,000 marked the peak in a historical four-year cycle for the token are overstated, Bernstein said, as the industry goes through a "digital assets revolution" that extends the bull run.

"As we have highlighted earlier, we believe the market concern on the 4-year cycle pattern is unwarranted in the current market context, where institutional demand is driving adoption," the analysts said.

Bernstein maintained its forecast that the token will hit $150,000 in 2026 and $200,000 in 2027.

Chhugani points out that despite bitcoin's 6% decline in 2025, the year was positive for crypto-related stocks and IPOs.

Looking ahead, a tokenization "supercycle" led by highfliers Robinhood (HOOD), Coinbase (COIN), Figure (FIGR), and Circle (CRCL) will continue to drive institutional adoption and lift the crypto sector.

Bitcoin prices have rebounded to start 2026 after trading in a tight range in recent weeks following sell-offs in the fourth quarter of last year.

Forced liquidations and selling by long-term holders pushed prices down as much as 35% from their October highs.

On Sunday, 10X Research noted technical indicators signaled "Bitcoin has entered a bullish trend."

The cryptocurrency ended December down for a third consecutive month, a pattern seen only 15 times historically, often setting up the token for January gains.

“There is a good opportunity for a tactical rally,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital assets at Fundstrat, on Monday night.

Farrell points to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion and a drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA), similar to the US government's checking account, as positive signs for bitcoin.

“We have liquidity improving, flows improving, and we've finally seen a couple of days of outperformance versus equities,” said Farrell.

The strategist sees a scenario where bitcoin could test the $105K–106K level, though his base case still calls for a significant drawdown in the first half of this year before a rally into the end of 2026.

Riot Platforms (RIOT), a publicly listed bitcoin mining company that develops and operates large-scale data centers, stepped up its bitcoin selling at year-end, offloading 1,818 BTC ($161.6 million) and 383 BTC ($37 million) in November. The sales reduced Riot's bitcoin balance to 18,005 BTC by the end of 2025.

While bitcoin miner sales of coins can occur for various reasons, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, suggested that funding for the company's AI build-out could be at play. The amount sold, he noted, is “roughly the entire capex Riot has guided for the first 112 MW core/shell build at Corsicana, targeting completion in Q1 2027. In other words, one winter of BTC sales equals funding Phase 1 of the AI data center pivot.”

Sigel added that the AI trade and bitcoin are increasingly linked, arguing that miners have been among the largest marginal sellers of BTC as they fund AI related capex, especially when credit conditions tighten. It could be one of many reasons for bitcoin's decline during 2025.

Riot shares are lower by 2% on Tuesday alongside a 1.2% retreat in the price of bitcoin to $92,500.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

 

Blockchain technology, a decentralised ledger system protected by encryption, is becoming a major influence in the art world. It solves long-standing problems, including fraud, documenting the history of an artwork, and fairly distributing artists' income. 

A panel discussion at Art Basel's annual Conversations series in Basel, led by journalist Tim Schneider, brought together artist Simon Denny, Verisart CEO Robert Norton, and TRANSFER founder Kelani Nichole to explore the practical and artistic uses of blockchain. 

This event shows how Art Basel is encouraging conversations about how to use crypto in art, which is similar to how blockchain is changing the world by making transactions safer and more open and by creating new types of digital value. 

In addition to these insights, academic research shows how blockchain can help enforce resale royalties (known as droit de suite) and make it easier for people in the EU, US, Australia, and China to create and trade art. 

The NFT market grew to $4 billion in monthly sales during the pandemic, with 80% of those purchases made by retail consumers. This shows blockchain's capacity to change things, but it won't be easy. This article examines these changes from a research perspective, drawing on expert perspectives and scholarly analysis to show how blockchain is transforming the art world.

One of the biggest problems in the art market is determining whether a piece of art is genuine and where it came from, especially if the artist is no longer alive. The Fine Arts Expert Institute in Geneva released a 2014 report stating that more than half of the works of art they examined were either fake or misattributed. 

Blockchain solves this problem by keeping a decentralised, unchangeable record of transactions on millions of computers. This stops hacking or corruption from happening in one place. This broken-up structure keeps data safe and unchangeable, and it uses timestamps and cryptographic signatures to track who owns what.

Experts stress the practical applications of blockchain at Art Basel's crypto-focused events. Robert Norton, the founder and CEO of Verisart, a platform that verifies art on the blockchain, said during the panel, “When it comes to selling art, two things are important…” Is the art authentic, and do I have the right to sell it to you?

 This demonstrates that blockchain not only verifies the authenticity of works of art but also confirms that sellers have the right to sell them, making the marketplace safer and more trustworthy. 

Scholarly studies support this, stating that blockchain's ability to trace the origins of items reduces the risk of forgeries common in traditional marketplaces, where uncertain ownership histories can lead to disputes. 

Blockchain builds confidence by putting transaction information in a ledger that can't be changed. This might make the art market less secretive and encourage more collectors who are worried about fraud to get involved.

Art Basel's crypto events have shown how blockchain can be used to create new kinds of art and attract a new group of collectors. Digital collectibles are turning art ownership into a game, as shown by projects like CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game where players can buy, breed, and sell virtual cats. 

During the Codex Art Auction, one-of-a-kind CryptoKitties editions sold for as much as USD 140,000. This shows that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are popular as unique digital assets. 

There are also blockchain-inspired works of art, such as French artist Youl's The Last Bitcoin Supper, which sold for almost $3,000 on eBay in 2014, and Plantoids, which are artificial plants that interact with people through cryptocurrency donations. The panellists in Art Basel's Conversations series provided important insights into this change. 

Robert Norton said that those who buy CryptoKitties “don't want to buy traditional art… What they're buying is a new kind of digital collectible.” He said this is because people who don't like traditional art forms are drawn to it. Artist Simon Denny has long been interested in blockchain as both a subject and a medium. 

He is part of a new movement that includes Bitcoin graffiti and works with cryptocurrency themes. However, it is still hard to get these gamified works into traditional galleries because they are similar to Takashi Murakami's infinite editions but are not widely accepted by cultural collectors. 

NFT platforms like OpenSea let creators set royalty terms in smart contracts, which automates 5–10% resale fees and makes it easier for more people to own a piece of art by enabling fractional ownership. The NFT surge during the pandemic, when 80% of transactions were made by regular customers, shows how blockchain could help the art world expand beyond elite circles.

Blockchain's smart contracts are changing the way resale royalties work by automating payments to artists on secondary sales and fixing problems in traditional markets. In the EU, Directive 2001/84/EC requires royalties, and in one year, it gave artists €10.1 million. 

The Copyright Agency and other groups have made $11 million under Australia's Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009. 

On the other hand, the US doesn't have any federal laws, and California's Act is currently under review by the courts. According to the 2020 Copyright Law Amendment, China's regulated strategy focuses on digital collectibles and limits speculative trading to lower financial risks.

 At Art Basel events, people talk about how well blockchain works in this field. Smart contracts ensure artists receive their fair share of sales (for example, 2.5% on OpenSea) by tracking transactions in a way that can't be altered. 

However, from 2023, platforms have made them optional. This technology makes things more open and secure by eliminating middlemen and enabling the enforcement of rules worldwide, even when laws differ across jurisdictions. 

Experts at Art Basel and elsewhere point out the bigger picture: the “code is law” idea of blockchain makes distribution easier, but it needs consistent rules to address legal problems.

Blockchain is making art more accessible by eliminating barriers to entry. This lets artists and purchasers from all around the world interact without traditional gatekeepers. NFT markets let people trade directly. 

For example, China's digital Dunhuang collections promote cultural heritage while following stringent rules. Tokenisation enables fractional ownership, making high-value art accessible to smaller investors and helping make the global art scene more open to everyone.

The Bitcoin panels at Art Basel criticise how this change has made things more like products. Simon Denny said, “A lot of the interest in art and blockchain seems to come from people who aren't really interested in art.” They genuinely just want to find a new way to make money. “When you buy a piece of art, you're not just clicking to buy it; you're falling in love with it,” Kelani Nichole said.

“This is a different kind of transaction; it's based on relationships,” they said, cautioning against putting assets first as they do with software companies. 

Research supports these concerns by highlighting privacy issues, the potential for duplicate minting in NFTs, and the risk of money laundering. It also calls for balanced ecosystems that allow for new ideas while still following the rules.

Blockchain has significant potential, but it faces challenges in the art industry. There are concerns due to technical problems, such as relying on “code is law” for enforcement, and regulatory problems, such as China's bans on unregulated NFTs. 

According to the Art Market 2.0 report, experts at Art Basel say the current art market situation is like the internet in 1993, suggesting that early adoption may not yield clear long-term benefits.

Future regulations should ensure that mechanisms for fair royalties and innovation work together, so that markets are ready for digital progress. These talks will help blockchain become more widely used, which might be good for art in a broader cultural sense if Art Basel continues to sponsor crypto events.

What is blockchain's primary benefit in the art market?

Blockchain provides secure, decentralized records for verifying artwork authenticity and provenance, making transactions safer and more transparent.

How do NFTs reshape art collecting?

NFTs enable unique digital ownership, as seen in projects like CryptoKitties, attracting new collectors through gamified, accessible formats.

What role do smart contracts play in resale royalties?

Smart contracts automate royalty distributions on resales, allowing artists to embed percentage fees (e.g., 5-10%) directly into transactions.

How is blockchain democratizing art?

It lowers barriers by facilitating global, intermediary-free trading and fractional ownership, expanding access to diverse creators and buyers.

What challenges does blockchain face in art?

Issues include privacy concerns, legal differences across countries, and a focus on monetization over cultural value, as experts have critiqued.

Ethereum's staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.

This means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.

Queues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.

In one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.

At the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.

Lower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium' — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.

What this means in plain terms is that “staking pressure” is no longer a daily narrative.

When queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.

When queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.

This changes the psychology around the ether trade.

Staking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.

Overall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.

Ethereum's DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.

The network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality. 

Incremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.

That fragmentation matters because Ethereum's strongest bull arguments used to be simple. More usage meant more fees, more burns, and more structural pressure on supply.

The 2021 TVL peak was also a leverage era; a lower TVL today doesn't necessarily mean less usage, just less froth.

In the current regime, however, a meaningful chunk of user activity can happen on layer-2 networks where fees are cheaper and experience is smoother, but the value capture that accrues back to ETH can be less obvious to spot markets at the moment.

"One way to frame it is that Ethereum has lost directional clarity," shared DNTV Research founder Bradley Park in a note to CoinDesk. "If ETH is treated primarily as a trust asset to be staked rather than actively used, it weakens the burn mechanism: less ETH gets burned, issuance continues, and sell-side pressure builds over time."Over the past 30 days, Base has generated significantly more fees than Ethereum itself. That contrast raises a harder question for Ethereum, whether its current trajectory adequately channels usage back into value for ETH," Park added.

That gap between activity and value capture is showing up in prediction markets.

On Polymarket, traders assign just an 11% chance that ETH reaches a new all-time high by March 2026, despite higher active addresses and a still-dominant share of DeFi TVL.

The pricing suggests the market views fragmentation and unconstrained staking supply as limiting factors, with usage alone no longer sufficient to force a challenge of the all-time high.

But that picture could shift quickly if U.S. policy evolves to allow yield-bearing ETH products, a change that would re-open the ‘staking premium' trade.

Cayman Islands-registered Buck Labs has introduced the "BUCK" crypto token, positioning it as a yield-bearing “savings coin” aimed at users seeking returns on dollar-denominated crypto holdings without relying on traditional stablecoins.

The token is backed by shares in Strategy (MSTR) shares, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin with nearly 675,000 BTC on its balance sheet. 

BUCK is initially priced at $1 and is designed to distribute rewards currently targeted at around 7% annually, with returns accruing on a minute-by-minute basis, Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Buck Labs, told CoinDesk. BUCK is not marketed as a stablecoin and does not maintain a hard dollar peg, meaning its price may fluctuate based on market conditions.

Rewards distributed to holders are funded indirectly through the foundation's treasury holdings of Strategy's bitcoin-linked perpetual preferred stock, known as STRC, which pays periodic income to the treasury. Strategy and its chairman Michael Saylor are not affiliated with Buck and do not sponsor or endorse the token.

“Every healthy economy needs both a way to spend and a way to save, which is why Buck introduces the SavingsCoin,” said VanderZanden, who previously held leadership roles at Bird, Lyft and Uber. “Stablecoins have become very good at moving money, but Buck is designed for what happens in between, earning rewards on idle capital.

BUCK is structured as a governance token, with holders allowed to vote on reward distribution and other protocol decisions. The company said the token is intended for non-U.S. users initially and is not being offered as a security.

VanderZanden said the product is aimed at users who want predictable crypto-based returns without actively trading. “People want a simple way to earn rewards in crypto without becoming speculators,” he said. “Buck is designed to make saving in crypto more intuitive.”

Buck Labs said the product is designed to complement, rather than replace, existing stablecoins by offering a savings-focused alternative for longer-term holdings.

Morgan Stanley has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot bitcoin BTC$93,235.03 exchange-traded fund (ETF) and solana trust, pushing its digital assets ambitions further.  

The BTC product, called the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, is structured as an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of bitcoin, net of fees and expenses, according to a Form S-1 submitted on Jan. 6. If approved, the fund's shares are expected to list on a national securities exchange under a ticker symbol that has not yet been disclosed.

The bitcoin trust is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and will hold bitcoin directly rather than using derivatives or leverage. Its net asset value will be calculated daily using a designated bitcoin pricing benchmark derived from activity on major spot exchanges. The fund will be passive and will not attempt to trade bitcoin based on market conditions.

Shares will be created and redeemed only in large blocks by authorized participants, either in cash or in kind. Cash transactions will be executed through third-party bitcoin counterparties selected by the sponsor. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares on the secondary market through brokerage accounts.

Morgan Stanley's filing follows the rapid expansion of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market over the past two years. SoSoValue data shows these now have $123 billion in total net assets, equivalent to 6.57% of bitcoin's total market capitalization. Since the start of the year, net inflows to these products have topped $1.1 billion.

Morgan Stanley has also filed a Form S-1 with the SEC for the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, meant to track the price of solana. These funds, as data shows, have grown to more than $1 billion in total net assets, following a total cumulative net inflow of nearly $800 million.

The filings show Morgan Stanley shifting from simply distributing third-party crypto products to building its own in-house vehicles, signaling a deeper, higher-conviction commitment to digital assets.

This pivot is likely driven by the robust economics of the ETF and trust business, underscored by the substantial fee revenue traditional finance firms have generated from spot bitcoin products in a short period. For example, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETFs became the firm's top revenue source in November of last year, according to BlackRock Brazil's director of business development, Cristiano Castro, with allocations nearing $100 billion.

Unlike asset managers such as BlackRock, Morgan Stanley operates a massive wealth management arm with thousands of advisors that opened crypto access to clients in October last year. By leveraging its own ETFs, the bank can vertically integrate these products into its client portfolios, keeping management fees in-house rather than paying them to competitors.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

As bitcoin BTC$93.235,03 clings to recent gains above $93,000, capital shifts from memecoins to utility tokens, with assets supposedly linked to artificial intelligence (AI) leading the charge.

CoinDesk's Culture and Entertainment Select Index, Metaverse Select Index, 10 Capped ex-Bitcoin Index, and the DeFi Select Index have gained over 4% each over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Meme Select Index was little-changed to negative, pausing its recent rally.

It shows capital rotating into substance, or established sub-sectors with utility, such as DeFi and metaverse, rather than speculative, jokey cryptocurrencies. That's a strong signal for the sustainability of crypto's recent bounce.

Among individual tokens, AI-linked coins have done well in the past 24 hours. For instance, Render Network's RENDER climbed 20%, becoming the best performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Render is a leading decentralized GPU compute platform for applications ranging from 3D rendering to machine learning and generative AI. Smaller AI tokens such as Virtuals Protocol's VIRTUAL token have risen over 6%

Layer-1 blockchain Sui's native coin, SUI$1,8179, has rallied over 15% on expectations of privacy tech, rivalling gains in Provenance Blockchain's HASH token. Payments-focused XRP jumped 10% to its highest in nearly two months, while Solana's sol SOL$137,66 remains locked in a multimonth range despite the recent bounce.

These moves are consistent with the renewed optimism for AI and high-beta tech stocks on Wall Street.

Antonio Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com, said that increased geopolitical tensions and impending economic data, particularly Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, warrant attention.

"Markets remain on alert amid rising geopolitical tensions following the U.S. offensive against Venezuela, a factor that has heightened perceptions of systemic risk and curbed enthusiasm for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies," he noted, adding that a weak payrolls figure could influence the Fed's monetary policy and investor risk appetite.

Other analysts said that continued gains in the crypto market depend on bitcoin ETF inflows, which have begun 2026 on a positive note, accumulating over $1 billion in the first two trading days. These inflows need to continue to keep the market bid.

In traditional markets, futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 were little changed, suggesting a cautious open after Monday's gain. The Nasdaq index has been consolidating in a narrowing price range (see Technical Analysis section). The direction in which it is eventually resolves will likely determine the next move and influence the crypto market accordingly. Stay alert!

When investors talk about building a crypto position, they rarely mean one coin only. The usual move is to anchor a portfolio with a leader, then add a smaller name with more room to grow. Bitcoin is still the most common anchor. But as the market looks ahead to 2026, more people are scanning for a new crypto that can sit next to BTC, not replace it.

That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing up. It is still priced under $0.1, it has a clear product roadmap, and its token sale has already built a large holder base. This is why some market commentators suggest MUTM is becoming a next pick in the potential best crypto to buy now.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $91,100 with a market cap near $1.80T. A key resistance zone sits at $100,000, which is a major psychological and technical level. Many traders expect BTC to test that zone again as market sentiment improves.

BTC remains the top crypto for liquidity and long-term trust. It is the asset many investors use as a base layer. The tradeoff is simple. BTC is already massive. That size can make the next multi-x move harder to achieve quickly, even in a bullish phase.

A “not attractive” BTC prediction is not a crash call. It is the idea that upside may be steady rather than explosive from here. Some analysts believe a 1.2x to 1.4x move is a more realistic near-term range than a sudden 3x. A 1.3x move from $91,100 would imply around $118,430. That is still a strong gain. It is just not the type of return that smaller tokens can sometimes deliver when they are early in their cycle.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a non custodial lending and borrowing protocol. The goal is to let users supply assets, borrow under clear rules, and manage collateral without relying on a centralized operator. The project describes a dual-market design so it can support different lending needs as adoption grows.

This matters because lending protocols are not just tokens. They are systems. A system becomes valuable when people use it repeatedly. Lending and borrowing are naturally repeated actions. Users supply, borrow, repay, and adjust positions over time.

Mutuum Finance has said V1 is being prepared for Sepolia testnet first, then finalized for mainnet, with timing described as coming shortly. The project lists core V1 components as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. It has also said the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral are expected to include ETH and USDT. That V1 step matters because it shifts the project from build mode into trackable readiness. Market watchers stop guessing and start watching execution.

Current presale figures show Mutuum Finance moving into later-stage distribution. Funding has reached $19.6M, supported by around 18,700 holders and roughly 822M MUTM already sold. 

MUTM is priced at $0.04 in presale Phase 7. Since the sale began in early 2025 at $0.01 in Phase 1, the price has climbed 300% through staged increases. Mutuum Finance also references an official launch price of $0.06.

The staged format matters because it changes behavior. Each stage has a set allocation. When one stage sells out, the next stage starts at a higher price. That means later entry points come with fewer tokens per dollar, and it is one reason late phases often feel more competitive.

This is also crucial for investor trust because the sale shows a clear, trackable progression instead of a flat price with unclear demand signals. A growing holder base spread across stages can suggest broader participation, not just a small cluster of wallets. 

The steady climb from stage to stage also acts as a public record of follow-through, since the price only moves higher when prior allocations are absorbed. In plain terms, it is easier for investors to see where the project stands, how far distribution has advanced, and how much of the sale supply has already moved into circulation.

Security is not a side story for lending protocols. It is the base layer of trust, because the system touches collateral, interest flows, and liquidations. Mutuum Finance states that Halborn Security completed an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol. It also cites a CertiK token scan score of 90/100 and references a $50k bug bounty.

The Halborn audit matters because audits focus on the areas that can break a lending system. That includes liquidation logic, rate calculations, and edge cases that happen during fast market moves. It also includes unusual token behavior that can cause accounting errors. Independent review helps reduce uncertainty around whether the core logic can hold up once liquidity grows.

For investors, this is crucial because it separates “concept” from “checked code.” It does not guarantee that nothing can go wrong, but it is one of the strongest readiness signals a developing DeFi crypto project can show before broader usage.

This is also why some market commentators say projects with visible audits tend to get added to watchlists more often. It is easier to treat them seriously when there is public proof of review and testing pressure.

The common approach is simple. BTC is the stability layer. A smaller token is the upside layer. With $500, an investor could place the full amount into BTC and expect slower, steadier returns. Or they could split it, keeping BTC as the base and adding a smaller position in a new cryptocurrency that has clearer early-cycle pricing.

At $0.04, a $500 allocation equals 12,500 MUTM. If MUTM trades at the project's referenced post-launch price of $0.40, that would imply a value of $5000. That is a benchmark scenario.

The reason MUTM gets paired with BTC is that the two assets sit in different phases. BTC is mature and large. MUTM is early and still building toward V1. In crypto investing terms, that pairing gives exposure to both long-term trust and early-stage repricing potential.

Something went wrong

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Ateev Bhandari

Jan 6 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is seeking regulatory approval to launch exchange-traded funds tied to the price ​of cryptocurrency tokens, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and ‌Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the first such move by a big U.S. bank.

The bank is looking to ‌launch ETFs tied to the price of cryptocurrencies bitcoin and solana, according to the filings, aiming to deepen its presence in the cryptocurrency space.

Regulatory clarity under U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged mainstream finance companies to embrace digital assets, which were ⁠once considered merely speculative instruments.

In ‌December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also allowed banks to act as intermediaries on crypto transactions, narrowing the ‍gap between the traditional sector and digital assets.

Several investors prefer holding crypto via ETFs, which provide greater liquidity and security, and simplified regulatory compliance compared to managing the underlying asset ​directly.

"It's interesting to see Morgan Stanley move into a commoditized market, and I ‌suspect that means they want to move clients that invest in bitcoin into their ETFs which could give them a fast start despite their late entrance," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar.

"A bank entering the crypto ETF market adds legitimacy to it, and others could follow."

In the two years since the SEC ⁠approved the first U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, a ​wide array of financial institutions - mostly asset managers - ​have stepped up to issue such funds.

U.S. banks, which have mostly only acted as custodians of client investments, are looking to evolve ‍from cautious facilitators to ⁠active advisers.

In October, Morgan Stanley expanded access to crypto investments to include all clients and types of accounts, according to media reports.

Bank of America ⁠followed suit, allowing its wealth advisers to recommend allocations to crypto in client portfolios from January, ‌without any asset threshold.

Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine chairman Tom Lee has begun the new year with what may be his most bullish outlook yet, predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb as high as $250,000 in 2026 and that Ethereum (ETH) could post similarly dramatic gains.

Speaking in recent CNBC interviews  and shareholder communications, Lee argued that traditional crypto market cycles may be breaking down, a shift he believes could unlock extraordinary upside for Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Lee said Bitcoin's next major rally could defy its long-established four-year halving cycle, which has historically been followed by steep drawdowns.

“In 2026, if Bitcoin gets to $200,000 or $250,000, it would be breaking the four-year cycle,” Lee said on CNBC's Squawk Box. 

“So that's sort of part of our view.”

Under the classic cycle framework, Lee acknowledged that Bitcoin “should be down this year,” but said recent developments have materially altered the outlook.

“I think there are tailwinds that are building,” he said, adding that leverage in the system was largely reset after a sharp market shock in October.

“Part of it is that we kind of reset leverage on Oct. 10 with that big shock,” Lee said.

He pointed to ongoing institutional adoption, Wall Street's continued development of blockchain-based products, and what he described as growing U.S. government support as key drivers that could propel Bitcoin higher.

Lee also addressed concerns that Bitcoin has lagged gold and silver during recent rallies in precious metals.

“It does look like gold rallies typically lead Bitcoin rallies,” he said. “So I think it's been healthy for gold to rally… with monetary easing, those are things that are supportive of crypto to follow.”

In addition, Lee said certain macro indicators have historically aligned with Bitcoin rallies, even if the relationships are not widely understood.

“For whatever hard-to-explain reason, we found that the copper-to-gold price ratio, when that rises, coincides with Bitcoin rallying,” he said.

“And we also found that the ISM, as it moves from below 50 to its peak, has coincided with Bitcoin entering its sort of rally stage.”

Lee has been equally bullish on Ethereum, arguing that its performance relative to Bitcoin could ultimately drive substantial upside.

“This is why we think the price ratio of Ethereum to Bitcoin is really the most important to watch,” Lee said in a recent message  to Bitmine shareholders.

Under Bitmine's base-case scenario of Bitcoin reaching $250,000, Lee outlined a range of potential Ethereum outcomes depending on how that ratio evolves.

“If Bitcoin gets to $250,000, which is our view, and Ethereum trades at its eight-year average ratio, that's $12,000 Ethereum,” he said. “If it gets to the 2021 high, that's $22,000 Ethereum.”

Lee said he bases his long-term conviction on Ethereum's role in what he sees as the future financial system.

“We believe Ethereum is the future of finance,” he said. “It's going to be a payment rail.”

In more aggressive scenarios, Lee suggested Ethereum's valuation could climb far higher.

“If Bitcoin gets to a million, that would value ETH at $250,000,” he said.

Lee's latest forecasts have drawn sharp criticism, most notably from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff.

Schiff dismissed Lee's argument that rising gold prices are bullish for Bitcoin, arguing that the two assets have historically competed rather than moved together.

“CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin,” Schiff wrote on X .

“But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the ‘better' inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.”

CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill @fundstrat  claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the “better” inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.

— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 5, 2026 



In a separate post, Schiff argued that Bitcoin's recent rebound reflected speculative momentum rather than improving fundamentals.

“Bitcoin has been caught up in the Venezuela-inspired rally. It's back above $94,500,” he wrote.

“Don't believe the hype. Just take advantage of the rally to sell and use the proceeds to buy real gold instead.”

Despite the criticism, Lee has reiterated that recent strength in precious metals supports a constructive outlook for digital assets.

Pointing to silver's sharp gains over the past month and gold's strong rise over the past year, Lee questioned whether skepticism toward crypto remains justified.

“If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” he wrote.

The comments prompted further backlash on X, where some users cited Lee's previous forecasts.

One urged him to “stick to equities,” while another said Lee had previously argued Bitcoin and Ethereum would not fall further shortly before prices declined.

The People's Bank of China has officially transitioned its central bank digital currency (e-CNY) into a new era of “digital deposit money” as of January 1, 2026. Under an ambitious new action plan, the central bank has authorized ten major commercial institutions—including Tencent's WeBank and Alibaba-affiliated MYbank—to begin paying interest on verified digital yuan balances. This policy shift represents a fundamental departure from the original 2014 vision of the e-CNY as a purely digital substitute for physical cash, which traditionally carries no yield. By allowing banks to offer an annual interest rate of approximately 0.05% on digital wallet holdings, the PBOC aims to revive stagnant adoption rates and deepen the integration of the digital yuan into the nation's formal asset-liability management systems. This move makes China the first major global economy to position its CBDC as a competitive, interest-bearing alternative to traditional savings accounts.

The new framework formally reclassifies digital yuan balances from “M0” (physical currency) to “M1” deposit-like liabilities, a technical shift with profound implications for the Chinese banking sector. For the first time, e-CNY balances held in real-name verified wallets will be treated as commercial bank liabilities, meaning they are now included in reserve requirement calculations and, most importantly, covered by China's national deposit insurance system. This transition provides a level of financial security for digital yuan holders that was previously reserved for traditional bank accounts, effectively removing the “time value loss” that users suffered when holding non-interest-bearing digital cash. To facilitate this rollout, the ten authorized banks have completed extensive system upgrades to ensure that interest is calculated and credited seamlessly to user wallets, matching the prevailing rates for demand deposits at the country's largest state-owned financial institutions.

By introducing a yield component, the People's Bank of China is making a strategic bid to challenge the dominance of private payment ecosystems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. While these platforms have long controlled the majority of China's cashless transactions, the state-backed digital yuan now offers a unique combination of government-guaranteed security and interest-bearing utility. Beyond domestic retail use, the interest-bearing e-CNY is also being positioned as a foundational tool for the “RMB International Operations Center” in Shanghai. The PBOC intends to leverage this new deposit-like status to attract international trade partners, including upcoming pilots with Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. As the digital yuan becomes a “stress-testable” monetary instrument with clear legal protections and yield potential, China is signaling its intent to lead the global CBDC race, creating a programmable financial infrastructure that bridges the gap between legacy banking and the future of on-chain sovereign settlement.

Colle AI (COLLE), the multichain AI-powered NFT creation platform, announced enhancements to its AI-driven design automation framework, further optimizing how creators build and scale digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. The update strengthens Colle AI's ability to translate creative intent into fully structured, multichain-ready NFTs, reducing manual effort while improving workflow efficiency for artists, studios, and brands operating at scale.

The enhanced automation layer advances how Colle AI assembles visual elements, applies stylistic coherence, prepares metadata, and aligns outputs with chain-specific requirements. By intelligently handling these processes in the background, the platform allows creators to focus on ideation and refinement rather than workflow configuration. This improvement supports faster iteration cycles and enables consistent production of both individual assets and large NFT collections without sacrificing creative flexibility.

While Ethereum (ETH) attempts to turn a crucial level into support, some analysts have shared a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, which could send its price above the $4,000 barrier in the first quarter of 2026.

End-Of-Year Weakness To Ignite Q1 Rally

On Monday, Ethereum broke above the $3,200 barrier for the first time in nearly a month, hitting a four-week high of $3,259. The cryptocurrency has seen a 8.3% surge from the crucial $3,000 level since Friday, consolidating above the $3,100 level over the weekend.

Now, the King of Altcoins is trying to hold the key resistance level and turn it into support. Amid this performance, some market observers shared a potential setup that could lead to a significant rally during the next three months.

In an X post, analyst Niels affirmed that Ethereum's quarterly close in the red is “not as bearish as it looks.” Notably, the altcoin recorded its worst Q4 in six years after closing the quarter with a negative return of 28.28%, according to CoinGlass data.

This marks ETH's first negative Q4 close since 2022, and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019, when it registered a negative return of 28.9%. Nonetheless, Niels highlighted that this opens the door for an “interesting” setup ahead of the altcoin's expected seasonality.

“History tells an interesting story: every single time ETH has finished Q4 in the red, the next Q1 has closed green,” the analyst explained, asserting that “year-end weakness has usually acted as a reset, not a reversal.”

Per the post, the end-of-year leverage flush and sentiment cooling have previously enabled Ethereum to start the new year “from a cleaner base,” which has allowed the altcoin to register quarterly returns of up to 52% in recent years.

“If that pattern holds, Q4 wasn't the warning; it was the setup heading into Q1,” he suggested.

Ethereum Prepares For 30% Breakout

As the price records an 11% weekly surge, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the cryptocurrency is about to face an important zone that has served as resistance for nearly two months.

Since the early November pullback, the largest altcoin by market capitalization has been trading between the $2,700-$3,400 price range, experiencing strong resistance around the $3,000 and $3,200 levels.

Now that the mid-zone of the range has been momentarily reclaimed, ETH must hold its momentum and turn the upper boundary into support. “A reclaim of this level will pump Ethereum towards the $3,800-$4,000 level,” where the next major resistance is located, Ted explained on Monday morning.

On the contrary, a rejection from this resistance zone could send the ETH price toward the $3,000 support, while risking a longer consolidation within its two-month range.

Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez discussed the altcoin's consolidation, pointing to a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on its chart. According to the analyst, Ethereum has been compressing between the pattern's ascending and descending trendlines since November, awaiting a 30% move.

If the price holds its current breakout from the upper boundary, the cryptocurrency could see a rally toward the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, positioning ETH for a retest of the Q3 levels.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,253, a 3.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences slated for February were cancelled, citing significant losses after the NFT market cap dropped by nearly $7B in a year. 

Meanwhile, the meme coin market saw a significant recovery as the wider market turned bullish at the start of 2026. Even though the developments had a positive impact on the Dogecoin price prediction, many meme traders chose DeepSnitch AI, not only for its upside potential but also for its meme-friendly utility. 

Raising $1M amid market turmoil, DeepSnitch AI built up organic hype and sparked multiple 100x projections on the strength of its AI-powered prediction and analytics suite. 

Organizers behind NFT Paris and RWA Paris conferences announced the cancellation of these events with a month's notice, citing market collapse as the primary reason. 

Even though it wasn't stated specifically, these events likely won't be organized in the future, with the company mentioning it's officially closing the chapter on conferences. 

The purchased tickets will be refunded within 15 days.

This may not be surprising as the NFT culture suffered a massive decrease in 2025, with the market cap shrinking from $9B in January 2025 to $2.7B in January 2026. 

At the same time, the meme coin market capitalization recovered by 17% in 30 days, reaching $48B by December 5. This is reflected in the Dogecoin price prediction, despite many traders opting for either newly-graduated meme tokens or high-potential presale projects. 

Judging by the latest Dogecoin price prediction (and solid recent performance), DOGE could provide serious gains in the short term. However, the lack of long-term utility and the coin's already high market cap could limit its upside potential. 

While it has a solid $0.03269 entry that is reminiscent of the prices of most meme coins, DeepSnitch AI is a full-fledged AI project. It's not just the price, though, as the underlying utility also presents a valuable set of tools for meme traders.

By integrating five AI agents into a single analytics and prediction suite, the platform aims to help retail traders make consistent trades. Along with a crypto-centric LLM, DeepSnitch AI also provides actionable analytics and can predict FUD spikes and even sentiment shifts. 

Meme traders, specifically, will love the SnitchScan agent for its ability to scan new tokens for rug pull risks, insider activity, and upside potential. 

All of this provides DeepSnitch AI with staying power and a significant upside potential. This is why it's not a surprise that the project raised over $1M while the rest of the market was in a 3-month corrective period. 

According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE settled in the $0.15 area on December 5. 

The immediate Dogecoin price outlook seems to have improved as the market has confirmed a breakout above $0.15. Analysts point to the RSI turning positive and the 20-day EMA turning up as clear bullish signals.If buyers remain in control, the Dogecoin price prediction could see the original meme coin crossing $0.16 to complete a rally to $0.19. 

On the contrary, the DOGE forecast could also switch back into the bear territory if the price pulls back below $0.13, which could open the door toward a dip to as low as $0.10. 

On December 5, XRP surged by 12% and rose above the $2.30 territory to start a test of the $2.40 resistance, according to CoinMarketCap.For those not confident in the Dogecoin price prediction, XRP may provide a bit more substance. Analysts agree that a rally to the downtrend line could be in play, which means that a massive breakout could happen after a few days. 

Alternatively, the rally could speed up if accumulation pushes the price above this crucial level, allowing XRP to surge past $3 in January. 

As the market recovers in the first weeks of January, the Dogecoin price prediction turned bullish, providing meme traders a way to grow their bags while the hype lasts.However, savvy traders are looking elsewhere and are prioritizing long-term potential and a larger upside.Priced at $0.03269 and raising over $1M, DeepSnitch AI's utility provides real value for traders in the meme sector while also reinforcing a 100x narrative that led to massive levels of hype. Thus, the gains could be immediate and much more substantial than what other affordable alts could realistically offer.



The Dogecoin price prediction is cautiously bullish after DOGE reclaimed the $0.15 level, with analysts targeting a potential move toward $0.19 if buying pressure remains strong.

As NFT market capitalization dropped from roughly $9B to $2.7B year-over-year, speculative capital rotated toward meme coins, helping boost sentiment and short-term price action.

DeepSnitch AI combines meme-friendly appeal with AI-powered analytics and prediction tools, offering higher upside potential and utility beyond traditional meme coins, which helped it surpass $1M during its presale.

Sleep is a conserved behavior across all animals with a nervous system, ranging from cnidarians to humans. Considering the survival risks, why sleep evolved in basal lineages and what essential benefits it provides to the simple nerve net of nocturnal and diurnal invertebrates remain elusive. We used behavioral criteria to empirically define sleep in the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea andromeda and the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Light and homeostasis were the primary drivers of sleep in C. andromeda, which slept at night and napped at midday in both the laboratory and the natural habitat. In contrast, both the circadian clock and homeostatic processes regulated sleep in N. vectensis, which increased sleep at dawn. Similar to humans, C. andromeda, wild-type (WT) and Clock mutant (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis slept about one-third of the day, irrespective of the daily timing and architecture of sleep, and melatonin promoted sleep in accordance with the species-specific chronotype. Notably, sleep deprivation, ultraviolet radiation, and mutagens increased neuronal DNA damage and sleep pressure, while spontaneous and induced sleep facilitated genome stability in both the diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. These results suggest that DNA damage and cellular stress in simple nerve nets may have driven the evolution of sleep.

Sleep is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved behavioral state prevalent across the animal kingdom, ranging from cnidarians to insects and mammals, suggesting that sleep is a Cambrian metazoan adaptation1,2,3,4,5,6. Sleep deprivation (SD) and disturbances are associated with increased risks for health decline in bilaterian animals7,8. The roles of sleep range from cellular repair and energy restoration to synaptic plasticity9,10,11,12. Nevertheless, the evolution of sleep came with major fitness compromises, such as reduced awareness of the environment and vulnerability to predation, and the fundamental conserved cellular functions of sleep remain elusive1,2,13.

Sleep is defined by behavioral criteria and neuronal activity patterns. In most non-mammalian animals, sleep is characterized solely by distinct behavioral criteria, including consolidated periods of behavioral immobility accompanied by an increased arousal threshold in response to external stimuli and species-specific postures1,2,14,15. Sleep is regulated by the circadian process, which determines sleep timing, and by the homeostatic process, which compensates for SD. The presence of sleep and these regulatory processes in basal and derived nocturnal and diurnal species suggests a common evolutionary origin of sleep regulation16,17.

Sleep plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity: it reduces DNA damage, which accumulates during wakefulness in neurons of flies, fish, and mice18,19,20,21. The causes of DNA damage are diverse and include the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the inadvertent action of nuclear enzymes, and neuronal activity20,22,23. The non-dividing and irreplaceable mature excitable neurons may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. This cell type evolutionarily emerged in basal metazoans24 and may require sleep to facilitate cellular maintenance. Indeed, sleep-like behavior has recently been observed in two diurnal cnidarians, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea and Hydra vulgaris (H. vulgaris)3,4, suggesting that the development of simple nerve nets in cnidarians25,26 coincided with the emergence of sleep.

Cnidarians represent one of the most ancient animal lineages possessing neurons, which extend neurites throughout the endodermal and ectodermal layers, and contain conserved neurotransmitters and neuropeptides27,28. The jellyfish Cassiopea, which lives in obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates, exhibits rhythmic daily activity that peaks during the day4. In contrast, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (N. vectensis), which lacks symbiotic eukaryotes, is considered nocturnal29,30. However, sleep architecture has not been empirically defined in Cassiopea, and sleep has not been characterized in N. vectensis. Thus, the mechanisms that drove the evolution of sleep in these model animals are unknown.

To dissect the origin of animal sleep and its core cellular drivers, we defined and analyzed sleep architecture in Cassiopea andromeda (C. andromeda) and N. vectensis. We found that the light/dark cycle and homeostatic pressure are the primary regulators of sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda, whereas the circadian clock and homeostatic drive are the predominant regulators of sleep in the crepuscular (active at dusk) N. vectensis. Notably, the results demonstrated that the capacity of sleep to relieve neuronal DNA damage is an ancestral trait shared by both symbiotic diurnal and non-symbiotic crepuscular cnidarians. We suggest that sleep may have evolved to enable consolidated periods of neural maintenance.

In Cassiopea, a sleep-like state has been characterized by monitoring the rate of pulsation activity of the jellyfish umbrella, which reduces during the night4. To quantify sleep, it is essential to determine the threshold of the pulsation frequency, which can differentiate sleep from wake behavior. An infrared (IR) camera was used to track the simultaneous behavior of multiple C. andromeda during the day and night (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Pulsation events were determined by monitoring the changes in pixel intensity, which reflected expansion and contraction of the C. andromeda bell diameter (Fig. 1b). Consistent with its diurnal nature, locomotor activity consistently reduced during the night in C. andromeda under 12 h light:12 h dark (LD) conditions with a mean pulsation rate of 36.4 ± 1.6 and 31.9 ± 1.4 pulses/min during the day and night, respectively (mean ± SEM; Fig. 1c, d). The constant pulsing behavior31 precluded the use of quiescence to define sleep in C. andromeda. To identify the arousal threshold distinguishing sleep from wake in C. andromeda, we applied a brief light stimulus at night and measured the response latency (Fig. 1e). A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (Fig. 1g, j). We found that C. andromeda, which pulsed fewer than 37 times per minute (Fig. 1f–h) for more than 3 min (Fig. 1i–k) were slower to respond to the stimulus. Thus, this threshold was used to characterize sleep in C. andromeda. Applying this criterion revealed that the average sleep time increased during the night (63.7%) compared to the day (45.3%) under LD in C. andromeda (Fig. 1l, m). Notably, similar to findings in primates and flies32,33, a midday nap was also observed in C. andromeda (Fig. 1l). The daily average sleep time rhythm was 24.2 h (Fig. 1n). However, rhythmic locomotor activity was abolished under constant darkness (DD) and robustly dampened under constant light (LL) conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). Moreover, under forced desynchrony conditions (6 h L:6 h D:6 h L:6 h D, LDLD), the animals showed a 12.1 h rhythm of locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig. 1e–g). These findings showed that sleep is primarily driven by the light/dark cycle in C. andromeda. To determine whether sleep in C. andromeda is regulated by a homeostatic process, we sleep-deprived the animals for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) using computer-controlled alternating repeated water turbulence at night (Supplementary Movie 2). Following SD, C. andromeda displayed sleep rebound, i.e., sleep-deprived animals slept 1.5-fold more than control animals during the day (Fig. 1o, p). In contrast, SD during the active period (ZT5-11) did not induce sleep rebound (Supplementary Fig. 1k, l). These findings show that sleep is regulated by light and homeostatic drive in the diurnal symbiotic C. andromeda.

To generalize the sleep criteria found in the laboratory to Cassiopea's natural habitat, we monitored the pulsation behavior of wild animals (Supplementary Fig. 1 m) during day and night ( ~ 15 h L: ~9 h D) in shallow water adjacent to the seashore of Key Largo, FL. The findings revealed a strong negative association between the size of Cassiopea and their pulsation rate (Fig. 1q). We therefore normalized the average activity according to the size of each group and showed elevated activity during the day at the sea (Fig. 1r and Supplementary Fig. 1n). Notably, the pulsation threshold used to detect sleep under controlled laboratory conditions (37 pulses/min, Fig. 1f–h) closely matched the average daytime pulse rate observed in the lab (36.4 pulses/min, Fig. 1d). Given this similarity, we approximated the sleep threshold in the field by the average daytime pulse rate, adjusted according to the bell diameter, as a proxy to differentiate sleeping and awake animals. Utilizing this model, we found that the sleep architecture of Cassiopea is similar in the laboratory and the sea. In their natural habitat, the animals primarily sleep at night and nap during midday (Fig. 1s). These results enable the quantification of sleep in various sizes of Cassiopea living in the laboratory and in their natural habitat at sea.

Although rhythmic locomotor activity has been described in N. vectensis29,30,34, sleep was not characterized in sea anemones, including N. vectensis. To detect the state of sleep, we used an IR camera and monitored the behavior of 18 N. vectensis placed individually in three 6-well plate arenas (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Movie 3). We quantified the levels of movement by calculating pixel change above a quiescence threshold, which was set based on MgCl2-paralyzed animals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). We analyzed 6 h bins (Supplementary Fig. 4) but chose 12 h windows (ZT18-6 and ZT6-18) because they encompass the full crepuscular (i.e., active at dusk) behavioral pattern and align with the 12 h light/dark periods used for C. andromeda (Fig. 1m), facilitating cross-species statistics. In contrast to C. andromeda, under LD, N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity (Fig. 2c), which increased between ZT6-ZT18 and decreased between ZT18-ZT6 (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that N. vectensis is a crepuscular animal. Notably, the exposure to a sudden artificial dark-to-light transition transiently induced locomotor activity (ZT0-2, Fig. 2c). This robust response to light was used as a stimulus to identify increased arousal threshold in sleeping animals. During daytime (ZT2), N. vectensis was exposed to various light intensities and showed a negative correlation between the light intensity and response latency (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2f–k). Using the intermediate-intensity light stimulus and optimization algorithm (Fig. 2g), we found a slower response in N. vectensis individuals that were quiescent for more than 8 min prior to the light stimulus (Fig. 2f–h). To validate this arousal threshold, we tested the response to an additional sensory stimulus, i.e., a food cue. Similar to the response to light (Fig. 2f-h), quiescence lasting at least 8 min resulted in a slower response and could differentiate sleep from quiet wakefulness (Fig. 2i–k). Thus, we defined sleep in N. vectensis as a quiescence state of at least 8 min, which is associated with reversible behavior and increased arousal threshold.

This characterization of sleep enabled us to convert mobility data to sleep time (Supplementary Fig. 2a-e). The crepuscular N. vectensis showed rhythmic locomotor activity and an average sleep duration of 25 ± 2.3 min during ZT18-ZT6 and 14 ± 1.8 min during ZT6-ZT18, with a sleep period of 23.4 h under LD conditions (mean ± SEM). Similarly, the rhythmic sleep period was 22.5 h under DD (Fig. 2l-n, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that sleep is regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis. To further differentiate between light- and circadian-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep under forced desynchrony (LDLD). While the rhythmic period of locomotor activity was 22.2 h and controlled by the clock, sleep period was 11.7 h (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f, i, j). These results suggest that although sleep is primarily regulated by the circadian clock it can also be modulated by light in N. vectensis. To understand the hierarchy of light- and intrinsic clock-regulation of sleep, we monitored sleep in NvClkΔ mutant34 (NvClkΔ/Δ) N. vectensis. NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis showed bimodal sleep/wake rhythms (periods of 12.25 h and 25.24 h) under LD and this rhythm was abolished under DD (Fig. 2o–q, Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Under LDLD, the sleep/wake cycle followed the 6 h alternating light/dark rhythm (Supplementary Fig.3k, l). These findings demonstrate that the transcription factor NvClk is essential for maintaining clock-controlled sleep in N. vectensis. To further characterize sleep, we examined species-specific association with posture. Sleep time was monitored in animals displaying closed or open tentacles (Fig. 2r). Although close or open tentacle posture did not strictly differentiate sleep from wake state; i.e. animals with closed tentacles can be awake and vice versa, the closed tentacle N. vectensis slept 2.1-fold more than open tentacles N. vectensis at the peak of the sleep period (ZT23, Fig. 2s). To test whether homeostatic process regulates sleep, we sleep-deprived the N. vectensis for 8 h during sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) using gradual and gentle water exchange once per hour (Supplementary Movie 4). Following SD, sleep-deprived animals slept 1.24-fold more than control animals (Fig. 2t, u), indicating a homeostatic sleep drive. In contrast, control SD during the activity period (ZT8-ZT16) did not induce a sleep rebound (Fig. 2v, w). Altogether, while sleep can be modulated by light, a combination of circadian and homeostatic processes are the primary regulators of sleep in the crepuscular N. vectensis.

The establishment of sleep criteria in two cnidarians, which sleep at different times of the day, enabled us to study species-specific changes in sleep architecture and regulatory mechanisms. The analysis of sleep time revealed nocturnal sleep in C. andromeda, and a crepuscular rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in WT N. vectensis, which was abolished in NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis under constant conditions (Fig. 2). However, total sleep time over 24 h was similar in C. andromeda, WT and NvClkΔ/Δ N. vectensis (Fig. 3a). To determine sleep patterns, we quantified the length and number of sleep bouts during the sleep and wake periods of each species. We found longer sleep bout durations and a higher number of sleep bouts at ZT18-6 compared to ZT6-18, under LD, in both WT (Fig. 3b, c) and NvClkΔ/Δ (Fig. 3d, e) N. vectensis. Similarly, under LD conditions, sleep bout length and the number of sleep bouts increased during the night (ZT12-0) in the diurnal C. andromeda (Fig. 3f, g). Inter-species comparison of sleep architecture revealed that although total sleep time was similar (Fig. 3a), the average sleep bout length was shorter by 2.8 min (Fig. 3h), and the mean number of sleep bouts was approximately two-fold higher (Fig. 3i) in C. andromeda compared to N. vectensis. These results show that, like humans, both cnidarian species spend approximately one-third of their lives sleeping (Fig. 3a). However, sleep is more consolidated in N. vectensis, i.e., longer and less fragmented sleep bouts, compared to C. andromeda.

The presence of circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in cnidarians suggests a common neuroregulatory mechanism. The melatonin hormone is secreted from the pineal gland during the night and mediates rhythmic daily physiological and behavioral processes in vertebrates35,36. However, its role in invertebrates remains poorly understood37,38. We tested the effect of melatonin on sleep in the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. While melatonin treatment did not affect sleep during the rest periods of N. vectensis (ZT3) and C. andromeda (ZT13) (Fig. 3j–l, s–u), sleep time, sleep bout duration, and the number of sleep bouts increased during the active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. 3m–o, p–r). These results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role of melatonin in sleep regulation across animals with different chronotypes.

The presence of sleep in cnidarians indicates that sleep evolved independently of the brain. Studies in fish have shown that sleep decreases DNA damage and is essential for the health of single, non-dividing neurons18,19. To investigate cellular factors that might have driven the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians, we monitored DNA damage levels in single cells of N. vectensis and C. andromeda during the sleep/wake cycle and following SD (Fig. 4a–d). We hypothesized that DNA damage would peak and decline following extended wake and sleep, respectively. To identify the time points of maximal and minimal sleep pressure, we calculated the average sleep time over the past 12 h that preceded each time point. Both C. andromeda and N. vectensis were sampled at the end of their wake (ZT11 and ZT17) and sleep (ZT23 and ZT8) phases (Fig. 4a, b), where wake and sleep accumulation peaked (Fig. 4c, d). DNA damage was quantified using immunohistochemical assays with an antibody against the phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a well-established biomarker of cellular response to DNA damage39. The number of nuclear γH2AX foci was quantified in the neuron-enriched mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue40, located adjacent to individual rhopalium of C. andromeda (Fig. 4e, g), and in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)27 N. vectensis (Fig. 4f, h). Under LD, the number of γH2AX foci increased at the end of the wakefulness period in C. andromeda (ZT11) and N. vectensis (ZT17) and reduced at the end of the sleep period in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) (Fig. 4i, j). The opposite timing of DNA damage reduction between C. andromeda and N. vectensis was aligned with their species-specific chronotype and daily timing of sleep. To determine the effect of homeostatic sleep pressure, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were sleep-deprived for 6 h (ZT17-ZT23) and 8 h (ZT20-ZT4), respectively. Following SD, the number of γH2AX foci increased in C. andromeda (ZT23) and N. vectensis (ZT8) and subsequently decreased to baseline levels following sleep recovery in both species (Fig. 4k, l). These results demonstrate that DNA damage accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep in both diurnal and crepuscular cnidarians. Furthermore, these findings suggest that decreasing DNA damage during sleep is an evolutionarily conserved cellular function that may have contributed to the emergence of sleep in early metazoans.

The correlation between sleep drive and cellular stress (Fig. 4) raised the possibility that environmental and intrinsic factors, disrupting DNA integrity, promote sleep in cnidarians. UV radiation is a potent DNA damage agent and an ancient pervasive atmospheric stressor impacting marine invertebrates41,42,43. To determine the effect of UV radiation on DNA damage and sleep, we exposed C. andromeda and N. vectensis to 15 min and 60 min, respectively, of UVB radiation44 (312 nm) during the day (ZT8). In C. andromeda and N. vectensis, the number of γH2AX foci increased one hour after UV exposure (Fig. 5a, b, f, g). Subsequently, nighttime and daytime sleep increased in C. andromeda (Fig. 5k, l) and N. vectensis (Fig. 5m, n), respectively. Notably, following sleep recovery, the animals remained viable, and two days later, the levels of DNA damage reduced in C. andromeda (Fig. 5a, b, f, g). These results suggest that UV-mediated induction of DNA damage increases sleep pressure. Since UVB may also affect the behavior of cnidarians in alternative pathways45, we treated N. vectensis with the mutagenic compound Etoposide46. While UVB induces oxidative stress and damage to DNA bases, Etoposide inhibits the topoisomerase II enzyme and stabilizes DNA double-strand break formation. Similar to the effect of UV, Etoposide treatment abruptly increased the number of γH2AX foci (Fig. 5c, h). The animals then increased sleep during the following day and night (Fig. 5o, p), and DNA damage was reduced (Fig. 5c, h). Consistent with these findings, melatonin treatment, which promoted sleep during the species-specific active phase in both N. vectensis (ZT13) and C. andromeda (ZT3) (Fig. 3m, p), reduced γH2AX foci levels in both species (Fig. 5d, e, i, j). Together, these results show bidirectional interactions between sleep and DNA damage in early divergent lineage. Moreover, these inter-species comparative findings suggest that environmental factors, such as UV radiation and soluble mutagenic compounds, which can induce DNA damage and cellular stress, may have contributed to the evolutionary emergence of sleep in cnidarians.

Sleep is a vulnerable behavioral state, yet it is ubiquitous across animal species with a nervous system. This study proposes that sleep is an adaptive solution to the cellular cost of wakefulness. Wakefulness is associated with continuous sensory inputs and activity of irreplaceable neurons, enhanced cellular metabolism, and increased locomotion9,10,11,12. Particularly when combined with exposure to environmental mutagens, extended wakefulness can result in cellular stress. To investigate the evolution of sleep function, we characterized the sleep architecture of two cnidarians: the diurnal C. andromeda and crepuscular N. vectensis. Like humans, both species require a total of approximately 8 h of sleep per day. While sleep is regulated by homeostatic pressure in both species, it is also regulated by the light and the circadian clock in C. andromeda and N. vectensis, respectively. Despite their divergent chronotype, both natural and melatonin-induced sleep reduce DNA damage levels, which increase during wakefulness, in both species. The relationship between sleep and DNA damage is bidirectional, and the induction of DNA damage can promote sleep pressure. Altogether, these findings suggest that sleep evolved to support cellular maintenance and preserve genomic integrity in ancient cnidarians possessing a simple nervous system.

In mammals, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and behavioral criteria are used to define sleep47. In most non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, EEG-based diagnostics are limited, making behavioral criteria the primary method for defining sleep1. Nevertheless, the behavioral sleep criteria have been supported by corresponding changes in neuronal activity in a few non-mammalian animals5,48,49. The recent identification of sleep-like behavior in cnidarians suggests that sleep predates the evolution of centralized nervous systems. Sleep-like states have been documented in Cassiopea4 and H. vulgaris3, and behavioral quiescence was observed in corals and box jellyfish in their natural habitat50,51,52. However, sleep had not previously been identified in the Anthozoans, and a specific arousal threshold was not determined in C. andromeda. Using arousal threshold experiments, we defined sleep as a minimum of 8 min of quiescence state in N. vectensis and 3 min under 37 pulses/min in C. andromeda. Although we observed a correlation between tentacle contraction and sleep in N. vectensis, both closed and open tentacle postures were observed during both sleep and wake states. In addition, C. andromeda maintained low but continuous pulsation activity while sleeping, supporting the idea that sleep cannot be defined solely by immobility or tentacle posture50,53. Likewise, migrating birds and marine mammals can sleep while moving, utilizing unihemispheric sleep54,55.

The quantitative measure of sleep enabled us to monitor sleep in the natural habitat, providing insights into how organisms regulate sleep under ecological conditions. In C. andromeda, we developed a predictive model for sleep duration across different organism sizes in wild populations inhabiting Key Largo, FL. These animals exhibited similar sleep duration and architecture as in controlled laboratory conditions, including short midday naps despite differences in salinity and temperature. These findings suggest that internal, species-specific cellular mechanisms shape the sleep pattern. Accordingly, we characterized the hierarchy of sleep regulatory mechanisms in two cnidarian species adapted to distinct ecological niches. Light and homeostatic drive were the predominant sleep regulatory processes in C. andromeda, while homeostatic drive and the circadian clock control sleep in N. vectensis. The light-dependence regulation may be attributed to the C. andromeda symbiosis with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, because photosynthesis-driven byproducts, such as ROS, increase cellular stress, DNA damage56,57,58,59 and sleep pressure. The rhythmic activity of the symbiotic algae is likely physiologically deficient under constant light or dark conditions, potentially disrupting the light-dependent rhythmic sleep/wake cycle in C. andromeda. In contrast, the sleep/wake cycle is regulated by the clock even under constant environmental conditions in the non-symbiotic and crepuscular N. vectensis. Indeed, oxygen consumption, and possibly also ROS levels, are regulated by the circadian clock in N. vectensis60, supporting the idea that intrinsic molecular clocks control the timing of sleep in cnidarians lacking photosymbiosis.

The neuroendocrinological mechanisms that regulate sleep in cnidarians is unknown. We showed that despite their opposing chronotypes, melatonin treatment promoted sleep and reduced DNA damage levels in both species during their respective active phases, suggesting a conserved role for this hormone in sleep modulation. Future extended monitoring of sleep for several days may reveal an additional circadian phase-shifting effect of melatonin. Similarly, exogenous melatonin promoted sleep in diurnal species, such as zebrafish61, and reduces locomotor activity and increases sleep in nocturnal species, such as flatworms62 and mice63, respectively. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland and binds to melatonin receptors in vertebrates35,36. However, although endogenous melatonin production was demonstrated in basal metazoans64, the mechanism of action is less understood in invertebrates. In the roundworm C. elegans, melatonin activates a specific potassium channel65, and similar channels may play an evolutionarily conserved role in mediating the sleep effect of melatonin in cnidarians. Future research in cnidarians, including genetic manipulations, may determine the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant, explain the mechanisms underlying its regulation and elucidate how pharmacological melatonin treatment contributes to sleep and DNA damage regulation in both nocturnal and diurnal animals.

In both C. andromeda and N. vectensis, we observed the accumulation of neuronal DNA damage during wakefulness, which was alleviated during sleep, whereas SD impaired this recovery process. These results in simple nerve nets support findings in other evolutionarily derived animals and humans18,20,21,66 and suggest that the balance between DNA damage and repair is insufficient during wakefulness, and sleep provides a consolidated period for efficient cellular maintenance in individual neurons. Across evolution, as the number of neurons and the complexity of neuronal networks increase67, sleep may have evolved to confine unsynchronized cellular maintenance, and coordinate neuronal activity and maintenance across interconnected circuits, ensuring functional stability.

Understanding which homeostatic internal and environmental factors drive sleep in basal animals could shed light on the evolutionary emergence of sleep behavior. In worms, flies, fish, and mice, sleep is necessary to recover from cellular stress, induced by factors such as ROS and UV light8,19,68,69. The symbiotic diurnal C. andromeda inhabits shallow tropical waters and are exposed to high levels of UV radiation70. In accordance, we found that UV exposure increased sleep pressure in C. andromeda. However, a similar effect was observed in the crepuscular N. vectensis, which inhabits estuarine environments with fluctuating light exposure, often burrowing in sediment during the day. Thus, we suggest that a downstream mechanism, i.e., UV-mediated DNA damage, is a homeostatic driver of sleep in cnidarians. Indeed, we showed that Etoposide, a pharmacological inducer of DNA damage, promoted sleep in N. vectensis, suggesting a positive correlation between DNA damage accumulation and sleep pressure across evolution. These findings are supported by our work in zebrafish showing that UV radiation, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nuclear proteins, and neuronal activity can induce DNA damage and promote sleep18,19. Moreover, sleep-dependent reductions in DNA damage have been reported also in flies, mice, and humans20,21,71, and melatonin improved the repair of oxidative DNA damage in night shift workers66.

Cnidarians are emerging as genetically tractable, translucent models for studying evolutionary neuroscience26,72. We showed that sleep supports neuronal recovery in cnidarians. Beyond cellular repair, neuronal health is likely tied to additional sleep functions, such as learning and memory consolidation73. Associate learning has recently been demonstrated in N. vectensis and box jellyfish72,74, and future studies in cnidarians can elucidate how sleep optimizes cellular maintenance and consolidation of memory at the level of single cell within simple nerve nets of live animals. The molecular tools developed in our work and in other cnidarian studies75 offer a unique opportunity to identify conserved sleep-associated cellular markers, which could help characterize sleep at the cellular level. Since sleep has traditionally been classified based on movement and arousal thresholds in invertebrates, uncovering molecular signatures of sleep in cnidarians may help to characterize sleep in additional basal organisms, such as coral colonies, which consist of thousands of interconnected polyps. Whether coral polyps sleep simultaneously or in a coordinated alternating manner remains unknown, but studying their nerve net dynamics could provide clues about the evolutionary origins of local sleep regulation76. Moreover, considering that the interplay between the circadian clock and genomic stability has been shown in non-neuronal mammalian cultured cells, fungi and cyanobacteria77,78,79,80, sleep-like states may have preceded the evolution of neurons, originally evolved to support synchronized and consolidated periods of cellular maintenance.

C. andromeda jellyfish were initially collected from the Gulf of Eilat and later raised and reproduced in the laboratory. The animals were reared in artificial seawater (ASW, OmegaSea, 39-40 ppt) at a 24 °C–25 °C with a pH of 8.1–8.3. A water cooler and heater were used to maintain a constant temperature. A deuterium-depleted water (DDW) compensation system was used to maintain salinity levels. Animals were raised under a 12 h day/12 h night cycle (LD) using 2400 W Metal Halogen 14,000 K light sources providing approximately 100 PPFD at the animal level, located 20 cm above the water surface. The animals were housed and monitored in a 113-liter closed water system equipped with a waste filtration system and a protein skimmer. Waste products were kept close to 0 ppm ammonia, 0 ppb phosphorus, 0 ppm nitrite, and 0 ppm nitrate. C. Andromeda were fed daily with brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii) at noon. Animals with bell diameters of 5-7.5 cm, in a relaxed state, were randomly assigned to each experimental group. The C. Andromeda genotype was validated by sequencing the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene81. Whole genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50), and DNA fragment amplification was performed using the following degenerated primers: Forward: 5'-ACNAAYCAYAAAGATATHGG-3', Reverse: 5'-TGGTGNGCYCANACNATRAANCC-3'.

N. vectensis were raised in ASW (OmegaSea, 12ppt) in a closed system at 17 °C under constant darkness and fed daily with Artemia nauplii at noon. Spawning of gametes and fertilization was performed according to established protocol82. In brief, the temperature was raised to 25 °C for 9 h, and males and females were exposed to strong white light. 3 h later, oocytes were mixed with sperm to enable fertilization. To genotype NvClkΔ mutant and WT N. vectensis, genomic DNA was extracted using the Minikit NucleoSPin tissue (NucleoSpin, REF 740952.50). A fragment of the NvClk gene was amplified using the following primers: forward 5'-ACCCCACTGAGTGACCTCTT-3' and reverse 5'-ATACGCCTGCGCTATACACC-3'. The PCR products were then loaded on a 3% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel supplemented with GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The genotype of each animal was determined based on the size of the PCR products: NvClkΔ/Δ - 120 bp; WT - 100 bp. The gel-based genotyping was confirmed by sequencing in selected animals.

Two modular water systems (Aquazone Ltd, Israel) were designed to monitor the behavior of 9 or 16 jellyfish simultaneously while maintaining controlled light, temperature, and salinity conditions. The systems consisted of 9 or 16 clear perspex chambers of 10 x 10 x 10 cm or 7 x 7 x 10 cm for individual jellyfish, respectively (Fig. 1a). These apparatuses were kept inside a 55 x 50 x 30 cm tank, connected to a waste filtration system, a protein skimmer, a water heater, and a DDW water compensation system. C. andromeda were kept under 12 h of light (five 50 W LED lights providing 100–200 PPFD at the animal level) and 12 h of darkness (LD) and constantly illuminated with low-intensity IR LED lights. Prior to each experiment, C. andromeda were acclimated in the recording system, one individual per chamber, for 2-3 days. An IR camera (Dahua Technology, Hangzhou, China) with an IR filter was used to record mp4 videos at resolution of 1920 × 1200 and 20 frames per second (fps). The mp4 videos were converted to avi files using the FFmpeg software (FFmpeg, Irvington, NJ, USA). MATLAB Version: 9.8.0 (R2020a)83 and a lab-made script were used to determine pulsation behavior. The change in the average pixel intensity was measured for each frame, producing a pulse trace. A rectangular region of interest (ROI) was selected for each jellyfish. The smoothed average pixel intensity was calculated using a Gaussian moving window and was subtracted from the data to control for low-frequency oscillations of the data. Pulsation events were counted using the peak of the pulse trace (Fig. 1b), and the mean activity was analyzed during the first 20 min of each hour along day and night. Sleep architecture was analyzed using the full duration of the first 24 h of the video recording to ensure the continuity of the data. Jellyfish that changed their horizontal to a vertical position or anomalous animals exhibiting pulsing behavior three standard deviations below or above the mean were excluded. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) from the ‘Lomb' library84 on R85 with a p < 0.01 threshold. To assess the change in arousal threshold, the jellyfish were stimulated repeatedly every hour at night (ZT13-ZT19) using a 1 s 100–200 PPFD light pulse. A response was defined as a reduction of 2 standard deviations in the inter-pulse intervals (IPI) compared to the distribution of IPIs before the stimulation, within a time window of 10 s after the stimulus. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. 1g, j). For each candidate threshold (e.g., pulsation rate), responses were split into two groups: below and above the threshold. We then summed all Euclidean distances of these responses from the mean value of their respective groups (i.e., error value). Thus, the behavioral value that optimally divided a group of fast responses and slow responses results in the lowest error value. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated repeatedly with a gentle water pulse using thin tubes connected to a water pump and a computer clock. These 10 min pulses of water were applied every 10 min for 6 h at ZT17-ZT23. Field experiments were conducted in May in the native habitat of Cassiopea at Key Largo, FL. Light intensities ranged between 400-1500 PPFD at a depth of 0.3–1.5 m at the peak of the day, salinity was 31.5 ppt and Temperature was 26.8 °C. The pulsation rate was monitored manually by counting the number of pulses per minute every hour in 30–40 animals during the day and night (total of 662 animals). Subsequently, the diameter of the relaxed bell of each individual was measured.

Locomotor activity of individual N. vectensis was monitored using a custom-made temperature-controlled (20 °C) water system equipped with an IR camera (Dahua, Binjiang District, Hangzhou, China). Animals of similar size (1-2 cm), genetic background, and age were distributed individually into wells of four six-well plates (Fig. 2a) and were subject to alternating white light Illumination with intensity of 17 PPFD (Sylvania Lightning Solution, Wilmington, MA, USA). MATLAB script was generated based on H. vulgaris sleep tracking methodology3 to analyze the locomotor activity and sleep. We measured changes in the pixel value between two consecutive frames at 5 s intervals (Supplementary Fig. 2a-e). Noise was reduced by subtracting the minimum pixel change of the individual. To set the minimum threshold of locomotor activity, pixel changes of MgCl2-treated paralyzed animals were quantified. These changes were considered immobility. The ratio of frames with detectable movements was calculated in a 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement) and defined as quiescence if movement was not detected in more than 50% of the frames per 1 min bin (i.e., fraction movement<0.5). To assess the change in arousal threshold, the polyps were stimulated with either light or food. Polyps were stimulated with three different light intensities ( + 5, +50, +500 PPFD, above the 17 PPFD baseline) during the day (ZT10) for 30 min (Supplementary Fig. 2f–k). Food stimulation was performed by application of “Reef Energy Plus” solution (Red Sea, Israel). A response-to-stimulus was defined as 30 s of continuous movement above the threshold. A threshold-based optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal behavioral parameters to distinguish between slow and fast responses (i.e., elevated arousal threshold; Fig. 2g, j) as is described for C. andromeda. Sleep durations were summed in hourly bins, and the average and standard errors were calculated for all tested animals. Since N. vectensis showed crepuscular behavior (i.e., active at dusk), we used a data-driven approach to define sleep (ZT18-6) and wake (ZT6-18) periods in a 12 h time window. Sleep architecture data were analyzed using continuous 60 h movies starting at ZT18. In SD experiments, the animals were stimulated by gentle water exchange once per hour during their peak of sleep period (ZT20-ZT4) and peak of activity period (ZT8-ZT16; Supplementary Movie 4) and sleep was monitored before and after the SD. The oscillation frequencies were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using Fourier analysis-based software LSP with a p < 0.01 threshold. Open or closed posture was manually annotated from a single video frame. Animals were categorized based on the number of tentacles deployed outside of their body. Animals that showed at least two visible tentacles were classified as ‘open'.

For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. In the C. andromeda system, water circulation was terminated one hour prior to melatonin treatment due to the high volume of constant water exchange in the system. Both species were treated with either 100 μM melatonin (diluted in ethanol) or ethanol for control, at ZT3 and ZT13. These time points were selected to correspond to their respective periods of sleep (ZT3 for N. vectensis, ZT13 for C. andromeda) and wakefulness (ZT13 for N. vectensis, ZT3 for C. andromeda) for both species. In C. andromeda, behavior was recorded 30 min before and during melatonin administration. In N. vectensis, behavior was recorded 60 min before and during melatonin treatment. The delta effect (Fig. 3j–u) was calculated by subtracting the mean post-treatment values from the mean pre-treatment values of either melatonin or ethanol treatment. In DNA damage quantification assays, animals were treated with melatonin for 3 h, starting at ZT13 for N. vectensis and ZT3 for C. andromeda at their respective wake period, and were then fixed in 4% PFA. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, three independent rhopalia were dissected from each animal (total of eight animals per Ctl and Mel groups) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

For both sleep and DNA damage assays, animals were first habituated. Specifically, C. andromeda and N. vectensis were entrained and maintained in the behavioral systems described above for 72 h under LD conditions. A dark plastic barrier divided and isolated UV-treated animals from controls in the behavioral monitoring systems. For C. andromeda, sleep was recorded for 30 h; for N. vectensis, 42 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were exposed to 312 nm UVB (Spectroline® E-Series UV lamp, 20 cm above the animals): 15 min in C. andromeda and 1 h in N. vectensis. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, UV-treated and control C. andromeda and N. vectensis were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the UV irradiation. All UV assays were performed in two independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column was mounted on a slide, and the cells in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. For C. andromeda, 2–3 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (11 animals per time point; ZT7, ZT9, ZT7 Day3) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located in the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

N. vectensis were habituated for 72 h and entrained to LD cycle in six-well plates. Sleep was recorded during 54 h. At ZT8, half of the animals were treated with 10 μm Etoposide (E1383, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and half with control 0.01% DMSO. To quantify DNA damage, at each time point, Etoposide-treated and control animals were fixed in 4% PFA before (ZT7), 1 h (ZT9), and two days (ZT7 Day3) following the treatment. Etoposide assays were performed in two independent experiments. The upper body column was mounted on a slide, and cells located in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged.

In both species, animals were habituated in their video monitoring system for 72 h and entrained to an LD cycle. SD was applied as described above. To quantify DNA damage, animals were fixed in 4% PFA at each time point. All LD and SD assays were performed in three independent experiments for both species. For N. vectensis, the upper body column of transgenic tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- animal was mounted on a slide, and neurons in the epithelium layer (ectodermis) were imaged. DNA damage quantification analyses were performed in mOrangeCAAX-positive neurons at ZT17, ZT8, and ZT17 Day 2. For C. andromeda, 2-4 rhopalia were dissected from each animal (8-10 animals per time point; ZT11, ZT23, and ZT11 Day 2) and DNA damage was quantified in cells located on the mesogleal surface of the peri-rhopalial tissue adjacent to each rhopalium.

tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX)+/- and wild type N. vectensis were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 2XPBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. The umbrella tissues of C. andromeda surrounding the rhopalium were sampled and fixed for 5 min in 2% PFA in ASW at room temperature, followed by a 6 h fixation in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C and washed with PBS. For both species, the tissues were incubated with 2 μg/mL protein kinase (PK) for 10 min, then washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum with 1% DMSO, and diluted in PBS + 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, in N. vectensis, tissues were incubated with a primary antibody: rabbit anti-γH2AX (GTX127342, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) 1:200 dilution and antiDsRED (Living Colors® mCherry Monoclonal mouse Antibody, Clontech, Cat# 632543) 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer for 72 h at 4 °C, while in C. andromeda, tissues were incubated with the rabbit anti-γH2AX 1:200 dilution. Then, for both species, samples were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min. N. vectensis were incubated for 1 h with a goat polyclonal secondary anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 646 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. C. andromeda were incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488 nm, 2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and with DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature. Next, both species were washed in PBS + 0.1% Triton 3 x 15 min and the slides were mounted and prepared for imaging and cellular quantification.

All imaging experiments were conducted on fixed dissected tissue mounted on slides in glycerol for both species. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 inverted and a LSM980 upright confocal/two-photon microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with ×63, 1.4 NA objective. γH2AX puncta were automatically counted using an ImageJ macro code utilizing the Analyze Particles built-in ImageJ plugin (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), within DAPI-based ROIs to focus on nuclear signal. Between 10-100 cells were analyzed in each C. andromeda rhopalia and N. vectensis. In addition to DAPI and γH2AX signal, a third channel was used to detect the fluorophore mOrange expressed in the nervous system of tg(-2.4NvElav1b:mOrangeCAAX) N. vectensis.

Mammals aren't known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this study:

Billions of people globally experience some kind of vision impairment, with many millions living with near or total blindness. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. But while other members of the animal kingdom display remarkable methods of vision regeneration, mammals largely lack these restorative powers. 

However, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies. 

Within the human body, it's mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn't explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. To investigate, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland explored what happens between connections of cells in the visual system and neurons in the brain in mice after an injury. While neurons didn't regrow, the researchers did notice that surviving cells increased branching, allowing for more connections in the brain. Eventually, this branching process—known as “sprouting”—resulted in nearly the same number of connections as before the injury. The results of this study were published in the journal JNeurosci. 

“The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. “Here we […] explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system.”

While the mice in the study did recover to an extent, the scientists were surprised to see that recovery wasn't uniform across sexes. Male mice showed enhanced recuperative abilities, while female mice experienced slower and incomplete repair by comparison. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn't wholly unexpected.

“Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University's Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.”

While the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail's eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish. 

For now, humans lack methods for fully regenerating cells that can completely restore our much-needed vision. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.

The catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers constitutes a recognized synthetic challenge as it is traditionally considered to arise from a non-concerted reaction pathway via formation and recombination of radical pairs. Here we show a catalytic enantioselective solution to this challenge, demonstrating that [1,2]-Wittig products are generated via an alternative reaction cascade to traditional dogma. The developed process employs a chiral bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst to promote an initial enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. A subsequent base-promoted, stereoconvergent, fragmentation–recombination process that proceeds with high enantiospecificity and retention of configuration, formally equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden thermal [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, generates [1,2]-Wittig products in up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio. Supported by extensive quantum chemistry calculations, this chirality transfer process will have broad implications for fundamental stereocontrol in organic transformations.

Sigmatropic rearrangements are useful and reliable atom-economic reactions, with their ability to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds through well-defined and predictable transition states1 making these processes attractive for the synthesis of complex targets2. Among this broad set of reaction processes, [2,3]- and [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangements are of synthetic and mechanistic significance3,4. The rearrangement of allylic ethers under basic reaction conditions typically leads to product mixtures proposed to arise from the thermally allowed concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic Wittig rearrangement, alongside a competitive non-concerted [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement generally thought to arise from homolytic fragmentation of the anionic intermediate to form a geminate radical pair and their subsequent recombination5,6 (Fig. 1a). As representative examples, both Rautenstrauch7 and Baldwin8 have shown that treatment of benzyl allyl ether 1 with nBuLi gives rise to a mixture of [2,3]- and [1,2]-products 2 and 3, respectively, with increased [1,2]-product observed at higher temperatures. Although not widely recognized, sporadic control reactions have demonstrated the feasibility of converting [2,3]-Wittig products to [1,2]-Wittig products (formally via a [1,3]-rearrangement), although the generality, mechanism and configurational consequence have not been established9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The concerted or dissociative (via ionic or radical intermediates) nature of both the [1,2]- and [1,3]-processes has been much debated. For example, Danheiser considered a concerted [1,3]-pathway to account for the inversion observed in the ring expansion of cis-cyclobutanol 416. However, Gajewski17 and Cohen18 both postulated a non-concerted fragmentation pathway via an intermediate allylic anion that accounts for the observed in situ isomerism of cis-4 to trans-6, and that use of enantiomerically pure cis-4 or trans-6 leads to racemic product 5 (Fig. 1b)19. Applying the Woodward–Hoffmann rules indicates that a concerted [1,2]-rearrangement is forbidden, while a thermal [1,3]-rearrangement is symmetry allowed but geometrically challenging, with a suprafacial carbon shift expected to proceed with inversion of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon1. Interestingly, Houk has previously shown that anionic Cope and amino-Cope reactions proceed through a stepwise dissociation–recombination process20, consistent with competitive non-concerted [1,3]-rearrangements observed in related systems21,22. Given the mechanistic ambiguity surrounding these processes the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is a recognized challenge and is currently unknown despite its synthetic potential23.

In this Article, the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers is developed (up to 97:3 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)) and is shown to proceed through a cascade process consisting of an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement (up to >99:1 e.r.) promoted by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyst. The resultant tertiary carbinol bearing an α-branched allylic substituent is transformed to the linear [1,2]-Wittig isomeric product with retention of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon (equivalent to a Woodward–Hoffmann forbidden [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement) through a dissociative intramolecular fragmentation–recombination event with high enantiospecificity (Fig. 1c). Substitution reactions that proceed with retention of configuration are rare, although recognized for alcohols via an SNi mechanism that proceeds via contact ion-paired intermediates24,25,26. Traditionally the stereospecificity of nucleophilic substitution processes leads to inversion of configuration in SN2 reaction processes at secondary centres and partial or complete racemization in SN1 processes at tertiary centres. However, recent advances have showcased stereospecific substitution at tertiary and even quaternary centres in which stereochemical information is conferred despite ionization of a substrate27,28,29,30,31,32. In this context, the high enantiospecificity of the observed chirality transfer protocol that leads to [1,2]-products with retention of configuration, while proceeding through an ionic fragmentation and recombination process, holds promise for the elucidation of alternative reaction pathways for generating chiral products with high enantioselectivity.

Building upon the observation that disubstitution at the allylic ether terminus typically leads to increased preference for [1,2]-rearrangement products14, the use of BIMPs as organocatalysts to promote the enantioselective [1,2]-rearrangement process was considered. Originally developed by Dixon, BIMPs have shown widespread use in a plethora of stereoselective transformations33, possessing a Brønsted superbasic iminophosphorane with a hydrogen-bond donor to assert stereocontrol. Rearrangement of an allylic ether upon an oxindole skeleton was chosen, given the prevalence of this motif in natural products and bioactive molecules, as well as expected acidity. Following initial screening of the effect of N-substituent (N-Me, N-Bn, N-trityl), BIMP catalyst, solvent and temperature variation (see Supplementary Information Section 2) using N-trityl-substituted allylic ether 8 and tBu-BIMP catalyst 7 showed that rearrangement to 9 in mesitylene led to selective formation of the [1,2]-product in excellent yield and promising enantioselectivity after 24 h (Fig. 2a; 92:8 e.r.). As [1,2]-Wittig products are traditionally expected to be generated via a radical recombination mechanism, the effect of adding 20 mol% of 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxopiperidinium (4-NHAc-TEMPO) as an additive was probed. Formation of the [1,2]-product was not significantly inhibited, giving 9 in 73% yield and improved 95:5 e.r., with no 4-NHAc-TEMPO adducts observed34. The mass balance consisted of the aldol side product 10 (>95:5 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.), 75:25 e.r.) that was isolated in 5% yield; addition of 1.0 equivalent of 4-NHAc-TEMPO was also tested, affording 9 in a further reduced 59% yield but enhanced 97:3 e.r. Control experiments indicated that taking a 1:1 mixture of allylic ether 8 and N-tritylisatin with tBu-BIMP 7 gave aldol product 10 in 71% yield (>95:5 d.r., 75:25 e.r.), consistent with in situ formation of N-tritylisatin derivative in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO. Further experiments showed that addition of 1.0 equivalent of TEMPO led to 9 in 57% isolated yield (97:3 e.r.) with 10% of TEMPO-allyl adduct (T-a) isolated as well as 11% N-tritylisatin. Intrigued by these observations, in situ temporal reaction analysis monitored consumption of allylic ether 11 (40 mm) upon treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 (20 mol%) to give [1,2]-Wittig product 13 in d8-toluene using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.1). The rearrangement showed a first-order consumption in substrate 11 (which was racemic throughout the reaction process), with a transient mixture of diastereoisomeric [2,3]-rearrangement products 12 detected (δH = 5.15 and 4.87 ppm) that accumulated to a maximum concentration of ≈15 mm and was subsequently transformed into the [1,2]-rearrangement product 13, consistent with 12 being an intermediate in the generation of 13. On a synthetic scale, stopping the reaction of allylic ether 8 after 1 h gave, at 75% conversion, a 63:37 mixture of [2,3]-product 14 and [1,2]-product 9 (96:4 e.r.). Purification gave 14 (89:11 d.r., both diastereoisomers 99:1 e.r.) in 21% yield whose absolute configuration was determined by N-trityl deprotection and subsequent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Information Section 6). The absolute configuration within 9 was confirmed by chemical synthesis (Supplementary Information Section 8.8), indicating stereoconvergence and retention of configuration at C(3) in the rearrangement of diastereoisomers 14 to 9. Separate control experiments validated the [2,3]-rearrangement products 14 as intermediates to the [1,2]-product 9 (Fig. 2c). Treating 14 (89:11 d.r.) with tBu-BIMP 7 and 4-NHAc-TEMPO for 5 h gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 60% yield (99:1 e.r.) alongside 10% of N-tritylisatin, while treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 and TEMPO gave the [1,2]-product 9 in 43% yield (97:3 e.r.) alongside 12% of TEMPO-adduct (T-a) and 15% of N-tritylisatin. Treatment with tBu-BIMP 7 alone gave 9 in 83% yield (96:4 e.r.) with 12% of N-tritylisatin observed, while the use of achiral base 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) on 14 also promoted rearrangement, but to moderate 50% conversion, giving 9 in 36% yield but with high enantioselectivity (96:4 e.r.). This is consistent with DBU or tBu-BIMP 7 acting as a base and not notably influencing enantiospecificity in this [1,3]-rearrangement process. Consistent with this observation, monitoring the conversion of 14 (89:11 d.r.) to 9 upon treatment with racemic or enantiopure BIMP derivatives did not lead to significant rate differences (Supplementary Information Section 5.2) implying no matched and mismatched reactant combinations. Taken together these experiments are consistent with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO leading to enhanced enantiospecificity in the base-promoted stereoconvergent [1,3]-rearrangement. This is consistent with selective fragment trapping within this process leading to enhanced selectivity, with the origin of this phenomenon discussed in ‘Mechanistic analysis'. The [2,3]-product 14 could also be transformed into the [1,2]-Wittig product 9 when heated at 100 °C without the addition of base, albeit with reduced yield (31%) and enantioselectivity (92:8 e.r.). Crossover experiments (Fig. 2d) using a 50:50 mixture of ethers 15 and 16 either with tBu-BIMP 7 alone (conditions a), or with the addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO (conditions b), resulted in only [1,2]-products 17 and 18, consistent with an intramolecular process in operation, with enhanced product enantioselectivity again observed in the presence of 4-NHAc-TEMPO.

Having identified a viable reaction pathway, the scope of the enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig cascade was examined (Table 1). Changing the C(3′)-alkyl substituent from methyl to ethyl was tolerated, giving 19, while using a C(3′)-cyclopropyl-substituted allylic ether as a radical probe generated only [1,2]-rearrangement product 20 (40% yield, 96:4 e.r.) with the cyclopropyl ring intact. Although indicative, the absence of ring-opened products does not exclude a radical mechanism since in-cage carbon–carbon radical recombination (rate constant typically estimated to be >1011 s−1) is considered much faster than ring opening of a cyclopropyl methyl radical (k = 1.3 × 108 s−1)35. Increasing the steric hindrance through incorporation of a C(3′)-phenyl substituent resulted in moderate conversion (Supplementary Information Section 4). This necessitated changing the N-trityl substituent to an N-benzyl for increased reactivity, giving 21 in 61% yield but reduced product enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r.), consistent with screening studies that necessitated N-trityl substitution for optimal enantioselectivity (Supplementary Information Section 2). A limitation of this process showed that both a (Z)-configured allylic ether and a dimethyl terminal allylic ether returned only starting material under the reaction conditions. Variation of the C(3′)-aryl substituent showed that the incorporation of halogens (4-F, 4-Cl and 4-Br), electron-withdrawing (4-CF3) as well as electron-donating (4-Ph, 4-Me, 4-MeO) substituents were tolerated, giving the [1,2]-rearrangement products 13, 18, 22–26 in high yields and enantioselectivity. The incorporation of 3-Me and 2-Me substituents (27, 28) was also tolerated, although with lower yields for the 2-Me-substituted example. In addition, 2-naphthyl-, thien-2-yl- and thiazol-2-yl-substituted ethers all afforded the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products 29–31 in 71% to 82% yields with 93:7 to 94:6 e.r. Substituent variation within the 4-, 5- and 6-positions of the oxindole included the incorporation of halogen (5-F, 5-Cl, 5-I, 6-Br, 6-Cl), electron-withdrawing (5-O2N) and electron-donating (5-Me, 5-MeO) substituents that gave the corresponding products 17, 32–39 in 67% to 80% yield and up to 96:4 e.r. While N-tritylation of 7-chloroisatin was unsuccessful, the N-benzyl analogue was prepared and tested, giving 40 in 81% yield but reduced enantioselectivity (73:27 e.r.).

To further probe the generality of this transformation, the effect of incorporating C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substituents within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. 3a). In contrast to the parent C(3′)-methyl series, treatment of 41 and 43 with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature gave exclusively the corresponding [2,3]-rearrangement products 42 (91:9 d.r., 98:2 e.r.) and 44 (72:28 d.r., 98:2 e.r.) with no formation of the [1,2]-product. To convert these enantioenriched [2,3]-products to the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products increased reaction temperatures (≥100 °C for 42 and 44) and the addition of stoichiometric DBU (1 equiv.) was required. For example, stereoconvergence of the separable diastereoisomers (3S,1′S)- and (3S,1′R)-44 upon treatment with DBU in mesitylene at 120 °C was observed, with both giving (E,S)-[1,2]-Wittig product 45 in 94:6 and 93:7 e.r., respectively. Solvent polarity has a substantial effect upon the enantiospecificity of the [1,3]-rearrangement at these increased reaction temperatures (Supplementary Information Section 3) with highest product enantioselectivity observed in solvents of low polarity (toluene and mesitylene) rather than polar solvents (DMF or MeCN). Rearrangement with retention of configuration is still observed, although addition of 4-NHAc-TEMPO or TEMPO does not lead to increased product e.r. in this series (Supplementary Information Section 3). Having demonstrated that high temperatures are required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement of the initially formed [2,3]-products, a telescoped process to allow one-pot access to [1,2]-Wittig products was developed that utilized toluene as a solvent (Fig. 3b). Treatment of a range of allylic ethers with tBu-BIMP 7 promoted enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, which was followed by the addition of DBU (1 equiv.) and heating to between 60 °C and 100 °C. Following this procedure, in the C(3′)-F series, inclusion of Ph-, 4-MeC6H4-, 4-MeOC6H4- and 4-F3CC6H4-substituted allylic ethers, as well as 4-Cl, 5-F, 5-NO2, 5-MeO and 6-Cl substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, giving the corresponding [1,2]-Wittig products (46–54) with good to excellent enantioselectivity (91:9 to 97:3 e.r.). In the C(3′)-H series, variation of the aryl substituent within the allylic ether showed that Ph-, 4-MeOC6H4, 4-F3CC6H4, 4-FC6H4, 2-MeOC6H4, 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl substitution, heteroaromatic 3-thienyl and C(2′)-methyl substitution, alongside 4-Cl, 5-OMe and 6-Br substituents within the oxindole were tolerated, allowing the formation of enantioenriched [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement products 45, 55–65 (87:13 to 95:5 e.r.). Notably, lower product yields (41% to 73%) were observed in this one-pot process than noted in Fig. 3, reflecting the propensity for competitive decomposition at the elevated reaction temperatures required to promote the [1,3]-rearrangement.

Having demonstrated the scope of this transformation, consideration to the mechanism of this cascade was given. Initial association of tBu-BIMP 7 to substrate I by hydrogen bonding is assumed to direct deprotonation of the allylic ether–BIMP complex II to give III, with subsequent concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement giving IV with high stereoselectivity (Fig. 4a). Protonation and catalyst release gives isolable V. A subsequent base-promoted (tBu-BIMP or DBU), anion-accelerated [1,3]-rearrangement from IV36, which proceeds with retention of configuration at the carbinol centre, generates [1,2]-Wittig product VI. Computational methods were used to gain mechanistic insight into the [2,3]- and [1,3]-rearrangement processes. Eight binding modes between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate were considered (Supplementary Fig. 19) and conformationally searched using CREST (GFN2-xTB; Ar = Ph, X = Me)37,38,39. The lowest energy conformer from each search was then optimized in Gaussian 1640 using ONIOM41,42 to reduce the computational complexity for this large system. The peripheral components of both catalyst and substrate were treated with semi-empirical quantum mechanics and placed in the low layer, while the atoms involved in bond breaking and forming were treated with density functional theory (DFT). Full DFT single point energies were performed on all stationary points (Supplementary Information Section 7). These calculations were conducted on substrate 8 (Ar = Ph, X = Me; Fig. 4a) in the presence of catalyst 7 unless otherwise stated (Fig. 2c). Previous studies have shown that there is good agreement between ONIOM and full DFT calculations for other organocatalytic systems43,44,45,46,47,48,49.

To study the origins of stereoselectivity, transition states (TSs) leading to each of the four possible stereoisomers for the BIMP-catalysed [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement were located (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Consistent with experimental results (Fig. 2c), the calculated lowest energy exo-TS forms the (S,S)-stereoisomer, with the difference in free energy between this and the lowest energy exo-(R,R)-TS (1.57 kcal mol−1; Fig. 4b) resulting in a computed e.r. of 93:750. The diastereomeric ratio computed from the exo-(S,S)- and endo-(S,R)-TS III energies (ΔΔG‡ = 1.16 kcal mol−1) is 86:14. These ratios are consistent with the experimentally observed levels of stereoselectivity in the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. To gain insight into the origins of enantioselectivity, the structures of exo-(S,S)- and exo-(R,R)-TS III were compared, revealing key differences in hydrogen bonding capability between [tBu-BIMP-H]+ and the substrate. In exo-(S,S)-TS III, three stabilizing NH···O hydrogen bonds from the catalyst to the substrate oxygen atoms are observed, while in exo-(R,R)-TS III, only two NH···O hydrogen bonds are seen alongside an unusual, longer and weaker NH···C interaction with a reacting carbon atom (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 21). The origins of diastereoselectivity can be understood by comparison of exo-(S,S)-TS III and endo-(S,R)-TS III. A shorter distance between the centroids of the allylic aryl substituent and an N-trityl Ph substituent in exo-(S,S)-TS III (4.74 Å) relative to endo-(S,R)-TS III (5.12 Å) is observed, suggesting a more favourable T-shaped π-stacking interaction, leading to the preference for the (S,S)-stereoisomer51 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 22).

Computational analysis subsequently studied the feasibility of a concerted rearrangement or a stepwise fragmentation followed by a recombination process (Fig. 4a) for the onwards reaction of (S,S)-IV (Ar = Ph, X = Me). Although examples of [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements are reported52,53,54,55,56,57,58, despite extensive efforts it was not possible to locate concerted TSs for this [1,3]-rearrangement process, even with constraints between the bond-forming and bond-breaking atoms; some unconstrained attempts resulted in geometries that resembled TS IV (fragmentation). Optimization of fragmentation TSs was possible but attempts to locate a TS that connects the fragment complex and the recombination product were all unsuccessful. An energy scan starting from the recombination product up to a fragment complex (Supplementary Fig. 23) showed no peak in the potential energy surface between 1.6 and 3.5 Å, which suggests that VI forms via a near-barrierless recombination event. Reoptimization of the lowest energy (S,S)-TS IV conformer with unrestricted methods showed no appreciable spin density on any atom, which is consistent with an ionic rather than a homolytic fragmentation.

The lowest energy conformer of (S,S)-IV and (S,S)-TS IV were then reoptimized with Ar = 4-FC6H4, X = Me such that the calculated reaction barrier could be directly compared to that derived from in situ reaction monitoring (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4 and 7.3). The intrinsic reaction coordinate data for the reoptimized 4-FC6H4 TS ((S,S)-TS IVF) is shown in Fig. 4c (for optimized structures of (S,S)-IVF, (S,S)-TS IVF and fragment complex see Supplementary Fig. 24). The computed barrier for the fragmentation step of this [1,3]-rearrangement (ΔG‡comp = 20.97 kcal mol−1) closely matches that derived from kinetic fitting of the reaction profile generated via in situ monitoring of 11→12→13 (ΔG‡exp = 21.90 kcal mol−1; see Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information Section 5.4).

To experimentally probe the validity of this proposed fragmentation–recombination pathway, taking isolated racemic [2,3]-rearrangement products that differed in the electronic effect of C(1′)-aryl substituents with tBu-BIMP 7 showed that inclusion of electron-withdrawing substituents led to enhanced reaction rates. Hammett analysis (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Information Section 5.2) revealed a ρ value of +0.76 when plotted against the substituent constant σ−. Although small, this ρ value is consistent with the build-up of partial negative charge within the rate-limiting TS of the reaction and the proposed anionic fragmentation. Notably, no significant difference in reaction rate was observed when using BIMP catalysts with either racemic or enantioenriched [2,3]-rearrangement products (Supplementary Information Section 5.3). Building on this observation, the effect of incorporating an electron-withdrawing ester substituent at C(3′) within the allylic ether terminus was investigated (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Information Section 3). Treatment of 66 (R1 = Me) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature promoted initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement, leading to [1,2]-product 67 in 55% yield (98:2 e.r.) alongside aldol product 68 (15%, 75:25 d.r., 88:12 e.r.) and N-tritylisatin (7%). Notably, treatment of 69 (R1 = H) with tBu-BIMP 7 at room temperature for 1 h, followed by warming at 40 °C for 2 h led to facile fragmentation, giving [1,2]-product 70 in 48% yield (95:5 e.r.) in conjunction with ethyl crotonate (22% yield) and N-tritylisatin (26%). The generation of ethyl crotonate 71 and N-tritylisatin is consistent with the ester substituent facilitating anionic fragmentation from an initially formed [2,3]-product, with protonation and isomerization giving 71. Building on these observations, the observed [1,3]-rearrangement with retention of configuration and high enantiospecificity is consistent with anionic fragmentation from an alkoxide·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ complex generating an intimate ion pair consisting of an allylic anion and N-tritylisatin·[tBu-BIMP-H]+ (Fig. 4c). Recombination at the terminal allylic position upon the Re-face of the isatin occurs at a faster rate than ion pair dissociation, or conformational change and bond rotation, to allow Si-face addition of the isatin that would lead to reduced product enantioselectivity. Given this anionic fragmentation–recombination mechanism the observation of improved product enantioselectivity on addition of TEMPO derivatives (Fig. 2a) is ascribed to initial single-electron transfer oxidation of an anionic carbanion intermediate by TEMPO as it dissociates from the intimate ion pair, followed by trapping with a second equivalent of TEMPO, consistent with observations by Studer and co-workers alongside others59,60,61,62. Alternative mechanisms involving radical fragmentation and subsequent recombination, or anionic fragmentation and protonation, followed by C-H abstraction by TEMPO and subsequent radical recombination were ruled out (Supplementary Information Section 3).

To conclude, a cascade process that allows the catalytic enantioselective [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of allylic ethers has been developed, providing enantioenriched homoallylic tertiary alcohols with high enantioselectivity. Contrary to existing dogma, mechanistic studies and quantum chemistry calculations strongly support a cascade mechanism for this process that involves an initial enantioselective [2,3]-rearrangement of the allylic ether catalysed by a chiral tBu-BIMP catalyst. This is followed by a base-promoted anionic fragmentation–recombination pathway (base, tBu-BIMP or DBU) that proceeds with high levels of enantiospecificity even at elevated reaction temperatures. Substitution of the allylic fragment markedly affects the effectiveness of the fragmentation–recombination pathway, with anion-stabilizing ester substituents facilitating fragmentation, and with C(3′)-alkyl substitution leading to enhanced rates of [1,2]-product formation over C(3′)-F or C(3′)-H substitution. Given the importance of understanding fundamental reaction processes that lead to stereochemical control, the enantiospecificity observed in this non-concerted pathway will have broader implications for a plethora of other related synthetic transformations.

Typical procedures for the [1,2]-rearrangement cascade at room temperature and upon heating are exemplified below.

The allylic ether substrate 8 (52.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), tBu-BIMP 7 (14.7 mg, 0.02 mmol) and 4-NHAc-TEMPO (4.3 mg, 0.02 mmol) were added to a flame-dried Schlenk tube and the tube was flushed with N2 three times. Mesitylene (2 ml, 0.05 M) was added through the septum under a positive pressure of N2. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h until completion as indicated by thin-layer chromatography analysis. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product, which was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent hexane:EtOAc = 4:1→3:1) to afford 9 (38.0 mg, 73%) as a colourless amorphous solid. The e.r. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALCEL OD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 7.0 min, retention time (major) =8.7 min; 5:95 e.r.).

The allylic ether substrate 43 (101.5 mg, 1.0 equiv.) and tBu-BIMP 7 (14.8 mg, 10 mol%) were added to a vial before the addition of toluene (4 ml, 0.05 M). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, then DBU (28 μl, 1.0 equiv.) was added, and the mixture was then heated to 100 °C and stirred for 16 h, then quenched by addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl and diluted with EtOAc. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel:eluent 80:20→75:25 petrol:EtOAc) to afford 45 (58 mg, 57%) as a yellow amorphous solid. The e.r. was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (chiral stationary phase) of the purified products (Daicel CHIRALPAK AD-H column (10% iPrOH in hexane; 1.0 ml min−1; T = 30 °C; 211 nm); retention time (minor) = 12.5 min, retention time (major) =14.6 min; 5:95 e.r.).

Immune molecules and their cognate receptors are developmentally regulated in brain and dynamically expressed in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the importance of immune molecules to brain wiring, a comprehensive map of the neuroimmune landscape is lacking in developing brain. Here we employed multiplexed in situ spatial transcriptomics to measure the expression of major immune ligands and receptors in developing mouse brain during mid and late gestation. Given the importance of maternal environment in shaping fetal neurodevelopment, we determined how embryonic neuroimmune landscape was altered after maternal immune activation (MIA) and maternal microbiome depletion. Our study revealed notable sex-specific patterns in gene expression and spatial architecture within developing brain. We observed changes in the CXCL12/CXCR7 chemokine network after MIA and microbiome depletion, suggesting a potential common mechanism underlying neural progenitor abnormalities. This resource underscores how the maternal environment programs precise regulation of immune molecules in developing brain, highlighting sex-specific vulnerability.

Assessing drug–target engagement in living cells is essential for verifying the activity of pharmacological agents. Traditional binding assays often overlook key factors such as permeability, intracellular distribution and complex formation that influence target occupancy in cells. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based probes enable direct, quantitative assessment of small-molecule binding to proteins in live, intact cells. BRET provides sensitive detection of target engagement across a wide range of target classes, including less-tractable proteins in membrane compartments. Compared to other existing methods, BRET offers quantification of drug occupancy at steady state and open system regimens. Recent innovations in this platform have expanded its utility beyond occupancy confirmation to include applications in polypharmacology and mechanism-of-action studies. Here, we provide an updated perspective on BRET target engagement assays as versatile tools for chemical biology and early-stage drug discovery.

Surface terminations critically govern the properties of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes), yet a universal strategy to obtain MXenes with uniform and controllable terminations remains elusive. Here we introduce a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching strategy that employs iodine vapour, halide molten salts and MAX phases to produce MXenes with pure and precisely tunable halogen terminations (Cl, Br, I or their combinations). In this process, halide molten salts dissolve iodine via interhalogen anion formation while efficiently transporting etching by-products. The resulting MXenes retain excellent structural integrity, yielding uniformly ordered surfaces. As a representative example, Ti3C2Cl2 shows a 160-fold enhancement in macroscopic conductivity and a 13-fold enhancement in terahertz conductivity relative to conventional Cl/O-terminated Ti3C2, attributed to minimized electron trapping and scattering. Beyond single-halogen terminations, the gas–liquid–solid approach enables dual- and triple-halogen termination control, providing a general platform for tailoring MXene surface chemistry towards advanced (opto)electronic applications.

Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, also known as MXenes, have emerged as a large group of multifunctional materials, characterized by the chemical formula Mn+1XnTx (M: transition metal, X: carbon or nitrogen, Tx: surface terminations)1. The Mn+1Xn core of MXenes comprises C/N layers sandwiched between transition metal layers. The partially filled d-orbitals of transition metals endow MXenes with a wealth of free electrons, resulting in outstanding electrical conductivity. The intrinsic metallic nature makes MXenes particularly appealing for applications where efficient charge transport is essential, such as electrocatalysis2, energy storage devices3, electromagnetic interference shielding4, terahertz detectors5 and various (opto)electronic devices. A distinguishing feature of MXenes is their adjustable surface terminations, which cover the exposed metal atoms on the MXene surface. These surface terminations have been shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to determine the intrinsic intralayer charge transport properties of MXenes by manipulating the electronic structure of the surface metal atoms6. In addition, they can markedly impact macroscopic charge transport in MXene films composed of multiple nanoflakes or grains7, with intergrain electron hopping being identified as the dominant mechanism8. However, the currently reported MXenes often possess mixed and mostly randomly distributed terminations, leading to surface disordering that causes severe electron trapping and scattering, consequently compromising the intrinsic charge transport9. Moreover, the lack of MXenes with uniform terminations poses a substantial obstacle to experimentally determining the impact of specific terminations on both intrinsic charge transport and intergrain electron hopping. Achieving this fundamental understanding is crucial for optimizing MXene properties and broadening their range of applications.

The random arrangement of terminations on MXenes stems from the intricate top-down etching synthesis process used to produce these materials from layered ternary metal carbides/nitrides (MAX phases). Typically, the synthesis process involves selectively removing the A-layers (for example, Al or Si) of MAX using strong acidic etchants, which exposes the transition metal atom layers to the surface. Anionic species in the reaction environment tend to bond with the exposed transition metal atoms for charge balance, acting as terminations on the MXene surface. The most common method employed is wet-chemistry etching using F- or Cl-containing aqueous acids, which generally yields MXenes with mixed terminations (–OH, –O or –F/–Cl) arranged randomly10,11. An alternative approach uses Lewis-acid halide salts as etchants in conjunction with molten salts to create a ‘solid–liquid' reaction environment under inert gas protection12,13,14. This approach also requires subsequent washing steps using aggressive oxidizing agents to eliminate side products, which inadvertently introduces O terminations and causes termination disordering. A few additional etching methods have also been proposed, including electrochemical and hydrothermal etching15,16. However, these approaches similarly result in MXenes characterized by mixed and randomly distributed terminations. Recently, a bottom-up approach was developed to synthesize Ti2CCl2 MXene with uniform terminations17, marking an important step towards MXene synthesis. Nonetheless, this method is currently limited to a few selected types of MXene. It is highly desirable to develop synthesis methods that can be universally applied to diverse MXenes, while ensuring ordered and uniform terminations.

In this work, we develop a ‘gas–liquid–solid' triphasic etching protocol (denoted GLS) that is capable of synthesizing diverse MXenes characterized by uniform and controllably orchestrated halogen terminations. The etching reaction involves solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salt and gas-phase I2 vapour. Iodine is selected as the etching agent because the generated by-products (for example, AlI3 and KI) can be readily removed through simple washing. The effectiveness of iodine as an etchant has been previously verified both in wet-solution phases and in a high-temperature vapour phase18,19,20. The halide molten salt acts as a crucial intermediate that dissolves the I2 etchant by forming interhalogen anions, creates a solid–liquid interface and facilitates the transport of side products for effective etching. After the etching reaction, a simple ethanol wash is able to completely remove generated side products and unreacted reactants, preventing contamination and disordering of the MXene terminations. We showcase the versatility of the GLS method by synthesizing MXenes from eight distinct types of MAX phase. Using Ti3C2 MXene as a representative example, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis of Ti3C2 with uniform Cl, Br and I terminations by utilizing different halide salts. The highly ordered and pure terminations of the yielded MXenes are confirmed by atomic-resolution ultralow-energy secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations. Importantly, our study highlights the critical role of uniform halogen terminations in substantially improving the charge transport properties of MXenes. For instance, the achieved Ti3C2Cl2 with ordered Cl terminations exhibits a 161.6-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity and a 12.7-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity compared with Ti3C2 with mixed Cl/O terminations (denoted ClO-Ti3C2). These enhancements are attributed to the mitigation of electron trapping and scattering, facilitated by the high structural ordering associated with the uniform Cl terminations. Furthermore, the GLS synthesis demonstrates the controllability to flexibly orchestrate the terminations of MXenes with dual-halogen and triple-halogen terminations. Six examples of Ti3C2 with varying proportions of mixed halogen terminations are successfully synthesized. This tunability opens avenues for further termination modifications with chalcogens or organic groups, as highlighted in previous studies6,21, thereby broadening their functional versatility.

We started by synthesizing MXenes with mono-halogen terminations using our GLS etching method. Typically, the GLS synthesis was conducted in a sealed glass tube containing iodine, potassium halide salt (KI, KBr or KCl), and MAX as the precursors (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Upon annealing, the precursors underwent a transformation into a triphasic system, comprising a solid-phase MAX phase, liquid-phase molten potassium halide and gas-phase I2 vapour. The molten potassium halide acted as a crucial reaction intermediate, facilitating the dissolution of I2 vapour by forming interhalogen anions (TI2−, T = I, Br or Cl), which enabled solid–liquid etching and aided in the transport of etchant (TI2−) and side products (AlI3 and KI). During the etching process, halogen anions from the molten salt attached to the exposed metal atoms of MXene, resulting in uniform and impurity-free terminations. Using Ti3AlC2 as a representative example, Fig. 1b illustrates the overall reaction process to obtain Ti3C2 MXenes with uniform halogen terminations (Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2). The overall reaction can be described by equation (1). The side products (AlI3) and unreacted I2 are highly soluble in ethanol, allowing easy removal by washing with ethanol in a glovebox. The generated KI and unreacted potassium halide salts are also soluble in ethanol and can be removed through iterative ethanol washing (Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall synthesis process of MXenes does not involve any hazards or oxidative compounds, effectively avoiding termination contamination. The synthesis yields of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 from 1 g of Ti3AlC2 are calculated to be 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively. We demonstrated the synthesis of up to 10 g of Ti3C2Cl2 in a single batch using a custom-designed laboratory set-up, highlighting its strong potential for industrial-scale production (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, apart from Ti3AlC2, our GLS approach also works for seven additional MAX phases, including Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, TiNbAlC, Nb2AlC, Nb4AlC3 and Mo2Ga2C. With an I2–KCl–MAX combination, we exemplified the successful synthesis of Ti3CNCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 4), Ti2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 5), Ti2NCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), TiNbCCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 7), Nb2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 8), Nb4C3Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 9) and Mo2CCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 10) with uniform halogen terminations.

a,b, Schematics showing the GLS method (a) and the evolution of the atomic structure during the synthesis of Ti3C2 MXene (b).

To validate the synthesis mechanism, we conducted annealing time-dependent ex situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å) analysis to track the compound evolution during the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Given the strong hygroscopic nature of AlI3, all samples underwent rapid ethanol washing before PXRD measurement, during which AlI3, together with I2, can be completely removed. By examining the (0002) peaks of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Cl2, we observed a gradual conversion from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2Cl2. After annealing for 54 h, Ti3AlC2 was fully converted to Ti3C2Cl2. In addition, with increasing annealing time, the intensity of characteristic KCl peaks exhibited a continuous weakening trend, while the intensity of characteristic KI peaks gradually increased. This phenomenon indicates the consumption of KCl during the reaction to form Cl terminations on MXenes, generating KI as the side product, thus confirming the reaction mechanism depicted in equation (1).

In addition, the formation of interhalogen anions during the synthesis process was confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy analysis, macroscopic colour changes on the annealing products and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 12). The presence of interhalogen anions was identified as a crucial factor in promoting etching efficiency. As a control study, PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig. 13) shows that potassium halide salts alone do not etch the MAX phase to yield MXenes in the GLS system. Moreover, we attempted to synthesize Ti3C2I2 MXene with a solid–gas biphasic system of I2 and Ti3AlC2. After 54 h of annealing, although the formation of Ti3C2I2 was detected in the synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) pattern, the presence of Ti3AlC2 was still evident, contrasting with the complete conversion of Ti3AlC2 achieved using our triphasic GLS method for the same duration of reaction (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Like MXenes synthesized through other methods, the obtained Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 2a), as well as Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 MXenes (Supplementary Fig. 15), display an accordion-like morphology, which is distinguished from the bulk morphology of Ti3AlC2. These layered MXenes can be further delaminated into single- or few-layer nanoflakes using a liquid-phase chemical exfoliation approach with n-butyllithium (Fig. 2b). The Ti3C2Cl2 nanoflakes suspended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) present a noticeable Tyndall effect when illuminated by a laser pointer. Meanwhile, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image discloses the single- or few-layer character of the exfoliated flakes, with the thickness of a single layer measuring approximately 1.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Ti K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were next collected to evaluate the chemical and local coordination environments of Ti atoms in the three MXenes. In the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 2c), all three Ti3C2 MXenes exhibit a similar spectrum shape to their corresponding metal carbide reference, TiC. The absorption edge energy (E0) values were determined to be 4,969.3 eV for Ti3C2Cl2, 4,968.8 eV for Ti3C2Br2 and 4,967.9 eV for Ti3C2I2. The noticeably higher E0 of Ti3C2Cl2 compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 suggests stronger hybridization between the surface Ti and Cl orbitals, probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms. Besides, Ti K-edge Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) R-space spectra were derived22 (Supplementary Fig. 17), and wavelet-transform analysis of EXAFS in R and k spaces was further performed for Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 2d), Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 2e) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 2f). The contour intensity reveals the coordination environment around Ti atoms, including the first-shell metal-termination scattering (1.67 Å for Ti–Cl, 1.73 Å for Ti–Br and 1.76 Å for Ti–I in R space) and second-shell Ti–C–Ti scattering (2.41 Å for Ti3C2Cl2, 2.55 Å for Ti3C2Br2 and 2.57 Å for Ti3C2I2 in R space). Overall, different halogen terminations cause slight changes in the Ti-termination distance and the Ti3C2 backbone thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of mono-halogen terminations in all three MXene samples (Supplementary Fig. 18). No iodine signals were detected in Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2, indicating that the terminations are entirely dependent on the molten salts used in the synthesis. In addition, the Ti 2p and C 1s spectra also indicate the integrity of the Ti3C2 backbone structure (Supplementary Fig. 19). It is important to note that the O 1s signals are attributed to C–O bonds, which may arise from lattice oxygen within the carbon layers, as previously reported6,23.

To elucidate the crystalline structures, SXRD patterns (λ = 0.4142 Å) of the three MXenes were collected, and their atomic structures were determined using DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig. 20). The detailed lattice parameters were derived through Rietveld refinement of the SXRD pattern with the simulated structures24 (Supplementary Table 1). As depicted in Fig. 2g, the SXRD pattern of Ti3C2Cl2 aligns well with a hexagonal structure characterized by the P63/mmc space group, exhibiting lattice parameters of a = b = 3.16 Å and c = 22.19 Å. Similarly, Ti3C2Br2 (a = b = 3.08 Å, c = 24.05 Å; Fig. 2h) and Ti3C2I2 (a = b = 3.09 Å, c = 25.19 Å; Fig. 2i) both exhibit a hexagonal structure. The interlayer distances follow the trend of Ti3C2I2 > Ti3C2Br2 > Ti3C2Cl2, consistent with the atomic size trend of I > Br > Cl.

We further sought to reveal the atomic arrangement of the three Ti3C2 MXenes by using quantitative atomic-resolution ultralow-energy SIMS23,25. This technique utilizes low-energy Cs+ ions to achieve layer-by-layer sputtering towards the sample surface at a high incident angle, enabling the elemental distribution to be resolved over the sample with atomic-depth resolution. As expected, the Ti3C2 backbone was distinctly identified in the quantitative SIMS analysis of Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 3a), Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 3b) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 3c). O signals were detected only in the C layers, consistent with the previous reports8,23. Notably, on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone, a monolayer of halogen atoms is visualized as the terminations, with no impurity elements detected between the Ti3C2 layers. Importantly, taking Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, depth profiling across multiple layers further verifies that each termination layer is uniformly Cl-terminated (Supplementary Fig. 21). For comparison, we synthesized ClO-Ti3C2 through the classic Lewis-acid molten salt approach12. By contrast, strong Cl and O signals were observed at the termination positions of ClO-Ti3C2 (Supplementary Fig. 22, and Supplementary Table 2). These findings underscore the uniform nature of the terminations on MXenes synthesized via our GLS method.

In addition, high-resolution TEM images and selected area electron diffraction patterns confirm the excellent crystallinity and hexagonal structure of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 23). High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) was further used to obtain atomic-resolution cross-sectional images of the MXenes. In Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 3d), three distinct Ti layers in the Ti3C2 backbone are clearly identified. Due to the relatively low atomic mass, the presence of Cl terminations on the Ti3C2 backbone is barely discernible. By contrast, the heavier atomic masses of Br and I in Ti3C2Br2 (Fig. 3e) and Ti3C2I2 (Fig. 3f) are more clearly visible in the HAADF-STEM images, where they appear as distinct monolayers on both sides of the Ti3C2 backbone. The interlayer distances of Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 were determined to be 1.12 nm, 1.21 nm and 1.28 nm, respectively, in close agreement with the SXRD analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images of Ti3C2Cl2 (Supplementary Fig. 24), Ti3C2Br2 (Supplementary Fig. 25) and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 26) reveal a uniform distribution of Ti, C and halogen elements within individual MXene particles. Quantitative analysis (Supplementary Table 3) indicates that the chemical formulas of the three MXenes can be represented as Ti2.9±0.3C2.0±0.2Cl2.0±0.3O0.1±0.03, Ti3.2±0.3C1.8±0.1Br1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04 and Ti3.3±0.3C1.9±0.1I1.6±0.2O0.1±0.04, closely resembling the ideal Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 formulas. A small amount of oxygen detected is attributable to lattice oxygen in Ti3C2, consistent with our SIMS analysis. In addition, to systematically evaluate the air-oxidation resistance of MXenes synthesized via our GLS method, we conducted time-dependent XPS and atomic-resolution SIMS on Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Figs. 27–29). All samples were obtained from the same batch and stored under ambient conditions for defined periods before testing. The results consistently show that MXenes produced by the GLS method remain stable in air for at least 8 weeks, with no substantial structural changes, particularly in the termination layers.

The highly pure and ordered terminations are expected to minimize electron trapping and scattering in MXenes, potentially leading to a substantial improvement in their charge transport properties. We first assessed the direct-current conductivities σdc of MXene pellets utilizing the temperature-dependent van der Pauw method (Fig. 4a). In general, macroscopic charge transport in MXene-based pellets is dominated by thermally activated intergrain electron hopping, leading to a continuously increasing conductivity as the temperature rises9,26. However, both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 exhibit metallic behaviour from 300 K down to ~100 K, with conductivity decreasing as temperature increases. Below 100 K, conductivities of both Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti3C2Br2 rise with increasing temperature. Hall effect measurements on ultrathin Ti3C2Cl2 film further confirmed this phenomenon (Supplementary Fig. 30a,b), which can be attributed to electron localization effects. A similar transition from high-temperature metallic to low-temperature localized electron transport has previously been observed in highly controlled epitaxial thin films of related materials27. Notably, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibited the highest electrical conductivity (51,380 S m−1 at 300 K), compared with Ti3C2Br2 (11,126 S m−1 at 300 K) and Ti3C2I2 (4,149 S m−1 at 300 K). Moreover, we measured the electrical conductivity of previously reported ClO-Ti3C2 (ref. 12) and Ti3C2 MXene synthesized via the conventional wet-chemistry hydrofluoric acid (HF)-etching method10 (denoted HF-Ti3C2) for comparison. Impressively, the Ti3C2Cl2 achieved approximately 160-fold and 13.5-fold increases in macroscopic electrical conductivity relative to ClO-Ti3C2 (318 S m−1 at 300 K) and HF-Ti3C2 (3,815 S m−1 at 300 K), respectively. To better compare the macroscopic electrical conductivity with reported literatures, we fabricated MXene thin films from delaminated MXene flakes and measured their conductivity using the van der Pauw method (Supplementary Fig. 30c). At 300 K, Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 films exhibited conductivities of approximately 16,000, 3,000 and 800 S cm⁻1, respectively. For comparison, ClO-Ti3C2 and HF-Ti3C2 showed conductivities of approximately 400 and 7,300 S cm⁻1, respectively. These values are comparable with those reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, time-dependent electrical conductivity measurements further demonstrated that Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits superior oxidation resistance compared with ClO-Ti3C2. After 4 weeks of air exposure, the conductivity of the Ti3C2Cl2 film decreased by only 12.5%, whereas that of ClO-Ti3C2 dropped by 86.5% (Supplementary Fig. 31). Both the temperature-dependent behaviour and the relatively high electrical conductivity in macroscopic specimens highlight the excellent chemical and structural quality of the synthesized materials.

We further explored intraflake transport in our MXenes using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, leveraging the transient nature of the terahertz electric field to probe short-range charge transport properties at the nanoscale9,28,29. We first conducted frequency-resolved static terahertz conductivity across a ~0.3–2.1 THz range (Supplementary Fig. 32), with the average terahertz conductivity values derived and compared in Fig. 4b. Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits the highest average terahertz conductivity (5,056 S m−1), surpassing that of Ti3C2Br2 (3,230 S m−1) and Ti3C2I2 (1,551 S m−1) (Methods). Compared with ClO-Ti3C2 (397 S m−1), Ti3C2Cl2 achieved a 13-fold increase in terahertz conductivity, highlighting a substantial enhancement in its intrinsic intraflake conductivity. Considering the 160-fold improvement in macroscopic electrical conductivity, we conclude that the uniform Cl terminations in Ti3C2Cl2 also substantially enhance intragrain electron hopping compared with ClO-Ti3C2.

Optical pump–terahertz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy elucidated the charge carrier dynamics and mechanisms governing the intrinsic intraflake charge transport of MXenes. In the OPTP measurement, additional charge carriers were photogenerated in MXenes using an optical pump pulse (1.55 eV laser pulse with ~50 fs duration) and then probed by a single-cycle terahertz pulse. The relative attenuation of the terahertz field (−ΔE/E) is directly linked to the terahertz photoconductivity (∆σTHz). Figure 4c illustrates the photoconductivity dynamics of our three MXenes in comparison with ClO-Ti3C2. In each sample, a transient increase in photoconductivity signifies the generation of free carriers, followed by rapid decay due to recombination or trapping effects9. Moreover, ∆σTHz is correlated with the charge carrier mobility (µ) as described by equation (2), where N, e, ϕ and Nabs represent the charge carrier density, elementary charge, photon-to-free-charge conversion quantum yield and absorbed photon density, respectively. Assuming a similar ϕ for all MXene samples, the highest photoconductivity per absorbed photon density (∆σTHz/Nabs) observed in Ti3C2Cl2 (9.3 × 10−18 S m) indicates its largest charge carrier mobility, while that of ClO-Ti3C2 is 2.6 × 10−18 S m. Quantitatively, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates a 3.6-fold enhancement in charge carrier mobility compared with ClO-Ti3C2.

DFT calculations were used to simulate the band structures of Ti3C2 MXenes, providing deeper insights into how Cl terminations enhance charge transport properties. We noticed that different halogen terminations substantially alter the band structure of Ti3C2 MXene, with Ti3C2Cl2 (Fig. 4d) exhibiting the highest electron density around the Fermi level compared with Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 (Supplementary Fig. 33). This effect is probably due to the higher electronegativity of Cl atoms, which enhances hybridization between the surface Ti and halogen orbitals. We also simulated the band structure of ClO-Ti3C2 (with a Cl/O ratio of 0.6/1.4; Supplementary Fig. 34), which presents minimal differences compared with Ti3C2Cl2. To further assess the impact of termination purity, electron transport through Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2 lattices was simulated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method in a two-probe pattern. Figure 4e and Fig. 4f visualize the electron transmission pathways within the Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2 lattices, respectively. Clearly, Ti3C2Cl2 demonstrates superior electron delocalization across the probes, whereas ClO-Ti3C2 shows notable electron localization near the left probe, leading to strong electron scattering. This interpretation is further supported by the quantified current–voltage curves (Fig. 4g) and electron transmittance patterns (Supplementary Fig. 35) of Ti3C2Cl2 and ClO-Ti3C2. Together, these experimental and theoretical findings emphasize the critical role of uniform Cl terminations in enhancing the charge transport capabilities of MXenes.

Electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the practical applicability of the halogen-terminated samples30. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36a, Ti3C2Cl2 exhibits strong EMW absorption in a frequency range of ~14–18 GHz, with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −51.4 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 4.6 GHz. Meanwhile, Ti3C2Br2 exhibits strong absorption in the ~12–17 GHz range, with an RLmin of −54.6 dB and an EABmax of 4.6 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36b). In comparison, Ti3C2I2 shows weaker EMW absorption, mainly in the ~16–18 GHz range, with an RLmin of −27.5 dB and an EABmax of 4.7 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36c). This RLmin value is much higher than the previously reported Ti3C2Tx (~−20 dB) prepared by wet-chemistry methods31,32. By contrast, ClO-Ti3C2 shows its primary absorption at lower frequencies of ~6–9 GHz, with a RLmin of −61.4 dB and an EABmax of 4.4 GHz (Supplementary Fig. 36d). These results demonstrate that tuning the surface terminations can effectively shift the primary EMW absorption frequency range of Ti3C2 MXenes. This result suggests a promising strategy for designing MXene-based absorbers tailored to specific frequency bands for various practical applications.

The strong dependence of MXene charge transport properties on termination type further motivated us to pursue controllable orchestration of halogen terminations on MXenes through our GLS synthesis method. In particular, DFT calculations not only revealed that mixed-halogen terminations are thermodynamically stable, but also demonstrated that they possess a more stable structure compared with single-halogen terminations (Supplementary Fig. 37). We noticed that the termination type of MXenes is directly determined by the chosen molten salt in the GLS synthesis. While mono-type potassium halide salts were initially used to achieve single-halogen terminations, we further employed mixed molten salts to synthesize MXenes with dual- and triple-halogen terminations. Specifically, we synthesized Ti3C2 MXene with mixed halogen terminations: I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. 5a), I:Cl = 1:1 (Fig. 5b), Br:Cl = 1:1 (Fig. 5c) and I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1 (Fig. 5d). In addition, taking Ti3C2 with mixed I/Br terminations as a model, we demonstrated precise control over the I/Br termination ratio with I:Br = 1:1 (Fig. 5a), I:Br = 1:2 (Fig. 5e) and I:Br = 2:1 (Fig. 5f). These examples showcase the capability of our GLS method in controllably orchestrating halogen terminations, which would further expand the MXene family and offer a venue to precisely customize the intrinsic properties of MXenes. Finally, Supplementary Table 5 compares the GLS method with previously reported MXene synthesis approaches, underscoring its unique advantages in termination chemistry, structural stability, production scalability and electrical conductivity.

In summary, we have demonstrated a triphasic GLS etching method that is applicable to eight different types of MAX phase, enabling the production of their corresponding MXenes with uniform halogen terminations. This process integrates solid-phase MAX precursors, liquid-phase halide molten salts and gas-phase I2 vapour. The resulting MXenes are characterized by highly pure and ordered halogen terminations (Cl, Br or I). As a representative case, Ti3C2Cl2 synthesized via this method exhibited a 160-fold improvement in macroscopic charge transport, a 13-fold enhancement in static terahertz conductivity and a 3.6-fold rise in charge carrier mobility, compared with ClO-Ti3C2. These enhancements are attributed to the uniform Cl terminations with superior structural ordering, which effectively reduces electron trapping and scattering. In addition, the GLS synthesis demonstrated the capability for controllable orchestration of dual- and triple-halogen terminations on MXenes. Beyond broadening the MXene family with finely adjustable properties, controlled halogen terminations offer the potential for further surface functionalization, such as selective postsubstitution or covalent grafting on specific halogen terminations6,21. We envision that our GLS method will accelerate the development of MXenes with customized properties for advanced (opto)electronics and beyond.

Ti3AlC2 and Nb2AlC MAX phases were purchased from Carbon-Ukraine. Ti3AlCN, Ti2AlC, TiNbAlC, Mo2Ga2C, Ti2AlN and Nb4AlC3 MAX phases were purchased from Jilin 11 Technology. Elemental iodine (I2), 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution in hexane, N-methylformamide (NMF), ethyl acetate (EA), HNO3, cellulose and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexane, tetrahydrofuran, potassium iodide (KI) and potassium bromide (KBr) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. High-purity ethanol (absolute, analytical reagent grade) was bought from Fisher Chemical. All chemicals were used directly without any purification.

The GLS method used MAX phase, elemental iodine and halide salts to create a triphasic system for MXene synthesis. Taking the synthesis of Ti3C2Cl2 as an example, typically, 500 mg Ti3AlC2, 1,956 mg I2 and 575 mg KCl were mixed (molar ratio of 1:3:3) and placed in a home-made glass tube (Supplementary Fig. 1). The tube was connected to a Schlenk line, purged with Ar gas three times to completely remove air and then vacuum-sealed to 10−2 mbar. The tube was flame-sealed with a butane torch (model: CHF CF211). Due to the volatility of I2, precursor materials were kept at the bottom of the glass tube in an ice-water bath during sealing to prevent iodine vapourization. The sealed glass tube was calcined at 600 °C in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for 54 h. After the reaction, the product was removed from the glass tube and washed eight times with high-purity ethanol to remove by-products such as AlI3 and KI, as well as unreacted KCl and I2. Each washing step involved 10 min of sonication in an ice-water bath to assist in dissolving any remaining salts. These washing steps were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox to prevent MXene oxidation. Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at room temperature for 24 h to obtain Ti3C2Cl2.

The synthesis of Ti3CNCl2, Ti2CCl2, Ti2NCl2, TiNbCCl2, Nb2CCl2, Nb4C3Cl2 and Mo2CCl2 was conducted using the same methodology. The synthesis process of Ti3C2Br2 and Ti3C2I2 follows a similar procedure, differing only in the choice of molten salt: the Ti3AlC2–I2–KBr combination for Ti3C2Br2 and the Ti3AlC2–I2–KI combination for Ti3C2I2. For MXenes with dual- and triple-halogen terminations, precursor ratios were adjusted as follows: Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:2.5:0.5) for I:Br = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KCl (1:3:2.9:0.1) for I:Cl = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KBr–KCl (1:3:2.5:0.5) for Br:Cl = 1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr–KCl (1:3:2.8:0.1:0.1) for I:Br:Cl = 1:1:1, Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:1.5:1.5) for I:Br = 1:2 and Ti3AlC2–I2–KI–KBr (1:3:2.9:0.1) for I:Br = 2:1. Ti3C2I2-GS was synthesized following the same method as Ti3C2I2 but without the inclusion of any halide salts. The synthesis of ClO-Ti3C2 was conducted according to a previously reported procedure12.

The delamination process of MXenes was carried out using an intercalation method8. Initially, 50 mg of MXenes and 1 ml of 2.5 M n-butyllithium solution were mixed in an Ar-filled glovebox and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Following this, the material underwent washing steps with high-purity hexane and tetrahydrofuran. The washed sample was then transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of anhydrous NMF and sonicated in an ice-water bath (<5 °C) for 40 min. The solution was centrifuged at 360g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min to isolate MXene nanoflakes, which were then dispersed in anhydrous NMP for subsequent use.

XPS was analysed by an Axis Supra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). PXRD was performed by the AERIS XRD system (PANalytical) using Cu Kα. SEM images were collected using Zeiss Gemini S4 500. AFM images were collected using Park NX10 AFM. TEM investigations were conducted using a Talos F200X transmission microscope at 200 kV. The measurements were carried out in a STEM mode using the high-angle annular dark-field detector. EDX was used for chemical composition analysis. SIMS was performed via CAMECA IMS SC Ultra instrument with a Cs+ primary-ion beam23. The primary ion beam featured an ultralow impact energy of 100 eV, a moderate current of 6 nA and a standard spot diameter of 30 µm. Measurements were conducted using a negative detector polarity. Initially, a parallel beam of primary Cs+ ions was applied to gently remove surface impurities and promote the formation of a flat, clean crystal surface. Subsequently, low-energy Cs+ ions were directed towards the sample at a high incident angle to ensure selective interaction with only the topmost atomic layer. During this bombardment, atoms from the sample surface were sputtered off and detected as secondary ions.

Synchrotron XAS measurements were conducted at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The XAS spectra were acquired in transmission mode at room temperature with photon energies centred around the Ti K edge (4,966 eV). The incident, transmitted and reference X-ray intensities were recorded using gas ionization chambers. A titanium foil standard was simultaneously measured with the samples and used for energy calibration. Before measurements, all powder samples were pressed into 8-mm pellets, homogeneously mixed with an appropriate amount of cellulose, and sealed between Kapton tapes inside an Ar-filled glovebox. The collected XANES and EXAFS data were subsequently processed and corrected using the Athena software (version 0.9.26)22. The wavelet transform analysis of the EXAFS spectra was carried out using the HAMA Fortran software. The EXAFS oscillation function, χ(k) (k-weights: 2), was extracted as a function of the photoelectron wave number k, within the selected radial range of 0–6 Å (Rmin = 0, Rmax = 6). The Morlet function was chosen as the mother wavelet, with parameters set to kappaMorlet = 10 and sigmaMorlet = 1. SXRD measurements were performed at the BL04 beamline of the ALBA synchrotron facility using an incident energy of 35 keV (λ = 0.4142 Å) and a high-angular-resolution multicrystal analyser detector set-up. The MXene powders were loaded into 0.3-mm-diameter glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH) and mounted on the dedicated sample stage provided by the beamline. The collected SXRD data were analysed using the GSAS-II software, and Rietveld refinement was used to determine the lattice parameters24.

The macroscopic direct current temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the MXene pellets was measured using the van der Pauw method in a commercial Physical Property Measurement System cryostat equipped with the electrical transport option and automatic contact switching (Quantum Design). Ohmic contacts were established using gold-plated spring-loaded probes on the clean surfaces of the MXene pellets. MXene pellets were made by using compressed powders with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of less than approximately 1 mm. The sheet resistance (Rs) of the pellet in the temperature range of ~5–300 K was determined to calculate the bulk electrical resistivity (ρ) and electrical conductivity (σdc). MXene ultrathin films used for the conductivity measurement were prepared as follows. First, exfoliated MXenes were dispersed in NMF to form a stable suspension (~1 mg ml−1). A volume of 1.5 ml of this suspension was then added to 40 ml of deionized water in a 60-ml wide-mouth beaker, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 1 M HNO3 to stabilize the surface potential. After thorough mixing, 2 ml of EA was introduced, and the beaker was covered to approximately 90% of its opening, allowing the EA to evaporate slowly. Once the EA had completely evaporated, the MXene nanosheets spontaneously self-assembled into a continuous single-layer ultrathin film at the water-air interface. These films were subsequently transferred onto gold prepatterned four-probe SiO2/Si substrates and dried under vacuum. To minimize cracks or discontinuities, two layers of film were transferred for each sample.

Terahertz spectroscopy was conducted using a commercial regenerative amplified mode-locked Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser system (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace, seeded by Mai Tai and pumped by Empower). The laser produced ~50-fs pulses centred at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Terahertz radiation was generated via optical rectification in a nonlinear zinc telluride (ZnTe) crystal oriented along the (110) direction. The transmitted THz electric field was detected using a second ZnTe crystal through the electro-optic sampling technique, probed by an 800-nm gating pulse. This configuration allowed frequency-resolved measurements in the range of 0.2−2.5 THz.

To determine the terahertz conductivity of MXene thin films without photoexcitation, the transmitted terahertz pulse through the sample (Esample) was compared with that through a reference substrate (Ereference). When the film thickness (d) is much smaller than the terahertz wavelength (d/λ << 1), the thin-film approximation can be applied, as illustrated in equation (3). Here, \(T\,(=\frac{{E}_{\mathrm{sample}}}{{E}_{\mathrm{reference}}})\) denotes the transmission ratio between the sample and reference signals, ∆σTHz represents the complex terahertz conductivity, Z0 = 377 Ω is the impedance of free space and nsub = 1.95 corresponds to the refractive index of the fused-silica substrate in the terahertz range.

For OPTP measurements, the terahertz absorption induced by photoexcited charge carriers (excitation wavelength 800 nm) was monitored by fixing the sampling beam at the peak of the terahertz electric field. Time-dependent, pump-induced terahertz absorption was recorded by varying the temporal delay between the pump and terahertz probe pulses. To eliminate interference from water vapour absorption, the entire terahertz set-up was continuously purged with dry nitrogen. During measurements, the samples were either maintained under a dry nitrogen atmosphere or kept under vacuum (<2 × 10−4 mbar). The time-resolved photoconductive response (∆σTHz) of charge carriers was determined from the time-dependent change in the transmitted terahertz field (∆E) using the thin-film approximation, as expressed by equation (4), where Epump and E0 correspond to the peak amplitudes of the transmitted terahertz field with and without optical excitation, respectively.

Similar to previously reported methods30, all samples were mixed with paraffin and fabricated into concentric rings with an inner diameter of 3.04 mm and an outer diameter of 7 mm for testing. The measurements were carried out using a standard coaxial-line method, using a vector network analyser (N5222B) to record the electromagnetic parameters, including the complex permittivity (εr = ε′ – jε′) and permeability (μr = μ;′ – jμ′).

Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)33,34, based on the plane-wave projector augmented-wave method. The exchange-correlation functional was used in the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof35. Van der Waals interactions were taken into account by using the Grimme (DFT-D3) method36. An energy cut-off of 500 eV was set for all the simulations. The Brillouin zone of the systems was sampled using 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst−Pack k-points37. The VASPKIT code was used for postprocessing of the VASP calculated data38. The electron transport was calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function technique as implemented in the Atomistix ToolKit package (QuantumWise A/S. Atomistix ToolKit, Version 2016.4). We used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with single-zeta plus polarization numerical basis sets for all the transport simulations. The kinetic energy cut-off of 75 Ryd was set for the self-consistent calculations. A fast Fourier transform solver was used to address the system's Poisson–Schrödinger equation in a self-consistent manner. The transport models were treated as two-probe systems with the central scattering region sandwiched between the semi-infinite source (left) and drain (right) electrodes from the same. The current through the scattering region is calculated within the Landauer formula (equation (5)), where \({T}\left(\varepsilon ,{V}\right)\) represents the energy- and voltage-resolved transmission function, f is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function and \({\mu }_{{\rm{L}},{\rm{R}}}={E}_{{\rm{f}}}\pm eV/2\) stands for the chemical potentials of the left and right electrodes. The transport calculations were performed at T = 300 K.

Insufficient functional T cell persistence impedes therapeutic success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies. Here we performed a CAR-adapted base-editing screen of PIK3CD, a key regulator of T cell function, metabolism and fate. We identified point mutations that beneficially modulate CAR T cell profiles in 4-1BBz and 28z CAR T cells, respectively. We found that point mutations with differing effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) signaling activity were advantageous in distinct CAR contexts: The PI3Kδ-activating substitution E81K enhanced proliferation, metabolic fitness and effector function of 4-1BBz CARs, promoting long-term functional persistence and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, the PI3Kδ-attenuating substitution L32P improved T cell memory formation and functionality of 28z CAR T cells. Together, our approach of rational optimization of activation-dependent signaling through targeted allelic reprogramming (ROADSTAR) illustrates the importance of CAR design-specific fine-tuning of intrinsic T cell signaling and demonstrates the potential of base editing for next-generation cellular therapies.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are an effective treatment option against refractory or relapsed B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma1,2,3,4. US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR designs incorporate CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory molecules fused to the intracellular CD3z chain (‘28z' or ‘BBz') to reprogram T cell metabolism, function and phenotypic properties2,5. Despite high initial response rates in persons with hematological malignancies, CAR-mediated therapeutic efficacy is insufficient in a substantial number of persons and response rates against solid tumors are poor6,7,8,9,10.

Inherent T cell characteristics critically determine the therapeutic potency and clinical responses of CAR therapies11,12,13. In line with the pivotal role of signaling strength in T cell biology, the signaling domains incorporated in the CAR design thereby critically affect the characteristics and function of the cell product14,15,16,17,18. Furthermore, introduction of single-nucleotide mutations in the genome by CRISPR base editing can positively and negatively tune effector T cell responses19,20,21. To enable potent CAR T cell efficacy in vivo, we hypothesized that it may be crucial to modulate T cell activity in consideration of the unique signaling activities imparted by the CAR itself. Prototypic 28z-based CARs are associated with high effector function and a more rapid T cell expansion relative to BBz-based CARs but are more prone to T cell exhaustion and demonstrate reduced persistence in vivo2,22. These differences have been linked to the engagement of noncanonical NF-κB that promotes oxidative phosphorylation and improved memory formation in BBz CAR T cells and the PI3K–AKT pathway that fosters aerobic glycolysis and differentiation into an effector phenotype in the context of 28z CARs5,23.

Recent bioengineering strategies have leveraged T cell signaling modulation to advance CAR therapies. We and others have focused on the attenuation of CAR-mediated signaling strength to prevent early differentiation and exhaustion in 28z CAR T cells17,24. Conversely, approaches to augment signaling strength to boost T cell activation have been beneficial for BBz-based CAR T cells15,25. Other approaches involve the overexpression of complementary DNA (cDNA) or gene disruption to transcriptionally, epigenetically and/or metabolically rewire CAR T cell profiles25,26,27,28. However, these methods do not allow precisely calibrating the activation of downstream genes and pathways and uncoupling signaling from endogenous positive and negative feedback regulation.

We hypothesized that precision T cell engineering by rational optimization of activation-dependent signaling through targeted allelic reprogramming (ROADSTAR) would result in enhanced and optimized CAR T cell therapies.

Herein, we performed a CRISPR base-editing screen in the p110δ adaptor-binding domain (ABD) of PIK3CD (NCBI gene ID 5293) to identify point mutations resulting in functional improvement of prototypic 1928z and 19BBz CAR T cells. We identified specific mutations in this regulatory domain of p110δ that were enriched under repetitive antigen stimulation in either CAR design. Base-editing hits were associated with contrasting effects on PI3K–AKT signaling strength in 28z relative to BBz CAR T cells, thereby conferring favorable attributes to each CAR product while preserving their ascribed beneficial properties. The PI3Kδ-activating substitution E81K resulted in long-term functional persistence of BBz CAR T cells without evidence of malignant transformation and was associated with superior tumor control of hematological and solid tumors in vivo. Conversely, the substitution L32P attenuated PI3Kδ signaling and altered 28z CAR T cell properties toward favorable memory features, leading to enhanced survival in a metastatic neuroblastoma model in vivo. Together, these data nominate the induction of targeted point mutations in CAR T cells as an effective way to endogenously fine-tune signaling strength for enhanced long-term antitumor activity in vivo and underscore the importance of CAR-adapted precision engineering to unleash the full potential of CAR therapies.

Costimulation provided by CD28 activates PI3K–AKT signaling and drives effector functions in T cells, whereas 4-1BB-mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling promotes T cell survival (Fig. 1a)29,30,31. Cognizant of the key role of PI3K–AKT signaling in shaping (CAR) T cell fate and metabolism32,33, we sought to explore whether alteration of PI3K signaling strength could provide therapeutic benefit for CAR T cells. Phosphorylated (p)AKT (at residue S473) levels revealed marked differences in signaling strength upon antigen stimulation between 28z and BBz CAR T cells, with high pathway activity in 28z and moderate pAKT levels in BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 1b). In lymphocytes, PI3K signaling strength is mainly regulated by PI3Kδ, which is composed of the catalytic subunit p110δ (encoded by the gene PIK3CD) and the regulatory subunit p85 (encoded by the gene PIK3R1)34. We hypothesized that incorporation of single-point mutations in the ABD of PIK3CD—the domain that regulates the interaction of the catalytic subunit p110δ with the regulatory subunit p85—can be leveraged to calibrate PI3K–AKT signaling activity in CAR T cells.

We first established conditions to efficiently induce point mutations in primary human CAR T cells using the cytosine base editor (CBE; AncBE4max)35 and adenine base editor (ABE; ABEmax)35. The simultaneous delivery of CBE mRNA with a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the T cell receptor β chain (TRBC1 and TRBC2) by inducing a premature stop codon resulted in an effective disruption of the endogenous TRBC locus in CAR T cells. This led to a loss of cell-surface CD3 expression, enabling a fast and facile flow-cytometry-based readout that served as a reference for assessing editing efficiencies (Fig. 1c)36. This method yielded editing efficiencies of up to 75% and established a reliable basis for the implementation of our ROADSTAR platform (Fig. 1d), integrating a pooled base-editing screen to systematically evaluate the role of induced point mutations in the ABD of PIK3CD within CAR T cells.

We designed an sgRNA library of n = 34 sgRNAs predicted to induce a single-amino-acid change in the ABD of PIK3CD (https://bedict.forone.red/#/per-base) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and included different control sgRNAs to guide cutoff values for determining hits and to calibrate results of the screen. An RASA2-targeting sgRNA served as a positive control given its role as a signaling checkpoint whose ablation enhances 1928z CAR T cell activity37,38. In addition, two sgRNAs predicted to result in a functional loss of CD19, which is absent in T cells, served as ‘neutral' controls. To restrict gene editing to CAR-positive cells in the screening setup, we generated a combined CD19-specific CAR sgRNA γ-retroviral vector (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and confirmed efficient editing in this system after transfection of the cells with the respective base editor mRNA by assessing TRBC knockout (KO) efficiencies in primary CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, we transduced T cells of two individual healthy donors with the sgRNA library containing 1928z or 19BBz CAR constructs followed by electroporation with the respective base editor mRNA (Fig. 1d). Base-edited 1928z and 19BBz CAR T cell pools were evaluated in an in vitro CAR T cell ‘stress test' with repetitive exposure to CD19-expressing Nalm6 leukemia cells (Fig. 1d). Abundance of each point mutation was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) before exposure of CAR T cells to the target cells and after repeated tumor stimulations, allowing us to determine individual edits that provide a functional advantage to CAR T cells through proliferative competition under antigen stimulation (Fig. 1d). As expected, the abundance of point mutations resulting in CD19 KO did not significantly change during the 3-week coculture assay and the point mutation conferring a loss of RASA2 was enriched in the context of 1928z CAR T cells. Importantly, results were consistent across both donors, confirming the robustness of our screening approach (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e).

In 19BBz CAR T cells, an E81K mutant showed the highest enrichment over the 3-week assay (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1d,f). In 1928z CAR T cells, an L32P mutant was most strongly enriched after repetitive tumor stimulations (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1e,g). Interestingly, the most highly enriched substitution within each CAR setting showed the strongest differential enrichment when comparing 1928z and 19BBz CARs (Fig. 1g), underscoring the difference in underlying signaling patterns afforded by the relevant costimulatory domains.

To predict potential functional consequences of the identified substitutions, we used the published crystal structure of PI3Kδ and overlaid the wild-type (WT) amino acid sequence with the respective virtually mutated sequences (Fig. 1h). The biochemical properties suggest that the insertion of the structural rigid proline instead of leucine might result in conformational changes that potentially affect the interaction site of the catalytic and the regulatory subunit of PI3Kδ located next to the substitution position 32 (Fig. 1h). The E81K substitution results in a charge reversal as glutamate is replaced by lysine. The proximity to other positively charged residues in the linker region next to E81 potentially results in notable structural changes, suggesting relevant effects on the interaction of p110δ with p85 and, subsequently, on the levels of PI3Kδ activity (Fig. 1h).

To evaluate the effect of the most enriched base edits on CAR T cell biology, we first confirmed successful editing induced by coelectroporation of T cells with base editor mRNA and the respective synthetic sgRNA followed by retroviral CAR transduction. This approach yielded high editing efficiencies, typically exceeding 50% for the E81K substitution in 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Editing efficiencies for the L32P substitution in 1928z CAR T cells were typically around 30% and single-cell analysis revealed a mixture of clones harboring either monoallelic or biallelic edits (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Importantly, haplotype analysis did not reveal consistent enrichment of additional mutations co-occurring with the respective top hits E81K or L32P across donors, supporting on-target specificity and functional relevance of the identified top hits (Extended Data Fig. 1f–i).

To evaluate the effects of the L32P and E81K substitutions on PI3K–AKT signaling activity, we assessed the levels of pAKT (at residue T308) in edited CAR T cells upon antigen encounter. Induction of the E81K substitution resulted in a notable increase in pAKT in 19BBz CAR T cells but not to the extent of 1928z CAR T cells (Fig. 1i,j). Conversely, the L32P point mutant dampened the signaling response in 1928z CAR T cells as indicated by reduced pAKT levels (Fig. 1i,j).

Given the intermediate activation of the PI3K pathway in E81K-edited 19BBz CARs as compared to control 19BBz and 1928z CAR T cells, we examined effects on downstream signaling. Primary E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells showed increased phosphorylation of PI3K–AKT effectors relative to controls without reaching the levels achieved in 1928z CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). These results were independently validated in CAR T cells generated from a SUP-T1 single-cell clone engineered to carry a homozygous E81K substitution and from patient-derived T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Notably, increased pAKT induced by E81K was only detected upon antigen exposure of CAR T cells while basal pAKT activity remained similar to controls (Extended Data Fig. 2e), indicating that the E81K edit enhances signaling capacities only upon antigen stimulation. Other key signaling pathways in T cell activation such as the MAPK–ERK pathway remained unaffected by the E81K edit (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

Consistent with these findings, the E81K substitution resulted in an increased fraction of CD69+ BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 2a) and in enhanced differentiation to an effector memory T cell state (Fig. 2b). These changes were associated with a considerably increased antigen-dependent proliferation capacity and a significantly enhanced cytolytic activity of E81K-edited relative to control 19BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Transcriptional profiles confirmed upregulation of key genes related to cytokine production, effector function, proliferation and cell cycle in E81K-edited compared to mock BBz CAR T cells and indicated enhanced metabolic fitness induced by the E81K substitution (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Furthermore, the greater signaling response of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells was associated with improved sensitivity to low antigen levels, resulting in superior proliferation and killing in antigen-low tumor settings (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k), a known limitation of prototypic 19BBz CARs25,39.

Data are representative of n = 2 biologically independent donors.

To expand the applicability of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells, we assessed their antitumor activity across multiple disease models. The E81K substitution enhanced BBz CAR functionality against a broad range of targets and malignancies, including hematological and solid tumors. This benefit was observed in CAR T cells generated from both healthy donors and heavily pretreated patients with cancer, underscoring the translational potential of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a–h).

The improved functionality of BBz-based CAR T cells relied on the endogenous modulation of PI3K signaling as exogenous cDNA-mediated overexpression of p110δ impaired antitumor activity of 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3i), highlighting the importance of precisely balancing PI3K signaling in CAR T cells.

To further delineate CAR T cell effector function at the single-cell level, we performed live-cell imaging of E81K-edited or control L1CAM-BBz CAR T cells in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel cocultures with endogenously L1CAM-expressing Sh-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells (Extended Data Fig. 3j). E81K-edited CAR T cells required fewer and shorter interactions with target cells to induce apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l), resulting in substantially higher and faster induction of target cell apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 3m). Additionally, long-term time-lapse microscopy revealed an improved migratory phenotype of base-edited CAR T cells demonstrating increased speed (Extended Data Fig. 3n). Altogether, these studies indicate that E81K-edited CAR T cells are more efficient in tumor cell killing, reinforcing their overall increased functionality and resulting in improved tumor control relative to nonedited CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3o,p).

To test whether these enhanced phenotypic and functional properties of E81K-edited CAR T cells translate into superior tumor control in vivo, we turned to the well-established preclinical Nalm6 leukemia mouse model (Fig. 2d). To prevent graft-versus-host disease and enable long-term monitoring of mice, we additionally applied base editing to induce TRBC KO in E81K-edited and mock CAR T cells. E81K-edited 19BBz CAR T cells elicited enhanced tumor control compared to control CAR T cells and could induce long-term remissions in mice, resulting in significantly improved survival (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Given recent concerns of toxicity or malignant transformation40, we performed in-depth safety analyses of E81K-edited CAR T cells. Long-term culture of E81K-modified 19BBz CARs without or with cytokine support did not show aberrant cell growth in the absence of antigen stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Likewise, mice treated with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells exhibited no signs of morbidity or changes in weight in long-term follow up studies (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Furthermore, necropsies of treated mice 66 days after CAR T cell infusion did not identify aberrant T cell numbers, infiltration or morphology and verified intact organ structures and cellular architectures (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Flow cytometric analyses confirmed similar T cell numbers between E81K-modified and control CAR T cells across different tissues including liver, lung, kidney and brain (Extended Data Fig. 4e) and liver enzymes remained unaffected in mice treated with E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). Lastly, serum cytokine measurements did not indicate any cytokine release syndrome-associated signatures induced by E81K-edited CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Taken together, there were no signs of lymphomagenesis or increased side effects associated with the improved functional persistence of E81K-modified CAR T cells.

We next assessed CAR T cell attributes 16 days after CAR injection into Nalm6-bearing mice. Mice injected with E81K-mutant CAR T cells displayed significantly higher CAR T cell numbers in peripheral blood and spleen and a similar albeit nonsignificant trend in bone marrow (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). E81K-modified CAR T cells showed low coexpression of canonical exhaustion-associated markers PD1, LAG3 and TIM3 in vivo (Fig. 2h,i) and a similar percentage of senescence-associated CD57+ T cells relative to control 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d), indicating that E81K does not promote T cell dysfunction in BBz CAR T cells.

Corroborating our in vitro findings from CAR T cells of healthy donors and of patients with cancer (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5e), the E81K substitution favored an increased presence of effector memory T cells in both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cell subsets in vivo (Fig. 2j). To assess the role of the induced effector memory population regarding the proliferative capacity of PI3K altered or WT CAR T cell subtypes, we sorted naive, central memory, effector memory and effector T cells using flow cytometry and subjected E81K-edited and control 19BBz CAR T cells generated from each subset to repetitive antigen stimulation with Nalm6 cells. We found that E81K-mutant effector memory CAR T cells outperformed all other T cell subsets and each subset of unmodified 19BBz CARs, validating their superior antigen-dependent expansion potential (Fig. 2k).

To assess the long-term functionality of E81K-modified BBz CAR T cells, we performed repetitive stimulations with hematological or solid tumors and found that E81K-mutant CAR T cells retained their robust cytotoxic advantage and sustained higher levels of effector cytokine responses even after several rounds of tumor exposure (Extended Data Figs. 5f–k and 6a–c). Consistent with the sustained functionality, E81K-edited CAR T cells derived from healthy donors or patients with cancer exhibited no increased expression of exhaustion or senescence markers after repetitive antigen stimulations (Extended Data Figs. 6d–f). Profiling of transcriptional changes confirmed the heightened effector state of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5k) and indicated reduced T cell dysfunction mediated by the transcription factor FOXO3 (ref. 41) (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), a main driver of 4-1BB-based CAR T cell impairment42.

To delineate whether in vivo persisting E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells maintain effective antitumor responses, we isolated CAR T cells from the spleen of treated mice and reexposed them to Nalm6 cells ex vivo. Strikingly, the retrieved E81K-mutant 19BBz CAR T cells outperformed control CAR T cells in their cytolytic capacities (Extended Data Fig. 6i). The observations of increased antitumor activity of persisting E81K-modified CAR T cells were concordant with enhanced IFNγ levels in the blood of mice 16–18 days after treatment with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6j).

To confirm the improved functional persistence of E81K-edited CAR T cells, we used a model of tumor relapse after initial response, which remains a major challenge in CAR T cell therapy43. To mimic this clinical scenario, we selected a setting in which both E81K-edited and control 19BBz CAR T cells induced full remission after initial CAR T cell infusion and rechallenged the mice with three consecutive rounds of Nalm6 injections at late time points (days 88, 103 and 117 after initial Nalm6 injection) (Fig. 3a). While all mice harboring control CAR T cells developed tumor relapses shortly after Nalm6 rechallenge, all E81K-mutant 19BBz CAR T cells were able to control tumor rechallenges (Fig. 3b), resulting in significantly improved survival (Extended Data Fig. 6k). Together, these data show that E81K-mutant CAR T cells retain their functional capacity long-term, thereby outperforming prototypic BBz CAR T cells.

Given the great challenge in enhancing CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors, we evaluated B7H3-BBz CAR T cells with or without the E81K substitution at stress test doses in a xenograft model of metastatic Sh-Sy5y neuroblastoma endogenously expressing B7H3/CD276 (ref. 44) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6l). E81K-modified B7H3-BBz CAR T cells demonstrated superior tumor control, resulting in significantly prolonged survival of treated mice (Fig. 3d,e). This therapeutic benefit was associated with an augmented CAR T cell-to-tumor ratio in the tumor-bearing liver (Fig. 3f). Consistent with our findings in hematological tumors, E81K-modified CAR T cells favored the presence of effector memory cells in the liver, leading to a higher effector memory CAR T cell-to-tumor cell ratio (Fig. 3g) while preventing elevated expression of exhaustion or senescence markers in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 6m,n).

In summary, the E81K substitution enhances the functional persistence of BBz CAR T cells without increasing safety concerns, reinforcing their high therapeutic potential.

To identify underlying mechanisms resulting in improved functional persistence of E81K-mutant BBz CAR T cells, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on sorted antigen-stimulated 19BBz CAR T cells with and without E81K substitution. Unsupervised clustering was followed by integration into n = 8 transcriptionally distinct clusters (Supplementary Tables 1–8) on the basis of selected marker gene expression. While we observed that CD4+ T cells are generally enriched in the E81K context, we identified two clusters of particular relevance when comparing the two conditions (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7): a cytotoxic CD4+ T cell cluster enriched in E81K-modified CAR T cells and a metabolically active CD4+ cluster uniquely enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells but nearly absent in their unmodified counterparts. Moreover, E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells were depleted in a CD4+ cluster with high expression of exhaustion-related genes NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, PDCD1 and LAG3, indicative of an exhaustion-like phenotype (Fig. 4a–d). Consistent with these findings, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing CD19 CAR T cells to exhaustion-prone HA CAR T cells45 revealed transcriptional similarities of the exhaustion-like CD4⁺ T cell cluster to HA CAR T cells. In contrast, the CD4⁺ clusters enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells more closely correlated with the transcriptional profile of functional CD19 CAR T cells (Fig. 4e).

Unmodified (mock) or E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (TRBC KO) from one healthy donor were sorted after two antigen stimulations with Nalm6 tumor cells and subsequently subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. a, UMAP embedding of all analyzed cells. Clusters of interest are encircled in red. b, Cluster distribution within each condition. c, Comparison of selected populations of interest for E81K-modified and unmodified 19BBz CAR T cells as shown by UMAP embedding. d, Level of expression of the indicated exhaustion-related genes across all CD4+ clusters. e, The score for genes upregulated in CD19-targeting compared to exhaustion-prone HA-targeting CD4 effector memory CAR T cells45 for all identified clusters. f, GSEA of the MSigDB Hallmark glycolysis gene set was performed for all identified clusters (permutation test). g, Joint transcriptomic and metabolomic pathway analysis (using MetaboAnalyst; www.metaboanalyst.ca) showing upregulated metabolic pathways in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells relative to controls after two stimulations with Nalm6 target cells. Top-ranked pathways are labeled. Transcriptomic data were used from experiment shown in a,b. Metabolic analysis is shown in Extended Data Fig. 8e–g (hypergeometric testing). h, Cellular ion counts of NADH across E81K-modified and 19BBz control CAR T cells after second Nalm6 tumor stimulation measured by mass spectrometry (n = 3 biologically independent healthy donors; mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test). i, OCR traces as measured by seahorse mitochondrial stress test for TRBC-KO control 19BBz (mock) and E81K-edited 19BBz CAR T cells after exposure to three repeated stimulations with Nalm6 cells. Lines mark the addition of oligomycin (2 μM), FCCP (1 μM) and rotenone + antimycin A (R + A; 0.5 μM) (mean of n = 5 technical replicates for one representative T cell donor of three donors). j, Average basal OCR, maximal OCR and spare respiratory capacity levels in seahorse mitochondrial stress test (n = 3 biologically independent T cell donors; mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test).

Concordant with our findings of increased effector function, E81K-modified CAR T cells displayed enhanced cytotoxic signatures characterized by high expression of effector genes including granzymes and perforin, and showed a specific enrichment of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c)46.

The metabolically active CD4⁺ T cell cluster highly enriched in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells displayed increased glycolytic activity (Fig. 4f). These findings were supported by an overall heightened expression of glycolysis-related genes and increased glucose uptake in E81K-modified 19BBz CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b,d,e). Parallel metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed altered intracellular metabolite levels in E81K-edited CAR T cells with a pronounced increase in NADH levels (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8f–i). Together, these findings indicate an overall favorable metabolic capacity induced by the E81K substitution in BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b,d–i).

Considering the pivotal role of metabolic fitness in sustaining long-term T cell functionality, we conducted a real-time metabolic flux analysis of E81K-edited versus mock CAR T cells following repeated tumor antigen exposure. E81K-mutant CAR T cells showed higher basal and maximal oxygen consumption, a significantly increased spare respiratory capacity (Fig. 4i,j) and a higher spare glycolytic capacity (Extended Data Fig. 8j,k). This improved CAR T cell fitness was accompanied by an increased mitochondrial mass of E81K-mutant CAR T cells relative to their unedited counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8l). Taken together, transcriptional and metabolic analyses indicate that the E81K substitution enhances cytolytic capacity and metabolic fitness of BBz CAR T cells while mitigating T cell exhaustion.

Given the beneficial properties conferred upon BBz CAR T cells by the E81K substitution, we next sought to assess its role in context of the 28z CAR design. Similar to our findings in BBz CAR T cells, induction of E81K in 1928z CARs boosted CD69 expression relative to unedited controls, reinforcing mutation-induced changes in T cell activation levels (Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, E81K editing in 28z CAR T cells was associated with augmented expression of exhaustion-related markers (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and the inability to enhance proliferative capacity and cytolytic properties (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). We observed similar albeit not statistically significant trends in T cells expressing high tonic-signaling B7H3-specific CARs following introduction of the E81K alteration (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Together, these results demonstrate that the E81K substitution confers functional benefits specifically in the context of 4-1BB-based CARs but not in the CD28 costimulation-based CAR framework, underscoring the need for signaling modulation tailored to the respective CAR design.

Therefore, we selected the top hit (L32P) in 28z CAR T cells on the basis of our initial screening results and investigated the phenotypical and functional consequences resulting from this substitution. In accordance with attenuated PI3K signaling mediated by the L32P substitution (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9g), we observed decreased levels of T cell activation in unstimulated L32P-edited 1928z and antigen-stimulated L32P-edited CD8+ 19BBz CAR T cells (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9h). In contrast to 19BBz CAR T cells that did not benefit from the L32P substitution (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j), L32P-mutant 1928z CAR T cells showed considerably increased antigen-dependent proliferation potential and retained the high effector function attributed to the 28z CAR design (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9k–n). In line with these observations, L32P-mutant 1928z CARs exhibited a less differentiated T cell state as indicated by an increased proportion of central memory T cells compared to mock-edited 1928z CAR T cells (Fig. 5c).

a, CD69 expression levels in mock 1928z as compared to L32P-modified 1928z CAR T cells determined by flow cytometry without further antigen stimulation (n = 11 biologically independent donors, mean ± s.d.; two-sided paired Student's t-test). b, n-fold CAR T cell expansion for L32P-edited relative to unmodified 1928z CAR T cells 7 days after one (day 7), two (day 14) and three (day 21) stimulation(s) with Nalm6 cells (two-sided one-sample t-test; n = 5 biologically independent donors, mean ± s.d.). c, Fold enrichment of the central memory (CD62L+CD45RA−) population in L32P-edited 1928z relative to mock 1928z CAR T cells within the CD8+ (left) and CD4+ (right) CAR+ compartment. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test (n = 9 biologically independent donors). d–f, Luciferase-expressing Sh-Sy5y cells were i.v. injected into NSG mice followed by i.v. administration of UT T cells or B7H3-28z CAR T cells with or without L32P substitution. d, Experimental timeline. e, Bioluminescence imaging of Sh-Sy5y-bearing mice (representative of f) treated with UT, mock B7H3-28z and L32P-edited B7H3-28z CAR T cells at the indicated time points (ventral view). f, Survival of the cohort (L32P B7H3-28z: n = 9, mock B7H3-28z: n = 9 mice, UT: n = 4 mice per group; T cells from two biologically unrelated healthy donors; two-sided Mantel–Cox test). g, Data from the liver of mice (n = 5) treated as shown in (d) and collected 10 days after injection of either mock B7H3-28z or L32P-modified B7H3-28z CAR T cells. Absolute count of SCM CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells in spleen and blood (n = 5 mice per group, mean ± s.d.; two-sided unpaired Student's t-test).

We next evaluated L32P-edited B7H3-28z CAR T cells in the challenging context of a solid tumor model in vivo. We found that L32P-mutant B7H3-28z CAR T cells significantly improved overall survival of mice in a metastatic neuroblastoma model compared to B7H3-28z controls (Fig. 5d–f). Consistent with our previous findings, the enhanced tumor control was associated with a less differentiated T cell phenotype, as indicated by a significantly increased stem-cell-like memory (SCM) T cell pool in L32P-edited compared to mock B7H3-28z CAR T cells on day 10 after injection (Fig. 5g).

Overall, these findings underscore the distinct role of PI3K–AKT signaling in BBz and 28z CAR T cell biology and highlight both the technological and the biological advances of our ROADSTAR approach. Targeted induction of point mutations by base editing enables precise calibration of signaling strength for each CAR design, enabling refined cell products with enhanced therapeutic potency.

Herein, we develop ROADSTAR to fine-tune endogenous PI3K–AKT signaling in CAR T cells through introduction of targeted point mutations. This base-editing screening platform revealed distinct point mutations in the regulatory ABD of p110δ that yield calibrated signaling activities tailored to either 28z-based or BBz-based CAR designs, resulting in favorable phenotypic, metabolic and functional T cell properties.

BBz CAR T cells showed highest enrichment for the PI3K-activating E81K substitution. Intriguingly, this substitution has been reported in persons with activated PI3Kδ syndrome, an autosomal dominant immune deficiency caused by an increased activity of the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway in immune cells19,47,48,49. While these clinical data bolster our findings of greater PI3K–AKT pathway activity induced by E81K, we found that the functional consequences for T cells are contrasting in the context of BBz CAR T cells. Activating PI3Kδ germline alterations foster early T cell differentiation at the expense of memory formation, which ultimately drives T cell exhaustion and senescence, thereby impairing immune responses19,47,48,50. In contrast, E81K-mutant BBz CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity upon repeated antigen exposures across different tumor entities in vitro and improved therapeutic efficacy against established hematological and solid tumors in vivo without driving T cell dysfunction.

Thus, the increased PI3K–AKT signaling activity in E81K-modified CAR T cells resulted in enhanced effector function while preserving the beneficial memory features ascribed to this CAR design. This suggests that 4-1BB costimulation incorporated in the CAR design promotes memory formation in a nonredundant way to PI3K signaling.

Mechanistically, metabolic and single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed improved metabolic capacities of E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells associated with increased spare respiratory capacity and mitochondrial fitness after repetitive antigen exposures—features that have been linked to improved T cell functionality28,46,51.

The additional signaling capacity conferred by the E81K substitution was not beneficial in the context of 28z CAR T cells. Instead, the L32P substitution identified as the top hit in 28z CAR T cells resulted in diminished PI3K–AKT signaling capacity, thereby limiting early T cell differentiation and activation profiles in 28z CAR T cells while simultaneously enhancing their proliferative capacity. These desirable attributes of L32P-mutant 28z CAR T cells culminated in superior control of a metastatic solid tumor in vivo.

One concern of activating PIK3CD point mutations is the potential of malignant transformation. Among over 67,000 individuals reported in cBioPortal, no cases of T cell leukemias harboring L32P or E81K substitutions have been reported. Likewise, there are no described T cell leukemias arising in persons with E81K substitutions, suggesting safety advantages compared to CRISPR–Cas-mediated KO of tumor suppressor genes or overexpression of mutations that have been implicated in T cell malignancies52,53. In accordance, our long-term in vivo experiments did not reveal any signs of toxicities or malignant transformation in mice treated with E81K-edited BBz CAR T cells.

This work highlights ROADSTAR as a strategy to modulate T cell intrinsic signaling pathway activity by targeted base edits, enabling differential signaling capacities tailored to the specific CAR design. This strategy differs from previous work focused on changes in the CAR construct itself and provides a notable advantage compared to genetic KO or exogenous overexpression by enabling precise calibration of signaling activation levels and preserving positive and negative feedback regulation15,17,25,53,54. Notably, our study emphasizes the importance of the underlying T cell biology imparted by the relevant CAR design in determining the beneficial nature of a point mutation to unleash full therapeutic potential. Previous studies identified PIK3CD variants capable of modulating T cell activity through base-editing screens in untransduced T cells21,55. However, such approaches that do not account for CAR design-specific signaling effects might select for highly activating mutations that, when combined with additional signaling provided in a CAR context, could risk inducing T cell overstimulation, hyperproliferation or dysfunction.

Overall, ROADSTAR enabled the identification of distinct point mutations induced by base editing that confer functional advantage and favorable T cell profiles to 28z and BBz CARs by calibrating endogenous signaling strength. These insights pave the way for more effective cellular cancer immunotherapies while simultaneously advancing our understanding of CAR T cell biology.

Cell lines used were luciferase-expressing and GFP-expressing Nalm6 (M.S., Columbia University), Kelly, SK-N-AS and Sh-Sy5y (University Children's Hospital Tübingen) and Daudi (kindly provided by D. Sonanini, University Hospital Tübingen). Cells were PCR-tested for Mycoplasma and found to be negative. SUP-T1 (S. Hailfinger, University Hospital Münster), Sh-Sy5y, Kelly and Daudi cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) with L-glutamine, 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Nalm6 cells were additionally supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1× nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (all Gibco). SK-N-AS were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 1× NEAA.

Fresh blood products from healthy deidentified volunteers were obtained from Zentrum für klinische Transfusionsmedizin, Tübingen. Samples from pretreated participants with cancer were isolated from 60–81-year-old individuals suffering from different cancer entities including sarcoma, lung cancer and breast cancer after several rounds of chemotherapy. Samples from pretreated participants with tumors were obtained from the Medical Department, University Hospital Tübingen. All blood samples were handled following the ethical and safety procedures approved by the ethic commission of the University of Tübingen (783/2023BO2, 846/2020BO2). Informed consent was obtained from the participants. All samples of human origin were destroyed after the analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood products and T cells were subsequently isolated using human Pan T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-5359). T cells were activated at a cell-to-bead-ratio of 1:1 with human T activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, 11161D) in the presence of 5 ng ml−1 IL-7 and IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-095-363 and 130-095-765). Cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells per ml in X-Vivo15 (Lonza, BEBP02-061Q), which was supplemented with 5% human AB-positive serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

pCMV-ABEmax (Addgene, 112094) and pCMV-AncBE4max (Addgenes, 112095) were used as templates. IVT was performed using the T7MEGAscript kit (Thermo Fisher, AMB13345). The plasmids were linearized through AgeI-HF, followed by IVT according to manufacturer's instructions. Transcripts were capped with the CleanCapAG (Tebubio, N-7113) and subjected to poly(A) tailing (Thermo Fisher, AM1350) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA was purified through overnight LiCl precipitation and mRNA was stored at −150 °C.

Base-editing sgRNAs (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10) were cloned into the previously described SFGγ retroviral 19BBz and 1928z CAR plasmids (M.S., Columbia University)17,39,56 under a hU6 promoter. CAR constructs coexpressed truncated LNGFR. Single-chain variable fragment sequences against CD22 (EP2912061B1), B7H3 (WO2017044699A1) and L1CAM (US20210085719A1) were cloned into the SFG-19BBz and SFG-1928z vectors using standard molecular biology techniques. Plasmids were used for retrovirus production as previously described17. H29 packaging cells were provided by M.S. (Columbia University) and 293Vec-RD114 packaging cells were provided by BioVec Pharma57. The PI3Kδ amino acid sequence was obtained from UniProt (O00329) and the respective nucleotide sequence was cloned into the SFG-19BBz or SFG-1928z vector, replacing truncated LNGFR. For ABD screening, T cells were transduced with the retroviral pools to express either 1928z or 19BBz CARs and the sgRNA library. Forty-eight hours after transduction, 2 × 106 T cells were resuspended in P3 primary cell buffer (Lonza) and electroporated with 10 µg of the respective base editor mRNA using Lonza Nucleofector device (EC115 program). Edited CAR T cell pools were subjected to weekly Nalm6 stimulations (effector-to-target ratio (E:T) 2:1) for a total of three stimulations. Genomic DNA was purified using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) from start-point and end-point samples and edited loci were amplified by PCR using NGS 5′ Illumina specific 30-bp partial adaptors. For PIK3CD, exons 1 and 2 spanning the screened p110δ ABD were amplified; for CD19 and RASA2, regions surrounding the respective sgRNA binding sites were targeted. Amplicons were sequenced by AmpliconEZ targeted amplicon deep sequencing (Azenta). Data analysis was carried out using the public Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org/). Adaptor removal and quality trimming were performed using the TrimGalore application with a threshold Phred-score of 25 (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to the reference sequences around the amplified loci using the BWA-MEM2 alignment algorithm58 and variants were called using the LoFreq variant caller application59. Mutations that were represented under 0.4% at the assay start point were excluded from further analysis. Mutational prevalence was normalized to the CAR T cell rate and analyzed as the fold change (FC) compared to start-point prevalence.

Haplotype analysis was performed by extracting reads harboring specific nucleotide substitutions corresponding to the amino acid changes L32P or E81K. Therefore, we implemented a custom filtering pipeline using pysam library (version 0.21.0; https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)60. Reads containing the respective codon-altering variants were isolated and subsequently reanalyzed to identify co-occurring mutations within the same sequencing reads.

T cells were isolated and stimulated as described above. Then, 48 h after, 3 × 106 T cells were resuspended in 100 µl of buffer T and electroporated with 10 µg of mRNA and 5 µg of each synthetic sgRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) resuspended in IDTE buffer (Integrated DNA Technologies, 11-05-01-05) at 1,400 V (three pulses, 10 ms) using the Neon electroporator device. Mock-edited T cells were electroporated with scrambled sgRNA (GCACTACCAGAGCTAACTCA); TRBC1/2 KO and E81K and L32P substitutions were induced by use of sgRNA sequences CCCACCAGCTCAGCTCCACG (AncBE4max), GCTCTTGCTGCTCCGCTGTC (AncBE4max) and AAGTTCAGGTAGACCCCTGT (ABEmax), respectively. Cells were rested in antibiotic-free X-Vivo15 supplemented with cytokines for 24 h and transduced with retroviral supernatant in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) with 10% FBS supplemented with cytokines by centrifugation on retronectin-coated (Takara, T110A) plates (300g, 1 h, 34 °C). CAR T cells with TRBC1/2 KO were enriched with human CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-043).

Base-editing efficiency was routinely assessed by Sanger sequencing followed by analysis with EditR61 default settings (https://moriaritylab.shinyapps.io/editr_v10/).

Substitutions co-occuring with L32P and E81K were analyzed using AmpliconEZ targeted amplicon deep sequencing (Azenta) as described above.

SUP-T1s were electroporated at 1,400 V (three pulses, 10 ms) using the Neon electroporator device, seeded in a single-cell suspension and sequenced for homozygous E81K substitution.

First, 7 days after transduction, unstimulated CAR T cells were single-cell-sorted on the basis of LNGFR expression using a MA900 multiapplication cell sorter (Sony). Single-cell DNA was isolated and amplified using REPLI-g single-cell kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, amplified DNA was used for PIK3CD exon 1 PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing.

CAR T cells (LNGFR+) were weekly stimulated with target cells in RPMI-1640 + FBS without cytokines (E:T = 2:1, unless otherwise indicated).

NOD/SCID/Il2rγ-null male and female mice (6–9 weeks old; Charles River, strain code 614, NSG) were used for experiments. All mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions with a housing temperature of 22 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity and a 12-h dark–light cycle. All ethical regulations and animal use guidelines were followed. Mouse protocols were approved by the Regierungspräsidium Tübingen and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University (R02/22G, R03/22G, R05/23G and no. 20220178). A total of 0.5 × 106 luciferase–GFP-expressing Nalm6 or Sh-Sy5y cells were administered by tail-vein injection followed by intravenous (i.v.) injection of 3 × 106 19BBz and 1 × 106 (B7H3-BBz) or 0.5 × 106 (B7H3-28z) CAR T cells 4 days later, respectively. Tumor rechallenge experiments were performed by repetitive i.v. injection of 1 × 106 Nalm6 cells at the indicated time points. Tumor-bearing mice were killed according to signs of morbidity, based on approved scoring sheets involving evaluation of face grimace, posture, weight loss (>20%), respiration, activity, social behavior and grooming. Tumor-free mice that had to be killed for unknown reasons were excluded. For assessment of tumor burden, mice were intraperitoneally administered 150 mg kg−1 D-luciferin potassium salt (GoldBio, LUCK-1g) dissolved in sterile PBS for 10 min, followed by imaging under isoflurane anesthesia62. Bioluminescence imaging was performed on the IVIS Lumina III system (PerkinElmer) and signal intensity was quantified using Living Image analysis software (version 4.7.4; PerkinElmer) as total flux (photons per s) from consistent regions of interest. To reduce spillover during bioluminescence imaging, we imaged treatment groups together whenever possible.

Ex vivo cytotoxicity was assessed through the generation of single-cell suspensions from spleen, followed by overnight incubation in RPMI-1640 + FBS. In vitro generated or ex vivo obtained CAR+ effectors were cocultured with the respective target cells in triplicate at the indicated E:T ratios in 96-well plates with 2 × 104 target cells per well. Maximal luciferase expression was determined using only target cells; Triton X-100-treated cells were used to assess background levels. After 18 h of incubation, 100 μl of luciferase substrate (D-luciferin; Goldbio) was directly added to each well. Emission was detected and lysis was calculated as (1 − Emsample/Emmax) × 100.

Anti-L1CAM-BBz CAR T cells were used after twice-weekly stimulations with Sh-Sy5y (E:T = 2:1). H2B–mGFP-expressing Sh-Sy5y cells were subconfluently seeded in a black 96-well imaging plate and were overlaid with a 3D collagen gel (PureCol, concentration: 1.7 mg ml−1) containing the respective preactivated CAR T cells stained with CellTracker Red CMTPX dye (Thermo Fisher, C34552). After polymerization, T cell dynamics were recorded by time-lapse bright-field microscopy (frame rate = 55 s) for 42–45 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The 2 × 2 mosaic images were obtained with an epifluorescence microscope (LeicaMicrosystems, Thunder 3D Assay) with hardware-based auto focus control using a Leica ×20 (numerical aperture: 0.95) air objective and computationally merged using the Leica LasX software. Whole-well end-point images were acquired after 4 days using a Tecan SparkCyto. Images were split and segmented by StarDist (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_30, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9093435); apoptotic cells were excluded and living cells were counted using FIJI. E:T cell interactions were quantified by automatic analysis based on vicinity. For speed quantification, T cells that could be followed for >30 min were included in the statistical analysis. Cells were segmented and tracked using TrackMate FIJI plug-in63 with Stardist segmentation and LAP Tracker tracking64. T cell analysis was performed using R Studio based on celltrackR65 and the work package (https://github.com/juliaquach02/cellcontacts) to detect E:T cell contacts. An interaction or contact was defined as three frames (155 s) and a maximum distance of 7 µm between T cell and tumor cell. Apoptotic events and T cell contacts until tumor cell apoptosis were quantified by manual analysis. Data were evaluated on the original image set.

Cell-surface staining of single-cell suspensions was performed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature.

Mitochondrial mass was determined by incubation with 10 nM MitoTracker orange CMTMRos (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by cell-surface staining.

For assessment of intracellular protein levels, effector and target cells were cocultured (E:T = 1:1, 4 h, 37 °C) in the presence of 3 µg ml−1 brefeldin A and 2 µM monensin (both Tonbobio), followed by viability and surface staining in PBS for 25 min. Cells were fixed with IC fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 20 min at room temperature. Intracellular staining was performed in 1× permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C.

For glucose uptake experiments, cells were analyzed after final stimulation with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Cells were washed and resuspended in glucose-free RPMI-1640 + FBS supplemented with 100 µg ml−1 2-NBD-glucose (Abcam, ab146200) to a cell concentration of 3 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS and stained extracellularly.

For phosphoflow analysis, cells were seeded in cytokine-free RPMI-1640 for 2 h and subsequently stimulated with Nalm6 cells for at an (E:T = 1:1). After fixation with 100 µl of warm 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, cells were washed and permeabilized in 300 µl of 90% ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice. Subsequently, cells were incubated with phosphoantibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed and stained with secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature.

For measurement of antigen surface levels, Quantum Simply Cellular antimouse IgG (Bangs Laboratories) was performed and calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For CAR T cell sorts, unstimulated CAR T cells were sorted on a MA900 multiapplication cell sorter (Sony, 100-µm chip). LNGFR+ CAR T cells were sorted for indicated CAR T cell subsets (naive, CD45RA+CD62L+; central memory, CD45RA−CD62L+; effector memory, CD45RA−CD62L−; effector, CD45RA+CD62L−).

Samples obtained from in vivo experiments were blocked using mouse FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-575) in addition to the CAR and surface staining. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated microtainer and washed with cold FACS buffer. FACS lysis solution (BD, 349202) was added to lyse red blood cells. CountBright absolute counting beads (Invitrogen) were added to the samples before acquisition. The gating strategy for in vivo samples is exemplarily shown in Extended Data Fig. 10. In all experiments involving TRBC1/2 KO, the CAR+ cells for subsequent analysis were determined as the proportion of CD3− T cells.

Flow cytometry and western blot antibodies and reagents are reported as Supplementary Tables 11 and 12. All samples were acquired on a five-laser Cytek Aurora spectral cytometer with automated compensation calculation. Fluorescence − 1 controls were acquired for accurate gating. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (version 10.8.0).

For immunoblotting, SUP-T1 or T cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per ml in fresh RPMI-1640 + FBS. Cells were either left untreated or incubated with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and spun down (300g, 5 min, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in supplemented RIPA buffer (protease inhibitor (Roche), NaF, Na4P2O7 and Na3VO4) and incubated for 15 min on ice with repetitive vigorous mixing. Protein concentration was measured using BioRad protein assay. Then, 40–60 µg of protein lysate was loaded onto 10% Tris–glycine SDS Gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA or milk in TBST; thereafter, primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight and secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature.

First, 19BBz CAR T cells carrying either a TRBC1/2 stop mutation and/or the E81K base edit were stimulated twice with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Then, 48 h after the last stimulation, living CAR T cells were single-cell-sorted (LNGFR+CD3−) and single-cell sequenced (CeGaT). Cell count and viability (>90%) were determined using a Cellaca MX cell counter (Revvity). The scRNA-seq library was prepared using Chromium NextGEM single-cell 3′ kit, version 3.1 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cell suspension was loaded into a Chromium NextGEM ChipG aiming for a cell recovery of 10,000 cells per sample. For cDNA amplification, 11 PCR cycles were used and the final sample index PCR was performed with 12 cycles. Libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq X Plus 1.5B flow cell (mean reads per cell: 19BBz TRBC, 113,977; 19BBz E81K, 121,606).

Demultiplexing of the sequencing reads was performed with bcl2fastq (version 2.20). For each sample, FASTQ files generated with bcl2fastq were subsequently processed with the Cell Ranger software (version 7.1.0) provided by 10x Genomics.

Processing and analysis of scRNA-seq data were performed with Scanpy (version 1.11.1)66. Genes with <20 total counts and cells with >100,000 total or 10% mitochondrial gene counts, <2,000 distinct genes or 10% ribosomal gene counts were filtered out. The gene expression matrix was normalized to the median of total counts per cell, log-transformed and scaled per gene. The 2,000 most highly variable genes were determined with the ‘seurat_v3' method on the basis of raw counts67. Scaled expression of these highly variable genes was used to compute a principal component analysis and a neighborhood graph with 30 nearest neighbors was constructed on the basis of 50 principal components using cosine similarity. Leiden clustering (resolution 1.0) was performed and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding was computed with default parameters for visualization.

For cell type annotation, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Leiden clusters were determined using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on log-normalized counts with the Scanpy function ‘rank_genes_groups' (ref. 66). Overrepresentation analysis of differentially upregulated genes for each cluster (false-discovery-rate-corrected P value < 0.05, log2FC > 0.5) and GSEA68 based on differential expression scores were performed using GSEApy (version 1.1.8)69 with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, Gene Ontology biological process, MSigDB Hallmark, MSigDB C7 immunologic signature and additional exhaustion-related gene sets45 to aid with functional annotations. Clusters with similar marker gene expression profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7c) were aggregated into functional cell types. Gene module expression46 was scored using the Scanpy function ‘score_genes' (ref. 66) on the basis of log-normalized counts.

First, 19BBz CAR T cells with a TRBC1/2 stop mutation and/or E81K substitution were twice stimulated with Nalm6 cells (E:T = 2:1). Then, 24 h after last stimulation, the absence of Nalm6 cells was controlled by flow analysis and 1 × 10−7 to 1.2 × 10−7 CAR T cells were thoroughly washed followed by quenching with 400 µl of ice-cold methanol (≥99.9%) and storage at −80 °C. Metabolite extraction was performed on ice using a two-phase extraction with methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether and H2O as previously described70. Liquid chromatography (LC)–mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed using a chromatography system coupled to a timsTOF Pro2 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a vacuum-insulated pressure-heated electrospray ionization source (Bruker Daltonics). Hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC) was performed using a BEH amide column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm; Waters). To manually assess signal linearity, a pooled quality control sample was injected (0.25–5 µl). Mass and ion mobility were recalibrated using sodium formate and Agilent's ESIS tuning solution per run. The MS analysis for nontargeted metabolomics was performed using parallel accumulation serial fragmentation mode with data-dependent MS/MS acquisition and trapped ion mobility spectrometry stepping, following the four-dimensional (4D) metabolomics standard method in TimsControl software (Bruker Daltonics). HILIC was run in both ionization modes; reverse phase LC was run in negative mode only.

Raw data were processed in MetaboScape 2025b using the T-ReX 4D algorithm and matched to commercial and in-house target lists and libraries (Bruker HMDB 2.0, METLIN-CCS, PNNL, IROA MSMLS). Metabolite identification followed Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 2 criteria (m/z deviation < 2.0 ppm, mSigma < 20, MS/MS score < 900 or collision cross-section deviation < 1%). Features had to be ≥3× blank, detected in ≥5 samples and have ≥1,500 ion counts and ≥125 4D points. Recursive extraction and quality-control-based batch correction were applied.

Data preprocessing and further statistical processing were performed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0. Missing values were imputed as one fifth of the minimum positive value, normalized by probabilistic quotient normalization, log10-transformed and merged across HILIC and RP modes. Redundant features were retained from the method with fewer missing values and higher intensity. Samples were run in five technical replicates unless stated otherwise. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance and the ward.D2 linkage method. Joint transcriptomics from overall scRNA analysis and metabolomic pathway analysis was conducted using the MetaboAnalyst 6.0. For this analysis, 222 upregulated genes (adjusted P value < 0.05, FC > 1) and 27 upregulated metabolites (P value < 0.05 in at least one donor) were included. Pathway enrichment was assessed using hypergeometric testing and pathway topology was evaluated on the basis of betweenness centrality.

Absolute NADH levels of CAR T cells were measured 24 h after second antigen stimulation using a NAD+/NADH assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK460) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Metabolic profiling was measured using a flux analyzer (Seahorse XF Pro, Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 × 105 T cells per well were seeded in 5–8 replicates in 180 µl of Seahorse XF RPMI medium (Agilent) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM D-glucose in poly(D-lysine)-coated 96-well microplates. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, mitochondrial respiration analysis was performed using the Seahorse XF cell mito stress test kit (Agilent, 103015-100) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Basal oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) before oligomycin treatment and after rotenone + antimycin A treatment. Maximal oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference of the OCR after rotenone + antimycin A treatment and after FCCP treatment. Basal and maximal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was defined as the ECAR measured before and after oligomycin addition. Spare respiratory capacity and spare ECAR were defined as the difference between maximal and basal oxygen consumption and ECAR, respectively.

For cytokine quantification, the LEGENDplex human essential immune response panel (BioLegend) was performed according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Data analysis was performed according to manufacturer's instructions using the LEGENDplex data analysis software. In brief, serum samples from mice were collected on day 16 and used both undiluted and in a 1:100 dilution for the assay. For in vitro experiments, CAR T cells and target cells were cocultured (24 h, E:T = 1:1). All measurements were performed in duplicates.

CAR T cells were harvested either unstimulated or after twice-weekly stimulations with Nalm6. Then, 4 days after the last stimulation, no Nalm6 cells were detectable in the culture as determined by flow cytometry. All cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and RNA was directly extracted using the RNeasy mini kit with RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Quality control, read mapping and counting were performed using the Nextflow-based nf-core/rnaseq (version 3.12.0) pipeline (https://nf-co.re/rnaseq). Quality control assessment of the raw data was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.9) and RSeQC (version 3.0.1). Reads were mapped to the reference genome (GRCh38) using the STAR aligner (version 2.6.1d)71. Quantification of raw gene expression was performed with Salmon (version 1.10.1)72 and downstream analysis was performed with the Nextflow-based rnadeseq (version 2.2.0) pipeline (https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/rnadeseq). This workflow integrates DESeq2 (version 1.40.2)73 for differential expression analysis used in the R language (version 4.3.1). Genes with an adjusted P value ≤ 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. The DEG lists were obtained from simple pairwise comparisons extracted from a linear model. The DEG lists, together with their associated log2FC were fed into gprofiler2 for pathway enrichment analysis. The gene selection for the comparative analysis between 19BBz CAR T cells with and without the E81K substitution in Extended Data Fig. 6h was based on the FOXO3-dependent gene set reported by Litvak et al.41 (Fig. 1a). Specifically, the top 30 genes upregulated in FOXO3-KO versus WT conditions and expressed across both human and murine species were selected for further analysis. For the GSEA, fgsea (version 1.28.0)71 was used to run the analysis on the output of DESeq2. The reference gene list used included two custom gene sets and MSigDB (version 7.2) Hallmark gene sets.

All tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. For histology 3–5 µm-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The histologic samples were analyzed by an experienced pathologist (L.Q.-M.). All samples were scanned with the Ventana DP200 (Roche) and processed with the Image Viewer MFC Application. Final image preparation was performed with Adobe Photoshop 2024.

Any additional statistical analyses not detailed above were conducted using Prism 7 (GraphPad). Mouse condition and survival were observed by an operator who was blinded to treatment groups in addition to the main investigator who was not blind to group allocation. Tumor burden was measured by a blinded operator; analysis of data was not performed in blinded fashion. No data were excluded throughout the studies. No blinding was performed for in vitro experiments. No statistical sample size was predetermined. Mice were randomly allocated to the respective groups after ensuring similar tumor burden. Comparisons between two groups were conducted using two-sided Student's t-tests. When normality could not be assumed (Shapiro–Wilk test), the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was applied for paired data. For values normalized to their respective control, two-sided one-sample t-tests were used if the data were normally distributed; otherwise, a two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test was applied. For comparing multiple groups, we applied one-way analysis of variance. For in vivo experiments, overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and survival differences between groups were assessed with the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Specific statistical tests used are detailed in the corresponding figure legends. Scientific illustrations were generated by J. Zenker with BioRender.com drafts.

A satellite designed to measure the height of the ocean surface was in the right place at the right time when a powerful earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula sent a tsunami across the Pacific in late July.

The spacecraft, known as the Surface Water Ocean Topography or SWOT satellite, recorded the first high resolution space-based track of a major subduction zone tsunami, according to researchers writing in The Seismic Record.

Instead of a simple wave moving cleanly across the ocean, the satellite data revealed a surprisingly intricate pattern of waves spreading, interacting, and scattering across the basin. Scientists say this detailed view could improve understanding of how tsunamis travel and how they may ultimately affect coastlines.

Combining satellite data with ocean sensors

To better understand the event, Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland and his colleagues combined the satellite observations with measurements from DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys located along the tsunami's path. These deep-ocean sensors helped them refine estimates of the earthquake that triggered the waves.

The July 29 earthquake struck in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone with a magnitude of 8.8, making it the sixth largest earthquake recorded worldwide since 1900.

"I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses," said Ruiz-Angulo. "Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean. There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface."

A satellite built for water, not disasters

SWOT was launched in December 2022 as a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Its main goal is to deliver the first global survey of Earth's surface water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes.

Ruiz-Angulo said he and co-author Charly de Marez had spent more than two years studying SWOT data to understand everyday ocean features such as small eddies. "[We] had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami."

Rethinking how giant tsunamis behave

Because the wavelength of large tsunamis is much longer than the depth of the ocean, scientists have traditionally described them as "non-dispersive." In simple terms, this means the wave is expected to travel as a single, stable form rather than breaking into multiple waves that spread out over time.

"The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive," Ruiz-Angulo explains.

When the team compared the satellite observations with computer simulations, they found that tsunami models that included dispersion matched the real-world data more closely than traditional models.

"The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run," Ruiz-Angulo added. "This 'extra' variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before."

A longer earthquake rupture than expected

The researchers also noticed a mismatch between tsunami arrival times predicted by earlier models and the actual measurements recorded by two DART tide gauges. One gauge recorded the tsunami earlier than expected, while the other detected it later.

Using the buoy data in a technique known as inversion, the team reexamined the source of the tsunami. Their analysis suggested the earthquake rupture extended farther south than previously thought and stretched about 400 kilometers -- significantly longer than the 300 kilometers estimated by other models.

"Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip," said study co-author Diego Melgar.

Why mixing data matters

Since that 2011 disaster, Melgar's research group and others have worked to better integrate DART buoy data into earthquake and tsunami analyses. However, this approach is still not routine.

Since then, Melgar's lab and others have been working on ways to include DART data in inversions, "but it is still not always done because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different than the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data. But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible," Melgar said.

Improving future tsunami warnings

The Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone has produced some of the largest tsunamis on record, including a devastating event in 1952 triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. That disaster led to the creation of the international tsunami warning system that later issued alerts across the Pacific during the 2025 event.

"With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting," Ruiz-Angulo said.

The expansion of ancestrally diverse genetic cohorts has altered the landscape of complex disease genetics. Differences in linkage disequilibrium across populations have improved fine-mapping and the identification of target genes — key steps for translating findings from genome-wide association studies into biological understanding. Whilst there is widespread sharing of genetic architecture across ancestries, loci that display heterogeneity in causal genetic effects across populations can offer unique biological insights. Here, we review how ancestral and global diversity shape genetic discoveries. As we advance towards global precision medicine, integrating genomic data with diverse environmental and social factors will be crucial to account for population-specific contexts that can influence disease risk or treatment response.

Amazon's Ring is rolling out a $5,000 solar-powered surveillance trailer for parking lots, construction sites, and events — part of a broader expansion beyond the doorbell and into commercial security.

The new Ring Mobile Security Trailer, announced Tuesday morning at CES, is designed to be an alternative to the heavy-duty rigs often seen at industrial sites. It uses a 360-degree camera with 4k resolution, which the company says ensures high-definition visibility without blind spots.

Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018, has renewed its focus on security under Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who returned to the tech giant last year after his 2023 departure.

The move puts Ring in more direct competition with commercial security players like Verkada and Motorola Solutions, which sell cloud-connected cameras and mobile surveillance systems, and traditional industrial providers such as Bosch and Hikvision known for rugged security gear.

Ring's strategy appears to be leveraging its brand recognition in residential security and Amazon's infrastructure — including Amazon Sidewalk connectivity and AWS cloud services — to undercut competitors on price as part of a larger system that bridges home and business security.

Set for release this spring, Ring's trailer can run on line power with battery backup or operate fully off-grid via solar panels. It comes with built-in LTE connectivity, meaning it requires no external internet infrastructure to work. It can also be detached and mounted in a truck bed or used as a standalone station, making it adaptable for temporary deployments like festivals.

It's part of Ring's new “Jobsite” security portfolio, which also includes a new Ring Elite camera line designed for large-scale business settings like logistics yards and campuses.

Separately, Ring introduced “Fire Watch,” a new feature developed in partnership with the non-profit Watch Duty. It provides real-time wildfire alerts directly within the Ring app and allows camera owners to voluntarily share periodic snapshots with first responders.

Apart from its new commercial offerings, the company announced several new residential security features and products.

Ring announced that the Sidewalk network itself is expanding globally, launching in Canada and Mexico in the coming months before reaching Europe, Australia, and Japan later this year.

Washington State Ferries is taking an initial step toward offering public Wi-Fi service at ferry terminals and aboard vessels.

The agency issued a report in December proposing a limited Wi-Fi pilot at a single terminal — Bremerton — and on a single vessel, the M/V Chimacum.

The effort is driven by state legislation passed last year directing the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to deploy a Wi-Fi pilot within existing resources and report on viability, costs, and potential free or fee-based models.

Washington State Ferries (WSF), which operates under WSDOT, is working through the procurement process for a vendor for the pilot program, according to a spokesperson. The program is limited in scope and any expansion or continuation would be subject to direction from lawmakers, the spokesperson noted. 

The report estimates that the pilot could cost between $100,000 and $150,000, which includes equipment, installation, and minimal vendor support for the pilot period. WSF estimates that expanding public Wi-Fi across terminals and vessels statewide would likely require a multi-million-dollar capital investment, along with ongoing annual operating and maintenance costs in the seven-figure range. 

WSF currently provides no public internet service anywhere in its ferry system. The report references a private-sector attempt to offer Wi-Fi in the late 2000s that ultimately failed due to high infrastructure costs and insufficient revenue. WSF previously partnered with wireless networking company Boingo on a fee-based Wi-Fi service in 2008, but that ended in 2016. 

The new pilot could determine whether modern networking technology and vendor models change that equation. WSF plans to measure how many passengers actually use Wi-Fi, how much bandwidth they consume, service reliability, and what kind of staffing and vendor support is required to keep the system running.

Final costs for a potential broader rollout would depend on factors such as how many terminals and vessels are covered, the level of bandwidth provided, and whether service is free, paid, or a mix of both.

If WSF proceeds as planned, the pilot would move forward in 2026, with installation in the spring, and an operational test period running from May through August, according to the report. WSF would analyze the data in late summer and deliver findings and recommendations in September 2026.

The agency flagged several risks, including cybersecurity requirements, potential strain on staff resources, infrastructure limitations on older vessels and terminals, and the challenge of managing passenger expectations for a temporary test program. Any public Wi-Fi network would need to be fully segmented from ferry operational systems and comply with state IT security and accessibility standards.

Higher DRAM prices are also bound to also affect their unreleased devices and make them a tougher sell to buyers.

For anything else, where I just need "small computer running Linux to do a thing over USB or the network", the Intel mini-PCs are still a better deal.1. They are usually upgradable, either in storage, and/or RAM, WiFi, etc depending on which one you buy.2. They usually have actual M.2 storage without the need for an add-on board.3. More sensible board and port layouts. I despise the Pi B form factor. Easily the worst thing about my Radxa X4 is the slavish "lets make it Pi B" form factor, which they didn't even manage to do, so any time I use it it's a port squid mess instead of having everything be neatly managable and I don't get to use any of the Pi B form-factor accessories I have anyways.4. Can run any x86 operating system, and get installed off of a USB. I dual boot my Radxa X4 between Windows and Linux.5. Typically have faster networking and definitely better video/NPU hardware. Intel QSV is excellent.6. Power usage stats that are a rounding error up or down from what a Pi 5 could do.At this point, I'd rather the Pi Foundation really focus on the Pico stuff, I find it far more interesting. The compute modules are also pretty useful when you really want to customize the I/O. As the landscape changed, the full-size Pi B's just seem...left out. Weird boot process, weird form factor, weird Broadcom stuff, weird price/performance ratio, downright hostile power supply choices (5V5A is supported by like two special snowflake supplies, and guess what, the Pi Foundation sells one!), few upsides. Maybe if the mini-PCs prices still increase, and the Pi Foundation can still get away with selling 8GB Pi 5s at $100 or whatever, it'll make more sense.

Digital Biotechnologies Inc., a new Seattle-based subsidiary of publicly traded immune medicine company Adaptive Biotechnologies, has raised fresh cash as part of an initial closing of a Series A investment round.

The round could total up to $15 million, according to a recent regulatory filing from Adaptive.

Digital Biotechnologies is developing DNA sequencing technology. A spokesperson for Adaptive said the startup is “adjacent” to Adaptive's current strategic focus on immune medicine and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing. 

“We are proud to have supported their journey to date and look forward to seeing their continued progress in the coming years with this new financing in place,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Adaptive will own nearly half of the company when the latest funding round is completed.

Digital Biotechnologies works out of Adaptive's headquarters in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. The spokesperson declined to provide more details about the company's leadership or website.

A recent job posting notes that Digital Biotechnologies is working on a “clinical sequencing instrument.” From the posting: 

Present methods for high-throughput sequencing are not suitable for many clinical applications, as all current NGS platforms lack the combination of high accuracy, rapid turnaround time, and low cost that would lead to robust clinical utility. In collaboration with academic and industry scientists across the country, Digital Biotechnologies is engineering the first solid-state sequencer with the specifications necessary for a widely applicable clinical sequencing instrument.

The startup appears to leverage Adaptive's immune medicine expertise and IP with a dedicated engineering and product organization focused on hardware. 

Jason Bielas, a longtime professor at the University of Washington and leader at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, is a co-founder of Digital Biotechnologies. The company has a handful of other employees, according to LinkedIn. 

Adaptive plans to consolidate the company's financial results in its own earnings reports.

Founded in 2009 by brothers Chad and Harlan Robins, Adaptive develops immune system-related products for diagnosis and monitoring of cancer and other diseases. The company, which spun out of the Fred Hutch, went public in 2019. 

Chad Robins still leads the company as CEO. Harlan Robins is chief scientific officer. Adaptive employs more than 600 people, according to LinkedIn. 

Adaptive's stock is up more than 120% over the past 12 months. Shares spiked more than 50% in November after the company topped third quarter expectations, reporting $94 million in overall revenue, fueled by growth in its MRD business.

Adaptive last month entered into two autoimmune-related agreements with Pfizer, including one focused on rheumatoid arthritis that could be worth up to $890 million.

The company agreed to terminate a deal with Genentech last year. That deal, originally announced in 2019, had $2 billion in potential value.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.

The magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.

After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.

Key components of Sparc's magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS' co-founder and CEO. “It'll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”

When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It's the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.

To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.

To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia's Omniverse libraries.

That won't be CFS' first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They'll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we'll be constantly comparing them to each other.”

The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.

Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company's first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. 

Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.

Building your own homelab has just become more expensive

The humble Raspberry Pi, the perennial leader of the low-power, single-board computing (SBC) world, has hit a price parity with its rival, the Intel N100-based mini PCs. An investigation by Jeff Geerling, which we've independently confirmed, shows that pricing for Pi's is now within just a few cents with a similarly configured board from brands like GMKTec. Why does this matter? Hobbyists and homelab builders had a great 2024 / 2025 which saw low prices for their DIY setups.

If you've been keeping a close eye on the PC hardware market of late, you'll have noticed prices only going one way: upward. Flash memory costs, along with tariff uncertainties last year, have forced mini PC manufacturers and retailers to raise prices across the board. As Geerling explains, an explosion in homelab builds using $100-150 mini PCs made those same PCs a better, or certainly cheaper, alternative to current-gen Raspberry Pi 5s which when bundled up with NVMe HATs, NVMe drives, cases etc, retailed for over $200 last year.

Now, the tables have turned. Geerling, who compared the prices of a GMKTec mini PC versus a Raspberry Pi 5 kit in March 2025, found in his updated investigation that the GMKTec machine he considered in his first investigation is now more expensive (albeit by only a few cents). Both systems feature 16GB RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, but given current market conditions, systems like these aren't be sold as cheaply as they were last year.

Our own comparison of rival mini PCs, based on Amazon's current pricing whilst compared with Camelcamelcamel's historical data, shows that this isn't just a brand-specific issue. For instance, the Beelink S13 with the refreshed Intel N150 CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $269, from as low as $168.99 in August 2025.

Meanwhile the Acemagic V1, with similar specs, is available for $217.54, up from $158 in August 2025, or $180 in January 2025. Geekom does offer an N100 mini PC costing $199.99 that hasn't seen a price change on Amazon in the last year, but with only 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. The Raspberry Pi is also not immune to the upward pricing trend. The cost of a Raspberry Pi has changed in recent months, and Raspberry Pi introduced a 1GB Pi 5 in order to keep a low $45 price point. A Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM is now $145, $25 more expensive than in early 2025.The cost of additional components, such as the SSD, have all added to the cost of creating your own DIY homelab.

This now leaves prospective homelab builders with three variables to consider: overall cost, power usage, and performance. Intel mini PCs are more powerful than the Raspberry Pi, even if the Pi 5 did offer a significant speed boost over the Pi 4, as our Pi 5 review explains. However, the Raspberry Pi continues to be the superior option if you're looking for the lowest power draw, even compared to the otherwise power-efficient Intel N100 and refreshed N150 mini PCs on sale.

Geerling believes that, as a result of these price rises, repurposing old hardware will be the “theme” for this new year, and one that will save you far more money, given the alternatives. This might be the status quo for some time, too. There's no end in sight for the price shocks affecting the market, with memory manufacturers warning that the crisis has only just started, and could roll on for years to come.

It's such a money maker but no one complains because they either don't know it's happening or don't care enough to say something. But 1 million people with $10 in their account will generate $1,000/day in free money for the holder.

reply

Deposit accounts at most banks pay you less than that, so it's unclear why you'd want gift cards to pay that much. Not to mention that turning gift cards into essentially bank accounts is going to create even more issues. Remember how we have to remind people how paypal isn't a bank? Or how would you calculate income taxes from the interest?

reply

Sell a product for $7 but only allow "recharge" in $5 increments. It pretty much guarantees that you will have tons of accounts with random dollar amounts laying around in them, never to be used. Even for regular gift cards, the counter party would be beholden to honoring them at their full value, as they should.Besides, nothing it stopping you from rolling monthly treasuries and using those as a bank. Something people with enough money to exploit this proposed "gift card bank" would almost surely already be aware of.

If giving/receiving cash wasn't already illegal or socially unacceptable, gift card issuers would have started lobbying for that yesterday.Other than that original use case, many people use them as a form of poorly functional digital cash (since it's not fungible across issuers) that really ought to exist natively in a currency these days.

Income taxes are easy. 1099-INT. Your bank gives you one, your brokerage gives you one, and your escrow account gives you one.

reply

You think people are going to diligently collect all the 1099-INT forms for all the cards scattered around the house? If you forgot about a gift card, are you suddenly a tax evader?

1. Gift cards. Users want gift cards so it doesn't make sense to penalize companies for that (by forcing them to complexify their codebase and finances)2. Top-up cards. I haven't really seen dark patterns here. You're usually not forced to use these as far as I've seen, and are usually rewarded if you do (accumulate points, get free stuff)

According to Gallup [1], only 47% of US Americans thought that immigration should decrease in 2020. That number had held more or less steady since at least 2000. But it grew steadily over Biden's term, reaching 88% in 2024. This, I believe, is a reflection of how the democrats shifted their rhetoric to be "tough on immigration". And it handed Trump a populace that was primed to be more susceptible than ever to his much more aggressive immigration rhetoric.Of course, this is just a small part of a much bigger picture, but I don't exactly think it helped.[1] https://news.gallup.com/poll/692522/surge-concern-immigratio...

Mamdani seems very proud to be a socialist and you get a taste of it where he says "...the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment" and "..we have to continue to elect more socialists and we have to ensure that we are unapologetic about our socialism", etc.  He is very clear about his beliefs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7HDuoJ0MQ

Meta is pausing its plans to sell its Ray-Ban Display glasses outside the U.S. due to “unprecedented demand and limited supply,” the company said on Tuesday. Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.

“Since launching last fall, we've seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we've decided to pause our planned international expansion.”

Meta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.

Unveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.

At CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.

Meta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City.

I've started adding this to all of my new conversations and it seems to help:    You are a principal software engineer. I report to you. Do not modify files. Do not write prose. Only provide observations and suggestions so that I can learn from you.

My question to the LLM then follows in the next paragraph. Foregoing most of the LLM's code-writing capabilities in favor of giving observations and ideas seems to be a much better choice for productivity. It can still lead me down rabbit holes or wrong directions, but at least I don't have to deal with 10 pages of prose in its output or 50 pages of ineffectual code.

I suppose part of the problem is that training a model on publicly available C++ isn't going to be great because syntactically broken code gets posted to the web all the time, along with suboptimal solutions.  I recall a talk saying that functional languages are better for agents because the code published publicly is formally correct.

It's possible Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 are significantly less terrible with C++ than previous models. Those only came out within the past 2 months.They also have significantly more recent knowledge cut-off dates.

As for environment degradation in general, just because prior predictions were wrong doesn't mean the biosphere isn't still headed in the wrong direction for sustainability. Maybe we have the right governance and economics to adapt in time, but that's not a guarantee.Being positive about everything seems like a really privileged position. It also maintains the status quo. If you're Ukrainian, how positive would you feel about your country's future? How positive is Europe about NATO and it's future with the US right about now. How are Canadians feeling about their neighbor to the South? Are they confident future US elections will self-correct?Maybe over the long term it all works itself out and human progress continues to the stars or whatever. Or maybe we're going to be part of a Great Filter intelligent species face because of short sightedness and powerful technologies they unleash. Or maybe we'll just muddle along with some gains and then losses. Civilizations rise and fall, we really don't know how positive the future will be.

So? You have to do that because it takes one toxic person to poison the well. HN is aggressively moderated to get rid of articles and opinions that don't belong too. Without it, it would be just a constant stream of self-promotion and politics.The point is that someone (the moderators) worked to nourish a positive culture and it worked. HN didn't and it shows. I don't think that negativity is necessary to keep the forum interesting. Especially given that HN's negativity really isn't all that insightful. A lot of negative takes are bad, and many of them are written without reading the article, or by cherrypicking a single sentence and attacking that.

You don't get tech without negativity. And honestly HN is very tame compared to most forums when it comes to the deeply negative.The problem with maintaining (only) positivity in tech is you turn into $large_companies marketing department. We have to step up and say security flaws exist. That companies outright lie. That some idea (when it comes to programming) are objectively bad.Hence why the OP is here on the thread talking about what negativity means in this particular case, because it also counts criticism.

When I was still visiting Reddit my subreddit list was short and focused on a few hobbies and tech topics. Even those subreddits had become overtaken with cynical doomerism and toxic responses to everything. For a while I could still get some value out of select comments, but eventually everyone who wanted real discussion gave up and left. Now even when interesting or helpful topics get posted it's like the commenters are sharks circling and waiting for any opportunity to bring doom and gloom to any subject.

Engagement means money. Even if this is bait content then you get rewarded (on TikTok, X, YouTube, you directly get cash).Even here controversy is indirectly rewarded here because it creates engagement, and there is practically no downsides if you upset anyone;You get points for every answer that someone does to your comment, and the downvotes you get on your own comments don't offset the gained points.These points have real utility to make money indirectly: the more points you have, the more credibility you have on this platform and capacity to push a story.[...]and it helps to bootstrap your project or grab new customers for free (at most 1 day of writing the bot script).Let's say, you want to launch a new Juicero, and nobody knows about it yet, it's great to be able to push it on the homepage of HN, otherwise nobody is going to notice.

The absolute key feature is the domain experts, not the karma. Any time any subject comes up, someone appears that knows everything about the subject and lives in the field. It's the single best thing about HN by a million miles.

reply

I remember a guy that had millions just because on any reddit AMA asked "tits or ass?"

reply

You're right about reddit karma though. One of the good things about HN is that throwaway joke posts like that are downvoted/flagged/otherwise discouraged. I can guess the top comment for any given Reddit comment section with like 90% accuracy just because it's going to be the most obvious joke possible based on the submission title, and Reddit users love upvoting those for some reason.

I would tend to think that this goes naturally:you get boosted by a circle of people you know, and who wants you to succeed, because if you succeed they will get money), so there is the incentive in some way.but it's still plausible that getting a boost on HN is part of the package (but I am not sure it is needed, because of this natural push that you get from let's say 100 people around you).What you said about capitalism is true, I noticed it too, and it sounds even strange to me, as we are literally on a board that is initiated by a capitalist fund.

For the most part I pinned it down to casual engagement from non hobbyists introduced noise and anti information at scale.For example in r/cars a site that talks about vehicles the vast majority of commenters do not own, comments become about the “simualacra” of having an exotic (comparing specs debating reviews etc). Where as Ferrari chat forum is about the utilitarian ins and outs of actually owning one (financing, maintence, dealer issues etc).This seems to apply to all hobby forums when grow in popularity to the point where engagement rewards contributions from non hobbiests over real ones.My final takeaway was that the nature of the internet being a simulation inherently rewards non real content over real.  (Fake news is inherent to the internet) And karmic systems specifically reconstruct and enforce that simualacra.

I recently bought a pair of boots from a reputable brand.  So I of course checked out the subreddit for the brand and while many posts are good and the community is receptive to questions but posts by weirdos with like a dozen+ pairs of $300+ boots dominate the discussion.Can these people actually afford like $5000 worth of boots and all the accessories they come with it?  Maybe.  Maybe we're all participating in their shopping addiction when they post pictures of their stairs covered in boots.Either way there's something unsettlingly unnatural about their posts, and I don't mean in an astroturfing sort of way.

It's hard to let bad ideas go unchallenged though. Places like Reddit? Sure, brigades, bots—it's tilting at windmills to try to add balance there. But HN is a community I still care for.

On the neutral category: the model outputs continuous scores from 0 to 1, so neutrality does exist around 0.5. The bimodal distribution with peaks at roughly 0.0 and 0.95 reflects how HN users tend toward strong evaluative positions. Three-class models could provide additional perspective, and that's worth exploring in future work.Also love your meta-observation. Imo your comment is critical, substantive, and engaging. By sentiment metrics it's "negative," but functionally it's high-quality discourse. But that's exactly how I read the data: HN's negativity is constructive critique that drives engagement, not hostility.

It's a matter of perspective. The OP is a negative post. You are negative about it. Therefore, you have made a positive post.

reply

But posting something positive and getting slammed in the comments? That's depressing. So the barrier to posting something positive seems higher.

reply

This is addressed in OPs post. The vast majority of the 'negativity' I encounter on HN is technical critique rather than criticism or toxicity. I've found HN to arguably be one of the least toxic communities.

reply

BTW even being the least toxic leaves the bar still pretty low, if you ask me.

reply

Years ago, when I was young, I noticed a trend watching local TV news: Whenever they would interview people on the street, past a certain age, their comments become so much more negative.  Example: "So, how is traffic in your part of town?  Oh, it's never been worse."  "How are the public schools?  Oh, it's never been worse."  Ad nauseam.  Whenever I feel any conversation in my life is drifting into "Oh, it's never been worse.", I tune out.

I am active on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Tumblr but not X.  On all of those platforms I am selective about who I follow (e.g. said anything about Trump in the last 20 posts I won't follow you,  posted an image with angry text in it,  I won't follow you) and quick with the block button.  In the case of the first two I get a feed which is really cozy,  the third has way too much AI slop (fake cat videos!) which would get the smackdown on the other too.I really enjoy sharing photos on that kind of platform as well as the kind of links I post to HN.  I did have an image that was a breakout hit the other day which got me a burst of follows and it was really depressing that 95%-ish of those new followers are people who are apoplectic about #uspol.  There are just so many of those people and they post so much and they always say the same things and I find it emotionally contagious.I am bothered less by the right wing equivalent of those people because I don't go on X,  I live in one of the most liberal towns in America.  They bother me less because I can easily dismiss the people who are bleating "free speech",  "free speech", "freespeech" as NPC minions of Peter Thiel [1] whereas I agree with the followers of Heather Cox Richardson about the problem but think their solution is so wrong and actually destructive to their cause that they are effectively working for the Koch Organization for free and for me that stings.[1] ... although I know I shouldn't.

Deep technical critique often can't be in the comments, in my opinion. Unless you're an expert, setting up the environment, doing the experiments and presenting the data is an entire article on it's own. It would probably be healthier if people did that, rather than typing out a quick comment.Then there are topics like how AI will influence society in general, that's a multi-year sociology study, before being able to say anything with just a hint of accuracy. Warnings based on sentiment and anecdotes will always register as negative.There are some articles that have 200+ comments, in those cases whatever you have to say has probably already been posted, but people like to vent their frustrations, sometimes it helps to type out your thoughts, even if no one will read them.

To be frank, a large portion of HNers just aren't qualified for that and never will be, and a growing proportion exhibit bot-like behavior. The fact that a bot account for "The Register" operated undetected on HN for 3 years and accumulated 66k karma until I and one other commenter decided to call it out highlights issues with this community.I personally think stricter moderation of tone (maybe in an automated manner), a stricter delineation on the kinds of topics being posted to HN, and a complete overhaul of the now 17 year old HN guidelines is now in order.HN used to be a platform where ICs and decisionmakers could anonymously have a water cooler conversation or a discussion but leave with changed impression. Over the past few years, it has exhibited hallmarks of becoming a more combative forum with users exhibiting Reddit-like behavior and oftentimes sharing articles from a handful of Reddit subs. Without a significant revamp, HN will lose it's signal-to-noise ratio which differentiated it.Already, most YC founders prefer to use BookFace over HN and more experienced technical ICs are looking to lobsters.

reply

You're also right that HN's moderation probably removes hostile content quickly (which is why I prefer this platform to other roptions tbh). So the negativity we observe is mostly substantive critique rather than personal attacks.That said, I'd push back a bit on whether this makes the finding less interesting. If anything, the opposite seems true. The fact that HN's "negativity" is constructive criticism, and that this criticism correlates with 27% higher engagement, tells us something about how technical communities value critical analysis over promotional framing. The classifier limitation is real (also see my other replies), but the engagement correlation holds whether we call it "negative sentiment" or "evaluative critique."I'll add a limitations section to make the terminology clearer: "negative sentiment" as used here means evaluative criticism detected by SST-2-trained models, not personal attacks or toxic comments. Thanks for your feedback!

> ... we observe extreme inequality in attention distribution. The Gini coefficient of 0.89 places HN among the most unequal attention economies documented in the literature. For comparison, Zhu & Lerman (2016) reported Gini co-efficients of 0.68–0.86 across Twitter metrics. ... The bottom 80% of posts [on HN] receive less than 10% of total upvotes. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5910263)This could probably be explained by HN's unique exposure mechanism. Every post starts on /newest and unless it gets picked up by the smaller group of users who browse /newest, it never reaches the front page where the main audience is. In most forums/subreddits by contrast a new post (unless it gets flagged as spam) usually gets some baseline exposure with the main audience before it sinks. On HN the main audience is downstream of an early gate and missing that gate is close to being effectively invisible. IMO this fact alone could probably explain why "attention inequality" seems more extreme on HN.

For HN titles, which tend to be evaluative and critical, I assumed DistilBERT's framing fits better than the alternatives. But the disagreement between models actually shows that "sentiment" is task-dependent rather than some universal measure. I'll add a methodology section in the revision to clarify why this model was chosen.

It would be interesting to see some of the comments that seem to be polar oposites in sentiments between the models. So ones where they are the most positive sentiment by one model but the most negative by another to analyse the cases where they disagree the most on their definition of sentiment.

There are plenty of articles or news ive red that made me think "that's pretty clever" only for HN to point out background i missed and tradeoffs making a solution worse.Sometimes criticism is shallow or pedantic, but thats easy to dismiss if irrelevant.

Rather a lot of what is said in any given social circle has to do with complaining.  It's very common for people to point out something that is viewed as bad by everyone.  Then the group commiserates and bonds over that.  Even though an AI might consider such complaints negative, there might be a positive effect on people feeling heard and supported by a like-minded group.For this reason, I'd take OP's results with a modicum of salt.  Human interaction doesn't have to be all rainbows and unicorns to have a positive psychological impact.  As with in-person interactions, I suspect a significant portion of what OP's LLM's described as negative might just be humans bonding through complaint among peers.

In my neighborhood an electrical power outage is news; but yet another day of consistent electrical power supply is not news. But taking a step back, I think it is noteworthy! It makes my life better every day, and compared to the vast sweep of human history, it's a huge positive anomaly. My life is full of stuff like this, as I suspect the lives are of many HNers.I say this because while I do value news reporting and knowing what's wrong or could be better, I also try hard to maintain this broader awareness of what's (still) positive and going well. Even if its consistency makes it seem unremarkable on short time scales like the daily news cycle.

This hit a nerve in a good way.Something I think about is intersection of "cringe"-like content and genuine uplifting content. There's tons of stuff out there about how people take care of themselves, how they're improving their health, hair, body, mood, whatever. Obviously the influencer world is present in this sphere of content.I suspect the content that leans way towards cringe goes way more viral, but if you step back, it's great so many people are trying/doing so many healthy and self-care-oriented things and making themselves feel better bit by bit.

We need to do something and are actively working on it. The challenge is to distinguish thoughtful critique from negativity-venting. The former is fine, the latter is lame. Unfortunately HN has too much of the latter.I believe it has to do with macro trends in society at large and on the internet, which we can't expect to be immune from—but also with the community here getting older. That scares and worries me, because HN won't survive over the long haul if new cohorts of users don't keep showing up. Along with that, there seems to be increased waves of jadedness, bitterness, and cynicism that use this place as a dumping ground for bad feelings.*That's a nasty dynamic, since the more it happens, the more it encourages more of it to happen. Meanwhile, people who don't enjoy jaded, bitter, and denunciatory rhetoric are just incentivized to leave: a classic vicious circle.This is why we added the following to https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html last year: Don't be curmudgeonly. Thoughtful criticism is fine, but please don't be rigidly or generically negative.(* I guess I'd better do the pre-emptive disclaimer thing and say no, of course this is not inevitable as one gets older. Many of HN's best, most curious and thoughtful commenters are (probably) older than the median user here. But it's statistical enough we're suffering from the trend. Clichés like old-man-yells-at-cloud and get-off-my-lawn have a basis, and that type of commenter is more motivated to comment (angrily and biliously) than others.)

That is the key takeaway. If critique is scored as negative, then there is nothing wrong with HN being "negative". Analysis and critical response to new ideas, tech, and products is a good thing, so I believe we should be responding positively to a report that says we apply negativity in productive ways.

I recall there being studies on financial loss vs gain, and that financial losses seem to effect emotions about 4x more than wins, so for an actual balanced algorithm, it would seem that positive posts should be boosted about 4-5x to have any chance of being surfaced on a modern social network. Given what we know about human psychology, sentiment boosts really should be a thing. Is anyone working on that?

reply

Hmm... Technical critiques are very different from truly negative comments. I'm not sure they should be lumped together. Technical critiques are often interesting and useful.In my experience, truly negative comments which don't meet the guidelines rarely appear on HN, and when they do appear, they tend to disappear very, very quickly, thanks to the moderators.

The definition above indicates "negative" may be a bit harsh as a term, it might be useful to see a split of that percentage between "unnecessary pushback" and "scrutiny".This comment will of course count as negative - it could no doubt be more substantive and better written but hopefully it is understood in the latter sense.

You could measure in two ways:1) raw score for the post. Look at the distribution of total scores and remove the low scoring posts. I personally think this will remove more negative posts than positive. (Note: this would be another way to look at this: for the posts with an overall negative sentiment, does the post score more or less).2) total number of unique people participating in the discussion. The more dynamic posts tend to be more positive, or at least balanced in my mind (might be wrong, but that's my gut feeling).3) You could also look at the peak rank of the post -- if the post stayed on the front page for more than 1 hour, but this seems more arbitrary and difficult.I think the idea here is that posts aren't created equal and some have different engagement patterns. What I'd like to know is if a post is skewing negative, does it get more or less traction. What are the incentives for the poster vs the commenter? Both get karma points, but does a commenter get more for being negative vs does a poster get more points for submitting articles expected to have a negative discussion?There are a number of other questions, like are there keywords that tend to produce negative posts (for example: are posts talking about AWS more positive or negative).  Or - are there topics that generally perform better? Are "expected" posts better? Are more "unique" posts better? Are "Show HN" posts more positive than other posts?I'd be happy to help - info in bio if you're interested.

Inquisitive posts, of course, can largely look for question marks.I think a lot of this boils down to "tone is hard to decipher in text."  And is a large part of why so many of us default to assuming an aggressive tone from others.  (Though, my personal pet idea there is that people are largely afraid to use questions more.)

I would expect most comments on HN to be critical and argumentative, but that isn't negativity. Being dismissive without good reason, or actually saying mean things (violates rules) would be clear negativity. But disagreement and questioning things, is part of how we all learn and share information. Matter of fact, the fastest way to learn things (as the meme goes) is to state something obviously incorrect and let people disagree with you, and show you a better way.In the few years I've been on HN, it's been very rare to see an actual negative comment that isn't simply someone having a sincere opinion different from someone else, and not getting flagged or downvoted-heavily.Would the author view this comment as negative, or would they see it as inquisitive? Because I'm not even criticizing anything the OP said or did, I'm genuinely wondering.

The central knowledge shared is that knowledge behaves like germs and can spread. Those that play on emotions spread better, and among the thought germs that spread based on emotions, the ones that play on anger spread the best.Worst yet: There are anger based thought germs which live in symbiosis and harmony even if they cause conflict among the humans who hold that germs.

You should vote, you should volunteer, you should help your neighbor, you should understand and be kind to others with different beliefs, and perhaps under the extreme you should die for your beliefs to help enact them.What you shouldn't do though is spend all day reading and posting memes about subjects you are already familiar with.

> It's human nature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias. Everyone does it, but we perceive other people as doing it more than we do, which is itself a variation of the bias.
You can even see it in the title of the OP, in the word "overwhelmingly". That's excessive: the negative bias is noticeable, but if you look closely, it's not overwhelming. (To make up some numbers, it's more like 60-40, not 90-10.)However, it often feels as if it is overwhelming; in fact, one or two datapoints, plus negativity bias, are enough to create just such a feeling. The feeling gets expressed in ways that trigger similar feelings in other people, so we end up with a positive* feedback loop.The interesting question is, what factors mitigate this? how do we dampen negativity bias? or, how do we get negative feedback into our positive feedback loop of negative affect? That must also be happening all the time, or we'd be in a "war of all against all", which isn't the case, though (again) it may feel like it.* ['positive' in the sense of increasing; a positive loop of negative affect!]https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40430263

That must also be happening all the time, or we'd be in a "war of all against all", which isn't the case, though (again) it may feel like it.* ['positive' in the sense of increasing; a positive loop of negative affect!]https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40430263

Note that for humans and other social animals "survival" doesn't always mean life or death -- it can mean being included or excluded from a social group which indirectly affects survival chances.

Just need to find the right scissor statement to really get the debate going.

- People with expertise / exceptional qualities are by definition out-numbered by the rest, so there must be privileged seats if you want quality to become represented.- Social coherence requires turning lots of conversations into a few, again requiring fewer privileged seats to represent views efficiently and have conversations between well-informed people trusted by those they represent.- Preventing runaway power feedback loops from reinforcing one single set of views requires that independent hierarchies can exist, which is pluralism.https://positron.solutions/articles/hierarchy-elevates-socia...

Real discourse tends to be critical. If you want sloppy trade press, read Apple Insider or Business Insider, or maybe watch a slop tech creator like Linus Tech Tips.

They are either easily to classify as useless when they don't provide reasoning or they provide useful insight to think about.If often submit links to HN for that kind of feedback

And at least the negativity allows us to fix the problems. I'm actually sick of modern toxic positivity, problems that could be fixed early are deliberately ignored until they couldn't be ignored anymore.

Does it? A lot of the negativity is structural (late stage capitalism and all), and there is very little talk regarding fixing these issues.

Old platforms always end up having problems with the users capable of making positive contributions only having so much time in the day to post, whereas the incorrigible and insane are usually unemployed or use the site compulsively at work, so they end up being overrepresented and stick around for longer.In the past I saw a lot more of these users get flagged and lose interest in the site, but recently it seems as though more users are vouching for the flagged comments and submissions.

What if 65% of what's being discussed is stupid or evil? Then 65% negativity would seem to be proportionate. What if 80% of what's posted is stupid? Or 20%?That's the only way you can really make this number meaningful. You can't just look at the number and read in some undisciplined interpretation.(And frankly, consider this. Suppose person A makes a claim. Now suppose person B agrees with that claim and person C disagrees with that claim. Who is more likely to respond? If B agrees and has nothing to add, no additional depth or insight to provide, then there is no reason for a followup comment. An upvote suffices. But if C disagrees, then there's something to contradict and a reason to followup with an explanation of why there is disagreement.)

-----1) I do not understand in any way the sentiment that discussion should ideally consist of people agreeing with and encouraging each other.The reason I speak with people is either to inform or learn. If I'm informing, this is not really a discussion. I'm just telling people something that they may not know. There are two ways to learn: one is to listen and not speak, which is the mirror of the above. The way to learn through speaking is that somebody says something, I dispute or question that thing, and that person shows me why I'm wrong.So the way to learn while speaking is that someone says something, I say something negative about that thing, and then that person says something negative about the negative thing I've just said.Friends and family are what you need, not the empty, uninformed, ritualistic, and above all socially-pressured positive comment of strangers.-----2) Following up on the first point (which is mainly a personal observation), it's important to say (although completely unsurprising and obvious) that negativity is relative. On HN (or reddit, or any comment site), the first post or OP is assigned positivity.A great example is this very OP, which is an accusation of negativity on Hacker News, which with no context is quite obviously a post with negative sentiment. The way you would grade reactions to it in a vacuum would say that other posts disputing its conclusions are positive.Its methodology, however, requires that the posts disputing it be graded as negative: "Criticism of technology, skepticism toward announcements, complaints about industry practices, frustration with APIs." What are the OPs that contain these posts? Links to technologies and technology advocates, announcements, recommendations of particular practices, descriptions of APIs.Accusations of negativity and tone policing are always content-free social control. If I set my point of view as positive and uplifting (while posting about how HN and reddit and social media are evil poison promulgated by evil people who should be physically stopped to save civilization), I can silence dispute through calling the mods rather than through discussion.The more indefensible my position is, the more I will prefer the sort of "discussion" where I say something, other people dispute it, and I accuse them of being negative people with implications of bad faith and possibly psychological unsoundness.

Amazon's augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.

Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.

Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn't specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.

And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app's Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.

Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon's Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company's Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren't in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.

Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.

For people who subscribe to Amazon's Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.

The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.

Margaret Atwood has spent most of her 86 years writing prolifically across subjects and genres, from speculative fiction to poetry to children's books—often plumbing the depths of her own relationships and experiences to do so. But it's only now that the celebrated writer is putting her own life to paper. In her recently published memoir, Book of Lives, Atwood chronicles everything from her youth in the Canadian wilderness, to her early professional years toiling in relative obscurity, to the various grudges and score settling she's finally able to undertake freely—since the people involved, she notes, are now largely dead.

Of course, Atwood long ago ascended from being defined merely as a writer. She has become, particularly since her dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale experienced a timely resurgence during the first Trump administration, something of a sociocultural and political expert, asked to opine on everything from dictatorships to reproductive rights to social media. Her takes, it must be said, are often very smart and very good. They're also, as I learned during a lengthy and expansive conversation with Atwood for The Big Interview podcast, still decidedly reassuring: In a 2023 interview with WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs, Atwood said that she was still optimistic about the United States. Despite everything that's happened thus far during Trump 2.0, she tells me her stance hasn't changed.

As a Canadian myself, the child of a writer, and someone who doesn't believe in god, interviewing Margaret Atwood is probably as close as I'll get to having a truly religious experience. Atwood was sharp, hilarious, and generous with her time—even leaving her landline phone off the hook when it wouldn't stop ringing—as we talked about the merits of jumping from gig to gig, the ins and outs of political resistance, doomscrolling, and much, much more. Here's our conversation.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Margaret Atwood, welcome to The Big Interview.

MARGARET ATWOOD: Thank you very much.

Thank you for being here. Now, we always start these conversations with some very quick questions, like a warm-up for your brain. Are you ready?

I'm always ready.

Typewriter or computer?

Right now, computer.

Spiritually though.

Spiritually, typewriter.

Pierre Trudeau or Justin Trudeau?

Oh, whoa. Woo. What a question. That is very loaded. Do I get a choice of neither?

Yes. Neither is an option.

OK.

You elect neither?

Unfortunately, I cannot elect “neither” because nobody's called that. But I don't belong to a political party and I usually vote on the basis of what the person is likely to do.

Fair enough. What is the best and worst part of literary fame?

The best part of literary fame is you don't have to work for a university and you can't get fired.

Love that.

The worst part is selfies.

Are you often asked for selfies?

In very odd places, such as the ladies' washroom. Do I allow selfies? We're not gonna go there because then I'll get just so many more requests for them.

OK. If Gilead took over Canada, which province would rebel first?

Quebec?

I thought you would say Quebec or Alberta.

Yeah, either one. I mean, you can have both if you want. I don't know about Alberta. They've had some pretty, um, Gilead signs recently.

You're not wrong. For those unfamiliar with Albertan politics, I would describe it as the most Texas of the provinces.

But not very Texas. I think it's another one of those places that's very divided between rural and urban.

That makes sense. If you could live for one year inside any book, which book would you live inside?

Do we want peace and quiet or excitement?

Well, that's up to you, but excitement.

Well, and you have to say whether you'd be the maid, whether you'd be the central character. It's pretty specific. It's like a past life. People who think they've had past lives, they're never a ditch digger. They're always Cleopatra. So any book that I would like to live inside, well now, what a question … For peace and quiet, Anne of Green Gables.

Well, that sounds lovely. I think we can do that.

Yes, it's before World War I, no bad things had happened. No bad 20th-century things had happened yet.

What is a misconception about you that you secretly enjoy?

I think I would offer up the rumor that was going around in about 1960, 1970, that I dressed up in pre-revolutionary French court dress, including the wig, and prowled the streets of Toronto at night in this getup.

Why would you be doing that?

I don't know, nor do I know where this rumor came from, but it was a rumor.

That's a really good one.

The only thing I can suspect is that the rumor was supposing I'd been alive since 1780, and was still wearing the same outfit while looking for my prey.

Name something humans will still be arguing about in a hundred years.

Gender.

I like that. Now, let's go back to the beginning because we are, of course, here on the occasion of you publishing a book all about your 86 years on earth, which I just finished reading over the weekend. It was a remarkable book. You wrote your first story at 6 years old. You say there wasn't much else to do in the Canadian wilderness. I, as a Canadian, am inclined to agree …

No, only when it's raining. You have to put “when it's raining.” When it's not raining, there's lots of other things to do.

Fair. I think what was particularly interesting to me, and what I didn't know about your history, was that you spent very large portions of your childhood in a very remote part outside of Ottawa …

Much further north than that. So up north in the Canadian boreal forest, either up the Ottawa River on the Quebec side or over in Sault Saint Marie, which is, as you know, at the eastern end of Lake Superior. What was I doing there? My dad was a forest entomologist, and those were the months, after the ice went out, until after it froze, until it was freezing up, that's when insects are active and can be studied. Then in the winters we would be in a city where he would write up his research.

So you are spending months and months at a time in the wilderness. How did that shape you as an adult?

Be prepared to improvise 'cause things break, right? You can't call the repair person 'cause you don't have a phone. There isn't one. So be prepared to improvise. Never throw out a bendy piece of wire. You will need one. Just saying. If you wanna get lost in the woods, come with me.

My dad, in addition to being a scientist, was also what I call one of the old bushy guys. So one of the old woodsman-type of people that used to be fairly common in Canada, but probably aren't anymore.

I mean, you see them on the streets of Toronto. They have big beards and flannel shirts, but they're cosplaying …

Uh, those are not …

No, I know. They're called hipsters now. The other piece that surprised me, although it shouldn't have been surprising, was how many years, decades, you spent in what sounded like relative financial precarity. You don't just fast-forward to having written dozens and dozens of books.

No, not at all. No writer does.

So you got a job at a marketing research firm. After leaving Harvard, you jumped from gig to gig. You were a lecturer, a teacher, a writer in residence, while you were publishing these early books. Lots of people, I think now more than ever, jump from gig to gig. That's the economy that we live in. Would you rather have hunkered down writing books or was there real value for you, in hindsight, in moving from role to role to role?

I think it's very valuable, particularly if you're writing novels, to have some kind of experience of how people actually live when they're not at quote, “creative writing school,” which didn't exist when I was doing those things.

I did have a poet, an older known female poet, say to me very early on, in about 1961, “If you want to be a writer, you have to drive a truck.”

Good luck with that as a woman.

Yeah, good luck with that as a short female in the 1960s. It wasn't possible, but translating that into other things, like other types of jobs, I think that's right.

When did you realize, or was it a realization at all, that your own life and those experiences, and the people you met and your parents and so on and so forth, would be a source of storytelling and characters and inspiration? Did that happen organically?

I think organically, for sure. My parents were both big storytellers. My mother told a lot of stories about her family, which was extended and eccentric and from Nova Scotia. It was the norm in those days to have an extended eccentric family if you were from Nova Scotia. She had lots of stories about her youth, which took place before motor cars and television or any of those things, and were pretty interesting and funny. My dad was funny, too, but his stories were about other things. They were usually about horrifying adventures he'd had in the backwoods.

I don't think it was so much about the material that they were telling as the fact that they were telling it. Stories don't have to be about dwarves and Cinderellas, they can be about people you've known.

I noticed in the book that you refer to your dreams more than once. There are a few very moving passages about your parents dying in particular. It is a very poorly understood field. Scientists don't know why we dream. It is a great medical mystery. How do you think about dreams and dreaming, and what is their significance to you?

It is a universally shared human characteristic. And we suspect it also happens among dogs.

I have two dogs and they definitely dream. They're moving. They're making little yipping noises. It's wild.

It's an interesting area, and lots of cultures have been very attentive to their dreams. But in general, and you know this yourself, you have dreams that are just kind of taking out the trash and little bits of this and that, and other ones that appear to you to be quite significant.

So why do those ones appear to be quite significant? Because they connect with something that's going on in your life. If you have a problem, let's say it's a creative problem, let's say it's a scientific problem, and you go to sleep, you often have the answer when you wake up because your brain has been working away at it.

So going to sleep or going for a walk are often helpful when you're waiting for answers to come out of left field.

Do you write your dreams down?

I have done, I've written some of them down, and people have said also that if you keep a dream journal, you're likely to remember them better in the morning.

I noticed that you recalled one dream in the book from when you were 13, a nightmare that you had. I thought to myself, “She either wrote that down or she has a really frighteningly good long-term memory.”

I have a frighteningly good long-term memory. Sorry.

I'm very impressed.

My brother said after reading my memoir—he's a man of very few words—he said, “You seem to have an unusually detailed memory.”

I mean, he's correct. I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning.

Well, that's different. I can't remember what happened to me yesterday morning, but you remember things of significance, not just what you did yesterday morning. Not what you had for breakfast. It's things that stand out. So catastrophes, things that are very funny, stupid things you did.

You have had a remarkable career, and in many respects, an unlikely one. As we've talked about already, it's not easy to make even a basic living as a writer. Do you think you would make it as a writer if you were in your twenties today instead of 60 years ago? What would be different today?

Well, a lot of things would be different, but it's a meaningless question because I would be quite a different person at 20. Then I remind you that pantyhose had not even been invented when I was 20. It was the dark ages.

But when you look at young writers …

First of all, in Canada anyway, when I was 20, there was not very much competition. Because only a lunatic would've chosen to be a writer. There were a lot of lunatics in the bohemian underground writing community at that time.

These were not the most able of people. I was quite abnormal amongst them. I wasn't an alcoholic. I wasn't a drug addict, and I didn't want to commit suicide. So what business have you got being a writer? So now it's been more professionalized, I think, through lots of advice, seminars, and creative writing schools and people saying, “Here's what you have to do and this is how it works.” We didn't have a clue. Not one single clue. I didn't know what an agent was. I had no idea what should be in a book contract or any of those things.

So, it's more professionalized and more respectable. So more people think they're gonna go into it, right? They get a certain amount of flim-flam shoved their way. You know, you're gonna write a first novel and you're gonna get a six-figure advance and then you'll be famous. And that doesn't happen very often.

Or, let's put it another way. We were in Ireland at a bed and breakfast and we had a very good breakfast and we said to the man, “This is a really good breakfast.” He said, “I used to be a chef.” And we said, “Oh, where were you a chef?” He named the restaurant. And we said, “Oh, what a coincidence. We had dinner there last night.” Pause. “How was the dinner?” We said, “Well, we thought it was pretty good.” Pause. “Anyone can cook a good dinner once.”

You have a hit with a book. Now do it again. Then do it again, and do it again.

Exceedingly unlikely.

It happens, but not to everybody who decides to do that. Whereas with a lawyer, you're usually bound to get some kind of a job.

Yes, as my dad reminded me many times.

It's very risky. It's gambling. There's a lot of luck involved, and also a lot of persistence because you have to keep doing it.

There's only four ways of surviving as an artist: Have money or marry money. People have done that. Have a patron, and that includes the Pope, the Canada Council, and everything in between. Have a job that is not related to writing, a job in the other world. Like T.S. Eliot worked in a bank. Or go to the market. So that means selling your books and living off the proceeds. Very few writers can do that in North America.

Did you ever seriously contemplate moving to the United States earlier in your career?

When I was at Harvard, it was quite tempting. Not that I would get hired by Harvard because Harvard didn't hire women in the English department at that time, but I got a letter from the Canadian government and it said, “We certainly hope you'll come back to Canada because we really need you.”

Oh wow. That's a nice letter to get.

I think so. I wonder how many people get letters like that now.

You're the first I've ever heard of.

So situated generationally, born in 1939, wartime baby, low birth rate, following the Depression, low birth rate, followed by the post-war baby boom. People could see this wave of babies washing towards them and they knew they didn't have enough people to fill the jobs to service those babies. So people of my generation were in demand.

It wasn't a question of whether we would have a job, it was a question of what kind of job we would have.

So did the letter do it?

Certainly inclined me in that direction, plus the fact that my student visa was gonna run out.

I ask because for me growing up in Canada, the prevailing wisdom was, Well, if you wanna go big, you go to the United States.

That was the prevailing opinion. And people did say that to me, but they said, “If you want to be a writer, you need to leave.”

I want to ask you about The Handmaid's Tale. Your name at this point is practically synonymous with prescient, whether you like that or not. One aspect I'm curious about, though, is technology in the book. Technology was not a key part of it, right? The Eyes are actual human beings. People are punished in these antiquated ways. There is no mass surveillance apparatus the way there is in the United States today. Even in 1985 when you were writing it, certainly there was a degree of government surveillance …

Yeah, but you'd have to get into somebody's apartment and rig them up, and bug it.

Sure. You would've had to bug it.

Yes, there were those things, but there were no cell phones. There was no internet. I think it segues OK today because those women would not be allowed access to those things anyway. As for a dark car driving by, you don't know what's in it. You know that you're being surveilled, but you don't know how.

Was that a concerted decision in writing the book, or was it simply a matter of writing in a way that reflected your context?

We had credit cards, and that certainly makes it into the book because what better way to make women go back into the home than cut off their jobs and credit cards? Which is what's happening now in the United States. There's actually a movement afoot to make it impossible for women to have credit cards in their own names. That law was not changed until 1974.

Obviously the piece around reproductive rights and reproductive freedom is incredibly salient today and has been, unfortunately, for several years. When you were writing the book in the eighties, did you sense a backlash to a woman's right to choose? Was that a conversation that you were aware was happening?

I think there is a backlash against women's rights in general, beginning with the election of Ronald Reagan and the rise of the so-called religious right as a political force in the United States. And I did keep a scrapbook of what people were saying. Newspaper clippings. Remember them? No, you don't.

I was born in ‘86, so …

Yeah, just at the edge of newspaper clippings. So they were saying that women belong in the home and they were certainly pushing back against a woman's right to choose. The ‘70s had been pretty game-changing for women in North America. So there was a reaction to that in the ‘80s. That's one of the reasons I wrote the book, because what people say they would like to do if they got power, because I think they will actually do it.

Right.

Some people say, “It's just words. They don't really mean it.” I always think they do mean it. Then I think, how would you go about it on a practical level? So here's all these women running around like gerbils having credit cards and jobs and money and apartments of their own. How would you get them back into a male-dominated, controlled space?

Well, you wrote a bit of a playbook.

But it's not new. It's not my playbook. It's what people have done over time.

Sure. What was so interesting to us, among other things that WIRED is covering in this most recent federal election, was that the playbook had been written.

Oh yeah.

It was out there. You could go see what they were going to do.

Yep.

He just says these crazy things. They would never actually … It's like, no, no. Take it literally, it's right here. You can read what they're gonna do.

Yes. So the other thing was, I believe in the Bible, literally. I guess they've never read it.

Right?

Which part of it do you believe literally? Are we going to follow the lifestyles of some of the people in it, because they're pretty severe and weird. So, in The Handmaid's Tale, the Handmaids are in the Rachel and Leah story in the Bible. That's why I put that quote at the front.

I'm curious about your take on the saga of the lonely young man. I ask because it feels like, at least to me, and I think to a lot of us sitting here, the con there is so much concern and conversation around young men online. It has, I think, eclipsed so many conversations around gender recently. It feels like women are increasingly excluded from those conversations. We're spending a lot of time wondering what to do about the plight of the man when there's a lot that we could be talking about on both sides. I'm wondering what you make of that, or where you think that comes from.

It's real.

Well, it is real. Sure.

But you're wondering why people are talking about it. Well, they didn't for quite a long time. In fact, they pretty much ignored it. You could see where it was going because here came all of these young men who were told they were bad and nobody wanted to listen to them anymore. It was no longer the days of going steady in the ‘50s. That shows up in statistics, how many women are succeeding at university and how many men are dropping out. Because obviously they don't feel welcome. They feel directionless. They don't know why they're doing all of this. They don't get a lot of, “Hey, you're great.” They get a lot of “shut up” and “we don't wanna hear your opinions.”

So, they congregate in bunches and worship Jordan Peterson because they feel, as young folks say now, they feel seen.

It's a crisis. There used to be organizations that they joined. They joined ROTC; they joined the military in the summers. They joined the Boy Scouts before it got such a bad rep. There was some direction for that sort of energy. But what's filling that now? What can a male young person do to feel valued by society and not like a total failure?

Well, yes, they can participate in Jordan Peterson discussion groups.

But that's not a very stable platform.

But if society is not taking the voices of young men seriously and we are increasingly suppressing the voices and the success of women, I would argue…

Yes.

Whose voices do you think are being taken seriously?

Exactly. Well, I think you're probably better placed to answer that question than I am. But every time Elon Musk opens his mouth, people take that seriously. So I would say tech bro billionaires are taken seriously. Who else? I don't know. Are we gonna count, quote, “influencers”? I think a lot of podcasters have pretty devoted followings. But again, it's very fractured.

I think you just nailed it, though, and I'm actually working through this while we talk. Everyone takes someone's voice seriously. But it is a fractured ecosystem. So we are all looking to a different source of truth.

Yeah, that's true. And that happened at the end of the 19th century with the literary community, which had been pretty monolithic in the middle of that century. By the end of it, it was pretty divided up. So I think anytime you introduce a new communications technology, you're gonna get a lot of disruption. Let me just mention the Gutenberg press followed by 300 years of sectarian religious warfare.

When WIRED's Kate Knibbs interviewed you a few years ago, you said “I am not counting the United States out.”

No, and I'm still not.

You know, everybody wants a little bit of hope.

Well, first of all, Canadians shouldn't be mad at Americans.

Well, you tell that to my dad's wife.

All Americans didn't do this.

Well, she's not mad at me. There are just many people in my life in Canada who don't want to come to the United States anymore.

They're scared.

Yeah. It's hard.

Yeah, especially with this new thing that you have to bring five years of social media information…

Disqualifying for many, many people.

So yeah, they're scared, they're apprehensive, and they don't want to take the chance. That's not the same as being mad at all American people, which is just stupid.

Of course. I have actually been surprised in the last year at how little resistance, relatively speaking, we are seeing in the United States. You know, employees at the big tech companies that we cover at WIRED, they have essentially been silenced.

They don't wanna be fired.

They don't wanna be fired. The executives running those companies are having fancy palace dinners with the president of the United States. Everyday Americans are protesting here and there. We've seen some really substantial protests at times, but what would a revolutionary moment in this country look like?

First of all, the resistance is visible in the polls, which I'm sure you're tracking.

Yeah. Of course.

They've been going down, down, down, down, down. So if you're afraid of getting fired and don't want the death threats and all the rest of it because you spoke out in public, you can express your opinion at the ballot box and in an anonymous poll. We are seeing that, we are seeing all those Democrats that got elected, and we're seeing the polls going down. So, it's there. But again, you have to understand that ordinary people are not billionaires and they have jobs.

A truly revolutionary moment would be like the French Revolution over a span of two or three years, which started out, as all these things do, they all start out as utopian visions. Things are gonna be so much better if only we … fill in the blank. Then you end up with Stalin. So, I'm not sure you really want that kind of revolution, which usually says tear it all down. So I'm not sure that you really want the terror.

No, I don't. For my family, for myself, what I want is for people to show up at the midterms and then show up in 2028 and for there to be a peaceful transition of power.

Well, I think that's quite likely to happen right now, as to the midterms, because the economic policies that we have been seeing have not been successful.

Surprise, surprise.

That's where it hits people: in the pocket book. If you look at revolutions through the ages, they usually start by being about money.

Yeah.

And in unequal distributions of power and wealth. I've thought for a little while that things were getting way too top heavy in that country and dangerously close to 1792.

Well, one challenge here is that the midterms don't solve for the grotesque wealth disparities that we now see in the United States.

No, they don't, but they may at least not increase them.

I want to ask you, speaking of power, and the consolidation of power in Big Tech, about artificial intelligence. That is a subject about which I know very little, except that it's a crap poet and a pretty bad imitator of me.

You've written about this. You wrote for The Atlantic, “What concerns me is the idea that an author's voice and mind are replicable.” I mean, that is one of many concerns about artificial intelligence. When you read about this, when you read about AI art or AI in writing, where do you sit on the notion that AI can be a useful and productive tool in the creation of works of art?

It's like absolutely every other human tool that we have ever come up with, including fire and language. So it has good news, it has bad news. It's got stupid consequences that nobody was thinking about and they're all like that. Name one, and that is what you will see.

Do you use it?

For what?

Anything—brainstorming, managing your calendar?

No, probably because I don't know how.

Do you give a shit about learning at this point?

I don't know. I mean, the thing is, anytime you sign on to any of those things, they're getting a lot of data on you.

They sure are.

They're gonna bombard you with crap. So my problem at the moment is not adding another one is getting rid of some of the ones that I have. You may have noticed that if you unsubscribe, it has no effect.

How much time do you spend online? What is your relationship to the internet? People like me spend, you know, most of our waking hours online.

Do you?

I mean, yeah.

What do you do for fun?

What do I do?

Yeah.

I run, I hang out with my daughter. I read. I cook.

OK. So you're not spending all of your life online?

Well, my job exists on the internet. My phone, I'm holding it up right now, is tethered to my body.

Well, I'm not different in that respect. I also use my phone to keep in touch with people, usually with text messages. I do a lot of doomscrolling.

You're a doomscroller.

I want to keep up with the latest doom.

You gotta, if you wanna sleep at night, you better be doomscrolling. That's what I say.

Do you?

No, I mean, I'm kidding. It's awful. My husband will be up till two in the morning looking at horrible headlines.

What you should tell him is “go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, it will be the same.” You don't have to do it at night.

So when do you doomscroll?

At night.

When I was rereading this interview you did in 2023 with WIRED you talked about a technology that you actually invented yourself.

I'm putting quote marks around “invented,” because it's quite a stupid story.

I would love to hear the story.

So the story is this: Back in the early 2000s, I was looking at the publishing sector and I was seeing a couple of things. One was that publishers only ever sent authors on tours to cities that reported to the New York Times lists. So that meant that a lot of cities were being excluded. They just never got any author visits, and a lot of authors were being excluded because their publishers were making the determination that it wasn't worth their investment to send them to these other cities.

So a lot of people just weren't being given tools for promoting their own books. So what we invented at first was supposed to be a service to the book business. What it was, and here's when I put quotation marks around it, I thought that the FedEx person who was coming with the package that you signed for, I thought the signature was flying through the air and turning into ink somewhere else, but it wasn't. So I said “Oh goody, we can sign books with this.” Actually no, you can't. So I asked some of my more tech-savvy, and I have to say younger, friends. And they took a look and there wasn't anything like that. The closest thing was long-distance surgery.

So nobody had invented anything that could scribble and you wouldn't wanna scribble on a body with a knife anyway, I don't think.

Most of us would not, no.

Not in a positive way.

No.

So we set about inventing this thing. It was going to be a remote book-signing technology. This is before any of the stuff that we currently use for it existed. So we were putting together bits that did exist, like video cams, and there was only one signing tablet that you could get at that time. We were sticking them all together. Then we needed to make something that would accommodate a book on the other end.

It had to have a lift, because books have a thickness; it had to be able to move up and down. The idea was that people could give interviews in remote places and then sign the person's book. We did invent it. It took some bizarre twists and turns along the way. I think one of our models involved something that looked like an LP disc with a little pen in the bottom. It was very accurate and it was very fast, but it was too fast. So it broke off and flew across the room.

Oh no.

Not cutting off anybody's head, but it might have. So with all of these things, you have to have something that's accurate that can be made inexpensive enough so people can actually use it. And is attractive enough some people will wish to use it and that they can see a use for it. Well, the book business didn't really grasp the beauty of the concept. But I said to one of my board members, “Frank, what else do you think this might be good for?” And he said, “Everything.”

You can go onto the internet and look up Syngrafii, or you can look up iinked and you can see that we are now in the super secure absolutely accurate, long distance, digital and ink signature business.

Are you still actively in that business?

Yes.

It's a great side hustle.

It's what?

It's a great side hustle.

It's a very interesting side hustle because we've seen it evolve over the years. The interesting thing is, because book collectors when we were first doing it were so extremely picky about it being absolutely accurate, one of them said, “I want the skin flakes on the paper.”

They weren't gonna accept signatures that weren't the real person's signature. So what we invented is something that will replicate any marks you make, and you can now do it on your phone. There weren't any phones when we started. You can do it on your computer screen. And our physical version that we started with, that we thought would become obsolete, it's now having an increased demand because people are becoming more distrustful of digital. It's so hackable.

The analog revolution.

Well, there is that. Some of that is happening.

Yeah, for sure.

Talking to young people, they're into vinyl LPs and things like that. These new phones that you can't do anything smart on. It's just a phone.

I am all for it.

How revolutionary, “Hey, this is a phone that doesn't do anything. I'm getting one!”

I know we only have a few minutes left, and I want to ask you about the book. I don't want to give anything away, but I finished it, and—I'm gonna be very honest with you here—I left wondering whether you would ever publish anything again. I also ended the book feeling like you are, if I may say this, thinking about your own death.

Oh, I think about my own death all the time, don't you?

I do, but it reads as maybe more imminent than how I think about death.

No. It's not imminent.

Well, no, let's not plan on that.

[But] not in the far distant future.

Do you plan to keep writing?

You don't plan to keep writing.

You just do.

You keep writing and then you can make plans about that. But you actually don't control whether any of your fantastically brilliant ideas is going to turn into a book. You have to discover that through the process of doing it.

Do you think about your legacy, about how you're remembered and talked about? Do you care?

I don't care.

You don't care at all.

No, because I'm not gonna be here. Also, looking at the lives of writers, usually they die, then there's a little flurry of interest in their work, then they go down, and then there might be a revival, but it usually follows the same trajectory. And it is generational, so you know “Oh, my mom read that. Ick.”

So it usually does that thing of going down and then if you're lucky it comes up again. But it's not gonna be your luck, it's gonna be your estate's luck.

To me, I think something I've always appreciated about writing and about books is there is a permanence to that. Maybe a more fleeting permanence than I'm willing to admit, or want to admit.

More chancey, a chance-ier permanence.

Yeah. By which you mean maybe it sticks …

By which I mean there were a lot more Greek classical plays than we have, and we know about them, they existed, but we don't have any copies anymore.

So ultimately it's too much to worry about, and what do we care when we're dead?

What would I do about it? I can't control the future, contrary to popular opinion. So it's one of those things of why worry because you can't do anything about it anyway.

This brings me to the perfect place to end, which is with this short game I'm gonna force you to play.

You think you're gonna force me to do something?

I'm gonna try. The short game I'm going to politely request you to play is called Control, Alt, Delete. So, what piece of technology would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change? And what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the earth if given the opportunity?

Oh, that's interesting. So the first one is, what one would I like to be able to control?

Yeah.

Do I get atomic bombs?

Yes.

OK, I'll choose that. Well, I would do nothing with them, but I would be in control of that nothing. I would be in control of whether anything got done with them or not. So if they're all under my control, the world would be safe from them.

OK. What would you alter? What would you wanna change?

What would I want to change? OK. I think I would like to change the very nasty turn that social media took after that initial period when it was fun. Because it was fun at first.

It was.

And now it's not so much fun.

Nope.

So I think parts of it are still fun, but you have to really limit what you're accessing, because the rest of it is not fun at all.

What was the third part?

Delete.

What would I delete? Do I get a large swath of it?

Yes. Go big or go home.

That's so tempting. It's so tempting and it's so beset with traps: There was a golden age and we could go back to that if only we got rid of name-your-thing-to-get-rid-of. So, I'd really probably have to think about that. But let's say we should start with the problems besetting humanity and dial back from there. How about that?

A methodical strategic approach.

So then it would be the automobile.

Wow. OK.

Because we have a problem with oil addiction, as you know.

Yes.

We also have a problem with urban expansion beyond the ability to make those bases interesting, vibrant, and safe. What allows those spaces to be so big is rapid transportation.

Cars.

So, I might do that. I might go back as far as choo-choo trains.

I like this.

But then we would be stuck with a lot of horses and then we have a horse poop problem. How would this work?

Yeah. You don't get to choose.

Well, it probably takes us into the age of steampunk to a certain extent. You know, dial it back and see if it turns out a bit differently.

LEGO's Smart Brick turns 25 patents and a standard 2x4 piece into a self-contained embedded system complete with LEDs, a speaker, and a tiny, 4.1mm ASIC.

At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Lego pulled the wraps off a familiar-looking product that behaves like a small computer. The new Smart Play platform centers on a standard 2x4 LEGO brick that packs processing, sensing, audio, wireless networking, and charging into a form factor that can still snap into a model. Tied to a March 1 retail launch, the Smart Brick debuts in three Star Wars sets, with pre-orders opening January 9.

Under the plastic, Lego has built what is effectively a mixed-signal embedded system. The company says the core is a custom 4.1mm ASIC with integrated sensors, RGB LEDs, a tiny speaker, and a radio stack. Power comes from an internal rechargeable battery that charges inductively, designed so the brick can be topped up even when buried inside a build.

Interestingly, Lego says that the brick understands its surroundings. Instead of cameras or optical tracking, Lego is using near-field magnetic sensing. ‘Smart Tags' embedded in tiles and minifigures carry unique IDs that the brick reads through copper coils. Those same coils enable relative positioning, letting multiple bricks detect distance and orientation to one another. Lego calls the resulting wireless mesh BrickNet, a low-latency network that allows two models to recognize when they are facing off or interacting without an intermediary.

Audio is handled in a similar manner. Rather than storing large sound files, Lego says the Smart Brick generates effects in real time, based on prompts from SMART Minifigures and Tags, thereby keeping memory requirements low and avoiding the need for constant updates just to add new clips. “By breaking down just a few sounds to their most basic principles, you can actually carefully adjust their frequencies and amplitude to create drastically different end results,” a deep divereads. Lego calls this a “synthetic soundscape” and, all in all, it's a very hardware-first solution to a problem most smart toys solve with a requisite app.

 




For launch, the Smart Brick appears in three all-in-one Star Wars sets ranging from 473 to 962 pieces, priced between $70 and $160 — expensive, no doubt, even for Lego. Each uses the brick to trigger music, sound effects, and interactive behavior based on how the model is handled. Importantly, Lego has been clear about what the platform does not include: there is no camera, no voice recording, and no cloud-dependent AI layer. The radio link is encrypted, and firmware updates are handled through a companion app rather than an always-on connection.

This isn't the first time that Lego has added electronics to a toy, but Smart Brick does represent a first in terms of how compact and self-sufficient this implementation is. It's essentially a computer designed to disappear into the plastic, doing just enough sensing and processing to make a model feel reactive without the need to drag a tablet into the room. For a company built on tolerances measured in fractions of a millimeter, hiding a complete system inside a brick is incredibly on-brand.

Robot vacuum maker Narwal unveiled its new set of smart vacuum cleaners at the Consumer Electronics Show with AI-powered features such as monitoring pets, finding valuable objects, and notifying users about misplaced toys.

The company said that its new flagship Flow 2 robot vacuum has a rounded design and easy-lift tanks for better cleaning. The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.

Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. 

The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.

Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2's design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.

Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.

Hyundai is not claiming that robots will take over the world, or save mankind, but on Monday at CES it may have just cracked a load-bearing pillar of investor confidence in Elon Musk and Tesla. 

Hyundai simply makes way, way, way, more cars than Tesla. Over the last three years, Hyundai sold roughly 7 million cars per year globally, while Tesla hovered around 1.8 million sales per year over that same period.

What makes Tesla, not Hyundai, the darling of Wall Street isn't the company's present day output, but the business narratives that make investors want to buy in with the expectation of an exit that will make them a fortune. Specifically, that narrative stems in part from Elon Musk's promise of a self-driving car future in which, he claims, Tesla will crush Waymo. But perhaps more importantly, it comes from Musk's claim that his Optimus line of robots is so powerful, they might end poverty, become the “biggest product of all time,” and generate “infinite” revenue.

But Tesla's line of robots has a lot to prove in a short time. It was less than five years ago that Elon Musk said he was revealing a robot prototype, but it turned out to actually be a person in a lycra bodysuit, and the whole thing was a sort of awkward, you-can't-laugh-at-me-if-I'm-laughing-too fake joke. 

Hyundai, by contrast, owns Boston Dynamics, a company three decades old, and one that pioneered the creepy, quadrupedal and then bipedal robots that used to go viral and make people make the same “kill it with fire” joke over and over. Boston Dynamics absolutely wrote the book on present-day robots. 

So with that in mind, watch the head of the Atlas program at Boston Dynamics, Zachary Jackowski, hype his robot, and keep in mind that he knows his competitor is Elon Musk:

He claims that while that thing moving around is just a research prototype, his company has been “hard at work on making the actual product version of Atlas,” and that it's going to be “the best and actually simplest robot that we have ever built.” It's going to be, he claims, water resistant, and able to endure temperatures as cold as minus 4 and as hot as 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Jackowski claims Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are putting together, the “most complete dataset in the world to train humanoid skills in manufacturing,” and that the car side of the company will soon be both using and manufacturing these things in “a new robotics factory capable of producing 30,000 Atlas robots a year.”

This is all, of course, just hype. There's no way to know what's purely meant to soothe uneasy investors and board members who are eager to slash labor costs, and what's meant to attract the attention of businesses who are thinking of becoming humanoid robot customers. 

Meanwhile, Elon Musk will only get the complete version of his famous trillion-dollar pay package if he deploys 1 million Optimus robots, so it's pretty clear what's motivating him. Nonetheless, he's pushed back the start date for Optimus robots, which, back in 2024, were supposed to be doing work in Tesla factories in 2025, and available for purchase by other companies in 2026. But Musk's claims about applications for his robots keep expanding. In November of last year he compared Optimus robots to having a “personal C-3PO/R2-D2.”

If you're reading this, Tesla probably doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, but Hyundai shouldn't either. It's a Chaebol, meaning it's one of the colossal, scandal-prone companies with troubling ties to that country's government. When it comes to creating armies of robots with the potential to crush labor power and generate “infinite” revenue, the question is not whether you should root for a company like Tesla or one like Hyundai. It's which company's outlandish narrative do you find more plausible?

The Alienware Area-51 was the kind of laptop that gets you excited to game. It felt great on the fingertips thanks to its mechanical keyboard with Cherry Ultra switches. It looked the part—like it had fallen off a UFO fuselage and was glowing with vibrant otherworldly energy through its bottom panel glass window. Its extraterrestrial design was unfortunately hampered by a dull IPS LCD screen. Dell's gaming brand may have come back to make amends. However, a revised screen—plus the skyrocketing cost of RAM—will likely demand a heftier price tag.

The new version of the Alienware 16 Area-51 for 2026 will sport an OLED panel at the same 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and 240Hz refresh rate as the previous model. This display will claim a 0.2ms response time and 120% DCI-P3 color gamut, typical of organic light-emitting diode screens. The new gaming laptop promises HDR True Black 500 certification as well as a peak of 620 nits of brightness in HDR. No, it's not the brightest display available. If you're not already aware, OLED displays offer far better contrast and black levels than other LCD-based screens. There are more modern, updated OLED screens coming to CES 2026, which promote better brightness overall.

Alienware promises the screen will have an anti-glare protector to keep the surface from reflecting too much light. Take the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i as an example of ultra-bright shiny displays that will reflect practically everything when not playing in a dim interior. The tradeoff with most anti-glare screens is a less vibrant picture. Indeed, every Alienware laptop is getting an OLED option. This includes the 16X Aurora, which will also pack a similar 240Hz panel.

There likely won't be any 18-inch OLED version, unfortunately. Alienware told Gizmodo that there aren't enough 18-inch OLED panels available to make the laptop cost-effective. Either way, the 16-inch will support the top-end Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors. The 2025 version of the 16-inch Area-51 topped out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, one step short of the highest-end 285HX, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU. The system also carried 32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM. That memory spec will likely become an issue for consumers in 2026, considering the spiking price of RAM across the board.

Dell has previously told Gizmodo that it will take “targeted pricing action when necessary” due to the spiking cost of memory. Already, the company has increased prices for corporate clients, according to a report from Business Insider. AI data centers are demanding so much high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that the semiconductor makers who are responsible for today's consumer-level RAM are shifting their focus—causing a massive shortage in memory across RAM and storage options.

Which is why consumers may be more enticed by the cheaper options. Dell's gaming brand may also have an “entry level” as well as an “ultra-slim gaming laptop” that's only around 17mm thick. I saw it in person, though Alienware was adamant I didn't take any photos of the laptop in its pre-production, relatively simplistic body. That new form factor will come in 14- and 16-inch sizes and will still support an Nvidia GPU as well as “next-gen” Intel CPUs, which could be one of the new Panther Lake variations. We can expect these laptops are meant to compete against today's 14- and 16-inch Razer Blade laptops.

No matter what, expect that laptops will cost more, but for now we can think about what may come in the future.

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone. 

As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.

The semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.

These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction.

This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.

Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company's recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.

“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”

AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.

“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”

PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.

The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.

Mechanical keyboard maker Keychron is going all in on wireless with its new Q Ultra series — which will have ZMK (rather than QMK) firmware — launched Monday at CES 2026. The Q Ultra series will be, according to Keychron, the "first mass-produced ZMK mechanical keyboard series of its kind, offering up to 660 hours of battery life in 8K polling rate in wireless mode." Yes, you read that correctly — 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate, thanks to the ZMK firmware. ZMK is, like QMK, open source — but it uses a different license (the MIT license), and is developed with wireless keyboards in mind (QMK doesn't natively support any wireless microcontrollers; QMK-based wireless keyboards like Keychron's Q1 HE or the Wobkey Rainy 75 Pro use dual- or hybrid microcontrollers, and still need to be wired for configuration). Anyway, all this to say that ZMK is (much) more power-efficient than QMK, as evidenced by the fact that Keychron's upcoming Q Series will have 660-hour, 8K polling rate battery life.

It's not just the firmware that's improved, of course. The Q Series will also feature Keychron's new Silk POM switches, which the company says is made from a new material that "delivers a richer sound and improved typing feel favored by typing enthusiasts." The keyboards will also have full aluminum bodies with layered acoustic foams and double-gasket structures for improved typing sound and feel, and double-shot PBT keycaps in a KSA profile. You'll be able to get that ultra-high 8K polling rate over both the wireless and wired connections. The Q Ultra series, launched today, comes in three layouts: the Q6 Ultra (100-percent / full-size), the Q3 Ultra (TKL), and the Q1 Ultra (75-percent). The Q6 Ultra retails for $239.99 and the Q3 and Q1 Ultra both retail for $229.99.

Keychron is also updating its V Series with new V Ultra models, which have the same improvements seen in the Q Ultra series — up to 660 hours of battery life with an 8K polling rate thanks to the ZMK firmware, updated switches to Keychron's Silk POM switches, as well as a new 1MB Flash microcontroller. The V5, V3, and V1 Ultra all have both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity (and wired), and will be available later this month. The V5 Ultra (96-percent layout) will retail for $119.99, while the V3 Ultra (80-percent TKL layout) and the V1 Ultra (75-percent layout) will both retail for $114.99.

 




Finally, Keychron also announced a few fancy special edition luxury keyboards that are (literally) rock-solid. The Keychron K2 HE Resin and the Keychron K2 HE Concrete will both launch this Feb. — both are 75-percent layout boards with Hall Effect magnetic switches and 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity. And yes, they are made of resin and concrete.

 




The Q1 HE 8K Marble Version will launch in April 2026, and will feature an 8K polling rate and Hall Effect magnetic switches (also a 75-percent layout), and will be made out of marble (only the case, it seems — looks like the keycaps are still going to be double-shot PBT). No word on pricing for these, but I'm sure they will not be cheap.

Google TV, the operating system mainly serving the successor devices to Google's defunct Chromecast line of products, is far from ubiquitous when you compare it to the overwhelmingly more popular Roku operating system and Samsung's Tizen, but for what it's worth, GTV is the one trying the hardest to shoehorn AI into the user experience. And an upcoming change announced Monday at CES will bring image and video generation via Google Gemini's Nano Banana text-to-image model family to your TV.

Like anything announced at CES, the implied promise is that people will want to use this, and the suite of features being described here is, I have to admit, intriguing. 

There are some AI assistant features mentioned in this announcement, but since the advantage Google TV has over most smart TV operating systems is that it's connected to your Google account, the most interesting new change is that Gemini will be able to search your library on Google Photos, and apply the Nano Banana features you may have already futzed around with on your smartphone, but from the comfort of your couch this time. This means adding uncanny effects to your family photos via the Photos Remix feature, and the ability to, according to Google's press release about the update “transform memories into cinematic immersive slideshows.” 

This next ability is listed separately in Google's press release, even though it sounds a bit like the first: “Use Nano Banana and Veo to reimagine your personal photos or create original media directly on your TV.” 

As photos accompanying the announcement make clear, much of what's on offer here is designed to, well, get TV viewers to watch a slop generator.

In one image, Google AI Premium users are invited to create videos. Another shows the actual video creation interface, which has what look like Pixar-style animated sample videos with suggested prompts like, “Fluff fish swimming on coral reefs made with squishy yarn.” There's a popup at the bottom of this menu with the text, “Describe your video…” Below that is instructional text about pressing and holding the mic button on your remote to talk.

It all paints a picture of an activity you're meant to enjoy in your living room: the “generate videos of our family members” game, perhaps. But the window dressing is more wholesome and kid-oriented than Sora's more brainrot-forward approach to user-generated video.

Anecdotally, most people I know who tried Sora had their curiosity slaked after a few days on the app, and don't really revisit it. I can see that being a problem with generating custom videos on Google TV as well. But there is, at the very least, something novel about messing around with AI while curled up with the dog and a bowl of popcorn. 

 

Google's release says these features will come to certain TCL devices first, and will expand to the rest of the Google TV universe “over the coming months.”

You already know everything you need to about what's happening inside Intel's latest laptop chips. Intel Core Ultra Series 3, aka Panther Lake, promises to offer strong performance plus a solid battery life. Now, we finally know which chips are going in which laptops, and I can already tell you you want one with the higher-end graphics capabilities.

There are a heap of different chips for various price points. The top-end Panther Lake chip is the Intel Core Ultra 388H, a 16-core CPU with a max performance core frequency of 5.1GHz. This chip will indeed sport the new Intel Arc B390 graphics with 12 of Intel's newfangled Xe3 GPU cores. Just a reminder, Panther Lake will support Wi-Fi 7 standard but not Thunderbolt 5. There will be laptops with these chips available for preorder starting Jan. 6, so pay attention to Gizmodo's CES coverage for all the specifics on that front.

In either case, Intel promises Core Ultra Series 3 will offer 60% better CPU performance over the previous-gen Lunar Lake chips. Intel also claimed laptops with these chips could get seven hours of battery life using UL Procyon Battery Life benchmarks and nine hours in a Microsoft Teams chat.

The other big upgrade this time around is the GPU capabilities. The chips are using a die-to-die bridge, allowing the chipmaker to scale up the graphics processor. The highest-end Intel chips will receive 12 Xe3 GPU cores. Sure, that means it will offer stronger gaming performance compared to a last-gen AMD chip, but Intel went as far as to claim it could manage over 50 fps in Battlefield 6 with “Overkill” graphics settings. That's only with the help of a revised XeSS upscaler. The updated XeSS 3 also has multi-frame generation capabilities, if you really don't mind the thought of playing games with so-called “fake frames.”

Intel is betting its latest chips are going to offer the secret sauce for mobile gaming. Now it's hoping to dethrone AMD on handheld PCs. Just as the company previously promised last year, Intel promised we'll see some new pint-sized gaming devices sporting Panther Lake sometime later this year.

Asus decided it's not giving up on a mobile gaming machine with more than one screen. At CES 2026, the company announced a new version of the ROG Zephyrus Duo that doubles the amount of 16-inch screen real estate you get on a typical laptop by—well—adding an extra OLED screen on an extra-large hinge.

There are actually two separate notes of inspiration to ROG's latest off-the-wall design. The first ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 from 2022 included an awkward 14.1-inch secondary panel that rose at an angle from the main display. This form factor scrunched the size of the keyboard and mousepad. Instead, the new Duo takes inspiration from the Asus Zenbook Duo with that laptop's hinged dual 14-inch screens and a keyboard that magnetically attaches to the bottom portion. The Zephyrus Duo includes the same slash lighting feature as the Zephyrus G14 and G16 laptops. However, the dual 16-inch screens offer some interesting new use cases for gaming or working on the go.

Like the Zenbook Duo, users can position the laptop with the screens vertically or else use the built-in kickstand to show the two displays on top of each other. That could be especially handy for mobile workers who can't get anything done without an additional display. Windows 11 doesn't allow for more than one full-screen game to run at once, which is a particular detriment to this device. However, Asus showed off their laptop running with the game mirrored on two screens at once with the laptop folded like a tent. If you're playing a co-op game, that may mean the two players don't have to hunch around a single small laptop display.

The new Zephyrus Duo arrives at the same time as a revised Zenbook Duo. The latter features a more seamless hinge that limits the amount of screen bezel. The Zephyrus is a larger, more capable device, mandating a larger and more pronounced mechanism. The Zephyrus' two 3K, 120Hz OLED displays will be enough for most gaming needs, but as for performance, it will be an interesting mix. The dual-screened laptop features a “next-gen Intel Core Ultra” processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU. Before you get excited, this is still a thin device. That limits the TGP, or total graphics power, to a bare 135W.

Whether this new Zephyrus model makes the cut will depend more on how it can perform with two screens running compared to only one. Battery life on all gaming laptops is already an issue, and it will be worse when trying to display two screens at once. Otherwise, Kojima fans may be more interested in a new version of the ROG Flow Z13, one that's inspired by Death Stranding 2: On a Beach. The limited edition gaming tablet/laptop hybrid still uses the same AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU that's proved so good for gaming, but it also sports a new expanded keyboard cover and a rear vent grill that will look striking even if you don't know what “Ludens” refers to.

The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation today revealed compelling new research pointing to major healthcare access challenges and financial burdens disproportionately affecting young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The national survey, conducted by the Foundation, assessed healthcare and financial experiences across three groups: young adults aged 18-25, adults aged 26-64, and caregivers of pediatric patients under 18.

The findings, published today in Crohn's & Colitis 360, are based on responses from over 1,700 IBD patients and caregivers.

Key findings:

The goal of the survey was to assess the state of access to care for patients with IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and affects approximately 1 in 100 Americans. The study was conducted as an online survey of IBD patients and their caregivers in the United States from February to June 2023.

These numbers demonstrate a clear gap in support and guidance for young adults as they transition from pediatric care and begin managing their own health insurance. The data show that not only are younger patients at greater risk of having to jump through insurance hoops to access essential medications, they also face substantial financial pressure-often working extra jobs just to afford care."

Laura Wingate, Chief Education, Support & Advocacy Officer, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation

"The research highlights a need for targeted educational resources, improved insurance navigation assistance, and policy attention to mitigate the unique challenges faced by young adults with IBD," said the study's lead author, Ross Maltz, MD, pediatric gastroenterologist, Nationwide Children's Hospital.

The Foundation is calling on partners, advocates, and the broader healthcare community to help amplify these findings and promote equitable access to care for all age groups.

An antibody activates the immune system's cellular and cytoplasmic defence to combat a pathogen. This occurs via interactions of the Fc (CH2-CH3) region to activate three effector function pathways and impacts half-life of antibody (Figure 1). These can be modulated via several Fc mutations to achieve bespoke effects, specific to project needs.

Bridge the gap in literature by producing combined Fc effector function and half-life extension mutations to investigate how these may affect the biophysical/functional properties of the therapeutic mAb being developed.

All Phase III mutants have been developed on the Trastuzumab backbone. These were characterised by a range of biophysical and functional assays.

Q combined mutations have also reported a lower melting temperature (Tm).

Mutation D is hydrophobic and introduces hydrophobicity in Fc combination mutants.

Table 1. shows all the biophysical and functional assays performed on the Trastuzumab mutations. Source: ELRIG (UK) Ltd.





* Q is a half-life extension tested in previous phases of the effector function toolbox.* R is a CDC increasing mutation, also tested in previous phases.* P is a mutation that reduces all effector functions, also tested in previous phases.

Trastuzumab Fc mutants were screened for their functional activity on the following assays:

Digital microfluidics enables highly miniaturized electroporation for cell engineering. DropGenie digital microfluidic (DMF) cartridges (left) use patterned electrodes and a modular top plate to manipulate nanoliter-scale droplets. Editing cargo (Cas9 nuclease and sgRNA) and human cells are combined in discrete droplets (top right) and electroporated within microchambers (center). Cross-sectional schematic (bottom) illustrates the DMF architecture, with cells and reagents confined between the coated top plate and PCB substrate. This platform enables 100× miniaturization compared to conventional systems, reducing input requirements to as few as 10,000 cells per edit.

DropGenie Workflow. Guides are deposited onto the DropGenie Chip using an ECHO acoustic dispenser (BCLS), and cells with payload are loaded into the cartridge with a Liquid Handler (Integra Assist+). The system runs with user-defined parameters, after which cells are plated for culture and recovery. Transfection efficiency is then assessed via flow cytometry, sequencing, or fluorescence microscopy. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Wambeke E et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.



Miniaturized DMF electroporation enables efficient TRAC knockout in primary human T cells. Representative flow cytometry gating strategy (top left) shows singlet, live, and CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cell populations used to quantify TCRα/β knockout efficiency. Example plots demonstrate loss of TCR expression following TRAC sgRNA editing compared to non-targeting control (NTC). Editing efficiency (top right) was robust in both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ subsets, reaching ~88–90 % KO across 40 replicates, while controls exhibited only background signal. Cell viability (bottom left) remained >90 % across all conditions. Summary statistics (bottom right) confirm high knockout efficiency with low variability (CD4⁺ mean 88.4 % ± 4.9 %; CD8⁺ mean 89.8 % ± 4.2 %) and strong reproducibility across donors. A total of 10,000 cells per edit were used, representing a 100× reduction in input compared to conventional electroporation systems.

Multiple HEK-293T cell lines stably expressing human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors were generated at BioAscent via cationic lipid-mediated transfection and Hygromycin B selection. Receptor expression levels were quantified in all clones by RT-qPCR, and three clones per receptor were progressed, based on a range of expression levels (Figure 1), for full pharmacological characterisation using intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation FLIPR (Figure 2) and xCELLigence label-free impedance (Figure 3) assays.



Figure 1. Quantification of 5-HT2A/5-HT2B receptor expression by RT-qPCR. 10 ng of cDNA was used for qPCR with PowerUpTM SYBR Green Master Mix. Transcript levels were normalised to GAPDH and expressed relative to the lowest expressing clone using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Mean triplicate expression data ± SEM is shown. (n=3/N=3).

Figure 4. 5-HT2 receptor agonists show expression-dependent potency and efficacy profiles at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. Agonist DRCs were normalised to DMSO (min control) and 10 μM 5-HT (max control) and plotted for 5-HT2A (A) and 5-HT2B (B) stable cell clones. Mean duplicate data from three independent runs (n=2/N=3) is shown ± SEM. Mean agonist potencies (pEC50) and mean Emax ± SEM are tabulated for each clone.

Figure 5. 5-HT2 agonists produce positive dose-dependent impedance responses. Normalised cell index traces (A, C) from 5-HT2A Clone #1 following stimulation with 5-HT (A) and Psilocin (C). Normalised cell index values were converted to ‘% Impedance Response' relative to the baseline and 10 μM 5-HT responses, and plotted as dose-response curves for 5-HT2A Clones #1 and #2 (B; 5-HT, D; Psilocin). Image Credit: Image courtesy of Sophie O'Neil et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.



Figure 6. The 5-HT2A inverse agonist, Volinanserin, produces a negative dose-dependent impedance response in 5-HT2A clones with high receptor reserves. Normalised cell index traces from 5-HT2A Clone #1 (A), Clone #2 (B) and Clone #3 (C) following pretreatment with Volinanserin. Baseline normalised cell index values for all three clones were plotted against Volinanserin concentration, to generate inverse agonist dose-response curves (D) at the peak negative impedance response.

We show that differences in receptor levels significantly alters the pharmacological profiles of 5-HT2A/2B ligands across different assay technologies. Failure to account for receptor density/reserves may lead to underestimation of partial agonism/inverse agonism and off-target toxicity in pre-clinical screens, especially for CNS-active compounds like psilocin/norpsilocin. These findings underscore the necessity to incorporate multiple physiologically-relevant models and assay approaches into pre-clinical drug safety/efficacy profiling, to ensure accurate predictions of clinical outcomes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a WHO-designated multidrug-resistant pathogen, causes severe hospital infections. With no vaccine against it, this study aims to design a multi-epitope vaccine to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics.

The researchers have screened the full proteome (5,563 proteins) to identify non-human homologous, stable, non-allergenic, adhesive, and immunogenic proteins. Furthermore, shortlisted proteins (Probable coat protein A of bacteriophage Pf1, alkaline phosphatase L, and a secreted protein) were evaluated for B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes.

Six multi-epitope constructs (DV1–DV6) with different adjuvants were designed, followed by structural validation and assessment through docking with TLR2/TLR4 and molecular dynamics simulation studies. Among them, DV5 (HBHA-conserved adjuvant) showed the strongest receptor interactions, high stability, and 98.47 % predicted global HLA coverage. Hence, our results conclude that DV5 is a promising multi-epitope vaccine candidate against P. aeruginosa, utilizing reverse vaccinology in combating MDR pathogens.

The maternal microbiome and immune system have both independent and synergistic effects on fetal brain health - changes in the mother's immune system have been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. A new study, published today in Nature Neuroscience, expands our understanding of this "gut-immune axis" by mapping the impact of stressors during pregnancy – namely changes in the microbiome and activation of the immune system - on the neuroimmune landscape of the developing fetal brain.

The research team, led by Brian Kalish, MD, Physician in Medicine in the Division of Newborn Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital, discovered notable sex-specific responses, including vulnerability for a specific immune pathway in the male brain that could be a potential target for early intervention.

Our study establishes a detailed spatial transcriptomic resource of immune gene networks during a critical window of embryonic brain development. Unlike previous atlases focused on the adult brain, our dataset captures dynamic immune signaling interactions at a stage when the brain is highly vulnerable."

Brian Kalish, MD, Physician in Medicine, Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital

The team integrated in situ spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) with single cell RNA-seq data. This dual-modality approach enabled them to (1) create a developmental cell atlas of immune gene expression in the embryonic mouse brain during mid- and late-gestation; (2) map the spatial location of neurodevelopmental-relevant genes in the developing brain; (3) reveal sex-specific responses of the developing brain to maternal gut-immune disruptions; (4) nominate a specific pathway – known as the CXCL12/CXCR7 signaling pathway - as an important mediator of abnormal neural differentiation.

"As a neonatologist, this work adds to our understanding early-life environmental factors that may impact neurodevelopmental potential and lends insights for potential interventions", added Kalish.

In patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who were in endoscopic remission, achieving intestinal ultrasound (IUS) transmural healing was associated with decreased risks for CD relapse, hospitalization, and perianal complications. Absence of transmural healing was associated with relapse.

Intestinal ultrasound transmural healing “could become a new target in CD patients, reflecting a broader shift from endoscopic remission toward objective measures of deeper remission,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Clara Yzet, PhD, Amiens University Hospital, Amiens, France. It was published online in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics.

The study was limited by the lack of centralized reading for endoscopies and IUS. Only patients with mucosal healing were included.

The study did not report any specific funding. Two authors reported receiving consultant and lecture fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

A research team from the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) has uncovered a key biological mechanism that explains how exercise maintain strong bones, paving the way for novel treatments for osteoporosis and bone loss in people who are unable to engage. By identifying a protein that acts as the body's 'exercise sensor', the research has opened the door to the development of drugs that mimic the effects of physical activity, offering hope for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, bedridden patients and those with chronic illnesses who face a high risk of fractures. The research findings were published in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy.

'Osteoporosis and age-related bone loss affect millions worldwide, often leaving elderly and bedridden patients vulnerable to fractures and loss of independence,' said Professor Xu Aimin, Director of the State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Chair Professor in the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed, who led the study. 'Current treatments rely heavily on physical activity, which many patients simply cannot perform. We need to understand how our bones get stronger when we move or exercise before we can find a way to replicate the benefits of exercise at the molecular level. This study is a critical step towards that goal.'

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 suffer a fracture due to weak bones. In Hong Kong, the problem is significant as the population ages, with 45% of women and 13% of men aged 65 and above affected by osteoporosis. Osteoporosis-related fractures cause significant pain and disability, severely impacting quality of life and independence, while placing a heavy healthcare and economic burden on the society.

Ageing involves the natural weakening of bones, which become less dense and more porous. Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow have the potential to develop into either fat cells or bone tissue. These stem cells are highly sensitive to external factors, like exercise and pressure. During the ageing process, they tend to differentiate into fat cells. As fat cells continue to accumulate in the bone marrow, it reduces the space available for healthy bone tissue, further compromising bone strength and creating a cycle of bone deterioration that is difficult to reverse with current treatments.

Using mouse models and human stem cells, the researchers identified a special 'switch', called Piezo1, which is a protein on the surface of mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow. This switch acts like an exercise sensor, detecting mechanical signals from physical activity that helps keep bones strong and preventing them from becoming frail as we age. In the mice model, when the Piezo1 protein was activated by physical activity, it reduced fat accumulation in the bone marrow and encouraged the formation of new bone. Conversely, when this protein is missing, it triggers signals that cause stem cells to accumulate fat, leading to increased bone loss. The absence of Piezo1 also promotes the release of certain pro-inflammatory signals (Ccl2 and lipocalin-2), making stem cells more likely to convert into fat cells, which hinders bone formation. Blocking these signals can help restore bone health.

'We have essentially decoded how the body converts movement into stronger bones,' said Professor Xu Aimin. 'We have identified the molecular exercise sensor, Piezo1, and the signalling pathways it controls. This gives us a clear target for intervention. By activating the Piezo1 pathway, we can mimic the benefits of exercise, effectively tricking the body into thinking it is exercising, even in the absence of movement.'

Dr. Wang Baile, Research Assistant Professor from the same department, who co-led the research, added, 'This discovery is especially meaningful for older individuals and patients who cannot exercise due to frailty, injury or chronic illness. Our findings open the door to developing "exercise mimetics" - drugs that chemically activate the Piezo1 pathway to help maintain bone mass and support independence.'

'This offers a promising strategy beyond traditional physical therapy,' remarked Professor Eric Honoré, Team Leader at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, French National Centre for Scientific Research, who co-led the research. 'In the future, we could potentially provide the biological benefits of exercise through targeted treatments, thereby slowing bone loss in vulnerable groups such as the bedridden patients or those with limited mobility, and substantially reducing their risk of fractures.'

The research team is now working to translate these findings into clinical applications, with the goal of developing new treatments to preserve bone health and improve the quality of life for an aging population and those confined to bed.

In a new study published in Liver Research, a team of researchers in China discovered that nicotinic acid-a common form of vitamin B3-can dramatically reduce liver damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a major complication in liver surgery and transplantation.

Hepatic IRI occurs when blood flow is temporarily cut off and then restored-common during liver resection or transplant-triggering oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. While antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have shown some benefit, effective clinical therapies remain limited."

Jia Yao, senior author

The team's findings demonstrate that nicotinic acid matches or even exceeds NAC's protective effects by targeting the root cause: damaged mitochondria. In experiments using both mice and primary hepatocytes, pretreatment with nicotinic acid markedly lowered markers of liver injury (ALT, AST, LDH), suppressed inflammation, and reduced cell death driven by ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death.

Notably, nicotinic acid markedly restored mitochondrial quality. "It did not just act as an antioxidant-it actively promoted mitophagy (the cleanup of broken mitochondria) and mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new ones)," says Yao. "This dual action stabilized the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, boosted ATP production, and rebalanced cellular redox status."

The authors noted that given its safety, low cost, and widespread availability, nicotinic acid could be rapidly translated into clinical use-potentially improving outcomes for patients undergoing liver surgery. Human trials are now being planned to confirm these benefits in real-world settings.

Every year, millions of infants and children undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the world. Sevoflurane is a commonly used pediatric anesthetic. Its exposure during brain development has been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and cause cognitive dysfunction in animal models. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Normal neurogenesis constitutes the neurobiological foundation for higher-order brain functions, such as learning and memory. Lipid metabolism is crucial for the regulation of neurogenesis.

"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) is a key molecule in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and PPARα serves as the principal regulatory factor of CPT1a. However, the potential alterations in FAO mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/CPT1a pathway in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) following sevoflurane exposure, and its potential role in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive dysfunction, remain unclear.

NSPCs, NE-4C cells, and postnatal day 7 rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 hours. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify whether sevoflurane exposure inhibits neurogenesis. The Morris water maze was employed to explore whether sevoflurane exposure impairs cognitive function. Untargeted lipidomics, FAOBlue staining, RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, CPT1a enzyme activity assay, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to validate the impact of sevoflurane exposure on FAO in NSPCs. Octanoate pretreatment, CPT1a overexpression, PPARα agonist palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and FAO substrate carnitine pretreatment were collectively employed to reveal the role of FAO and PPARα in NSPCs on sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment.

Sevoflurane exposure inhibited neurogenesis and impaired cognitive function. In NSPCs, sevoflurane exposure caused extensive changes in lipid metabolism intermediates, inhibited the mRNA expression of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), acyl-CoA oxidase 3 (ACOX3), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase beta subunit (HADHB), CPT1a, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short-chain (ACADS), and solute carrier family 22 member 5 (SLC22A5), suppressed FAO activity, and decreased the protein expression and activity of CPT1a. Enhancing FAO activity in NSPCs attenuated sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis impairment. Overexpression of CPT1a rescued sevoflurane-induced inhibition of FAO activity and neurogenesis in NE-4C cells. Besides, sevoflurane exposure reduced the expression levels of PPARα in the nuclei of NSPCs and hippocampal tissue. Pretreatment with PEA increased the nuclear content of PPARα and the expression of CPT1a in NSPCs and the rat hippocampus after sevoflurane exposure. Moreover, pretreatment with PEA or the CPT1a substrate carnitine rescued the sevoflurane-induced decrease of FAO activity in NSPCs, inhibition of neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and the cognitive impairment.

Previous work has not investigated whether or how FAO participates in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive decline. Our study showed that sevoflurane inhibited neurogenesis and impaired cognitive function likely by inhibiting FAO in NSPCs through the PPARα/CPT1a pathway.This study reveals a new potential mechanism of sevoflurane neurodevelopmental toxicity. Future research is needed to clarify the role of FAO in NSPCs in sevoflurane-induced neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment, and to explore the mechanisms that execute this FAO-dependent effect.

Public health researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health used computer modeling to reconstruct how the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the U.S. The findings highlight the rapid spread of pandemic respiratory pathogens and the challenges of early outbreak containment. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to comprehensively compare the spatial transmission of the last two respiratory pandemics in the U.S. at the metropolitan scale. 

In the U.S., the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic was responsible for 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has so far led to 1.2 million confirmed deaths.

The researchers set out understand the geographic spread of the two pandemics to inform strategies to prevent future pandemics. They applied detailed data on the dynamics of the two infectious diseases to a computer model to simulate their spread using known patterns of air travel and commuting, as well as potential superspreading events. They focused on over three hundred metropolitan areas in the U.S.

In the simulations, both pandemics were widely circulating in most of the metro areas within weeks, before government interventions or early case detection. While the specific transmission pathways across locations were different for the last two pandemics, the spatial expansion was driven by several shared transmission hubs such as the New York and Atlanta metropolitan areas. Their spread was largely driven by air travel rather than commuting, though random dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, which makes it hard to predict where the outbreaks will happen in real time.

The rapid and uncertain spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu and 2020 COVID-19 pandemics underscores the challenges for timely detection and control. Expanding wastewater surveillance coverage coupled with effective infection control could potentially slow the initial spread of future pandemics."

 Many studies have pointed to the benefits of wastewater surveillance programs. The new study further underscores the benefit of expanding wastewater surveillance for pandemic preparedness.

Beyond reconstructing the historical spread of the last two pandemics, the study also provides a generalizable framework to infer early epidemic dynamics that may be applied to other pathogens. While mobility, particularly air travel, is a key driver of pandemic spread, the researchers caution that other factors also play a role, including community demographics, school schedules, winter holidays, and weather conditions.

For more than a decade, Jeffrey Shaman and colleagues, including Sen Pei, have developed and refined methods to understand and simulate the spread of infectious diseases, including the flu, COVID-19, and others. Their real-time forecasts anticipate the rate and geographic spread of an outbreak, as well as the timing of its peak, to guide public health responses.

Oops, something went wrong

Mario Götze will go down in soccer history as the player who scored the winning goal that made Germany the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion. But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.

Companion M, Götze's personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. But the athlete also learned some lessons along the way about vetting opportunities. “I only agree to invest if the startup and its founders check all the boxes,” he told TechCrunch.

The boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25,000 and €50,000 ($29,000-$58,000). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn't one of those areas — at least not directly.

According to Götze, Companion M primarily focuses on B2B SaaS, software infrastructure, and cybersecurity, as well as health and biotech. While that's not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.

In 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn't touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.

With cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant.

Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don't have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote.

Götze isn't doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained.

There is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut's first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.”

This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.

Not coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based Arcee AI and Frankfurt-based Qualifyze. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo.

Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he's also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.

Götze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly discussing an extension. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told Bloomberg. But even then, don't expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.

“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: dwelling on what you missed won't help you score the next goal.

In the end, Ruben Amorim could not handle being told what to do by other people. Despite being the first man in Manchester United's history to be appointed under the title of 'head coach' rather than 'manager', he decided that he wanted the latter role. What he ultimately meant is that he wanted control, and he certainly did not want others meddling in his business.

Amorim should have seen this situation coming. Thomas Tuchel certainly did. According to the respected German television pundit Marcel Reif, Tuchel was excited about taking charge of United in the summer of 2024 until he learned that he would not have the final say on transfers. He had been in a similar position previously with Chelsea and Bayern Munich, and reportedly vowed, 'I won't do that to myself again'.

Amorim, though, felt that not only did he not have the final say on transfers, he did not have the final say on his tactics, and 'blew up' when director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to him about changing his system. Wilcox certainly had reasons for encouraging Amorim to adapt - even though he had been told time and time again by the Portuguese that he was not going to - as United were failing to earn positive results in too many winnable games.

Erik ten Hag's desire for control - he had a veto on transfers - also put him on a collision course with United's directors. The club's new regime of INEOS controlling the football operation is going to either put off elite candidates like Unai Emery and Oliver Glasner or eventually become unworkable a year or so down the line when whoever succeeds Amorim does not get their way.

As long as INEOS want to dictate how United is run, and especially if they want to do it on a tight budget, the only solution is to look to those who know the club inside-out and who care more about the Red Devils than their own careers. 

Former United defender Phil Jones recently told GOAL that"the United shirt is heavy to wear", and the dugout has also proven inhospitable to every coach who has stepped into it since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. David Moyes was shocked about how different managing United was to taking charge of Everton, while despite Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho past lives at Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, they too were taken aback by the magnitude of the job at Old Trafford.

Ten Hag, meanwhile, was one of the most coveted coaches when he stepped into the fold, while Amorim had been on the shortlists of Liverpool and Manchester City before United hired him. Both managers had excellent reputations and track records in their own countries, but they struggled to get to grips with the Premier League and above all the intense spotlight on them at United.

Ten Hag did not enjoy being the subject of Jamie Carragher's Sky Sports analysis on Monday Night Football, and while Amorim claimed to not pay attention to the media, his final comments before being sacked cited Gary Neville. Constantly being ripped apart by former United captain Neville, whom he previously said "is critical of everything", clearly rattled him.

The only people who understand how big this club is are those that have lived inside it for many years. It is why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick are the most compelling candidates for United right now. They do not need a crash course in how the club works, how every word you utter reverberates around the world and can be twisted to suit someone else's agenda.

They also know what makes United players tick, and that going to war with a member of the first-team squad is never a good idea. Solskjaer never publicly spoke out against the players during his three years in charge. Instead, he took a group that had been beaten down by Mourinho's negativity and led them on a run of 14 wins in his first 17 matches.

The Norwegian's three-year stint was full of ups and downs and there's no getting away from the fact that he oversaw some shocking results, such as losing 5-0 at home to Liverpool or 6-1 at home to Tottenham. And yet Solskjaer secured back-to-back top-four finishes in his two full seasons, the only United coach since Ferguson to do so. He also made the club a much happier place to be after Mourinho, and came agonisingly close to winning a trophy, too, as he took United to a Europa League final, where they lost to Villarreal after a marathon penalty shootout, and three domestic cup semi-finals.

Solskjaer knew that the carrot, rather than the stick, was more effective at United. The Norwegian would never have called his team "the worst in history", a damning claim made by Amorim which only served to further drain the squad's confidence, nor ridiculed individuals like Marcus Rashford or Alejandro Garnacho. He would also never have spoken out against the academy, the club's biggest source of pride, by calling out youngsters like Harry Amass or Chido Obi.

While Amorim seemed to have a great bond with his players at Sporting CP, it is difficult to want to perform for a coach who keeps on criticising you in public. 

Fletcher, the Under-18s coach who will take charge of the first team against Burnley on Wednesday, also makes a lot of sense right now. He has been around United in a variety of roles since October 2020 following a 13-year career as a Red Devils player, meaning he knows the squad perfectly, as well as the academy.

Solskjaer and Fletcher - or Carrick, who was the Norwegian's assistant and briefly became interim coach when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021 - are far more likely to get a response from the team or the crowd. Amorim often talked about the players and fans feeling anxious at Old Trafford, but it was difficult for supporters to get excited about the often predictable football they were playing. By contrast, the atmosphere at Old Trafford was at its best when Solskjaer was in charge as fans felt a real identity within the club.

But INEOS should not just look to United's soul to make fans happy. After all, fan welfare has hardly been a priority for a regime which has sent ticket prices rocketing, and thus they need to lift the mood to protect themselves. 

Ratcliffe's swingeing cuts and mass redundancies, coming after almost two decades of decay under the Glazer ownership, have badly reduced morale around the club. But a coach that understands what it means to represent United can really lift the mood.

There is also a financial motive for looking within. United have burned through £42 million in little more than a year on bad appointments. It cost £10.4m to sack Ten Hag and his staff in October 2024, while two months later United sacked director of football Dan Ashworth after only five months in the role, costing £4.1m. 

Hiring and firing Amorim, meanwhile, is set to cost almost £27m, as United paid out his contract at Sporting and now have to pay off the remaining 18 months of his deal at Old Trafford. United can ill-afford another expensive hire after their total debt climbed to a record £1.29 billion ($1.72bn).

Solskjaer and the other club legends who have moved into coaching are not in it for the money; they merely want to help the club. Their love for United also means they will be more willing to work with, not against, the likes of Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.

It might seem that re-hiring Solskjaer or taking a chance on Fletcher or Carrick is a return to the days of Ed Woodward and undermines all the work that Ratcliffe has done in reshaping the club's structure in a bid to align with the other top teams in Europe. But the INEOS chief and his colleagues at United have ended up building a structure which is only like to repel the very top coaches. They might want 'best in class', but are quite reluctant to pay for it. 

After two years of eating away at the club's soul, it is time to go back to its roots.

MLS

 Kevin R. Wexler / NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY Network / Imagn Images

With the same steely gaze he wore as he patrolled midfields during an illustrious career spanning nearly two decades, Michael Bradley sat eagerly and excitedly as he took questions as the New York Red Bulls' newest head coach.

Though Monday was Bradley's introductory press conference, he has long been at work preparing for this role. The former U.S. men's national team captain has been ever-present at the Red Bulls' training facility and, from afar, it's easy to forget he's planning training sessions and not preparing to take part in them.

In fact, when head of sport Julian de Guzman peered through the glass windows at RBNY's training facility to see someone running wind sprints on the practice field, he wondered which player it was — only to take a closer look and see it was his 38-year-old head coach.

“An individual like Michael doesn't come around very often,” de Guzman told the media on Monday.

De Guzman and the Red Bull hierarchy had no reservations over whether Bradley was ready for this job or not. Bradley took over as Red Bulls II head coach this summer, joining midseason and helping continue the development of young players. All he did was lead the team to the MLS Next Pro Cup title.

Bradley didn't hesitate to seize the opportunity, either.

“How in the world could you say no?” Bradley asked as he broke his seriousness with a smile.

“Like anything in life, you can ask yourself certain questions,” Bradley continued. “‘Is it the right time? Am I ready? What about this, what about that?' Well, certain things come and you have to go for it. This one took me about half a second to realize I'm going for this one.”

Bradley, who began his playing career with the franchise when it was still the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, retired as a player at the end of the 2023 season. In his final years with Toronto FC, Bradley sat in on many coaches' meetings under Greg Vanney. He has long known he wanted to go into coaching after he hung up his boots and many viewed him as an extension of the coaching staff on the field, even in his younger days, such was his pedigree, soccer intellect and leadership.

Upon retiring, his early days in coaching included an assistant stint for his dad, Bob Bradley, at Stabaek in Norway, and a brief guest stint under Jesse Marsch with the Canadian national team. Now, he has a team and a job to call his own.

“This guy is here to win,” de Guzman said. “Everybody feeds off of that. That creates culture. This is the person you want every day in the building. It makes you enjoy and love your job.”

Bradley's age won't be abnormal in this league, either. Minnesota United's Eric Ramsay (34), St. Louis City's Yoann Damet (35) and the Colorado Rapids' Matt Wells (37) are all younger. The tides of global soccer continue to evolve, and younger coaches at clubs big and small are getting first-team chances.

A fresh voice and perspective are welcomed in Harrison, N.J., where the club parted ways with manager Sandro Schwarz after failing to make the postseason last year for the first time since 2009. The tactics will get a refresh under Bradley, too.

Just as he implemented during his time with RBNY II, Bradley plans to change the team's typically narrow, pressing- and transition-based system to one that values possession a bit more and plays wider, particularly with the use of wingers.

The prototypical Red Bull global-style energy will still be there, but the club wants to evolve its game model.

“It's easy to sit up here and talk about it on January 5, but this is the fun part now,” Bradley said. “Taking the ideas we have in our heads and bring them to life.”

That undertaking won't happen overnight.

The roster is at a place of transition, though the Red Bulls are doing what they can to create flexibility. Key departures to headline the offseason include Carlos Coronel, Lewis Morgan, Peter Stroud, Sean Nealis, Kyle Duncan and Alexander Hack. So far, just two senior players have arrived — Cade Cowell and Justin Che.

More changes will come this month and next. It's a process, but the Red Bulls are fully stuck into this task, from de Guzman to Bradley and everyone inside the building.

“To be trusted as the person to lead this club going forward, it's a huge honor and something that I am going to commit my absolute life to,” Bradley said. “To make sure we are able to put a team on the field our fans are proud of, to represent our club, this community, in a way where everybody who comes into this stadium feels a part of.”

Morocco is currently hosting the Africa Cup of Nations 2025 (ending on January 18, currently in its round of 16). In 2030, they will co-host FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. And now sources say they could host FIFA Club World Cup 2029. "According to several reliable sources, Morocco is one of the most credible candidates", reports RMC Sport.

Nothing has been announced at the moment, but it would follow a pattern: 2025 edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, the first one under the new format, to be held every four years, took place in the United States one year before they co-host FIFA World Cup. If Morocco hosts Club World Cup in 2029, it would serve as a dress rehearsal before the World Cup 2030.

"Behind the scenes, various Moroccan sources are openly acknowledging this strong ambition for the Kingdom", reports the French outlet, adding that the Kingdom meets the criteria needs for the competition. If works continue as expected, the Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca will be open by then (expected in 2028), with a capacity of 115,000 spectators, making it the largest football stadium in the world.

It would also be a step up compared to the current Africa Cup of Nations, which is held in nine stadiums with 24 teams. The 2025 Club World Cup has hosted in 12 stadiums with 32 teams, and there were rumours that FIFA would increase the number of participant teams in the competition.

Do you think Morocco will host FIFA Club World Cup in 2029?

Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly pushing Al-Nassr to launch a stunning raid for Antonio Rudiger. The experienced German defender is seeing his contract at Santiago Bernabeu run down and will become a free agent in the summer of 2026 if no extension is agreed. It is claimed that CR7 wants to see the former Chelsea centre-half join him in the Saudi Pro League.

As Rudiger has less than six months left to run on his current deal, he is free to enter into negotiations with any suitors outside of Spain. According to Fichajes, Al-Nassr are ready to make a serious play for his signature.

It is claimed that “discussions for a possible renewal are not progressing” in Madrid and Rudiger is “starting to generate a noise that is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore”. The “most likely scenario” at this stage is considered to be a move elsewhere when the 2025-26 campaign comes to a close.

He is said to be attracting interest from “several ambitious projects”, with big-spending teams in the Middle East forming part of that pack. Real are reportedly willing to let him leave as they remain in a “defensive transition process”, with recruitment focus being narrowed on “medium to long-term” additions.

The Blancos have always been reluctant to tie aging stars - those over the age of 30 - down on lengthy deals. Rudiger will turn 33 in March. Real Madrid are “not willing to compromise future planning with long contracts or conditions outside their roadmap”.

With that in mind, “one of the destinations that has gained momentum in recent weeks is Al-Nassr”. They already have Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo on their books, alongside Joao Felix and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane.

They are looking to bolster their back line and see Rudiger as an ideal addition. Fichajes claims that “an economically powerful offer is being prepared” - one which any European-based clubs will find it “difficult to match”. A “high-level salary contract and a central role within the sporting project” is on offer in Riyadh.

Fichajes go on to state that sources close to the Saudi outfit have revealed that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo “has recommended Rudiger's signing”. Having previously lined up against the German, he believes that an “immediate quality boost” can be secured.

It is noted that Ronaldo “holds significant influence within Al-Nassr's sporting project, not just on the field but also in strategic decision-making”. Several transfer calls have already been made on his advice, with the 40-year-old frontman desperate to get more proven winners alongside him.

A formal proposal is said to have been readied, but Rudiger “has not made a final decision” yet. He remains focused on the present for now, with Real still in the hunt for prestigious domestic and continental titles.

He is, however, aware of interest from Saudi Arabia and considers the option of such a switch to be “real, ambitious, and economically very attractive”. The presence of Ronaldo at Al-Nassr will also be factored into the equation - as he has committed to a deal through to 2027.

An extended stay at the Bernabeu cannot be entirely ruled out for now, potentially on rolling 12-month terms, but other options are certainly being considered - by Rudiger and the Blancos.

Al-Nassr are ready to pounce, with club captain Ronaldo an obvious ace in their pack. They have faltered of late, in a Saudi Pro League title bid, but remain fiercely competitive on multiple fronts and would provide Rudiger with opportunities to enhance his already impressive CV.

Fichjaes claims that any move to the Middle East would be “another impactful move by Saudi football, adding a top-level defender to one of the most ambitious projects”.

Real Madrid legend Ronaldo - who remains the club's all-time leading goalscorer - is a man that has grown accustomed to getting his way down the years, and that suggests that Rudiger could complete a stunning switch once dropping into the free agent pool.

Bayern Munich wonderkid Lennart Karl caused a stir this weekend by admitting his ultimate career dream is to join Real Madrid, despite currently developing at the Allianz Arena. While such comments often irritate the Bavarian faithful, club legend Lothar Matthaus has surprisingly defended the 17-year-old, drawing parallels with Robert Lewandowski and Florian Wirtz while revealing his own failed move to the Bernabeu.

In modern football, pledging loyalty to your current employer is usually rule number one of the media training handbook, especially for a teenager looking to break into the first team of a European giant. However, Bayern Munich prospect Karl tore up the script this weekend with a candid admission that his long-term sights are set on the Spanish capital.

The 17-year-old, who has been tearing up youth leagues and drawing attention from across the continent, frankly stated: "FC Bayern is a very big club. It's a dream to play there. But at some point, I definitely want to go to Real Madrid. That's my dream club, but that stays between us. Of course, Bayern is something very special and it's a lot of fun."

Usually, such a declaration from a player who has yet to fully establish himself as a Bayern legend would draw the ire of pundits and supporters alike. Yet, in his latest column for Sky Sport, Bayern icon Matthaus offered a refreshing and surprisingly supportive take on the youngster's ambition.

Rather than chastising Karl for a lack of respect, Matthaus praised the teenager's mindset. The 1990 World Cup winner believes that articulating such high ambitions is a sign of necessary self-belief rather than petulance.

"Big words, big goals! The Real Madrid statements from Lennart Karl have caused a stir," Matthaus wrote. "I think it's good when someone has self-confidence even at 17. Setting goals has nothing to do with arrogance. I find it honest, but not presumptuous and not arrogant. Real Madrid simply has that myth. Bayern Munich is on a similar level, but often in life, you want to try something new."

Matthaus argues that the era of the 'one-club man' is largely over, citing Thomas Muller as a glorious anomaly rather than the standard. He believes that the modern player is driven by diverse experiences, highlighting Robert Lewandowski's move to Barcelona and Florian Wirtz's switch to Liverpool as evidence that seeking a "change of scenery" is a natural human desire.

"You can't say: 'I'll stay at Bayern Munich for the rest of my life' like a Thomas Muller - that is unique," Matthaus explained. "In the end, everyone has a goal. Robert Lewandowski also went to Barcelona and simply chose a change of air, a new experience. It's not always just about money, but also about a new challenge, to refresh oneself. Having a dream is normality. Florian Wirtz, for example, also sought the challenge in Liverpool to take the next step in his life and personally. He could have made himself comfortable in Leverkusen."

Crucially, Matthaus pointed out that Karl's dream is actually beneficial for Bayern Munich in the medium term. The logic is sound: for Real Madrid to ever be interested in signing Karl, he must first become a superstar in Munich.

"I think it's all in order," Matthaus continued. "It shows that Karl is ambitious and believes in himself. He knows that he has to perform outstandingly at Bayern Munich to even be on the list at Real Madrid. The 17-year-old hasn't said he wants to play for Real in the next two years. It is his dream. Dreams can come true, but you have to work for them and FC Bayern would also benefit from that. If Karl becomes so good that Real Madrid negotiates with him, he must first achieve extraordinary things at another club."

Perhaps the most compelling part of Matthaus' defence was a personal revelation regarding his own career. The German legend admitted that he, too, had agreed to join Los Blancos during his prime, only for the move to be blocked by his club.

"I, too, would have liked to play for the Royals," Matthaus revealed. "I became World Footballer of the Year in 1990-91 and suddenly Real Madrid was at the door. I would have liked to go, but I still had an existing contract. That's why the transfer didn't work out back then. Real and I, we were in agreement, however, Inter Milan didn't want to let me go for a high transfer fee."

He added: "I also had dreams: I always said that I want to play for a bigger club, want to become a national player and want to be at the World Cup. At some point, the dreams just get bigger. Four years ago he [Karl] probably would have said that he wants to play in the Bundesliga—probably at Bayern Munich."

Finally, Matthaus touched upon the tangible factors that make a move to Spain so attractive for elite players, noting that it often transcends pure sporting reasons. He highlighted "quality of life" and "better weather" as genuine factors, alongside the global visibility that La Liga giants command.

"Karl simply sees that something is possible," Matthaus concluded. "It's not just about the sporting side. It's perhaps also about a new, different and better quality of life, better weather, an even bigger club in the world. And frequently one has seen that the World Footballers do not come from the Bundesliga, but rather from a league that gets more attention worldwide."

The Swift-ematics are in.

To host Taylor Swift's “The Eras Tour” over six shows at the Rogers Centre in November 2024 cost the city more than $4 million, and generated less than $8 million in direct revenue, according to a city hall briefing note sent to councillors last month.

The internal note outlined the costs, benefits and lessons learned from the pop superstar's concerts that could be applied to the 2026 FIFA World Cup this summer.

Swift's concerts cost Toronto $4.2 million in total across city services and agencies.

Its biggest single item was for police — $1.9 million, as previously reported. An additional $680,000 was covered by the Rogers Centre to have paid duty officers inside the venue and The Ritz Carleton for stationing two officers at the hotel every day.

The second-largest cost was the increase in TTC service on buses, streetcars and subway lines. The transit agency spent an extra $1.7 million, but generated $588,000 in additional revenue during the concerts compared to the weeks prior, in keeping with its prediction of $1 million to $1.2 million.

The city's transportation division incurred additional costs of slightly more than $333,000 for traffic management costs, such as sign and camera installations, signal adjustments. It also includes the cost of traffic agents, paid duty officers and the traffic operations centre.

Staffing for the city's emergency management was just over $134,000.

The city's economic development and culture division kept to its $131,000 budget, including $25,000 for marketing. It also included $47,000 for the TO Poets Department, the city's free pre-concert poetry events to promote local artists, and $59,000 to hire a co-ordinator and purchase signs, outside radiators and other supplies to support a volunteers program that helped visitors get around the city.

Meanwhile, Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency in charge of GO trains and buses, incurred approximately $827,800 in “incremental service costs” for increased cleaning, marketing, additional bus and rail trips, standby operators and “enhanced staffing.”

Metrolinx generated approximately $1.2 million in additional revenue from increased ridership on GO Transit and the UPX, according to the note.

While there were approximately 240,000 concert goers, that number more than doubled when accounting for people accompanying them who didn't have tickets but still visited Toronto.

Of the $152 million in direct spending, $141 million came from international visitors, mainly from the U.S., while just $11 million was estimated to come from local Swifties. 

However, the federal and provincial governments collected the most from the tax revenues associated with that spending. Combined they received 80 per cent of the tax revenue generated, with Ottawa directly getting $10.6 million and Queen's Park getting $8.6 million.

The city directly collected $7.1 million — a large portion of which was from the Municipal Accommodation Tax, a local levy applied to the price of short-term accommodations, while the rest was from such city services such as transit fees or parking.

“This analysis underscores the challenges that cities face in fully capturing the financial benefits of hosting major events,” according to the internal note.

“While staging events are quite lucrative to the artists/hosting organizations and other orders of government, associated costs are primarily absorbed by the municipal government.”

The note doesn't outline the federal and provincial governments' expenses. The ministries involved did not respond to the Star in time for publication.

The note also confirmed that the large injection of Swift money was primarily focused on the downtown core, as experts previously told the Star.

The note said that The Eras Tour offered the city “an invaluable opportunity” for Toronto to refine and improve how it prepares for large-scale events — such as the FIFA World Cup.

Some of the main lessons include having “as much lead time as possible” when planning large-scale events and streamlining the number of city departments and agencies involved to “reduce redundancy and issues with staffing and reporting.”

The Eras Tour also underscored the need for a more “robust” emergency management strategies including “detailed contingency plans, efficient communication systems and comprehensive training exercises,” the note said.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly "under consideration" as Manchester United search for a caretaker or interim manager to take over from Ruben Amorim, just over four years after he himself was sacked by the Red Devils. Darren Fletcher will lead the team in the immediate short-term, but the club is expected to name someone else in charge for the coming months, before a final permanent appointment is ultimately made ahead of next season.

It ended on a sour note for Solskjaer last time round, sacked the day after a heavy defeat to Watford compounded what was already a poor start to the 2021-22 season. But the Norwegian still holds Manchester United very close to his heart, almost 30 years after first joining as a player in the summer of 1996, and Fabrizio Romano has reported via his YouTube channel that Solskjaer would be "more than open" to returning to Old Trafford once more as manager in a caretaker capacity.

The Athletic now claims that Solskjaer is “under consideration in what would be an emotional comeback”. Being drafted in as an interim is exactly how his first spell, which eventually lasted almost three years, came to happen when a previous United hierarchy sacked another Portuguese coach: Jose Mourinho.

Many United fans bemoaned the club's lack of tangible success during the Solskjaer era, which ran from December 2018 until November 2021. It's true that the former striker, who played 366 times for the Red Devils and had later spells in the first-team coaching staff and managing the reserves, was unable to win a trophy. However, he has proven more consistent than his two permanent successors.

In his two full seasons at the helm, Solskjaer oversaw third and second-place Premier League finishes, reached the semi-finals or better of five cup competitions, and brought the best out of Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial. His win percentage (54.2%) was marginally worse than Erik ten Hag (54.7%) – but over significantly more games – and is far better than Amorim achieved (38.1%). He also had a better such record than both David Moyes (52.9%) and Louis van Gaal (52.4%).

It may have fallen short of the impossible standards set by Sir Alex Fergsuon, but in this new way of looking at Manchester United, a club still finding its feet in the post-Fergie landscape, it certainly wasn't bad by any means. Of all those who have filled the hotseat since Ferguson retired almost 13 years ago, Solskjaer has also been the closest to harnessing what feels like the real 'United way'.

Speaking to BBC Sport as recently as November 2025, Solskjaer reflected on the difficulty that he faced as Manchester United manager, trying to build up a successful team at a time when Manchester City and Liverpool were both at their absolute peaks.

"It's not about getting the credit, but it was the worst time to be the manager of Manchester United. You have Jurgen Klopp with his Liverpool team and you have Pep Guardiola with his Manchester City team," he mused.

"Best managers in the world at the time and probably the two best teams in the world at the time. But we got second and third. So with the staff, we had something going but we couldn't take the next steps."

Solskjaer added that the pressure of being United boss was a "privilege", rather than something to be feared. "I felt privileged to be the manager of Manchester United, but of course it's not the same as playing. As a player, you just do your job. Suddenly now you're the manager, you're the face of everyone. You think about all these supporters, players, everything surrounding Manchester United.

"But that pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way. And that was having great staff around us, an environment in and around the club that was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work every day, training sessions... you need results and we unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Manchester United and they made a change, which is fine."

Darren Fletcher has been placed in charge for at least this week, but the plan for Manchester United appears to be finding someone who can lead the team for the next few months until the summer. Then, a permanent appointment can be made, allowing time to get the crucial decision right.

The Athletic reports that “Fletcher will get a chance to show his credentials”. Another ex-Red Devils midfielder, Michael Carrick, “has also been mentioned for a possible return” while former defender Jonny Evans “could also be appointed to the club's coaching staff, possibly in time to assist Fletcher at Burnley”.

Jason Wilcox, who held a fiery meeting with Amorim prior to the Portuguese's dismissal, and chief executive Omar Berrada will lead the hunt for a new boss. They are aware that “knowledge of United can be beneficial”, but are said to have current Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner - who will be out of contract at Selhurst Park in the summer - at the top of their wish list.

There's a nostalgic feel to Chelsea's sudden firing of a manager and the mad scramble to bring in a successor midway through a season. The difference on this occasion is they are not a team stacked with world-class players in pursuit of the Premier League title, rather a middling assembly of young starlets with little hope of immediate success.

When Roman Abramovich ran Chelsea, they were a force to be reckoned with. There wasn't a price they wouldn't pay to get what they wanted. The club still have wealthy owners, but even with the restrictions posed by the Premier League's PSR and UEFA's FFP, their ambitions are a little different.

Everything that comes out of Chelsea suggests they are building for the long term, not the here and now. Results only matter to a certain extent rather than dictating policy. It is about the development and progress of their assets which is key.

That's why BlueCo have decided to take the head coach of their second club, Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, and place him in charge of their favourite child. Liam Rosenior, the 41-year-old Englishman who was hired in 2024 to replace Patrick Vieira, will now have the chance to succeed Enzo Maresca at Stamford Bridge.

Most English football fans who remember Rosenior will know him as a defender who spent his playing career flitting between the Premier League and Championship, turning to punditry before taking up coaching in the second tier. But what is he going to bring to Chelsea as their new head coach?

When Rosenior was added to Sky Sports' rotating cast of pundits in 2018, he combined it with the assistant manager's job for Brighton's Under-23s (because what good is a Chelsea hire in 2026 without having some experience with the Seagulls on your CV, right?...). A year later, he was appointed as a 'specialist first-team coach' on Phillip Cocu's staff at Derby.

The Rams described Rosenior's strengths in detail during their statement announcing his arrival: "Rosenior's position on the first-team staff will, as well as working with players on the training ground with a particular emphasis on individual development of emerging young talent, see him play a prominent role in pre-match opposition analysis with the scouting and analysis departments. He will also be well-placed to provide advice and guidance from his own playing career, the vast majority of which was played in the Premier League and Championship, to help manage the extensive number and scheduling challenges presented across the campaign."

Cocu left Derby in 2020, and Rosenior then served as assistant to new boss Wayne Rooney, who hung up his boots to take his first steps into management. The two worked in tandem excellently, with Rooney laid back in his approach and Rosenior often prowling the edge of the technical area with tactical instructions.

"He's taken chances, and hopefully that pays off because I think Liam is as good a coach as I've ever worked with," Rooney said on the BBC's 'Wayne Rooney Show' on Monday. "His detail, how he approaches the day-to-day, he's as good as I've worked with.

"Liam was so important for me. He was incredible in his coaching ability. I was more of the manager and dealing with players and everything. So I learned a lot from him from that point of view and then I think he's done a great job as a whole."

Rosenior's first full-time role as a head coach came at Championship side Hull City, whom he led to a seventh-placed finish in 2023-24 and who were widely seen to have punched above their weight. In that time, he leant heavily on the use of young players, including current Chelsea striker Liam Delap, former Liverpool midfielders Tyler Morton and Fabio Carvalho, and defender Jacob Greaves, who was sold to Ipswich Town at the end of that season for an initial £15 million.

Since the summer of 2024, Rosenior has been head coach of Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Their squad this season is the youngest in France's top-flight, with its average age of 22.6 almost a whole year younger than the next team on that particular leaderboard (Auxerre at 23.5). Though this is part of BlueCo's wider sporting project, and seen in France as supporting Chelsea more than anything else, developing youngsters is clearly part of Rosenior's own philosophy too. The hope is he will bring a level of maturity to a dressing room which has a severe on-pitch disciplinary problem.

"Am I a manager or a coach? I'm both," Rosenior told ITV. "Coaching is educating, coaching is wanting to improve players on a technical and tactical level. Management is making sure that you have a strong culture, that your players have rules and regulations, and you manage them in the right way. In English, 'manage', if you split the two words, is 'man' and 'age'. You're aging men."

One of Chelsea fans' main criticisms of Maresca was his tactical inflexibility. They would usually set up in a 4-2-3-1, with at least one full-back inverted to create overloads in midfield. Bar the odd wrinkle here and there, his Blues were predictable and susceptible to dry performances against low blocks. They needed yards of space in front of them in order to make chances and score goals at will.

Rosenior, like Maresca, wants his teams to play from the back, irrespective of opponent and situation, with options almost always available across the pitch. He often speaks of 'bravery' on the ball and wants his players to be 'all in'. That could prove irksome to a Stamford Bridge crowd which prefers faster-pace football, even if that means less possession and having to sit in on occasion. There won't be much patience in these home games, particularly if Chelsea's defenders continue to make glaring errors on the ball.

For most of 2025-26, Rosenior, nicknamed 'Le Professeur', has lined Strasbourg up in a fluid 3-4-3 system, with pacy 6'5 striker Emmanuel Emegha, who will join Chelsea this summer, leading the line as captain when fit. They average the seventh-highest average possession in Ligue 1 with 52.9 percent, and are capable of breaking down teams both when dominant and playing in transition. Strasbourg are also known to play more orthodox four-at-the-back formations too, and it's no guarantee Rosenior will stick with only one system as the ill-fated Ruben Amorim did at Manchester United.

Despite Strasbourg's youth, Rosenior has matured many of their best players. Last season, Chelsea loanee Andrey Santos announced himself as one of Ligue 1's finest talents before returning to Maresca's first-team squad for this campaign. Even with the club acting as a feeder to Chelsea and fans protesting against this, Strasbourg's players and head coach have risen above the noise, securing a return to Europe for this season, where they beat Crystal Palace and finished first in the league phase of the Conference League.

One of Strasbourg's major scalps under Rosenior came back in October when they held European champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-3 draw at Parc des Princes. Remarkably, the visitors were great value for their 3-1 lead at one point.

For over an hour in the French capital, Strasbourg were the better team. They stuck to their principles and tried to outplay the hosts, looking to beat an aggressive press wherever possible and dictate the game in their own way. It nearly got them all three points, but they had to settle for one.

"I was impressed with Liam's work," PSG boss Luis Enrique said post-match of Rosenior. "I knew the match would be difficult. We started well showing superiority with and without the ball, but the end of first half was poor. We improved after the break and the final stages were very positive. My first impression is that Strasbourg is one of the best teams in Ligue 1, in the way they play."

As with any and every manager, Rosenior has his flaws and isn't perfect. Strasbourg's main criticisms this season have been losing steam late in games, while the squad was pretty drained by the time they reached France's winter break.

When Strasbourg's suffocating intensity is successful, it's fantastic to watch. But when opponents get to grips with it, they're vulnerable. There have been many times where their youthful enthusiasm has got the better of them, and immature heads have been allowed to drop. The go-to strategy doesn't usually change, with the French press questioning whether Rosenior has a 'plan B' during games as the tide turns against him.

Rosenior's Strasbourg tend to struggle on the roadwithout the backing of their passionate Stade de la Meinau home crowd. The flip-side to that is obviously his teams can make their own stadium a fortress, but at a club like Chelsea, that is expected as a given.

There will almost inevitably be a match featuring some humiliation in passing out from the back. There should equally be team goals which are a joy to watch. It's a risk-reward system that Rosenior lives and dies by. How he will fare in the pressure cooker of one of the world's biggest clubs remains to be seen.

Rosenior, born down the road in Wandsworth, becomes Chelsea's second-ever Black head coach, following in the footsteps of the great Ruud Gullit. At a time when so many Black coaches, let alone Black British coaches, are struggling to be considered for the game's elite jobs, it's a triumph that Rosenior has made it here.

Chelsea as a club have a long and complicated history with racism dating back decades. In more recent times, they have actively sought to make amends and clean up an image that once tarnished them. In 2023, they commissioned a documentary called 'Blue Is The Colour', diving into how fans from different backgrounds see the issue.

The modern history of Chelsea has been written by plenty of Black players. Xaymaca Awoyungbo, the brains behind the documentary, told The Athletic: "I've definitely felt welcome (at Chelsea). The experiences of the people in the documentary are real but, like one of the fans at the end of it says, we had players like (Didier) Drogba, (Michael) Essien, Mikel (John Obi) who showed a different image of Chelsea. I never felt like, 'Do I belong here?'. It was more the history that made me feel unsure. Personally, going to games was never a problem (in that sense)."

Paul Canoville was Chelsea's first-ever Black player during the 1980s, and though he received racist abuse at the time, he has dedicated a large chunk of his life to his namesake foundation and is seen as a key voice in the club's battle against discrimination. Canoville told the Daily Telegraph: "What really strikes me about Liam is he grew up and played not far from here (Chelsea), he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation, working with young people every day. There's a real alignment there, no?

"When kids see someone like Liam managing their club, someone who looks like them, who's from their ends, who comes from a family that fights for what's right... that's powerful, man. That's hope. That's showing them the path is there."

The Chelsea gig in the BlueCo era is looking an increasingly unstable one. Thomas Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 little over 12 months on from winning the Champions League. His sought-after successor, Graham Potter, didn't even last until the end of that season. Mauricio Pochettino at least got a whole year before the two parties mutually agreed to part ways. Maresca was admired and hired because of his mix of mentality and tactical nous, but it seems from the outside looking in that he got too big for his boots.

This is why the club are taking a chance on Rosenior. They are obviously aware of his work at Strasbourg, but this is a massive leap from one job to another. A more sensible operation would be looking at the same pool as Manchester United are right now.

If Rosenior succeeds, he will run the same risk as Maresca, expected to remain one part of a whole rather than allowing himself to grow and take more authority. If he fails, then the club and its sporting directors will have failed. This appointment is more of a risk than any that have come before under this ownership. They should be careful what they wish.

Donald Trump has issued fresh warnings to countries hours after capturing Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.

Trump approved and oversaw the airstrikes on Venezuela before American troops captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the presidential palace in Caracas.

The United States accused Maduro of criminal activities, including narco-terrorism charges.

Maduro entered a not guilty plea on Monday in front of US District Judge Alvin K Hellerstein.

Trump has meanwhile warned other countries of possible attacks, including those that are set to participate in the 2026 World Cup.

This year's World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, but it is the US that has been hogging all the headlines due to Trump's policies.

Trump has now warned Mexico, Colombia, Greenland, Iran and Cuba. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has been one of Trump's fiercest critics.

When asked if the US would consider a military operation, the 79-year-old responded,

On Mexico, Trump has always insisted that they are not doing enough to stop the drugs trade.

Trump also threatened to attack Iran if they kill peaceful protesters who are calling for the overthrow of Ayatollah Khamenei. 

The new threats come at a time when the World Cup is less than six months away. Colombia were drawn in Group K alongside Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and debutants Uzbekistan. A third country will join them after the play-offs.

Mexico are in Group A with South Africa and South Korea, while Iran are in Group G with Belgium, Germany and New Zealand.

The warnings come at a time when Trump has placed multiple countries on a ban list, including some of the qualified teams for the World Cup.

World Cup

Declan Rice is a byword for consistency with Arsenal and England Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images

As we enter a World Cup year, England manager Thomas Tuchel will have a clear idea of the squad he wants to take to North America. He may indeed know the core of his ideal starting XI to face Croatia on June 17 in Arlington, Texas.

Depending on injuries, captain Harry Kane is a certainty and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford will be No 1. Declan Rice's form for Arsenal this season has also made him one of the first names on the teamsheet.

Rice has been the epitome of consistency under Mikel Arteta and a driving force in Arsenal's Premier League title challenges. Tuchel will hope he can do likewise for England in their bid to win a first World Cup on foreign soil.

Rice built his reputation as a defensive midfielder at West Ham United. His form prompted a £100million move to Arsenal in 2023, yet recently he has been playing more of an attacking role for club and country.

In an era obsessed with systems and players being tagged in very specific roles, Rice has become a throwback to midfielders of old. A box-to-box, all-action midfielder who is effective in both penalty areas.

Historically, England have often possessed players who boast a knack of timing their runs to score goals. After Bryan Robson and David Platt in the 1980s and 1990s came Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes at the turn of the century. Successive managers were unable to solve the conundrum of how to accommodate the trio in the same side.

At Bournemouth on Saturday, Rice showed he could become that type of player for Tuchel's England.

His four goals this season take him to within one of Leandro Trossard and Viktor Gyokeres as Arsenal's top scorers this season, and his three assists put him only behind Trossard (four).

Rice is revelling in getting forward and he ranks fourth for Arsenal in total shots on goal (27) and shots on target (10).

He is also Arsenal's second-highest chance creator with 32, just behind Bukayo Saka's 37, and he has created the most big chances (nine) — golden opportunities to score that are expected to be taken — than any of his colleagues.

His tally of 142 line-breaking passes — a pass that is played between the line of defenders and pushes the team closer to the opposition goal — is also the highest, with Martin  Zubimendi (133) second.

His greater attacking output doesn't mean he has relinquished his defensive duties, either. His 33 tackles are the second highest behind Jurrien Timber (46) and his 18 interceptions are second only to Zubimendi's 24. Rice has also regained possession for his side in the middle third 50 times, and 96 times across the entire pitch, the highest of any Arsenal player.

Given the freedom, Rice is extremely effective in open play, but he has played a significant role for Arsenal from set pieces too.

One of Arsenal's many strengths in recent seasons is their effectiveness at set pieces. As one of the key takers of corners and free kicks, Rice's delivery has been vital to that.

Arsenal top the Premier League list for the most goals from set plays this season (17) — 14 when excluding penalties — the most in the Premier League. 

Rice has created 12 chances from set pieces, which is the seventh-highest in the league, but the most by an Arsenal player. 

“Declan Rice is unbelievable,” defender Gabriel told Amazon Prime after Arsenal's 4-0 Champions League victory against Atletico Madrid in October.

“I'm watching Arsenal and every time they get a corner, my head is in my hands,” former Liverpool defender and pundit Jamie Carragher said in October on the Sky Sports Premier League Podcast.

“I've never seen anything like this before in football. I think the whole football world feels every time they get a corner, they're going to score a goal.”

Rice has forged a promising partnership with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson for England, with the latter providing the holding platform that allows Rice to break forward.

Anderson has also created one more chance than Rice this season from his set-piece deliveries, giving Tuchel even more options. Set pieces could be a defining factor in the tournament this summer.

Rice has also been robust this season. He has made 27 appearances in the Premier League, Champions League and League Cup, starting 22 matches. He overcame a knee injury to face Bournemouth and showed no signs of the knock hindering his performance. He scored twice in a league game for the first time in his career.

With Arsenal still involved in four competitions and competition likely to be long and as gruelling as ever, the only concern for Tuchel will come after the season. Despite his all-action style, any fatigue could be overcome by the buoyancy of what promises to be a memorable campaign for the Premier League leaders.

And, like Arteta, Tuchel knows he can rely on Rice to drive others on and off the pitch.

Footy Headlines has leaked the home jersey of the US men's soccer national team for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and its design is classic and innovative.

The design presented by Nike is based on the national flag and on two previous jersey designs of the USMNT.

The jersey features a bold interpretation of the classic American stripes of the national flag. The pattern of the stripes flows across the jersey.

The predominant colors, clearly, are red and white, and they have some details in navy blue on the collar, sleeve cuffs, and the Nike swoosh.

The leaked photo shows the badge of the US women's soccer national team, but the cited portal assures that it is also the design that the USMNT will use at the 2026 World Cup.

According to the Footy Headlines report, this jersey is expected to be announced shortly, as they indicate it will be available for purchase early in 2026.

"The Nike USA 2026 World Cup home jersey will be available from early 2026," they wrote in the leak article.

The US Soccer 2026 Home Jersey will be available for purchase in multiple stores, both physical and online, with the most prominent being Nike and Fanatics.

While Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz battle Maria Sakkari and Stefanos Tsitsipas for a spot in the final four, the season heats up with Amanda Anisimova and Jessica Pegula making their highly anticipated debuts in Brisbane.

Two compelling United Cup quarterfinals play out Wednesday in Perth as the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz continues its opening stretch, with the United States taking on Greece, followed by unbeaten Switzerland facing Argentina.

Let's break it down:

Taylor Fritz saved a match point Monday against Spain and won a 3-hour, 14-minute match that ended in a tiebreak before Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison sealed the tie in mixed doubles.

Team USA captain Michael Russell was asked how he assessed the dramatic tie.

“The first three hours or the last eight?” he said jokingly. “Look, the team fought so hard like we do. That's why they've done so well here in the past, because everyone is playing for everyone.”

The United States has won two of the three United Cup titles, but the team faces a significant test Wednesday due to a format quirk. As Group A winner, Team USA was meant to play Perth's best runner-up -- Argentina -- but they already met in group play. So instead, the Americans face Greece, the Group E champion.

Play begins with Gauff taking on a resurgent Maria Sakkari. Their head-to-head is 5-5, but Gauff won both meetings last year in Indian Wells and Miami, each in straight sets.

Stefanos Tsitsipas leads Fritz 3-2 in their ATP Head2Head.

Gauff and Harrison clinched both U.S. wins in mixed doubles.

Sakkari and Tsitsipas -- both looking to reestablish themselves near their peak career rankings -- have guided Greece to the quarterfinals for the third time in four years.

“It's great that we know that we're at the same position right now,” Sakkari said. “We're trying to get back to where we were.”

Tsitsipas credited Sakkari for helping reignite his belief.

“Maria was the reason I really believed at first,” he said. “She played the breakthrough first. That reignited a new flame inside of me. … I can't help but be proud that we're both in this together.”

Sakkari is already off to a far brighter start than last season's 20-27 campaign, with strong wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu.

Start Time: 10 a.m. local / 9 p.m. ET

Women's singles: Coco Gauff vs. Maria Sakkari

Men's singles: Taylor Fritz vs. Stefanos Tsitsipas

Mixed doubles: Gauff / Christian Harrison vs. Sakkari / Tsitsipas

A year ago, Belinda Bencic was steadily working back from maternity leave. Today, she's leading Switzerland again.

“We're living in Belinda's world again,” Stan Wawrinka said after Switzerland's win over Italy. “She's showing us why we're here again.”

Bencic is 4–0 across singles and doubles, including the deciding mixed doubles win with Jakub Paul to send Switzerland into the quarterfinals. She opens against Solana Sierra in their first career meeting.

Wawrinka has also been outstanding, producing two long matches including a deciding-set tiebreak win over Arthur Rinderknech. He faces Sebastian Baez.

Argentina's dominant 3-0 win over Spain -- and their 4-2 overall match record -- pushed them through.

Start Time: Not before 5 p.m. local / 4 a.m. ET

Women's singles: Belinda Bencic vs. Solana Sierra

Men's singles: Stan Wawrinka vs. Sebastian Baez

Mixed doubles: Bencic / Wawrinka vs. Maria Lourdes Carle / Guido Andreozzi

Poland, last year's finalist, can clinch the Group F title and a quarterfinal berth against Australia.

Marta Kostyuk had an intentional offseason, taking an extended break to recharge and focusing on precision strength to increase power. Now the World No. 26 is ready to blow past her career-high No. 16 ranking and into the Top 10.

Marta Kostyuk had quite the eventful offseason.

She rested and recharged in the Maldives -- her "happy place" -- went on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje (a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina), returned to the Ukraine and ended up in Dubai before heading Down Under for the start of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season. (She also got a second dog, who proved to be more of a troublemaker than her first and required a substantial amount of training.)

The 23-year-old took advantage of her team's decision to take a longer break than usual after the season ended, in a year where she played a jam-packed schedule consisting of 22 tournaments (including Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers, and then the BJK Cup Finals five months later).

"It was a team decision," the World No. 26 said before heading to Brisbane for her first tournament of the year. "We were like, 'OK, we want some longevity, and we want me to be mentally healthy.'"

Once the extended break concluded and Kostyuk returned to the court and the weight room, she went full bore.

Working with her fitness coach, Jolanta Rusin, for a third straight preseason, the pair homed in on Kostyuk's precision strength, which is more about explosive movements than being able to lift a ton of weight. Rusin created a series of intense, intentional workouts that incorporated speed, endurance and strength, specifically eccentric and isometric exercises. It was challenging work, Kostyuk says, though she and Rusin have been working towards this evolution of her fitness and power over the last three years.

They couldn't have executed it as effectively when they first started their working relationship.

"I needed two years of work so my body can handle what we are doing right now," she says. "And it's not like everyone is going to see my strength or my power in the first week of the year. It's something that we have just started building up, and it's going to come in time."

With time and reps, Rusin and the rest of the team have gotten to understand Kostyuk's body more intricately, and they've used that valuable information to not only build up the Ukrainian's power, but also help her prevent injuries. (Despite a wrist injury that sidelined her from the Cincinnati Open last summer, she played a full schedule in 2025.)

A post shared by Marta Kostyuk • Марта Костюк (@martakostyuk)

Ahead of her first tournament of the year in Brisbane, Kostyuk says she feels the effects of her offseason training, and is not merely excited about what it could mean for her performance on court -- she's also amazed.

"It's amazing to see how things come together and you become this incredibly fast human being," she said. "Incredibly sharp and explosive. This process is incredible. And every time I go through it as an athlete, it's just so mesmerizing to me."

Beyond feeling physically fit and energized, Kostyuk also gets life from the Australian swing, a part of the year where she's enjoyed some breakthrough moments and tends to shine.

She's had more than a few wonderful memories in Australia: her girls' singles title in Melbourne, when she was 14 -- the first Grand Slam she ever played -- is one of them. More recently, in 2024, she had her best result at a major when she reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.

And as far as it is from home, at times it feels like home. That's due, in large part, to a Ukrainian family that Kostyuk met at the tournament some years ago. She sees them every year at the season's first Slam, and considers them her Australian family.

But before she sets her sights on another deep run in Melbourne, she has a couple of tune-ups at WTA 500 tournaments in Brisbane and Adelaide, where she made the quarterfinals in both 2023 in 2024.

She'll make her season debut in Brisbane against Yulia Putintseva, after receiving a first-round bye. It will be their first career meeting.

"I feel great," Kostyuk said. "I feel happy. I feel happy to be traveling again for the tournaments, and I start from my favorite place, Australia. I feel rested. I feel excited."

Despite a solid season in which Kostyuk reached the quarterfinals of three WTA 1000 tournaments and the fourth round of the US Open, she fell in the PIF WTA Rankings in 2025. She started the season ranked No. 18 and fell down to No. 36 in April, ultimately finishing at No. 26.

The year prior, a few months removed from reaching the semis of Indian Wells and the Stuttgart final, she hit a career-high No. 16.

As she begins her ninth season on the WTA Tour, she's aiming to get back there, and then blow past it and into the Top 10. It's the first time she's had a specific, concrete benchmark like that in mind.

"I want to finish the year in the Top 10," she says. "I've never set a goal like this before, a clear goal in my head. I still don't think it's the right thing to do, to focus on the rankings, because the most important thing is to develop yourself and your game. Then the rankings will just be a consequence of the work that you do. 

"But it's something that I keep in my head. It's still good to have something like this in your head, because it's a direction that you want to go. Because if you don't have a direction, you can get lost, you know?"

The ultimate goal, of course, is to win a Grand Slam. Though even that takes a backseat to being a quality human being and role model.

"At the end of the day, the most important thing is what kind of person you are," she says. "[It's more important] than what kind of player you are. This is what we, as a whole team, work on every day, too. I think at times it is an even more difficult job than being a tennis player."

Despite Czechia's Barbora Krejcikova's straight-set victory over Maya Joint, Australia's Alex de Minaur defeated Jakub Mensik, and carried that momentum into mixed doubles with Storm Hunter to win Group D. Czechia still advances as Sydney's top runner-up.

Host nation Australia advanced to the United Cup quarterfinals after a comeback 2-1 victory over Czechia on Tuesday.

After two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova defeated Maya Joint in straight sets to give Czechia the early lead, Australia faced an uphill climb to qualify on home soil.

Alex de Minaur responded in front of a lively Ken Rosewall Arena crowd, defeating Jakub Mensik 6-4, 6-1 to level the tie. He then teamed with Storm Hunter to clinch the result, beating Miriam Skoch and Dalibor Svrcina 6-2, 6-3 in mixed doubles to secure the 2-1 win and top Group D.

Despite the loss, Czechia also advanced to the quarterfinals as the best runner-up in Sydney, thanks in part to Krejcikova's singles victory.

Krejcikova, ranked No. 63 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, jumped out to a 4-1 lead against Australian No. 1, who had missed her country's opening tie of the competition due to illness. Although Joint narrowed the gap to 4-3, Krejcikova held firm to close out the opening set 6-4.

"Felt really good to be back out here today," Joint said to reporters. "I felt ready to play and ready to compete. Yeah, I mean, love the atmosphere. [I] was pretty disappointed I couldn't play the first match."

In the second set, Krejcikova -- who defeated Norway's Malene Helgo in straight sets in Czechia's first tie of the tournament -- again raced to an early lead, winning the first four games before sealing the 6-4, 6-1 win in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

"I'm very happy with my performance," Krejcikova said on court. "I'm happy with the way I played from beginning to end. I had great support as well. It was a little up and down in the first set, but I'm happy to come through. I was trying to be aggressive from the start, and it's nice to have some matches under my belt. I felt a little better on the court today."

In men's singles, de Minaur delivered a composed performance to defeat Mensik 6-4, 6-1 in 1 hour and 31 minutes and level the tie at 1-1.

"I didn't start the year the way I wanted to," said de Minaur, who fell to Casper Ruud in his first group match. "But something I've done really well in my career is bouncing back, so I'm happy I bounced back today."

Mensik produced moments of flair early in the second set, highlighted by an audacious front-facing tweener set up by a booming first serve. But de Minaur remained relentless, saving all four break points he faced and improving his record to 5-0 against the Czech in their head-to-head series.

Alex de Minaur once again carried the weight of the green and gold with distinction on Tuesday night at the United Cup in Sydney, where he pulled double duty to send Australia past Czechia into the quarter-finals.

After Barbora Krejcikova dispatched Maya Joint in straight sets, Australia faced an uphill battle to qualify on home soil. But the 26-year-old De Minaur fed off a lively Ken Rosewall Arena atmosphere to defeat Jakub Mensik 6-4, 6-1 before partnering Storm Hunter to overcome Miriam Skoch and Dalibor Svrcina 6-2, 6-3, sealing a 2-1 victory to top Group D.

With Krejcikova's triumph, Czechia also advanced to the quarter-finals as the best runner-up in Sydney.

“The atmosphere was unbelievable. Saturday night was incredible and tonight you delivered again,” Hunter said on court. “Demon brings energy, he's so clutch under pressure. So I felt really comfortable and confident with him by my side.”

Mensik produced moments of flair early in the second set against De Minaur, highlighted by an audacious front-facing tweener volley set up by a booming first serve. But the Australian remained relentless, saving all four break points he faced en route to improving his record to 5-0 against the Czech in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I didn't start the year the way I wanted to,” said De Minaur, who fell to Casper Ruud in his first group match. “But something I've done really well in my career is bouncing back, so I'm happy I bounced back today.”

In the women's singles, Krejcikova continued her strong start to the 2026 season with a comprehensive 6-4, 6-1 victory over Joint to give Czechia the early lead.

The 30-year-old, WTA No. 63 after missing the first five months of the 2025 season, jumped out to a 4-1 lead against Australian No. 1 Joint, who had missed her country's opening tie of the competition due to illness. Although Joint narrowed the gap to 4-3, Krejcikova held firm to close out the opening set 6-4 and ran away with the second.

“I'm very happy with my performance,” Krejcikova said. “I'm happy with the way I played from beginning to end. I had great support as well. It was a little up and down in the first set, but I'm happy to come through. I was trying to be aggressive from the start, and it's nice to have some matches under my belt.

Kovacevic was virtually untouchable when his first serve found the box, winning 25 of 26 points. He successfully converted a break in each set, both instances coming via an unforced error off the Australian's racquet.“Obviously a tough one to approach. You don't always know what you're going to get with Nick, whether he's healthy or he's not,” Kovacevic said during his on-court interview. “Tough to scout him recently, because he hasn't been on tour for a while playing serious matches. I just knew I had to be pretty locked in.“I do like playing in big stadiums like this.”Kovacevic comes in ranked a career-high No. 58 this week. For a quarterfinal berth, he gets the winner of a left-handed showdown between seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Ugo Humbert.

Since ending his 2022 season in Tokyo, tour appearances have been few and far between for Kyrgios due to persistent knee and wrist injuries. After entering just one tournament across the next two years, the former Wimbledon finalist managed to contest four events in 2025. He wrapped the year by defeating Aryna Sabalenka in "The Battle of the Sexes" exhibition.“I don't really know what my plan is this year. I don't know what my future, like, holds either,” Kyrgios said following his opening doubles win here. “I'm literally taking it day by day. Just to be a part of these events is special.”Elsewhere at the ATP 250 stop, three of the top five seeds were dealt losing 2026 debuts.

France's Arthur Rinderknech saved two match points to stun Flavio Cobolli and eliminate Italy from United Cup quarter-final contention Tuesday in Perth. 

The result ensures that Argentina will finish as the Perth group runner-up with the best record. Wednesday's quarter-finals will see defending champion United States play Greece in the morning and Argentina play Switzerland in the evening session. 








After saving two match points on serve at 5-6 in the second set, Rinderknech rallied from a break down in the third set to close out a courageous 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-5 win in three hours and 21 minutes. 

 “I don't know if it was seriously good, but it was seriously tough, that's for sure,” the top-ranked Frenchman said. “He's powerful and he made me play a lot of balls. I was able to find a way somehow like Stan found a way against me three days ago. Both matches [went deep] in the third, so I guess it's good preparation for the Australian Open."

Rinderknech survived 14 Cobolli forehand winners in the second set, when he came from within a point of going down a set and 1-5. He trailed 2-4 in the third before digging deep to win five of the last six games, finishing with 13 aces and saving seven of 11 break points faced.

“[Near the end] I relaxed a little more when my back was against the wall,” he said. “I couldn't do anything else but try to the last shot. I'll talk to my coach Lucas and I'm sure we can take something positive out of it.” 

Rinderknech finished 2025 as the No. 1 Frenchman and within the Top 30 for the first time in his career. He is now at a career-high mark of No. 27.

Although both Italy and France have been eliminated from quarter-final contention, play continues inside RAC Arena with Jasmine Paolini taking on Leolia Jeanjean, with mixed doubles to follow.

It was an unenviable task for Jasmine Paolini, stepping on court just moments after Italy was eliminated from quarter-final contention at the United Cup following Cobolli's loss to Rinderknech.

But she handled it with efficiency, defeating Leolia Jeanjean in businesslike fashion, 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 22 minutes.

While the scoreline suggests a routine win, Paolini had to navigate more than a few challenges to secure her first victory of 2026. Beyond the dejected mood on the Team Italy bench, the World No. 8 also had to withstand a blistering start on serve by Jeanjean.

Despite entering as the underdog, Jeanjean fired six aces in her first two service games to take a 2-1 lead. Paolini responded by reeling off five straight games to claim the opening set in 40 minutes. 

She did so behind the strength of her own serve, winning 80 per cent of her own first-serve points in the first set. She finished the match at an even more impressive 88 per cent. On the other side of the net, Paolini broke Jeanjean to open the second set - and despite needing six match points - never looked back.

Even with Italy eliminated before she took the court, Paolini maintained her trademark positivity postmatch.

“We couldn't get through the group, but we did our best,” Paolini said. “We fought until the last ball and there's still mixed doubles, so we're going to be there to cheer for them. Sometimes it's sport, but we have to keep going, [keep] fighting, because that's the right way to finish this competition.”

With both teams already eliminated and only bragging rights remaining, Italy's Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori defeated France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 7-6(6), 7-6(6) to clinch the tie.

Team Belgium earned a stunning 3-0 sweep of Team Canada Tuesday in Sydney at the United Cup to win Group B and claim a place in the quarter-finals.

After Zizou Bergs and Elise Mertens earned impressive singles victories to clinch the tie, the Belgians partnered to defeat Cleeve Harper and Victoria Mboko 6-3, 3-6, 10-5 in a critical mixed doubles match to top the group.

"We had to beat some big players today and a big tennis country," Bergs said. "We small Belgians, we are so proud of each other today what we did as a team, especially after a rough first encounter with China. So we are happy and the group is very happy."

The Belgians woke up this morning knew to win their group they needed to sweep Canada. That was a difficult task considering Canada swept China, which beat Belgium earlier in the event. That proved inconsequential inside Ken Rosewall Arena, where Bergs and Mertens found a way to keep their United Cup alive.

"I trust this team 100 per cent and I think we can do it and we actually did it," Mertens said. "Nothing is impossible, so very happy about the doubles we played. We really were a team, we were growing."

Bergs earned the biggest win of his career to start the day, upsetting World No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2.

“Really happy with the performance. I think this shows also our strength we have. We can fall down, but we will get back up and try to be better [than] we were the day before,” Bergs said. “This is what we do, and I'm also very thankful to have that team around me.”

Bergs claimed his second Top-10 victory (2-10) in one hour and 28 minutes, having also defeated then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev 10 months ago in Miami. A Belgian man had never previously earned a win at the United Cup. 

“I actually forgot this was my second Top-10 win, so that's really huge, actually, especially with a convincing way of playing,” Bergs said. “I just looked at it as a match. This is a a little different format, so we're still down. We still have to win a lot of matches today, so that was more the focus and today I just had to get the job done.”

Auger-Aliassime enjoyed the best season of his career in 2025, reaching the US Open semi-finals and competing in the Nitto ATP Finals. He looked sharp in his first match of the season against Zhang, but was unable to dominate the same way against Bergs, who saved all five break points he faced.

Watch Women's Singles Highlights:

Experience beat youth in the second match of the day when Mertens defeated Mboko 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Her two-hour, five-minute triumph put Belgium on the brink of the quarter-finals.

After coming from a set behind to defeat China's Zhu Lin in her opening match of the week, there was no similar escape for the 19-year-old Mboko against Mertens.

The Belgian rode a stellar serving performance to a one-set lead, holding at love in each of her first four service games and breaking Mboko decisively to love in the sixth game as well. Though Mboko showed the fighting spirit that earned her 15 three-set wins in 2025 on the way to being crowned the WTA Tour Newcomer of the Year to push the match the distance, she was unable to create any break point chances in the decider either. 

Mertens earned the decisive break of serve in the fourth game from a 30/0 deficit, and won a staggering 93 per cent of points played behind her first serve overall.

"I'm absolutely pumped ... I'm very happy with the point for Belgium," Mertens said. "Also well played to my opponent. She's up and coming, she's really young — she's more than 10 years younger than me!

"I'm most proud of how I [started] the beginning of the third set. I really wanted to get that point, and of course, I had the team behind me. I got a little bit of experience already, but of course you always feel a little bit nervous. That's the game, tennis, a lot of emotions, but I'm very pleased about [the win]."

Sixteen inches separate Reilly Opelka and Dane Sweeny, but Sweeny did not seem to mind Tuesday at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ.

After Opelka defeated the Australian 6-3, 7-5 at the ATP 250 event, the 5'7” Sweeny grabbed a chair to step on to embrace the American. They shared a viral moment at the net.

"I'm just trying to not be overly serious with my tennis,” Sweeny told ATPTour.com. “And I told the boys, my friends, that at the end of the match, I would do the Dudi Sela. Dudi Sela did it to Karlovic a while ago. So I thought that was pretty iconic and he's 16 inches taller and I thought it'd be pretty funny.”

Sweeny was referring to 2014 in Bogota, where Dudi Sela did the same thing after losing his sixth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Ivo Karlovic. That embrace remains a fans' favourite.

“I think it's emblematic of the mindset I'm trying to take into this year,” Sweeny said. “I'm just trying to have fun with it as a whole."

After a season without a tournament victory, Martinez will look to rediscover his winning touch in Bengaluru as he bids for his first title since lifting the trophy on home soil in Valencia in October 2024. Success in India would mark the eighth ATP Challenger title of his career. The world No. 92 takes on a qualifier in the first round.Second-seeded Frenchman Harold Mayot, third seed Jay Clarke of Great Britain and fourth seed Lloyd Harris from South Africa also find themselves in competitive sections in the draw.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Zhou Guanyu tells F1.com about his excitement at becoming a reserve driver for the new Cadillac F1 team, how he feels he benefitted from his time at Ferrari and his hopes for the future.

Zhou Guanyu is the latest familiar name to join the Cadillac Formula 1 team, with the Chinese racer having been announced as the squad's reserve driver for 2026, forming part of a wider line-up that features Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez on the race team and former IndyCar racer Colton Herta as a test driver.

While Zhou is no stranger to the reserve role – having acted in this position for Ferrari in 2025 – the year ahead will provide a wholly new challenge for the 26-year-old as he prepares to provide crucial support work to a brand-new team, in a season that will also feature new technical regulations.

‘New' might be a term that cropped up a lot there, but the project is one that also brings with it a lot of familiarity for Zhou, a factor that he admits was part of the appeal as he discusses his Cadillac move with F1.com.

“Firstly, I'm really excited for this new project,” the driver from Shanghai – who spent three years on the grid with the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber team between 2022 and 2024 – explains.

“The main thing is that with this new team, I know for example Graeme [Lowdon], Valtteri and also a lot of engineers that work in the team and, over the course of this year, I've seen how the team was setting up and I really felt the future is bright.

“They're not setting up a team just to be on the grid – they're setting up a team trying to compete. They have a mission target, to try to achieve over the years, and to bring Cadillac to a top midfield team and so on onwards, so that's what really attracted me.

“On the other side, I think the team [saw] what I was able to do over the course of last year and what my role was, and I think it can really benefit both sides.

"So to be the team's only reserve driver, I feel like this is the best opportunity for me in order to be back behind the wheel, and at the same time I think what I am capable of bringing [in terms of] information and, together with two very experienced drivers, it just brings the team forward.

“This year is a massive rule change, so all this knowledge, experience we've had over the years, this can be a help if you're comparing to a less experienced driver.”

Indeed, Zhou described the feeling of joining the team as being like “rejoining family” in the announcement of his signing, with Team Principal Lowdon having long acted as part of his management team while Bottas was the Chinese driver's team mate throughout his time on the grid. It is the involvement of such experienced names that added further to his interest in the project.

“We spoke a lot,” Zhou says of his relationship with Bottas. “We spent a lot of time [together], even when we were in different teams over the course of last year, so the three years I spent [in F1 were] really together with Valtteri.

“But at the same time I always worked together with Graeme, and that's really what brings me the high trust over this project. I haven't worked with Checo before – I know he's a great driver.

“But the three of us were always very honest people, and also we're very transparent with what's going on behind the scenes. So when you come into a massive chapter change over the rules, that's what you really need.

“You need a team that can drive forward all together, rather than just focusing on an individual side of the garage for the, let's say, single benefits and results. All that is really important.

“And as well, it's a new team, so it just puts extra energy on it because you start from scratch. For me, it's also a brand-new experience I've never been [in] before. I'm excited for what's coming ahead, and looking forward to going back in the Charlotte factory, spend some simulator time, and also at Silverstone with all the engineers.”

After losing his spot on the grid with Kick Sauber at the end of 2024, Zhou returned to Ferrari – where he had previously been a member of the Driver Academy – in the role of reserve driver, working alongside race drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

With the Scuderia providing Cadillac with their power unit and gearbox in 2026, Zhou believes that his experience of working with the Italian outfit will be beneficial, along with the fact that he previously raced with Ferrari engines during his time with Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber.

“Since this new era of Formula 1 introduced in 2022, I was only driving with Ferrari engines, which I got really used to, and also while I was testing development for Ferrari last season, I was also trying their 2026 engines, so all these things come into play together,” he explains.

“I have a very precise idea and a feeling with feedback on how the engine, power unit, gearbox, everything works, and also the hydraulic system. When you change from engine to engine, that's also one of the biggest things you need to adapt as a driver, because the way you downshift, the way you drive, the driving style, it's going to be changing.

“You need to adapt, which, for me, I will be already up to date. I'm looking forward to seeing what is the biggest difference this year, because it's going to be a big change. Even though we are a Ferrari power unit, I think every single manufacturer is going to develop over the years, so that's going to be very important.

“I think this year is not about who can start on top; it's all about, throughout the season, who can put the most efficient hours in terms of wind tunnel development and to have the most efficient benefits on the aerodynamics or improvements throughout the season.

“So that's what I'm looking forward to, and also I don't feel that I'm joining somewhere where everything I need to adapt to. I have the people I worked with, the engine the same and also, like I've mentioned, many staff and engineers I worked with over the course of the years. Everything just feels already like I'm familiar with everyone.”

Zhou also believes that joining Ferrari from Kick Sauber helped him to “learn a lot” and develop as a driver, explaining: “The decision made last year [to join Ferrari] was because I can learn so much from them.

“For me, in 2024 I was fighting at the bottom of the field, and then when you're arriving into a top field team, you can see what they're doing as a team differently compared to what has been in the past.

“It's not just how drivers react over the weekend, it's also the way you are setting up the team, the way the constructor works in the factory, and all the little details really matter. So that's what I really learned, and I see the massive difference since day one I joined them. Now I'm understanding what it takes to be getting a team up to speed of fighting at the top, for winning victories or [becoming a] top midfield team.

“That's very important, useful information, and I really enjoyed my time in 2025, that's for sure, because this is a year I learned so much from the team side, but also from the driver's side.”

On the flip side of this, Zhou acknowledges that making the switch from being a full-time F1 driver to a reserve was not always the easiest adjustment.

“It's challenging in terms of the mental side, just because you're watching all the people that are racing, and some of them you have battled with or you've beaten them throughout the years,” he concedes.

“You want to be there, and you feel like you deserve to be on the grid fighting with them together. So that's probably the hard side, on the mental side, and when you're just watching the race.

“Then on the other side, I don't feel it's such a bad position, because while I was able to take a step down from a race seat over the 2025 season, I really felt the stuff I wasn't on the top performance level of, the stuff I would do differently if I go back on the grid again in the future.

“When you're outside, you can just see a clearer picture of how you should develop, because you learn from both sides of the garage. Especially over the last year, I was able to be around two of the top drivers on the grid, to see what they're doing, and when they struggle or what they do well, what they've done differently, how they adapt, react.

“All these things I'm taking into consideration, and I feel like it made me a better driver already. I'm just looking forward for the season coming together, but then also hopefully my ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, back behind the wheel, racing full-time.”

That goal of a comeback evidently remains on Zhou's mind, but he admits that this is not a target that he is rushing ahead with as he focuses on his current journey with Cadillac.

“I think generally it's not something I will think about every single week or monthly,” he explains. “While you are at the beginning of the season, you are just focused on the commitment you have, and my current commitment is with the completely new journey with the Cadillac F1 team.

“For me, I think the ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, and that's the target. But in terms to achieve the target, sometimes you need a bit of a waiting game. You need to show the team what you can do over the course of the weeks, months, putting the effort in, and sometimes the opportunity appears, so I'm not fully rushing on that.

“Right now, I'm actually looking forward to the next few weeks, few months, before the season.

“Normally the period [for thinking about the future] is a couple of weeks before the summer shutdown. That's where you have to start talking about the future, so right now I'm just trying to take my [focus] into the team and then try to build on that.”

Lowdon has reiterated that Cadillac's target entering into their maiden campaign is to “execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors”, and Zhou echoes these sentiments amid a season that poses unknowns over the pecking order.

“I think when you have a new team, you can't say that when you get to F1 for the first race, you're going to be on top or you're going to be fighting for a top 10 easily,” the team's new reserve driver explains.

“It's about building on that. Many midfield teams started from scratch and they had to build on it, and it's all about getting the right people and putting the team in the right place, not rushing everything. I think on that side Graeme is doing a fantastic job.

“Who knows [what will happen] – it's a question mark at the end of the day, because everything is so different with the regulations for this season, so you have no expectation for any teams. But what I can say is that how this team is looking over the course of the last few weeks and months, it's definitely in the right direction in order to make the team a lot stronger and better.”

There is little time to spare before some of those questions perhaps start to be answered, with three pre-season tests soon to take place before the campaign kicks off with the Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.

The work begins now, then, for Zhou, as he gives an insight into what his first few weeks with the team will look like.

“There will be simulator [work] going on,” he smiles. “I'll be finally meeting up with all the staff members in the team after this announcement. I've been waiting for this for a long time now – I'm, let's say, released in terms of I can just go there, start putting the hard work in, starting all the season from now.

“I'll be very soon back in the factory, in the simulator, trying to give an idea how I feel and the comparison to all the recent and all the past experiences [I've had]. I'm looking forward to trying that and to meeting some new faces, some familiar faces, so everything will start very soon.”

Universal Music Group has signed the latest in a string of contentious deals between major labels and artificial intelligence companies, this time partnering with the chipmaking tech giant Nvidia. The deal opens Universal's enormous catalog to the world's most valuable company: Nvidia will use its AI infrastructure to develop new ways to make, discover, and engage with music, all while protecting artists and rightsholders, a press release claims.

At the heart of the partnership is Nvidia's large audio-language model Music Flamingo, designed to develop a “human-like understanding of songs” that accounts for “harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context,” Nvidia's research overview notes. The model's way of parsing “emotional narrative and cultural resonance” will enrich the experience of music discovery, the press release adds (though websites staffed by humans, with emotions and cultures of our own, can help with that too). The prospect of song generation is given less attention, but UMG and Nvidia promise to establish an “artist incubator” where real artists, songwriters, and producers will co-design and test AI-powered tools. According to the press release, the incubator will offer “a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs.”

Lucian Grainge, UMG's chair and CEO, said in a statement that Nvidia would protect and respect copyright and human creativity. Richard Kerris, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of media, reiterated Grainge's assertion and added, “We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe—conversational, contextual, and genuinely interactive.”

Lionsgate has confirmed a 2026 production start for ‘The Housemaid's Secret,' with Michele Morrone also returning and the 'Euphoria' star to exec produce. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Sydney Sweeney looks set to star in and executive produce The Housemaid's Secret, the sequel from Lionsgate for The Housemaid now in development and with the studio eyeing the Euphoria actress in a starring role.


	The next film in the franchise, based on the second novel in Freida McFadden's trilogy, will also be directed by Paul Feig. Sweeney has already signed on to exec produce the sequel, and while there's no deal yet signed for her to star, Lionsgate is understood to be looking for her to reprise her role as Millie.

	As for Amanda Seyfried, a co-star in The Housemaid, she too has an executive producer credit on the sequel. And her character doesn't appear in McFadden's second book, but the possibility of Seyfried appearing in the sequel is still a possibility, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

	The Hidden Pictures / Pretty Dangerous Pictures production of the sequel follows the box office success of The Housemaid, now in theaters and having earned $75 million domestically and $133 million worldwide with international territories continuing to roll out through January.


	Screenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine, who adapted The Housemaid, will return to adapt the sequel for producers Todd Lieberman, Feig, Laura Fischer, Carly Elter and Alex Young. McFadden will also serve as an executive producer. 

	











	“It's clear from both the global box office and from the outpouring on social media that audiences have responded strongly – and audibly – to the totally unique and truly theatrical experience of The Housemaid and want to know what happens next,” Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement.


	 “We believed in these stories from the very beginning, and we are beyond excited to bring the next chapter of Millie's story to life on-screen in collaboration with our outstanding creative partners Todd, Paul, Laura, Carly, Alex, and Sydney. The Housemaid's Secret is another wildly thrilling book in Freida's series that has captivated readers worldwide, and we look forward to translating it into a similarly rousing and riotous moviegoing experience,” he added.


	Feig added: “It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world fall in love with The Housemaid and the incredible work of our talented cast and crew. We're lucky that Freida McFadden has already extended Millie's journey on the page, and that we get to work with Rebecca Sonnenshine and Lionsgate to bring this next story to audiences.”


	The sequel will be overseen by Lionsgate's Chelsea Kujawa, who also oversaw the first film and brought the project into the studio, alongside Maria Ascanio. Robert Melnik negotiated the deals for Lionsgate.

Although Jaeda Lily Miller has been part of the Hallmark family since she was eight years old, the “When Calls the Heart” actress is growing up in front of fans' eyes and coming into her own — much like Allie, the character she's played on the series since 2019. Allie got lots of screen time during the season 13 premiere on January 4, 2026, from her reunion with friends in Hope Valley to her slowly developing romance with Oliver. 

Miller, who's now 19, has stretched herself as an actress over the last couple of years with emotionally raw scenes on the series and by taking on additional movie roles. Her Hallmark colleagues have definitely noticed; some of the series' biggest stars have commented in recent weeks about how proud and impressed they are with Miller's growth, excited to see what she does next. 

Ben Rosenbaum, who has played Mike Hickam on “When Calls The Heart” since 2014, got the chance to see Miller in a totally different light when she appeared in his 2025 holiday movie “The Christmas Cup.” Before the movie's premiere, he told EntertainmentNow how impressed he was with Miller, noting that they got to spend much more time together on that set than when they're filming “When Calls The Heart.”  

“Our characters can go a long time before getting to have scenes together on the show,” he said of Hickam and Allie. “So this was much more concentrated, and I got many days in a row of working with her, and that was super fun.” 

Rosenbaum said Miller was so good playing a different and more vivacious character, Starla, that she “stole some scenes” in the movie. He gushed, “She's so bubbly and fun and funny in this. She really takes a character that felt like it could have been a caricature, and made it feel totally real, like a real person in the world who's just a little bit extra dramatic, a little extra out there.”

While the season premiere of “When Calls The Heart” was airing on January 4, Rosenbaum sang her praises again when he tweeted, “I still can't believe the @jaedalilymiller who plays Allie in WCTH is the very same Jaeda who played Starla in The Christmas Cup. So different! Such a transformation!” 

Rosenbaum added a cute GIF to his tweet, with a clip of comedian Billy Eichner aggressively stating, “You are overflowing with talent and I admire you!” 

In “When Calls the Heart,” longtime Hallmark star Kevin McGarry plays Allie's uncle and adoptive dad, Hope Valley Mountie Nathan Grant. At the Hallmark Christmas Experience in December, Stephanie Long of the “Heart in Motion” podcast captured video of McGarry singing Miller's praises. She shared footage of Miller's early days on the show to reveal her physical growth, contrasted with McGarry praising her personal growth over the years. 

He told the audience, “When Jaeda came on to … our show, seven years ago or whatever? I have seen Jaeda, because I work so closely with her, not only grow up as an actor, but as a person, as well, and bring all these life experiences that she's had to work and play off (of), and I've just seen her become this incredible actress.” 

“You don't get that (while working) on a four-week movie,” McGarry continued, adding that Miller has “an incredible storyline” for season 13, “and I can't wait for all you guys to see it.”

Ironically, Miller's very first Hallmark role was in 2014's “A Cookie Cutter Christmas” starring Erin Krakow, who also plays Elizabeth, the main protagonist of “When Calls The Heart.” Elizabeth spent years as Allie's teacher on the series, and could become Allie's stepmom if Nathan ever gets up the courage to propose to Elizabeth. 

Krakow, who happens to be married to Rosenbaum in real life, was part of the same Hallmark Christmas Experience panel as McGarry, and the “Suspenders Unbuttoned” podcast posted video (above) of her comments about working with Miller. 

“She is just a phenomenal young actor and is such a joy to work with,” she says in the footage. “Her enthusiasm is through the roof.” 

Miller also took on a gritty role in the July 2025 Lifetime movie “Before Your Father Finds Us,” co-starring Hallmark alum Alexa PenaVega. Other Hallmark Christmas movies you might spot Miller in (but looking much younger) include 2017's “Christmas in Evergreen” and 2020's “Christmas in Evergreen: Bells Are Ringing,” as well as 2016's “A Heavenly Christmas” and 2015's “Love Under the Stars.”

Some things just go together: chocolate and peanut butter, sex and candy, death and chess. Fortunately (or not, depending on your expectations of a Marvel movie), only the latter is the focus of the latest Marvel teaser, which reunites Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto for some threats over the King's Game. 

“Death comes for us all. That's all I know for sure,” says McKellen in a voice-over as chess pieces move over a board telekinetically. “The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' The question is, ‘Who will you be when you close your eyes?'” Careful, fellas—you'll break the Seventh Seal. 



We've known at least since the infamous chair reveal that McKellen and Stewart would return for Avengers: Doomsday, but this is the first visual proof we've had that these two pre-MCU franchise stars are back in the blue void for the next film. James Marsden as Cyclops also gets a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at the end of the clip. He was also confirmed at the chair announcement last March. “I've spent 20 years listening to people say, ‘When are you coming back? When are you coming back? Are you coming back?'” the actor told Vanity Fair last August. “I'm dead. Well, maybe not. I'm going to have a tough time struggling to get into costume if they waited a couple more years… it's been a blast.” 

Avengers: Doomsday is slated for release on December 16, 2026.

The collaboration will allow fans and artists to go in-depth on the music they love and create an artist incubator to explore AI in human creation.


													By
												

	Dan Rys



	The Universal Music Group has inked a new partnership with AI chipmaking giant NVIDIA “to pioneer responsible AI for music discovery, creation and engagement,” the companies announced today (Jan. 6). The collaboration will involve research and development, the companies said, with an emphasis on “advancing human music creation and rightsholder compensation,” including the identification of copyrighted works in AI uses.


	Much of that collaboration will center on NVIDIA's Music Flamingo initiative, launched in November, which allows for in-depth analysis of music below the surface level, digging into elements such as harmony, musical structure, tempo, instrumentation, key, lyricism, musical theory, cultural and historical context and dynamics, among other metrics, including things like emotional resonance and chord progressions. Universal sees that as being additive to the musical discovery process for fans — allowing for deeper connections to different songs, albums or artists based on more than just genre, scene or surface-level signifiers. It also sees it as additive for artists — who can now use it for in-depth analyses of their own works — as well as for fans to more deeply engage in the music they already love, in addition to finding new music that resonates.


	“We're excited to establish this ground-breaking strategic relationship which unites the world's leading technology company with the world's leading music company in a shared mission to harness revolutionary AI technology to dramatically advance the interests of the creative community and the role of music in global culture,” Universal chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge said in a statement. “We eagerly embrace the opportunities that AI presents, and the fact that NVIDIA is choosing to take a leadership position in the tech industry in their commitment to responsible AI principles is critically important. We look forward to working closely with NVIDIA to direct AI's unprecedented transformational potential towards the service of artists and their fans as we work together to set new standards for innovation within the industry, while protecting and respecting copyright and human creativity.” 


	That last part — human creativity — will be addressed in a second part of the partnership, which will involve a dedicated artist incubator supported by both UMG and NVIDIA. Rather than promoting the hands-off generative AI music creation models that have emerged, the incubator will aim to bring together artists, songwriters and producers to see how they can better utilize NVIDIA's AI tools to help to enhance their own creative processes, instead of replacing humans with click-of-a-button creation. “By prioritizing hands-on artist involvement, the incubator develops solutions that enhance originality and authenticity — serving as a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop' outputs, and placing artists at the center of responsible AI innovation,” the companies said in a press release.


	That will also extend to creative labs in UMG's existing studios around the world, and UMG will utilize NVIDIA's AI capabilities within its corporate structure, too. The NVIDIA deal follows other AI agreements that UMG has cut with companies, including Splice, Udio, KLAY, BandLab and more.


	“We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual and genuinely interactive,” NVIDIA's vp/GM of media Richard Kerris said in a statement. “By extending NVIDIA's Music Flamingo with UMG's unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem, we're going to change how fans discover, understand and engage with music on a global scale. And we'll do it the right way: responsibly, with safeguards that protect artists' work, ensure attribution and respect copyright.”

Now in its third year, The Popcorn List (TPL), an annual survey of acclaimed feature films currently without wide release, is offering up 25 films recommended by film festival programmers from across the United States. Those titles include some of our favorite films of the year, like Annapurna Sriram's “Fucktoys,” Brittany Shyne's “Seeds,” and Ian Bell's “WTO/99.”

Founded in 2024 as a discovery and visibility project to amplify independent films that deserve a wider audience, TPL has quickly grown. To date, its lists have targeted 60 independent films, with TPL tracking each film's distribution journey along the way (two of the 19 films from the 2025 List and 10 of 20 films from the 2024 List are now widely available).

TPL exists as both an open, online database (check out its website right here) and as a Pop Up Series, bringing “fresh, hot films” to audiences around the country via sneak-peek screenings at art house cinemas and through a virtual format. 

This year, TPL reached out to 68 film festival programmers, 40 of whom responded with 35 film recommendations. Some stats: four films were recommended by more than one programmer, and 10 are included as Special Mentions (due to their distribution and release plans, or other mitigating factors). Of this year's official recommendations, 12 are narrative films and 13 are documentaries, 17 are feature directorial debuts, and 14 are directed by women. The films on the list premiered all over the festival circuit, from SXSW to Sundance, TIFF to Tribeca, Berlin to Venice. 

 










“As more filmmakers confront the flaws of the traditional system, TPL has likewise evolved its understanding of what ‘distribution' can mean. And that could look more like a choose-your-own-adventure model,” said TPL co-founder Lela Meadow-Conner in an official statement. “We've expanded our thinking around what ‘wide release' means to TPL: has the average viewer in any given U.S. city had access to your film at their local theater, on broadcast or VOD? If the answer is no, you're eligible for the List. We applaud filmmakers who are taking matters into their own hands, and recognize the value of their work.”

Also of note: TPL's Pop Up Series will also return in the summer of 2026. “The opportunity to work with eight film teams to bring their films to audiences across the U.S. was a natural extension of TPL's mission,” said Kathy Susca, of The Film Collaborative, TPL's partner in the series and its fiscal sponsor.) “We're taking our learnings and adapting the Series — aiming for more films, more art house theaters, and more audiences for these fantastic films. We're emphasizing building the TPL brand for general audiences as a marker of quality, independent films that they can't find anywhere else.”

	The X-Men are back in the latest look at Avengers: Doomsday.


	The minute-long teaser, just released by Marvel, features Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his old nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) reuniting over a game of chess.


	McKellen, in his inimitable voice, intones: “Death comes for us all. That's all I know for sure. The question isn't, ‘Are you prepared to die?' The question is, ‘Who will you be when you close your eyes?' “


	The trailer then cuts to Cyclops, played by James Marsden, tearing off his visor and unleashing the signature red beam from his eyes. 


	The trio of actors, who first appeared together in 2000's X-Men, were all confirmed as part of the Doomsday cast last year.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The X-Men-themed teaser is the third released by Marvel. The previous clips featured Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. The Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to showings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. 


Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie, premiering on December 18, 2026. Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.799 billion at the global box office.

Come for RDJ.  Stay for the brief cameos.   Story?   Don't worry about it, Marvel hasn't for nearly 10 years.

I'm ecstatic that movies continue to be shot in darkness so that we can imagine what's happening.  Love it!

Love it! Disney/MCU doing Cyclops right unlike Fox

If you pay attention to the background when Cyclops is tearing off his Visor you can see Sentinal robots walking about!!

Also, the mansion appears to be in disaray. I don't think Magneto did that. He appears to be ill and Prof. X is comforting him.

As long as we've known about him, we've heard that Robin Hood's thing is that he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. This sounds like a net positive. But The Death Of Robin Hood, the upcoming film from A24 which released its first trailer today, has a different take on the legend. “People speak of Robin Hood, tell his stories… they're all lies,” we hear early in the clip. Of course, it's Robin Hood (Hugh Jackman) himself telling us these things, so perhaps he has an ulterior motive. 

“Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last,” reads an official synopsis for the film. “In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.” From the looks of it, at least some of this salvation will come from Robin's relationship with a little girl whom he teaches to use a bow and arrow. This leaves him conflicted, given his new distaste for murder and pillaging, so he later promises to keep her safe. 



The Death Of Robin Hood comes from A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig director and screenwriter Michael Sarnoski. Jackman stars alongside Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe. The film is slated for a 2026 release, though there's no firm theatrical release date as of this writing.

Then again, after the way things went for the Kansas City Chiefs this year, the "Best Medicine" star might be rethinking his diss.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Josh Charles has no complaints about appearing alongside his former Dead Poets Society co-star Ethan Hawke as mad scientists in the video for Taylor Swift‘s 2024 single “Fortnight.” Hell, after the clip won the video of the year prize at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, Charles got a Moon Person for his role.

	“I got a Moon Man. It was pretty cool. The Video Music Awards, when I grew up, was the thing,” Charles, 54, told Jimmy Fallon on Monday night's (Jan. 5) Tonight Show. “The idea that that came just speaks to what an incredibly generous, awesome person Taylor Swift is.”

	Now, here's where things got a bit dicey.


	Fallon asked Best Medicine star Charles about rumors that he “got into a fight” with Swift's fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, on the set of the video, a tale Hawke first shared last year on the Rich Eisen Show. During that appearance, Hawke said that Baltimore Ravens superfan Charles would not leave Kelce alone about the Chiefs' heartbreaking 17-10 win over Baltimore in the 2024 AFC Championship game.


	Specifically, Charles was worked up about a specific call he thought went the wrong way, with Hawke counseling his fellow actor to “let it go,” even as he praised Kelce being “super polite” about the awkward interaction. 

	











	“A fight? No, he exaggerated this. It wasn't a fight,” Charles assured Fallon. “I've always liked Travis Kelce. I just thought he was so cool. But that year they beat us in the AFC Championship game — they beat the Ravens — he was a real jerk that year. So I kind of fell off of him.”


	Describing the mood on set of the clip that also featured co-vocalist Post Malone, Charles said when he met Kelce he was blunt about his assessment of the sure-fire future football hall of famer, telling him, “‘You know I always liked you and this year you were kind of a d–k.'” 


	Fallon couldn't believe it, shocked that Charles would confront the three-time Super Bowl champ, and legendarily good guy baller, saying, “You said that to Travis Kelce? He's one of the most lovable people I know!” 


	Charles was unbowed, saying, “I did. I said, ‘What was up with that?' And he laughed. He was like, ‘You know what, you're right. I'm gonna tell you why.” The actor then said Kelce admitted that the Chiefs were “most worried about that game” that year and they were determined to come out on top. “He's like, ‘I knew I had to come in with some swagger,' and he did,” Charles said of Kelce. “He got one of our veterans to commit a personal foul. He got in our heads, and it worked for them, and they won the game.”


	In the end, Charles admitted that Kelce was “actually great. We talked all different kinds of football… Such a good dude. I really like him a lot.” And even though Charles now really likes Kelce the man, when it comes to the gridiron, the star said his feelings still run purple, black, gold and red. “I'll root against him,” Charles doubled-down of the football star who may have played his final game on Sunday, which the Chiefs lost in a 14-12 heartbreaker against the three-win Las Vegas Raiders.

	











	And while Charles' beloved Ravens won't be making a Super Bowl run this year, he can take solace that Kelce will also be watching from home as the Chiefs will miss the playoffs for the first time in a decade this year after a dismal 6-11 season.

Michael Sarnoski is just two films into his directing career, but everything he has touched so far has turned to gold. 

After bursting onto the scene with the truffle-hunting tragedy “Pig,” which boasted one of the best performances of Nicolas Cage's recent career, he turned a tricky I.P. assignment into a box office phenomenon with “A Quiet Place: Day One.” But his upcoming film “The Death of Robin Hood” seems like his most ambitious project yet.

The film stars Hugh Jackman as an elderly version of the famed thief who steals from the rich and gives to the poor in British folklore. Written and directed by Sarnoski, the film promises to offer a much darker take on the Robin Hood stories that explores the end of the character's life. With a supporting cast that also includes Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe, it is already one of the most anticipated films of 2026.

An official synopsis for “The Death of Robin Hood” reads: “Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last. In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.”

After “The Death of Robin Hood” comes out, Sarnoski will turn his attention to a packed development slate that includes an adaptation of Hideo Kojima's acclaimed video game “Death Stranding” for A24. In a 2024 interview with IndieWire, the filmmaker also expressed openness to returning to the world of “A Quiet Place” while making it clear that he wants to balance original projects with his work on existing franchises. 

“I'm definitely going to do something original next, [but] one of the great things about the ‘Quiet Place' universe is that you have this sort of fundamental creature, and beyond that, you can explore any human story you want to in that world,” Sarnoski said. “I would definitely be open to that if I found that kind of in again, but you can tell a thousand different stories in this world because it's just about the characters. But I'm going to do something a little different next.” A24 will release “The Death of Robin Hood” in theaters in 2026. Watch the trailer below.

It's a very good time for people who love love — and want to see it on their screens. Hot off the massive success of the Rachel Reid adaptation “Heated Rivalry,” beloved romance author Emily Henry is gearing up for her very first film adaptation to arrive. And are people going to love it? Oh, we think so.

While Henry's first five romance novels are all in various states of adaptation, it's Brett Haley's spin on her second romance novel, “People We Meet on Vacation,” that is first out of the gate. The film version arrives on Netflix this week, with “Lady Jane” breakout Emily Bader and “Plainclothes” star Tom Blyth starring as our star-crossed lovebirds, Poppy and Alex. The film was written by Yulin Kuang, Amos Vernon, and Nunzio Randazzo. (Kuang is also on board to write and direct an adaptation of Henry's “Beach Read.”)

As fans of Henry's work know, her blend of swoony love and spicy romance built around compelling characters has rocketed her to the top of the bestseller lists, and fans are eager to see how that might translate to film success. “People We Meet on Vacation” has sold more than 2 million copies and spent 69 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list, but it's just one of Henry's hits. 

 










This one follows unlikely best friends Poppy and Alex, who first met-sorta-cute in college (shades of “When Harry Met Sally”) and bond intensely during their first road trip together. While the pair couldn't be more mismatched (Poppy is a travel junkie who worries she's a bit too much, Alex is a reserved dude who doesn't want to stray too far from their own hometown), their annual summer vacations together provide both of them with something they can't get elsewhere.

You might see where this is going, but Haley's take on Henry's story ably uses the novel's nonlinear storyline to guide us through every step of Poppy and Alex's ever-changing relationship, including the trip that went so off the rails that they didn't speak for two years and the big! important! sexy! wedding trip that forces them to reunite (and confront some long-held feelings).

Ahead, executive producer Henry talks to IndieWire about the “Heated Rivalry” effect, why romance fans are so voracious (and so deserving of more stories and adaptations), what she personally had to have in Haley's film, why Netflix was the best fit for this one, and what it's like to get to work on adapting her own work with the upcoming “Funny Story” feature. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.
 










IndieWire: I want to start with asking you the question that I've been asking everyone in my life for the last month: Have you been watching “Heated Rivalry”?

Emily Henry: I haven't yet. I haven't yet. I'm seeing all the memes. I'm learning that I should. I'm looking forward to it. Is it all fully aired now?

Are you a binge-watcher by nature?

That's my preference, definitely, because I just don't have a good memory. I can do the weekly, but what I'm really struggling with is the two-part drops.

The two-part drops are really rough.

I haven't watched the new “Stranger Things” yet because I know by the time the second half comes out, I will not [remember what happened], because it happened to me last time. And “Bridgerton” did it. I'm struggling with those. My memory is not good enough. It's probably social media breaking my brain. But also, I hate being spoiled. I kind of hold out until I feel like I can't ignore what's happening around me anymore, and then I usually give in.

Oh, I love spoilers.

Do you really?

“Gravity” was spoiled for me two days before I was going to see it. Someone was like, “Man, can you believe it when she lands back on Earth?” And I was like, “What?”

Wow. My gosh. Let me tell you this: I have not seen “Gravity” because I did not assume that that happened, and now I feel like I can see “Gravity.” Maybe I like spoilers too! [Laughs] I have such a deep, deep, healthy, normal, natural fear of space.

 










I would not go.

This whole story sounds like a dream that I had, but I was at a dinner where they had an astronaut do a toast, and he gave this beautiful, poetic toast. I thought an astronaut was sort of a person who just didn't feel connected. It really kind of rocked my world to realize this man with this poetic soul and this love for humankind was also an astronaut because I've always just felt like, who is going to space? And why?

Well, they often say when they get up there, they look back down—

—and it changes them. Maybe he wasn't poetic and wonderful until he saw the Earth from a great distance. I don't know.

Well, we're happy for him, and we're not going to go!

I'm very happy for him, and I'm not going. I'll die on Earth. Thank you.

Even though you have not yet seen “Heated Rivalry,” you know that people are talking about it. As someone who is a creator and a consumer of romance, when you're seeing things like this breaking through, what excites you about that?

It's really exciting because it's a queer love story. Even with a hetero love story like “People We Meet on Vacation,” there has still been this hesitancy to believe that this can work on a big level, and I don't really know why. For something like “Heated Rivalry” to be something that is a cultural moment that everybody's talking about, everybody is watching, [it] is so significant and is going to open so many doors for other stories that have not been allowed to get made and have not had the funding.

 










I really hope that “People We Meet on Vacation” will do that as well. I hope that people will see that this is a kind of story that people are hungry for. For a long time, not always, but for a long time, romance has not been viewed as meaningful, significant, valuable art unless it is tragic. I love a good tragic love story, to be clear. 

I went to school for creative writing. I was obviously not reading romance in my classes, of course, which is fine. I wasn't really reading about women at all, frankly. The story of art and its acceptance is just, here is what's acceptable and interesting and valuable, and then it's just pushing that wider and wider and wider and wider until everyone and all stories are included and valued.

You know better than anyone what a big, hungry, excited audience there is for these stories.

Voracious. We will read and watch all of it.

I hope that men will feel like they're getting permission to like this kind of story, too. In my real life, I feel like almost everyone that I know really craves romantic love. Not everyone, but most people that I know really crave romantic love the same way that we really crave familial love, and we really crave platonic friend love. We really crave self-love. All of those things are very natural, human things.

 










It's strange to me, because I think you can make a movie about friendship, and it's not going to be put in the same little cordoned-off area as far as who thinks that that isn't silly and embarrassing and escapist. Audiences take stories about male friendship, I would say, more seriously than they take almost any other relationship, which I think is really interesting.

But so many of us crave romantic love. It's so human to long for that. And for a lot of us, it's one of our highest priorities is to have that one person who is with you through everything who you, hopefully in the best-case scenario, get old with. It's not a mystery that people would want this.

It's not some weird, niche thing.

It makes complete sense. It's not a shock.

Pretty much everything that you've written is in some state of being adapted for the screen, but this is the first adaptation that has arrived. What was that timeline?

“Beach Read” was optioned before its release for a deal that didn't end up going through. They extended the option a couple times and tried to get it together, and they were looking at it as a series, and it didn't end up coming to fruition. And then this one was optioned, and then that “Beach Read” option lapsed, and someone else got it. This was the first one with real movement on it.

 










Once Brett signed on, he really wanted this to be the first one. He was like, “I want to be the one to crack this and be the first Emily Henry movie.” For me, if any of them get made, that's great, but I think his passion and determination is part of the reason why we are sitting here on this call right now. He really wanted to get it made, and he wanted to get it made efficiently, quickly, well.

When you get the call that the movie is happening, what was the first thing that you're like, “They've got to do this. This part needs to be included. This specific thing, this scene, this moment”?

I definitely told him from the beginning the balcony scene was the most important moment. I really wanted him to find a way to get the condom scene with her mom in, and he did. It was not actually essential at all. I was like, “I understand that if we need to cut fat, this does not advance the story. However, I really want it in.” And luckily, that made the cut.

It gets in with Molly Shannon, who, of course, is naturally the funniest person on the planet.

If we didn't have that scene, then I don't think we would've even bothered sending [the script] to Molly Shannon. We had to have something good for her to do. And same with Alan Ruck. That scene that they conceived of, I love between him and Alex. I did really want the pregnancy scare in. I remember that. That felt important to me.

 










The big thing really was character. I never wanted it to be oversimplified to the point of she's just “afraid of commitment.” That was kind of my big fear, which would've been fine, but for some reason, that just felt like such an oversimplification. What makes it interesting is why they're afraid of commitment, and that's what makes it feel real. That's what readers connect with, too, is the thing that you're actually afraid of. Because fear of commitment, you're just like, what? Are you afraid you're going to be bored?

I really wanted to get all of the stuff about Poppy being afraid of being too much, because I think the thing that really most of the readers who are diehard fans of each of my books are connecting with is the female lead. I usually go pretty deeply into their psyches. I felt like anyone who's watching this who's already a diehard fan of the book, it's probably because they connect with Poppy, and that probably means that they feel like they're too much or too loud, too weird, too annoying, all of those things. I think it's really important to show someone on that journey, realizing that they're discounting themselves in a way, and their fear is keeping them from deep, intimate love.

Do you picture people when you're writing?

No, it would be really hard if I had just locked onto one actor and then had to adjust that in my mind and accept it. I really can barely picture any of them. I remember having a conversation with Jasmine Guillory, and I was saying, “I don't really picture anybody, but I do know exactly what everybody's kitchens look like.” And she was like, “Me, too.” I've talked to a lot of authors since then who have said, “I know the exact layout of my characters' kitchens.” We know where the fridge is! But it doesn't matter to me what they look like. 

 










It's something that I'm really fascinated by, when somebody can really pull off a love-at-first-sight premise in a book because, as an audience member, it's so hard to glom onto that and experience it. I don't imagine someone being described and it really working or doing anything to me. But the description of attraction, the description of touch, and the way that someone's looking at you, all of those things are interesting and exciting to me and call to mind specific moments. You just want to believe that these two characters are crazy about each other. I don't really need them to look like anything in particular.

What was the first time you actually saw Tom and Emily in character?

The first time I actually saw them was their chemistry read. Brett had met them both separately and loved them both separately. I thought it was promising because, once or twice a year, I usually go into a bookstore and sign stock all day, and I get to spend a lot of time with the booksellers, and they're mostly women in their 20s, and they're lovely and wonderful. And I knew that they all loved Tom Blyth, so when Brett mentioned Tom Blyth, I was like, “I actually am not super-familiar. However, I know that my readership loves him, so that's good.”

With Emily, she had just been in another adaptation, “My Lady Jane,” and my editor had actually emailed me and said, “I know who should be Poppy. It should be Emily Bader.” I trust my editor more than most other people in the world.

 










Then, Brett did this chemistry read between the two of them over Zoom, and he knew instantly, this is who they should be, and this is who I want. He basically called me and was like, “We have our Alex and Poppy.” I was still scared, because ultimately, I don't have any control. It's not my movie. He was like, “I'm going to send you the chemistry read, and I hope you agree.”

I was so nervous to watch it. Of course, it's not ideal circumstances, you're seeing two people in horribly lit rooms on opposite sides of the world, Zooming. But they were so good. They were so good. So quickly, I was so ecstatic. And it was the day that they met, by the way. And then getting to see them act together on set. I did two different set visits, which was really fun. I got to see a little bit of everything. I just couldn't be happier.

I saw you during the wedding scene. What other days were you on set?

I was there the day that they shot the opening and closing scenes. I was there for all the wedding. I was there for most of the wedding stuff. Then I came down to New Orleans for a couple weeks later, and I was there when they shot the dance scene.

Honestly, it's such a blur. When I would go to these set visits, Brett would also just show me a bunch of the dailies from the stuff I had missed. I kind of feel like I got to watch the whole thing get made, even though I was only there a handful of days.

 










It was amazing. It's a weird experience, because you both feel like you're kind of a spare part. I didn't need to be there. I was there for my own fun. And it was really humbling both in that it was, wow, I can't believe this is happening, and this is looking so great, and everybody's so talented.

It was a wild, wild experience. But I will say that none of it really sunk in until getting to sit down and watch with an audience. That was way more surreal. That was just one of the most magical moments of my life was just getting to watch with some of the readers. I feel like I'm going to be thinking about that on my deathbed. It was so special.

I assume that they all loved it.

They at least performed loving it very well. It was a warm room. They were pretty thrilled because Tom and Emily had also stopped by. Everybody was pretty excited.

But, the same way that I was like, “Nobody's going to be a harsher critic than I am,” I feel like the readers are going to be a harder audience than people who are just seeing a movie that don't have any preconceived notions. There was a lot of laughing. They cheered at multiple points in the movie. There were just gasps and shouting. And it was so fun.

 










Why do you think a streamer, Netflix in particular, was the right spot for this?

Well, honestly, Netflix was who wanted it. If somebody had wanted to make it theatrically, that would've been really exciting. But Netflix, they are champions of the romance genre, they have been early adopters of the romance genre, and they understand that that audience wants these stories.

When you have a movie you love on Netflix, you just watch it over and over and over again. And I thought about “To All the Boys I've Loved Before.” I have rewatched it so many times. If people want to restart it the second it's over, they'll be able to. If they want to have watch parties with their book club and their friends, they'll be able to.

What made them the right partner is that they wanted to be partners. I think that readers have this idea that everybody just lines up, actors, studios, everything, and I just point. That would be nice if that's how the world worked. It's not. You have to find someone who's genuinely excited about what you're doing, and that's who you're going to partner with. You don't want to make a movie with someone who does not want to be making the kind of movie that you want to make.

You are adapting “Funny Story” yourself. The way I wrote the question is, “You are adapting ‘Funny Story.' How is that going?”
 










[Laughs] It's going well. I have really liked adapting, because you're taking so much that you can pull from, doing this little Jenga thing. Everything's moving. I have notes on that script that I'm going to be diving back into. We're very close on getting things coming together. I never know what I'm allowed to say, so that's what I can say.

At least from the outside, you are prolific in a way that feels sustainable. You generally have one book a year, and that's easy to rely on as a reader, but what is useful for you in terms of scheduling and creating things?

I think earlier in my career, it did feel extremely sustainable. I'm very happy to get to talk about this movie with you today, but having interviews, that takes time. Needing to travel to do press, that takes time. And it isn't always as sustainable as it was back when nobody really cared what I was saying, and I could just write in my living room all day long.

I think that it has been kind of an adjustment and a growing pain of mine to figure out how to make all of these other pieces of the job all fit together. But ideally, it is I'm waking up, I'm having coffee, I'm playing my New York Times word games, and then I'm just sitting down to write, and I'm writing until either all day or until I have my first phone call of the day. And typically, I do have one or two phone calls a day now just for other various things.

 










In my perfect world, I am just writing all day every day, but that's, luckily, I guess, not what my world is. But I'm very excited that when I finish [promotion of the movie], I can start on “Heated Rivalry.” I am really excited.

“People We Meet on Vacation” starts streaming on Netflix on Friday, January 9.

She gets it.

Céline Dion knows exactly what the kids are up to. At least now she does. The beloved international pop star finally joined TikTok this week and she did it in the most Celine way possible.

	In a 17-second video posted on Monday (Jan. 5), Dion officially launched her TikTok era with a fun clip in which she reintroduced herself. “My name is Céline,” Dion, 57, said while wearing a black hoodie from the French fashion house that happens to share her first name before rhetorically asking how old she is. “I've got kids,” said Dion, perched in front of a glowing skyline and adopting a cool kid pose as she channeled her 14-year-old twin sons pleading with her, “‘We have to get you on TikTok!'”

	Miming confusion, Dion, said, “On TikTok?,” with a sampled voice behind her yelping “WHAT?!”


	“I've heard of that before. Suddenly I'm becoming cool,” she added as a Seinfeld-like bass thump bubbled up behind her and digital sunglasses were superimposed on her face. “Céline Dion is cool. That's amazing,” she announced with the perfect amount of winky incredulity. “TikTok here I come!” Ciao.”


	Dion let the caption do the heavy lifting. “They told me, ‘Celine, it's time…' I asked, ‘Time for what?' Turns out…something completely new,” she wrote. “My team then said they'd handle everything, handed me back my phone, and then quietly disappeared. So here I am, learning how this TikTok world works…one video at a time! Thank you for being here, I'm glad we're here together.”

	











	So far, Dion's TikTok adventure includes just the one introductory video, though her feed is populated with earlier videos from her other social feeds. 


	As last year ended, Dion was in a silly mood, dressing up as the Grinch to do the a monologue from the 2000 Jim Carrey-starring How the Grinch Stole Christmas and crooning her legendary cover of Eric Carmen's ballad “All By Myself.” Then, on New Year's Eve, Dion shared a heartfelt message to her fans, telling them, “As we welcome this new year, I want to take a moment to send you all my love.

Béla Tarr, the patient Hungarian filmmaker who captured often pitiless worlds in slow-cinema epics like the seismic, seven-hour-and-30-minute black-and-white “Sátántangó,” has died. He was 70 years old. According to Deadline, Tarr's death was shared by Hungary's national news agency MTI via Hungarian filmmaker Bence Fliegauf, with the European Film Academy sharing in an email that he died after “a long and serious illness.”

Tarr had not directed a feature film since 2011's acclaimed “The Turin Horse,” a bleak and apocalyptic drama about the unraveling of a farming family, after which he relocated from Hungary to Sarajevo to start the international film school film.factory. Tarr had a reputation for mentoring younger generations of filmmakers throughout his career, from “Twilight” director György Fehér, who died in 2002, to “Lamb” director Valdimar Jóhannsson. Tarr shut down the school in 2016 but remained an academic in his post-filmmaking life; visiting teachers up until that time included the likes of Apichatpong Weerasethakul (whose own style owes a great deal to Tarr's), Carlos Reygadas, and Gus van Sant. His prior academic career had included launching the short-lived Társulás Filmstúdió in the 1980s.

Tarr's accolades included a Palme d'Or nomination at Cannes for 2007's “The Man from London,” a crime drama starring Tilda Swinton and again in Tarr's career-long black-and-white, languid style; a 2023 honorary European Film Award; and the 2011 Berlin Silver Bear prize for “The Turin Horse.” The crowning jewel of Tarr's nine features, and the most internationally renowned and discovered and rediscovered by every generation of cinephile, is “Sátántangó.” It follows the denizens of a small Hungarian village grappling with the consequences of communism's collapse; the László Krasznahorkai adaptation retains Tarr's pessimistic, nihilistic style, directing everything from farm animals to drunk actors within Tarkovsky-like long takes and statically shot dance sequences.

 










“I'm just a big fucking maniac who believes in people,” Tarr told IndieWire on the eve of the 4K restoration of the film. Looking back on the film, he said, “I was just an ugly, poor filmmaker. I still am. I don't have power. I don't have anything — just a fucking camera.”

His other films include 2000's “Werckmeister Harmonies,” which returned to theaters in 2023 with a 4K restoration from Janus Films; “Damnation”; “Almanac of Fall”; and his breakout debut “Family Nest,” from 1979.

The European Film Academy's statement upon news of Tarr's death, per Variety, said the community “mourns an outstanding director and a personality with a strong political voice, who is not only deeply respected by his colleagues but also celebrated by audiences worldwide. The grieving family asks for the understanding of the press and the public and that they not be sought for a statement during these difficult days.”

Hallmark Channel's tight-knit creative community is grieving the death of longtime script supervisor Holly Atchison, who monitored the filming of every scene in dozens of Hallmark movies since 2014. 

Several of the network's most prolific movie directors have posted tributes to Atchison, including her dear friend Gail Harvey, who shared via Facebook on January 5, 2026, that she'd been “crying off and on now for four days” over Atchison's passing. 

Harvey, who worked with Atchison on seven movies, including “Christmas on Cherry Lane” and “Happy Holidays From Cherry Lane,” wrote that Atchison had been hospitalized over the holidays for an undisclosed illness, noting, “I was hoping to fly to Vancouver when I got home to see her one time but she was gone so quickly. It was a shock. Please hug everyone you love.”

Longtime Hallmark director Ron Oliver, famous for destination movies like “The Groomsmen” trilogy and “The Wedding Veil” films, shared via Instagram on January 4 that he was “deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my darling Holly Atchison.” 

Oliver wrote, “As a script supervisor on half a dozen of my movies filmed in Vancouver, Canada, Holly was an integral part of my directing team, responsible for everything from timing to logic to story elements, and she did it with charm and skill and the kind of creative integrity we seem to be losing in our industry.”

“But beyond that,” Oliver continued, “she was a delightful woman, brimming with kindness and compassion, literally a beam of sunlight everywhere she went. We shared a love for our pups and a good martini, and without her in my life it is safe to say that what I refer to as my ‘career' wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as much fun. RIP Holly. Hug your pup for me.”

Another longtime Hallmark director, David Winning, also shared his heartbreak via Facebook on January 4, writing that he and Atchison had worked on 12 movies and two series together, including Hallmark's “The Nine Kittens of Christmas” and “Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead.” 

Sharing multiple photos of them on set over the years, Winning wrote, “My Rock xo So sad to hear this news. The BEST | my ORIGINAL SCRIPT SUPERVISOR. From the top of Frosty Mountains at Manning, to boxes full of Christmas KITTENS to OUTER SPACE | By my side for SO MANY years. RIP my friend Holly Atchison”

Winning's tribute received over 100 comments from people in the industry stunned to learn of Atchison's death, including La Vonne Girard, a longtime Hallmark movie set decorator who wrote, “Oh my goodness. Just heard this tragic news. Holly, Bob and I worked on sooooo many projects together. We are absolutely devastated hearing this news. Such a loss. RIP Holly.”

As a script supervisor, Atchison was responsible for ensuring continuity from scene to scene, closely monitoring the dialogue and set from filming through editing. Her first script supervisor jobs in the 90s, according to IMDb, included working on hit feature films like “Ace Venture: When Nature Calls” and four episodes of “Stargate SG-1.”

Her first Hallmark movie was 2014's “Garage Sale Mystery: All That Glitters” starring Lori Loughlin, and she was soon on sets year-round for Hallmark projects, including many Hallmark mysteries. In addition to working behind the scenes on all eight episodes of Hallmark's 2024 series “Holidazed” and a 2019 episode of “When Calls The Heart,” Atchison worked on over 30 Hallmark movies.

As the suspect remains behind bars, his siblings — brother Jake, 34, and sister Romy, 28 — are leaning on each other at their family's beach house in California.

Page Six recently obtained photographs of the duo walking along the shore collecting rocks.

Romy reportedly was the one to find Rob and Michele's bodies after they were stabbed to death in their Brentwood home.

As for Nick, he was caught on camera wandering around Los Angeles prior to his arrest — and left behind a bloodstained hotel room.

Nick, who long struggled with drug addiction, was reportedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and had his meds changed weeks before the gruesome murders.

His behavior subsequently became “alarming,” TMZ reported, claiming Nick was “out of his head.”

He did, notably, make a scene at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party with his parents the night before their bodies were discovered.

A pal said at Rob and Michele's memorial service last month that the “petrified” late director admitted at the bash that he was “afraid of [his] son” and thought Nick could “hurt” him.

In the wake of Rob and Michele's “horrific” and “devastating” deaths, Romy and Jake released a heartbreaking statement.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they wrote, in part. “They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

The actor posted a video message to his nearly 500,000 Instagram followers.

	The saga of Mickey Rourke‘s latest round of financial woes has taken another bizarre turn as the actor has released a video denouncing a GoFundMe set up in his name by his longtime manager, allegedly with his permission.


	The fundraiser, launched early Sunday morning, is nearing its $100,000 goal — money meant to help Rourke remain in his home after being served an eviction notice for falling $60,000 behind in rent.




	Seated with his beloved rescue dog Lucky on his lap, a distraught Rourke, in a fuchsia V-neck T-shirt and straw cowboy hat, addresses his nearly 500,000 Instagram followers.

					Mickey Rourke Approves GoFundMe to Prevent Eviction (Exclusive)		
			









	“Something's come up that I'm really frustrated, confused and I don't understand,” Rourke, 73, says. “Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money. A charity. 


	“And that's not me. If I needed money I wouldn't ask for no charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger,” he continues. “Whoever did this, I don't know why they did it. I wouldn't know what a GoFundMe is in a million years.”


	As reported exclusively by The Hollywood Reporter, the account was created by Liya-Joelle Jones, assistant to Kimberly Hines, Rourke's manager for a decade. Hines and Jones both told THR that the GoFundMe was created “with Mickey's permission.” 


	Hines now tells THR that Rourke may not have been completely clear on the details of how a GoFundMe works and is now embarrassed that the effort has become worldwide news.


	Rourke, however, is denying any knowledge of who created the fundraiser and insists he would never turn to fans for financial help, an act of desperation he calls “humiliating,”

	











	Rourke candidly admits he was terrible at maintaining finances throughout his career, with online estimates putting his net worth at its peak at $5 million. 


	“I did a terrible job managing my career. I wasn't very diplomatic. I had to go to 20 years of therapy to get over that. But I'm not that person anymore. … I'm not that wild man I was 20 years ago,” he concedes.


	Rourke goes on to pledge that he will reach out to his longtime lawyer, Bill Sobel, and return any money donated to the GoFundMe by fans.


	“I would never ask strangers or fans for a nickel,” Rourke says. “It's not my style. You ask anybody who knows me. It's humiliating and fucking embarrassing… I want you to get your money back. All things will pass.


	“There's only one person I can think of that would do such a thing. I hope it's not the person I'm thinking about,” he says.


	Speaking to THR from Europe, Hines details the events that led to the GoFundMe launch and offers more background on Rourke's current living situation.

Mickey Rourke confirmed he is not involved with the GoFundMe campaign that was launched under the premise of helping the actor to stay in his home. 


	In late December, The Wrestler actor was sued by his landlord, who alleged that Rourke owed nearly $60,000 in rent on the three-bedroom Spanish bungalow just south of West Hollywood that he was living in. In response, Liya-Joelle Jones launched a GoFundMe to “Help Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home.”


	Rourke, however, says he has no knowledge of the fundraising effort and isn't asking fans for any money. In a video posted to Instagram on Monday night, Rourke said he is “frustrated” and “confused” by the situation. He explained that he learned about the GoFundMe, but didn't understand why it was created. 


	“That's not me, OK?” Rourke said. “I'd rather, if I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no fucking charity. I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger. So whoever did this, I don't know if they did it — why they did it. I don't understand it. I wouldn't know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years. My life is very simple. I don't go to outside sources like that.”

	











	He added that it is “embarrassing.” “But I'm sure I'll get over it like anything else,” Rourke said. “Everything else. Listen, I've done a really terrible job in managing my career. I wasn't very diplomatic. I had to go to over 20 years of therapy to get over the damage that was done to me years ago. And I worked very hard to work through that. And I'm not that person anymore … I'm not that wild man that I was twentysomething years ago. But you pay the price for your past.”

	











	Rourke told fans not to give any money to the GoFundMe campaign. “Get it back,” he said. He added that he plans to speak with his lawyer to “get to the bottom of this.” 


	“There's only one person I can think of that would do such a thing, and I hope it's not the person I'm thinking about,” Rourke said. “It's humiliating.” He confirmed that he has previously borrowed money from a “good friend,” but if he needed money he would ask. “But I would never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel,” he said. “That's not my style … I wouldn't take a fucking nickel from charity or from anybody.”

	He added, “I don't want anybody's money. I don't want anybody to send me money. I want you to get your money back.” 


	As of early this morning, the GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $97,000. The page states, “Life doesn't always move in a straight line, and despite everything Mickey has given through his work and his life, he is now dealing with a challenging financial moment that has put his housing at risk. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent eviction.”


	Earlier this week, Jones spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about setting up the campaign on Rourke's behalf. “Mickey is going through a very difficult time right now, and it's been incredibly touching to see how many people care about him and want to help,” she said. The publication names her a friend and a member of Rourke's management team.

	Rourke received a three-day eviction notice on Dec. 18, according to the Los Angeles Times. He signed the lease in March 2025 for $5,200 per month. It was later raised to $7,000 per month.


	The actor gained acclaim for his role as a fast-talking hustler in Barry Levinson's coming-of-age comedy Diner. He later starred in Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish and 9 ½ Weeks with Kim Basinger. After a lull in his career, Rourke mounted a comeback thanks to roles in Sin City, Iron Man 2, and his Oscar-nominated turn in The Wrestler. While Rourke has continued to maintain a steady stream of roles over the past decade, he's largely appeared in direct-to-video films.

Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned Monday night after the holiday break, and host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to recap all of the “crazy stuff” Donald Trump did while the show was away.


	“It would take a nine-part Ken Burns documentary series to cover it all,” Kimmel noted. “But I'm going to do my best to boil it down.”


	Kimmel reminded viewers that Trump hosted the the Kennedy Center Honors, which aired in December to notably low ratings. “After boasting about what a great host he is and how much better he is than I am and how huge his ratings would be, Trump hosted the lowest rated Kennedy Center Honors telecast of all time,” Kimmel said. 


	He added, “I'd hate to be the White House intern who had to tear that headline out of all the papers and eat 'em. You know, as I recall, he said he'd step down if this happened, right? He said, ‘If I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel, then I don't think I should be president.' Hey, a deal is a deal. Back to Mar-a-Lago you go.”

	











	Kimmel then noted that since Jimmy Kimmel Live! left for its break, Trump posted on Truth Social 556 times. “Behold the ramblings of a madman,” he said, displaying all of the social media posts on a video wall behind him. “He was in an especially festive mood on Christmas Eve.” That evening, Trump threatened to “terminate” the broadcast licenses of news networks and late-night shows.

	“This is the vision of sugar plums that are dancing in his head as he goes to sleep,” Kimmel quipped. Trump then posted, “Merry Christmas to all, including the many sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein.” 

	











	“Leave it to Trump to wish Merry Christmas to himself,” Kimmel responded. Trump closed his Christmas Eve post with, “Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.” “What is he trying to tell us?” Kimmel asked. “He's going down? He's taking us with him? I don't know.”


	Elsewhere in his monologue, Kimmel recounted how Trump enlisted Vanilla Ice to perform at his New Year's Eve party for the third time in five years. “Which is a lot of times for a guy with one song,” Kimmel said. “What year were they ringing in? 1991?”

	He added, “President Trump said his New Year's resolution this year is peace on Earth. And that lasted for just under two days. If you were wondering how bad these Epstein files are for Trump, turns out they're invade-Venezuela bad. This is literally the plot of the movie Wag the Dog. The president gets caught in a sex scandal, so he attacks a smaller country to distract us. And here we are, distracted.”


	Kimmel closed his monologue by taking the cognitive test that Trump has repeatedly bragged about acing. “Let's find out just how difficult this big, beautiful test is,” Kimmel said. “And how my brain stacks up against our stable genius president's.” Spoiler alert: Kimmel received a perfect score. “So I could be president,” he confirmed.

	On Sunday night, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was awarded the trophy for Best Talk Show at the Critics Choice Awards. In his acceptance speech, Kimmel joked that he owed the win to his nemesis “Donald Jennifer Trump.” “A FIFA Peace Prize would have been better, but this is nice, too,” Kimmel said. 


	He added, “Most of all, I want to thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump, without whom we would be going home empty-handed tonight. Thank you, Mr. President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day.”

The 1977 classic experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams since appearing in the Netflix series.

	David Bowie's 1977 classic “Heroes” is seeing a major resurgence on streaming platforms following its prominent placement in the finale of Netflix's Stranger Things, which premiered Dec. 31.

	According to new Luminate data, the song experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams after soundtracking the end credits of the series' final episode.

	Over the previous five months, “Heroes” had averaged approximately 94,000 daily streams. That figure jumped sharply in the days following the finale's release, reaching roughly 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3 — representing a 3.6- to 5-times increase over its typical daily performance.


	The placement marked a full-circle moment for the series, which has become closely associated with 1980s music throughout its run. 


	In earlier seasons, the show famously used a cover of “Heroes” by Peter Gabriel, making the finale's use of Bowie's original recording a deliberate callback.


	In an interview with Netflix's Tudum, Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed that the idea to use Bowie's version came from cast member Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington.


	“It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do the Bowie version,” Ross Duffer said. “Once Joe said that, we immediately knew that was the right song to end the show on because it is, in some ways, an anthem for Stranger Things. To use the original Bowie version just felt fitting for the conclusion.”

	











	Keery also saw a streaming boost of his own following the finale. His music project Djo experienced renewed attention, with his 2022 track “End of Beginning” climbing to No. 1 on Spotify's Global Chart this week, according to Rolling Stone, displacing Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia,” which had held the top spot for several weeks.


	Music has long played a central role in Stranger Things, which helped reintroduce a new generation of listeners to catalog tracks from the 1980s. Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” famously returned to global charts in 2022 after appearing in Season Four, while the finale also featured Prince's “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain.”


	The Duffer Brothers told Tudum that music selection was especially critical in the final episode, which centered around a record player used as a key plot device. “We never talked about a song choice as much as we did for that moment,” Ross Duffer said. 


	“We knew we needed an epic needle drop, and so many ideas were thrown around. I think there's nothing really more epic than Prince.” “Purple Rain” has seen a 243% increase in Spotify streams, with global Gen Z listeners driving a reported 577% surge.

It's hard, these days, to move through the world feeling optimistic. Violence is everywhere. Prices are steep, jobs are scarce, AI fakery is ubiquitous, and everything seems to be in a state of collapse. It would be natural for me to turn to any of the harsh or melancholy-tinged AD 93 records stored in my iPod. But I've more often found myself hitting play on The Velvet Underground and Rowan, a brilliant and irreverent underground pop album released last summer that's edgy but not irony-poisoned, silly but not unserious, darkly funny and giddily joyful. Its 14 songs, totaling just over 30 minutes, brought the skip back to my step and the song back to my heart like little else in recent memory.

The Velvet Underground and Rowan is the work of Londoners Leo Fincham, a visual artist and producer who records as Worldpeace DMT, and Rowan Please, government name Rowan Miles, a member of the Teenagers-esque pop duo the Femcels. Fincham and Miles are part of the '00s-fetishizing London scene that tangentially includes fakemink and Bassvictim, but The Velvet Underground and Rowan makes the pair feel like a scene of two: They may give entertaining and slightly crazy interviews, maintain messy Instagram pages, and put on hyped shows with little advance notice—and Fincham may live, or have lived, with Bassvictim's Ike Clateman—but their music is a melange of hyper-uncool early-'10s indie references and pathos-heavy lyrics, delivered with Donny & Marie Osmond-level chumminess.

The first time I listened to The Velvet Underground and Rowan, I felt like I'd just been king hit by Carles: Fincham and Miles may talk up their love of the '60s in interviews, and shades of both the Beach Boys and their album's namesake may crop up at times—along with a chirpy cover of Fleetwood Mac's “The Ledge”—but, for the most part, The Velvet Underground and Rowan feels like the work of two people who came of age in the late '00s and early '10s. Fincham and Miles draw liberally from the primary-colored soup of post-landfill-indie bands like Darwin Deez, Grouplove, and Cults, cheerfully yelping choruses and layering them with chimes, programmed drums, and finicky guitar riffs. There are less outré reference points, too—Sung Tongs-era Anco, the sunny plunderphonics of the Avalanches—but never anything that would warrant a second glance from anyone in the bar queue at Ormside or OTO.

In this sense, The Velvet Underground and Rowan feels of a piece with Callahan & Witscher's Think Differently, pairing two underground musicians who put a cheeky, throw-everything-at-the-wall spin on relatively unfasionable sounds. But where Callahan & Witscher use their '90s rock pastiche in service of blackpilled anti-Boomkat nihilism, Fincham and Miles seem like optimists. Their music is certainly funny, but their lyrics often scan as totally earnest, even when they're droll. “Wrote this song just so you'd know/To love yourself no matter what,” yelps Miles on the sweet, glitchy “Love Yourself,” before, a few verses later: “Leo wrote this song for you/Sorry that I fucked your dude.”

Fincham's production is inherently bright, and his maximalist approach allows for surprising emotional range: The glitch-pop of “B-Side Story” and “Sound-waves” is dazed bordering on goofy, while “Hey Marshmallow” is directional and euphoric, building toward a punch-the-air orchestral hook halfway through. (Someone is screaming in the background at the same time; it doesn't sound like David Comes to Life, but it does sound like what I remember David Comes to Life as sounding like.) As if leery of seeming too in thrall of the straightforward positivity of 2010s indie, he still grounds the music in the metacommentary of a lot of underground pop: “If the music's bad, you haven't paid for it,” sings Miles on “Neighbourhood Announcement Squad,” an interlude that sounds like the Bugsnax soundtrack. “You can press skip, pause, and add it to a playlist!”

A lot of so-called indie sleaze warrants blasé nihilism because it sounds louche and unbothered. Miles, working within the framework of Obama-era indie optimism, maintains the extremely contemporary themes of the Femcels without any of the edge. “Say the Sky Is Grey,” a highlight that sounds like one of the dusty private-press curios from the 2016 compilation Sky Girl, is a bittersweet ode to a porn addict; her worn-down vocals imbue the scene with a surprising amount of pathos. “Do you still want me to stay in this room where you keep the window closed/Lay in bed and blow your loads?” she sings. “Nut on me, nut on me/Can't you ever do it on me?” It is a deeply unromantic love song for exceptionally unromantic times, rendered with nostalgia for a time when couples like Matt & Kim and Dave Longstreth and Amber Coffman were headlining festivals.

It's easy to be skeptical about music that's so indebted to past sounds when a good chunk of what's being released now is designed as a game of spot-the-reference. The Velvet Underground and Rowan is more confrontational than your average pastiche: Rather than imagine a universe in which they were hitting Misshapes at 14 or palling around with Uffie and Busy P, Fincham and Miles have chosen to trawl the depths of that scene's less cool, far less sexy aftermath. It might feel awkward to look back on that period now, but Worldpeace DMT and Rowan Please find pleasure in the discomfort.

Between Sisu and Ready Or Not 2, the world of John Wick is finding common cause with the influence of Quentin Tarantino. And there's no shortage of comedic kung fu, ironic bloodletting, and stylish hotel rooms in the first trailer for They Will Kill You. Produced by It sibilings Andy and Barbara Muschietti and directed by Kirill Sokolov, the Russian action-comedy filmmaker behind Why Don't You Just Die, the trailer makes no attempt to hide its influences before veering off in its own Satanic course. Still, while it may take people a second to realize that this isn't the trailer for Ready Or Not: Here I Come, it still gives Zazie Beetz, the Bullet Train star who's no stranger to this type of thing, an excuse to square off against Patricia Arquette, Tom Felton, and Heather Graham.

﻿

Here's the logline:

A young woman must survive the night at the Virgil, a demonic cult's mysterious and twisted death-trap of a lair, before becoming their next offering in a uniquely brazen, big screen battle of epic kills and wickedly dark humor.

They Will Kill You opens in theaters on March 25, 2026.

Five days in, and it's been a shameful, humiliating, and violent year for the United States. There is no shortage of horrors to point to, from the immigration raids to X, the everything app, adding a new CSAM feature to the gutting of public television. But for now, let's focus on international relations. They're bad. Days after the Trump administration kidnapped Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, the President and the ghouls hanging off him for warmth have renewed calls to annex Greenland. Speaking of which, Stephen Miller appeared on CNN today to rant that “Greenland should be part of the US,” though he failed to make any discernible case for it. While these threats probably won't inspire any urgency among Democrats, Icelandic art-pop superstar Björk is calling on Greenlanders to declare independence.

In an Instagram post earlier today, the “It's Oh So Quiet” singer loudly wished all “Greenlanders blessing in their fight for independence,” reflecting on how “relieved” Icelanders are that they “managed to break free from the Danish in 1944.” Iceland managed to retain its language because of its independence, which is why Björk's children speak Icelandic rather than Danish. But Greenland hasn't been so lucky. The country is a self-governing entity within the Kingdom of Denmark, which continues to oversee Greenland's foreign affairs and to account for most of its public funds.

Though she did not mention Trump by name, Björk didn't leave much to mystery as to who and what she was describing. “Colonialism has repeatedly given me horror chills up my back,” she wrote, “and the chance that my fellow greenlanders might go from one cruel coloniser to another is too brutal to even imagine.” As she lamented the threats from one cruel colonizer, she reflected on the horrors of another. “I burst with sympathy for greenlanders,” she wrote as she recounted the “forced contraception” of thousands of Greenlandic girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1970, as well as the “parenting competency” tests Denmark enforced on Greenlanders until May 2025. “Still today the danish are treating greenlanders like they are second class humans, removing children from their parents in 2025.”

“Dear Greenlanders, declare independence !!!! Sympathetic wishes from your neighbors. Warmthness.”

After Hollywood's A-list toasted the critics' favorite TV and films of the year at the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday night, the evening's biggest winners made their way backstage to take photos and chat with press.

“Field of Dreams” alum Amy Madigan, who pulled off a surprise supporting actress win for her work as Aunt Gladys in the horror film “Weapons,” breezed into the winners circle with a glazed donut in hand.

After some requests from photographers, she reluctantly swapped the pastry for her silver starred trophy, waving it around and hamming it up for the cameras.

“I've got donut on my face! Ah, I don't care!” she said with a giggle.

“KPop Demon Hunters” singer-songwriter Ejae, who took home best original song for the smash hit “Golden” alongside Mark Sonnenblick, reflected on how the song has evolved over the past year. 

“It's in sync with the intention of the song and how I felt writing it. For me, it was a hopeful song. It gave me hope that one day my dreams would come true. I still feel that now.”

In the TV world, “The Studio” won big for lead actor Seth Rogen, supporting actor Ike Barinholtz and best comedy series.

As a screen in the press room showed Jacob Elordi taking the stage for his “Frankenstein” supporting actor win, Rogen quipped, “Elordi won? For playing Frankenstein?”

Barinholz was quick to correct Rogen's literary faux-pas: “He's not Frankenstein! He's Frankenstein's monster,” he said, prompting belly laughs from Rogen and co-star Chase Sui Wonders.

Jean Smart entered the press room soon after, joking that her martini just kicked in as she fist-pumped and crunched her trophy like a 10-pound weight in her arms.

Jimmy Kimmel, who snagged the award for outstanding talk show, took a moment to ask some questions of his own to the photographers and reporters in the room.

“How does this work? You all take the exact same picture of me, then it's a competition to see whose photos get used?”

After a resounding “yes” from the peanut gallery, he quipped: “And do you all hate each other?” to laughs from all the photographers (who assured him that they prefer to help each other out, not just compete for the best shot).

Not every winner made their way to the backstage press room: the Leonardo DiCaprio-led “One Battle After Another” crew, which took home trophies for best picture and best director Paul Thomas Anderson, opted to skip the photo op, as did “Marty Supreme” best actor victor Timothée Chalamet.

The Annie Awards, which recognize the best in animated film and TV, announced their nominations on January 5. Unsurprisingly, things look “Golden” for “KPop Demon Hunters.”

The Netflix sleeper hit was one of the two films to receive the most nominations at the ceremony, along with “Elio,” the Pixar sci-fi film that underperformed at the box office upon its June premiere. Both films received nominations in the best feature category, alongside categories like character animation, music, and voice acting; “KPop Demon Hunters” additionally nabbed a directing nomination. Other films nominated in the Best Feature category are “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” and “Zootopia 2,” both of which received seven nods, and “The Bad Guys 2,” which received five. The best Independent feature category includes “Arco,” which received five nominations, three-time nominee “Scarlet,” as well as “A Magnificent Life,” “I'm Frankelda,” and “Lost in Starlight.”

David Bowie‘s “Heroes” might be stuck in your head after that iconic Stranger Things finale — and it's being streamed by thousands of people, too. According to new Luminate data acquired by Rolling Stone on Monday, the classic track, which soundtracked the end credits of Stranger Things‘ Dec. 31 finale, saw a jump of almost 500 percent on streaming services.


	On average, the 1977 song has been earning about 94,000 digital streams daily over the last five months. But after New Year's Eve — when the song was used in the Netflix show's final episode — it logged a rounded 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3, marking a roughly 3.6-to-5 times jump over its daily average in the days following the finale's drop.


	In a Monday interview with Netflix's outlet Tudum, the Duffer Brothers revealed that it was Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington in the show, who suggested that the Bowie song would be the perfect way to conclude the show during its end-credits segment. It was also a nostalgic nod to the Peter Gabriel cover of the song that was featured in earlier seasons.

	











	“It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do the Bowie version,” Ross Duffer told the outlet. “Once Joe said that, we immediately knew that was the right song to end the show on because it is, in some ways, an anthem for Stranger Things. To use the original Bowie version just felt fitting for the conclusion.”

	











	Speaking of Keery, the actor's artist project Djo also saw a surge on streaming following the finale. His song “End of Beginning,” originally dropped in 2022, climbed its way to Number One on the Spotify Global Chart this week — replacing Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia,” which held the position for weeks.


Stranger Things slayed at helping revive Eighties culture and music throughout its run, especially with its song choices. The show's finale also featured two classic Prince songs, “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain,” and Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” returned to the charts in 2022 after being featured in Season Four.

	The Duffer Brothers knew they would need several songs for key parts of the last episode after they figured out they'd have a record player serve as the trigger for the bomb that would end the bridge connecting the world to the Upside Down. Ross Duffer told Tudum they “never talked about a song choice as much as we did for that moment,” adding: “We knew we needed an epic needle drop, and so many ideas were thrown around. I think there's nothing really more epic than Prince.”  When it came to hitting those two moods, side two of Purple Rain “lined up perfectly for us,” Ross said. 


	According to Variety, since the finale aired on New Year's Eve, “Purple Rain” has seen a 243 percent jump in streams on Spotify, with a 577 percent surge among global Gen Z listeners.

Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are officially parents! The “Dancing with the Stars” former pro turned judge and his lovely wife announced the birth of their daughter on Monday, January 5. They also shared important details, including her date of birth and the beautiful name they had chosen. 

Hough and Erbert posted a joint Instagram announcement featuring a black-and-white photo of their daughter's feet. “December 29, 2025. Everley Capri Hough,” they wrote the caption. “Every step of our lives has led us to you. Our hearts have been cracked wide open, and our world is forever changed.”

Their daughter's name is Everley Capri Hough, and it's a stunning choice that's also incredibly meaningful. The name Everley is a “gender-neutral baby name of British origin,” The Bump reports. “This baby name directly translates to ‘boar' and ‘woodland clearing.'”

The meaning behind the name Capri is described as  “a feminine name of Italian origin,” The Bump reports. “The modern name depicts the charm of the colorful Italian island located just off the mainland's west coast.” Together, the names sound really pretty and have a natural, earthy meaning.

Baby Hough's initials are ECH, and her proud dad has already added them to his Instagram bio. The DWTS judge had hinted at his daughter's arrival just days ago, when he made a subtle change on Instagram. Hough's Instagram bio reads, “ECH, 4 X Emmy Award Winner, 6 X DWTS Champion, NYT Best Selling Author, LIVE ON TOUR.”

Days earlier, he added his daughter's initials and removed the sentence “soon to be Daddy,” generating excitement among fans, who felt it signalled the birth of their child. Little did the world know that Hough and Erbert are very good at keeping secrets, and their daughter is already one week old. 

Hough and Erbert's baby announcement, which is only two hours old, is already receiving a lot of attention from fans, celebrities, and Hough's DWTS family. The comment section has been flooded with messages, and the post has been liked over 500,000 times.

“Welcome to the world sweet angel Everley,” her aunt Julianne Hough shared. “She's going to be so loved,” Season 34 finalist and fan favorite Dylan Efron commented.

Congratulations to Hough and Erbert on the birth of their daughter. We are so excited to watch them in this next step of their journey!

Happiest of Baby Everley love to you and your family.  A Blessed event for your entire family.🍼

Wishing you all the best! She probably moves like she's dancing already!

Congratulations mom and dad! May all the joy and blessing of the Lord, be upon you and this little one! May he protect all of you and keep you all safe! In Jesus's Mighty name!  Amen! Such a blessing! I'm so happy for you both! She will bring you so much joy!

Ronnie Radke filed a temporary restraining order against Tommy Lee's wife, Brittany Furlan on Monday.

The Falling in Reverse frontman claims that Furlan harassed him on social media, and her behavior escalated when he ignored her messages, according to docs obtained by TMZ.

He claims in the docs that Furlan drove to his house and sat outside, and also alleged that she followed him to a doctor's appointment and waited outside, simply staring at him.

In a statement to Page Six, Furlan's attorney insisted she's the one being harassed.

“Ms. Furlan is offended to find out this petition was filed because the only victim of harassment is her,” the statement reads. “We will take all legal measures to defend against this frivolous lawsuit and request that Ms. Furlan be protected from further harassment and threats by the petitioner.”

Reps for Radke didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

In May 2025, Furlan claimed she was “catfished” on social media by someone she presumed to be Radke — while she was still married to Lee — but that she told her husband “everything.”

TMZ reported that she revisited the drama over the weekend, claiming in her Instagram Stories that Radke really was the one messaging her and also accusing him of interacting with underage fans.

Radke, 42, hit back at her claims on Instagram, accusing her of “stalking and harassment.”

“Brittany Furlan may be now committing a crime,” he captioned one video.

Radke told TMZ back in May 2025 that multiple other women besides Furlan were “tricked and duped” by the individual pretending to be him and that the FBI was involved.

At the time, he said that he was cooperating with authorities.

“I sent them some stuff,” he claimed. “They're gonna find out who it is. I want to prove to everyone it's not me.”

Despite the catfish scandal and reports Furlan and Lee split in May 2025 after six years of marriage, the couple is still together.

Furlan said the incident actually strengthened their marriage during an episode of her and Brittany Schmitt's “This Is The Worst” podcast back in June 2025.

“All of this happening has weirdly brought us together, which is really strange,” she said. “I think we really faced like, ‘Oh, what would life really be like without each other?'”

Advertisement

“I was so lonely,” she also confessed. “I was messaging Chat GPT for affection. I'm like, ‘It talks to you lovingly and it says nice things to you and it's sweet to you and if it could kiss me I would let it.'”

A month later, Lee, 63, captioned a pic of them on Instagram, “Hey fake news we're not separated or divorced!! Get your sh—t together!! 🤣.”

The Mötley Crüe drummer recently shared a selfie with his wife celebrating New Year's Day together.

Savannah Guthrie assured fans she is “all good” after undergoing a recent vocal cord surgery.

The “Today” show host took to Instagram Monday to share the positive update. 

In the snap, Guthrie held up a whiteboard that read, “All good! Thanks for prayers and love,” showing that she is apparently unable to speak for the time being.

“see you soon! 💛” she teased in the caption. 

Her fans instantly flooded the comments section with warm wishes and saying how much they miss seeing her on their screens. 

“So happy to hear all went well ! Sending healing ❤️‍🩹 vibes,” one wrote. 

“Miss seeing you with Craig and Sheinelle. Love you 3. Heal fast and come back,” another added. 

On Dec. 19, the journalist announced that she'd be taking some time away from from the talk show to undergo the vocal cord surgery in the new year.

Guthrie, 54, explained on air that she had nodules and a polyp that needed removal, which is why viewers may have noticed that her voice had been “very scratchy and started to crack a little bit.”

She also said she would need to be on vocal rest during the recovery period but insisted the procedure is “not a big, big deal.”

She joked that it sounded like she had “the world's longest head cold,” but now, she's “really excited” to finally have some answers and improve her voice. 

“This has been going on for years, honestly,” she shared.

Since she wouldn't be able to speak for a while, Guthrie joked, “Christmas coming early for my family!”

The lawyer shares two children, daughter Vale, 11, and son Charley, 8 with husband, Michael Feldman.

Co-host Sheinelle Jones noted that she had undergone the same surgery and gifted Guthrie the whiteboard, wrapped in a red bow, that she used to “speak” as she recovered. 

“The silver lining is you have permission to be still. The house gets quiet, the kids are gonna want to help you out,” Jones said. 

“A lot of the greats have done it, maybe you'll come out singing like, I don't know, Celine Dion.”

Stranger Things has come to an end, and as the Upside Down industrial complex prepares to churn out more strange things, the show's biggest fans have a simple question: Where is the real series finale, Netflix? The show's core fanbase has been in a tailspin ever since Stranger Things wrapped last week. While reactions to the final season have been mixed, a common occurrence in the world of long-running, big-budget fantasy television shows, a large swath of fans apparently think they've been duped into watching the fake finale. Some refuse to believe that's how it ended and have begun spinning up different conspiracy theories to explain their disappointment. For instance, a Change.org petition signed by 389,000 people argues that there is “unseen footage” of the show that will supposedly fill in its numerous plot holes. Winnii J, the petition's starter writes [sic throughout], “I believe the fans should have a say in how the series should go. This is why so many of us are disappointed because it didn't live up to the expectations that was held upon. Everyone is clearly dissatisfied with this season volume. And also the amount of clues and information we got from the cast members and interviews are not matching up with the episodes provided. We want stranger things to have a legacy not be seen as some show that couldn't pull though due to it bad writing.”

On TikTok and X, the Duffer brothers' faithful have launched a fan theory called “Conformity Gate,” which poses that the series finale was an elaborate illusion created by Vecna, explaining why all the characters conformed to adulthood in the epilogue, a strange decision for a show that's, more or less, about growing up. Why do they think that? Because the long-running “Byler” romance between Mike Wheeler and Will Byers did not come to pass. So now the fandom is poring over plot holes, production goofs, The Truman Show for some reason, Netflix's episode ID system, the legal definition of television season, and the seating positions of characters to prove that a secret episode will drop later this week.



This sort of thing isn't new. When Game Of Thrones disappointed fans with its final season, a million fans signed a petition for a do-over. However, back in the halcyon days of 2018, when a TV show was bad, it was because the creators screwed up. Now? They're masters of manipulation, pulling the strings, and playing 4-D chess with their audience to release a secret episode after most of the people who watch the show have already moved on to Heated Rivalry. We imagine the fandom will be overjoyed to hear that the last piece of the Stranger Things puzzle is an extensive behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of season five that Netflix announced today.

A new paper posits that advanced alien civilizations may communicate through subtle flashes, like fireflies do on Earth. The thought experiment suggests that we need to avoid human biases in our search for extraterrestrial life.

Advanced alien civilizations may communicate via a series of flashing lights, similar to how fireflies do, a new paper hints. This would potentially make extraterrestrials much harder to spot if we continue to rely on our current observation techniques, the researchers argue.

However, while this thought experiment raises interesting questions about alien intelligence, it does not provide any evidence that these signals actually exist.

So far, the quest to uncover alien intelligence has focused on finding evidence of distant human-like civilizations. For example, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute — the world's leading organization dedicated to searching for alien life — spends most of its time searching for radio signals from distant exoplanets or heat given off by technological megastructures, such as the theoretical Dyson sphere.

However, some scientists believe that these searches suffer from an "anthropocentric bias" — meaning we're trying to understand nonhuman entities through a distinctly human lens — and do not account for potential civilizations that are wholly different from our own. Due to this bias, we may be overlooking promising signs of life.

In the new study, uploaded Nov. 8 to the preprint server arXiv, researchers proposed a new way that an alien civilization could communicate — by flashing to one another like fireflies. These flashing signals could be used for specific and complex communications. However, the researchers argue that they are more likely being widely broadcast to other civilizations, like a luminous repeating beacon. (This paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but is now under consideration for publication in the journal PNAS.)

 




On Earth, fireflies communicate via a series of regularly repeating flashes caused by internal chemical reactions. These flashes are mainly used to find mates. But while these signals are simple, they do allow distinct firefly species to tell each other apart.

The researchers argue that similar flashing could be used as "here we are" signals by an alien civilization. And space is plentiful with repetitive bursts of light.

In the new paper, researchers analyzed the flashes of more than 150 pulsars — rapidly spinning, highly magnetized neutron stars that shoot out regular beams of electromagnetic radiation — as a proxy for what these signals may look like. And while they found no evidence of any artificial signals, they did note some similarities between the pulsars and firefly signals, and proposed ways of being able to detect future firefly-like flashes from other natural objects, like pulsars.

The study team argues that these signals could be more likely to evolve in long-lasting alien civilizations that progress past the need for widespread use of radio waves. A similar progression is already happening on Earth, where the use of communications satellites with more specific and concentrated radio signals is making our planet appear more "radio quiet" from afar, the researchers wrote.

And just because we may not naturally think to communicate in this way, it doesn't mean that other civilizations wouldn't, they added.

—Intelligent aliens would need a power supply to jump-start their civilization — would they require fossil fuels?

—Alien 'warp drives' may leave telltale signals in the fabric of space-time, new paper claims

—7 potential 'alien megastructures' spotted in our galaxy are not what they seem

"Communication is a fundamental feature of life across lineages and manifests in a wonderful diversity of forms and strategies," study co-author Estelle Janin, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, recently told Universe Today. "Taking non-human communication into account is essential if we want to broaden our intuition and understanding about what alien communication could look like, and what a theory of life ought to explain."

This is just one example of what non-human signals may look like, and the researchers encourage others to think outside of the anthropocentric box to come up with other ways that a non-human-like civilization could communicate.

"Our study is meant as a provoking thought-experiment and an invitation for SETI and animal communication research to engage more directly and to draw more systematically on each other's insights," Janin said.

      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel."



President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one."



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..."



President Barack Obama: "What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are."



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: "The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting." - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: "Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom."



Corroboration: "I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft."



Triangular Craft Sighting: ["I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

One day in 1961, father of four and Korean War veteran George Carroll went out to buy a packet of cigarettes. He never came home again.

Or so his wife Dorothy told their young children. As ‘her word was gospel' in those days, they believed her explanation.

‘Don't even think about him,' Dorothy assured them, later silencing their natural curiosities. ‘He wasn't a good guy.'

However, decades later a series of astonishing events revealed the dark secret behind their father's disappearance.

In a new documentary, The Secrets We Bury, the truth behind George's vanishing, which wife Dorothy took to her grave when she died of cancer in 1998, is laid bare for the first time.

It's a mystery involving missing family members living only streets away, children who suspected that their new stepfather had killed their father, a psychic medium and a body buried deep under the basement of a family house.

Mike, Dorothy's son who still lives in the family home in Lake Grove village on New York's Long Island, is the focus of the documentary. Now 64, he is the youngest of four children – with sisters Jean, 71, and Pat, 69, and brother Steve, 68.

‘When my mother became sick, my dad was always on her mind,' Mike says. ‘On her deathbed, I asked, “Can you tell me anything about that before you leave?”

‘My mother literally turned her head, winked at me, never said a word and then passed away.'

Their father's fate had long puzzled the children. It seemed odd that he'd left his wallet and car behind and hadn't cashed his final pay cheque. And it was suspicious that no police report about his disappearance was ever filed.

There were rumours that he'd returned to a girlfriend he had in Korea during the war there in the 1950s, or that he'd been murdered by the Mob – but nothing concrete.

Mike was only eight months old when George vanished and barely remembered him. Curiously, his older siblings who did remember their dad could not recall any drama leading up to the actual moment he vanished.

‘I know I was Daddy's girl,' says Mike's sister Jean. ‘My dad was there and then all of a sudden my dad wasn't there.'

After George vanished, Dorothy swiftly remarried and the children had a stepfather, Richard Darress, a newspaper photographer who lived locally. The older children described the switch from one father to another as ‘almost seamless'.

Although the children didn't like Richard, family life continued.

Curiously, when a young Mike then got a job delivering newspapers, one of his customers Mr Yagel appeared at the door of their family home with a box of old share certificates that had belonged to George Carroll. While Mike asked his mother how Mr Yagel had known his father, she never explained.

Life continued, Mike got married and had children with his wife Debbi and later, when his mother – a gregarious ‘frustrated actress' who put on comedy shows in her large garage – was struggling financially, they moved into the family home to help her out.

But there were signs that Dorothy had secrets. When Debbi and Mike divorced in 1995, Dorothy warned Debbi that ‘something would happen' to her daughter-in-law if she tried to take the house away from her in the divorce settlement. Debbi is clear that she believed Dorothy was entirely serious. It seemed that this wasn't such a ‘normal' family after all.

A family bombshell came a couple of years after Dorothy's death in 1998 when Mike, who worked as a respiratory therapist, was called at 3am one night to tend to a patient at the local hospital.

He was surprised to find that the patient had the same unusual last name, Yagel, as the older man who years earlier had delivered the box of his father's papers. He was even more shocked when the patient, on learning he was Mike Carroll, announced he was his uncle – George's brother.

Mike realised he had been delivering newspapers for years to the older man, Mr Yagel Sr, without ever knowing he was his grandfather.

His newfound uncle explained that George had been digging up his house to add an extension when he disappeared. The Yagels had always suspected George's body might be under the family home because the timing of the building work matched so neatly with his vanishing.

They'd become estranged from Dorothy, who they believed was involved.

Mike wouldn't hear anything against his beloved mother, but his sister Jean took up the investigation. She decided to consult a medium – a plan that other family members, who didn't believe in such things, dismissed. However, Mike accompanied her to a séance in 2010.

The medium spent an hour talking about other family matters until Mike – distinctly unimpressed – impatiently told her he only wanted to learn about his father.

‘She goes, “Oh, when it comes to the “M” word, I normally don't say anything until you give me the permission to do it,'” he says in the documentary. ‘I said, “What's the “M” word?'” She replied: “Murder.”'

She told the siblings that their father had been killed and buried in the basement of the family home – identifying the precise location, explaining that the spot lay under a ‘target' on the wall.

Jean was puzzled by what she meant, but Mike remembered a target used to hang on the wall at which they'd fire pellet guns when he was little, although it had long been taken down.

How did the medium know about such a specific detail about their family home, from 60 years ago? Mike was impressed. When he asked who did it, she replied with ‘Richard'.

They were in no doubt she meant their former stepfather, Richard Darress, but dreaded breaking the news to his son, Richard Jr, with whom they'd grown up.

The latter was also interviewed for the documentary. Asked about the theory that his father killed George, he says: ‘Is it possible? Sure it is. Is it likely? Probably not.'

The others were more convinced. Jean even had a distinct memory of waking up one morning, around the age of seven before her father's disappearance, to find a man sleeping on the living room sofa.

She later learned he was her soon-to-be stepfather Richard Darress Sr.

Darress had just got out of prison for theft and after meeting in a bar her father had offered him a place to sleep in return for help with the building work on his home.

So did Darress Sr and Dorothy have an affair while he was dossing on the sofa? Mike says ‘it kind of makes sense'.

Meanwhile, only siblings Jean and Mike believed that there could be something under the basement. Mike started digging, using only hammers and chisels to break through the concrete.

His initial excavation in the spot identified by the medium proved fruitless. But after his two adult sons joined the dig, hiring a team with ground-penetrating radar equipment, they identified a new place to search, a 5ft-square area that had been disturbed.

After spending months digging a huge 8ft hole without finding anything, they discovered an underground cinderblock wall on the edge of the excavation area. Breaking through it, they found a cavity which turned out to be a vault for the old house's water pump.

Inside, they first found of piece of decomposed fabric which turned out to be clothing. Under it was a pelvis bone. Then as they scrabbled away at the earth, it was revealed to be part of a complete human skeleton. It was Halloween, October 2018 – 57 years after George Carroll had vanished.

‘Everyone had said I was wrong,' says Mike. After many years during which everyone believed he and Jean were unhinged and needed to simply accept their father deserted them, this was ‘payday', he says.

Richard Darress Jr describes the discovery as ‘probably the most emotional day of my life – your whole body turns numb, you start reflecting on your entire life. Not just who did it – was it my father? Was it my mother? – but it was “Oh my God, my siblings - what did they endure their entire lives.”'

He rushed back from a business trip in Chicago to be with them, aware that they had little doubt that his father had killed theirs.

The family immediately called police who – after establishing this was not a typical Halloween prank call – arrived in force, while the media also descended on the quiet neighbourhood. Investigators confirmed that the victim was indeed George Carroll, who had died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Anxious not to upset Richard Jr and his own family, the Carrolls initially refused to be drawn into the media's speculations on who they believed to be the killer.

That suspect, Darress Sr, had died just three months earlier – infuriatingly, before the family had been able to talk to him about George's fate.

Parroting what he says he was told by his paternal uncle, Richard Jr believes George had been abusive towards Dorothy and that Richard Sr had been ‘defending her'.

He tells the documentary: ‘I've heard stories about George Carroll. He wasn't the best husband. I've heard the term “heavy hands”'.

Richard Jr's half-siblings accepted there was some truth to this as their mother claimed George had been ‘rough with her' – with scars to prove it – after possibly suffering post-traumatic stress in the Korean War.

But, crucially, did she conspire with Darress Sr to kill George? Some of her family cling to the hope that she knew nothing about the killing, although the fact she never filed a missing persons report and kept her children away from George's family is certainly suspicious.

And yet there's another explanation in this labyrinthine story.

Darress Sr's stepchildren claim he sexually molested the girls in the family – Jean and Pat – and that even while George was still alive, Darress repeatedly exposed himself to the Carroll children.

Jean remembers Darress as an ‘evil' and ‘manipulative' sexual ‘predator'.

Is it possible, asks Steve Carroll, Jean's other brother, that George was murdered after he confronted Darress in the house over his predilections?

He certainly believes so, although he adds that – if this was the case – why on earth did his mother allow such a monster to remain in her home?

So many questions and so few answers. It doesn't exactly help that all of the siblings have wildly divergent theories as to who did what and why.

George's children accept that they will never know for certain which of them – if any – is correct although they can at least find small consolation in the fact that their father didn't abandon them after all.

The Secrets We Bury is available on Discovery+, HBO Max and Prime Video.

One of the reasons I've spent recent years latching onto the analog horror trend on YouTube is how the genre uses liminal space to generate unease. Series like The Backrooms and The Mandela Catalogue thrive because of the unsettling atmospheres they occupy, and films like Skinamarink are so sparsely decorated that they let your imagination do most of the heavy lifting. The problem is that there aren't a ton of feature-length films that really use liminal space to its fullest potential. At least, that's what I thought before feasting my eyes on 1974's Messiah of Evil. 

I have to give credit where it's due, as I first heard about Messiah of Evil after running a YouTube search for “Liminal Horror.” That rabbit hole led me to a channel called Nightmare Movies, which sold me on streaming the film after breaking it down so succinctly.

If you're a fan of liminal horror and you've slept on Messiah of Evil like I had, it's in your best interest to check it out on Tubi. It's streaming there for free, and it will take you to a strange place in the uncanny valley that threatens to swallow you whole.

I'm only going to touch on the most basic plot elements that Messiah of Evil has to offer, because the story is only half the battle here. The main thread follows Arletty Lang (Marianna Hill), who travels to the small beach town of Point Dune in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged father, Joseph (Royal Dano). Joseph is a troubled artist who has lived in the town for years, but has become increasingly unstable as of late.

Arletty discovers letters from her father addressed to her that warn of a plague overtaking Point Dune. These writings also describe the increasingly vivid nightmares Joseph has been experiencing, which slowly bleed into something far more ominous.

During her stay, Arletty encounters Thom (Michael Greer) and his two companions, Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford). While talking at Thom's motel, they have a run-in with a local vagrant named Charlie, who warns them about an upcoming blood moon. According to Charlie, this event marks the 100-year anniversary of the appearance of an entity known as the Dark Stranger, which ties directly into Joseph's paranoid letters.

After Charlie ominously claims that her father is “one of them now,” Arletty's curiosity turns into alarm, pushing her to dig deeper into what's actually happening in Point Dune.

Messiah of Evil's surface-level horror comes from the zombie-like trance the residents of Point Dune fall into as the film escalates. People who appear perfectly normal are suddenly shown feasting on raw meat in grocery stores, only to snap into pursuit once they spot someone who hasn't turned. For me, the liminal spaces these moments take place in make Messiah of Evil genuinely horrifying.

I've always found empty versions of places that are meant to be crowded to be among the most unsettling settings imaginable, and Messiah of Evil fully commits to that idea. Gas stations, Ralphs grocery stores, movie theaters, and other familiar third places feel menacing specifically because of their emptiness as Arletty searches for answers about her father. Joseph's artwork lurking in the background makes you hypervigilant as a viewer, never quite sure whether those paintings are playing tricks on your eyes or watching you back.

There's a constant sense that something is wrong just outside the frame. Much of that dread forms in your own head rather than being spelled out for you. The imagery does the heavy lifting here, not the exposition, which is why the specifics of the plot in Messiah of Evil matter far less than its cinematography and overall delivery.

Messiah of Evil feels like that figure you think you see standing in your doorway as you drift off to sleep, when you're not entirely sure if it's a shadow on the wall or someone watching you. For nearly its entire runtime, the film sustains that feeling. The zombie attacks are just an added bonus.

GFR SCORE

Messiah of Evil, which is currently streaming for free on streaming services like, Tubi, PlutoTV, and Hoopla, is one of those movies that rewards multiple viewings. Watch it once for the general storyline, then revisit it purely for the liminal nightmare it occupies and thrives in.

Across 15 seasons, Supernatural wove a veritable tome of demonic lore. Knowing your Knights of Hell from the King of Hell became crucial to understanding Supernatural's demonic dangers, and each demon packed a different kind of punch. Even Hell itself didn't seem to quite understand the demon hierarchy at times, but the basic principles of the "bad place" and its residents remained largely the same.

A power angels and demons alike wielded was possession. Both species could only walk the mortal realm via a human body, and while demons would typically force their way into whichever unsuspecting victim they preferred, angels had a moral obligation to only possess willing individuals. Demons were also restricted from possessing anyone with specific markings, which was how Sam and Dean remained free from any unwelcome body guests.

One of Supernatural''s demon rules was seemingly broken after a single episode, but upon further examination, there was a logical reason it didn't last.

 The image of demonic possession fans will associate most with Supernatural is the cloud of black smoke forcing its way through the host's mouth. That wasn't how the trope began, however.

While Azazel was part of Supernatural lore from the earliest scenes, season 1 episode "Phantom Traveler" marked the first time a demon featured prominently. This was also the episode that introduced the idea of possession, as the plot revolves entirely around Sam and Dean tracking down a demon hiding inside a plane passenger.

Contradicting later lore, this episode established the notion that demons possess humans by flying in through their eyes. This idea never resurfaced again in Supernatural, and subsequent demonic characters would reliably take the oral route instead, creating the show tradition we all know and love.

In hindsight, it's easy to dismiss season 1's eye possession as a Supernatural plot hole. The inconsistency certainly could have come about due to Supernatural not yet having a firm foundation for its demon rule book in season 1, and the show's creative team changing its mind. Regardless of whether the eye/mouth switch was a retcon, however, the change can be easily explained by the show's lore.

The demon in "Phantom Traveler" was actually a special breed known as a disaster demon. One could argue that it makes no sense for a disaster demon to access a host through their eyes when even high-ranking hellions like Lilith are forced to go through the mouth like a commoner, but the distinction still works as a canon explanation for why we never see demons possess humans via the eyes again. This is the only disaster demon shown in Supernatural, leaving nothing to contradict the rules "Phantom Traveler" created.

The disaster demon excuse could also explain other differences between Supernatural's first demon and every other demon in the show - the grainy appearance of the black cloud, for example. Again, we can assume the Doylist explanation for this was the show changing how it visually presented demons, but the Watsonian explanation (that the disaster demon played by different possession rules) still holds water.

Jupiter's moon Europa may be less hospitable to life than scientists once hoped

Jupiter's moon Europa, long considered a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its vast subsurface ocean, may not be as habitable as once thought, according to new research. 

A study published in Nature Communications suggests that Europa's rocky seafloor is likely too mechanically strong to support the tectonic and volcanic activity crucial for generating life-sustaining nutrients and chemical energy.

On Earth, such geological processes facilitate interactions between rock and seawater, producing essential chemicals for microbial life. However, after modelling Europa's conditions, researchers concluded that its seafloor probably lacks these dynamic features.

The study considered factors including Europa's size, the makeup of its rocky core, and the immense gravitational forces exerted by Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet. Their evaluation, indicating little to no active faulting at the moon's seafloor, suggests this environment would be challenging for life.

"On Earth, tectonic activity such as fracturing and faulting exposes fresh rock to the environment where chemical reactions, principally involving water, generate chemicals such as methane that microbial life can use," explained planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis, the study's lead author. "Without such activity, those reactions are harder to establish and sustain, making Europa's seafloor a challenging environment for life."

Life may have emerged on Earth billions of years ago in the dynamic environment around seafloor hydrothermal vents, features that Europa may lack. "Based on our findings, the seafloor would probably not contain major tectonic landforms, such as long ridges or deep troughs. There would likely not be any underwater volcanoes or seamounts, and we would not have any hydrothermal activity such as black smokers. Having said that, I hope I will stand corrected one day," said University of Georgia geologist and study co-author Christian Klimczak.

Despite these new findings, Europa possesses several traits that have long fuelled hopes of habitability. Its subsurface ocean is believed to be 40-100 miles deep, potentially holding double the water present in Earth's oceans, beneath an icy shell 10-15 miles thick. It is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, with a diameter of roughly 1,940 miles.

"There are three major factors thought to be critical for supporting life: liquid water, organic chemistry and energy," Mr Byrne noted. "Europa's subsurface ocean satisfies the first requirement. We've identified organic chemicals on this moon's exterior icy shell, and there may very well be such chemicals inside the ocean. So that's the second requirement. And Europa's particular orbit means that Jupiter drives tidal heating within Europa – requirement three."

NASA's robotic Europa Clipper spacecraft, launched in 2024, is set to conduct dozens of close flybys starting in 2031, specifically to examine whether Europa has conditions suitable to support life, underscoring the continued scientific interest.

Jupiter's gravitational pull significantly influences its moons. Io, the innermost large moon, is the solar system's most volcanically active body due to intense tidal forces. However, Europa orbits much further from Jupiter. "The effect of this tidal heating drops off quickly with distance, so although there's enough tidal heating to keep Europa's ocean from freezing solid, according to our calculations at least there's not nearly enough to tectonically deform the ocean floor. So, in short, there probably isn't the kind of thing happening on Io taking place deep within Europa," Mr Byrne explained.

The study focused solely on Europa's current conditions. Mr Byrne suggested a nuanced possibility: "There are reasons to think that Europa might once have been much more geologically active than it is today, albeit a few billion years ago. So perhaps for a time that world really was just not habitable but actually inhabited, before those conditions changed and the chemical energy for life ran out." Despite these new insights, Mr Klimczak maintains that "Given what we know about Europa, it is still the best place to look for extraterrestrial life."

White House E.T. cover-up claims say George H.W. Bush confirmed aliens are here and known to insiders.

Jan. 6 2026, Published 7:00 a.m. ET

A bombshell new disclosure reveals former President George H.W. Bush learned that space aliens came face-to-face with U.S. military personnel at a New Mexico airbase more than 60 years ago, but kept mum about the mind-boggling meeting, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

The explosive revelation comes from Dr. Eric Davis, a top astrophysicist who worked for the Pentagon's since-disbanded Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). 

He insists, in the new documentary The Age of Disclosure, that the former president briefed him on the extraordinary 1964 alien encounter at Holloman Air Force Base.

Eric Davis said George H.W. Bush described a 1964 UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in 'The Age of Disclosure.'

Davis says the ex-commander-in-chief detailed to him in 2003 – 10 years after he'd left office – that three UFOs buzzed the base before one of them actually landed on the tarmac.

"A non-human entity deboarded the craft ... and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," Davis said Bush, who died in 2018 at the age of 94, told him.

But when Bush asked his aides for more details, he was curtly told "he did not have a need to know" and so kept it secret, said Davis.

Marco Rubio questioned assumptions about presidential access while discussing UFO secrecy in the documentary.

The bombshell revelation jibes with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told the film's producers, "There's this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say, 'All right, take me to Roswell [New Mexico], show me the alien bodies [that allegedly were pulled from a downed UFO there in 1947]. I want to see the video of the autopsy, I want to see the whole thing.'

"I think that really is a naive understanding of how our government works."

Sources say the doc reveals other astounding testimony that pulls back the curtain on a decades-old, secret government UFO retrieval outfit dubbed the "Legacy Program."

The program, Davis said, investigated an incident where several ETs were said to have been pulled from the wreckage of a large tic tac-shaped UFO in Russia in 1998.

Gary Nolan cited treating soldiers with severe injuries allegedly linked to encounters with an alien craft.

And Gary Nolan, an immunologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University's School of Medicine, told producers he once treated soldiers who had sustained "horrific" burns and "internal scarring" in their brains after allegedly encountering an alien craft.

Hal Puthoff, a quantum physicist and former AATIP member, says proof exists that more than one alien species have visited Earth.

"The bodies recovered are not all the same type," Puthoff said. "Whoever it is, they're here – and they've been operating here for a long time."

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has abandoned his 2026 reelection campaign. In his announcement Monday, Walz pointed to right-wing conspiracy theories about the state's Somali immigrant community as having played a part in his decision. It has been nine years since Pizzagate, and yet such conspiracy theories have gotten worse—and as they have further eroded many people's sense of shared political reality, combating them has only become harder.

Late in December, YouTuber Nick Shirley recorded himself going to several childcare centers in Minnesota, an attempt to “prove” that Somali immigrants have been using the centers to steal public money. When Shirley showed up, at least one childcare center did not open its door, one owner said, “because we thought it was ICE.” The resulting video was quickly rebutted and fact-checked: The state's Department of Children reported the childcare centers he descended upon were “operating as expected.” It didn't matter. By then, the video had millions of views, and the childcare center “fraud” narrative had become part of the right-wing cable news cycle of anti-immigrant grievance and cruelty. Workers at the childcare facilities Shirley targeted said they had received “hateful” and “threatening” messages. One day care center reported a break-in, and sensitive documents were found missing. 

The conspiracy theory was always thin, and never actually implicated Walz. Nevertheless, Walz found himself defending his administration's actions to stop fraud, and he cited the chaos caused by the video in his announcement abandoning his campaign on Monday. He called Shirley a “conspiracy theorist” and he accused Trump, accurately, of “demonizing our Somali neighbors.” But he was still leaving the race: “I can't give a political campaign my all,” said Walz. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”

It's all too easy to see the parallels to real-world chaos caused by Pizzagate, and the incident nine years ago that signaled to the public how right-wing conspiracy theories had become more serious and dangerous. Then, in 2016, a gunman entered a Washington, D.C. restaurant, convinced by Twitter conspiracy theorists like Jack Posobiec that he could save children who were being trafficked for sex in its basement by a ring they claimed was organized by and for Democrats. The restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, did not have a basement. No one was physically harmed. For most people, news of the gunman's arrest was their first exposure to such gruesome sex-trafficking conspiracy theories, which to that point were largely the province of marginal media figures feeding them to their growing online audiences.

It has often felt as if Pizzagate never ended. Long after it faded from public attention, Jack Posobiec now has the ear of the president—who, after the Shirley video, suspended childcare funding to the state of Minnesota. The conspiracy theories motivated Trump to take swift action. Trump himself, at the same time as the childcare center videos were circulating, was posting a video on his own social media about the Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman, promoting the conspiracy theory that Tim Walz had her assassinated. (The man indicted for Hortman's murder and currently awaiting trial also targeted other Democrats and abortion providers, and is reportedly a Trump supporter who considered himself to be engaged in spiritual warfare.) 

Politics now play out parallel to conspiracy theories, expressing them and promoting them. This has been building for nearly a decade, while attempts to counter them can barely keep up, and don't seem to stop them. Fact-checking responds to conspiracy theories as if they are isolated incidents that can be corrected, and not common and regular expressions of the political and media ecosystem in which we live. 

Over the last decade, each time such conspiracy theories take hold, break containment, and begin to widely circulate, a whole host of anti-misinformation experts, researchers documenting the far right, historians and journalists tracking the rise of Christian nationalism, fact-checkers and defenders of legacy media, and lobby groups for online and child safety attempt to respond. The idea that we can set the truth right is also appealing to those in the media, who, on our better days, believe facts are capable of making change in the world. 

It is increasingly common, however, for those who benefit from the rise of conspiracy-theory politics (influencers, content creators, and even elected officials and the mainstream of the Republican Party), to then target those misinformation experts and fact-checkers. In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol, it briefly looked like Republican members of Congress recognized the threats posed by conspiracy-theory politics: Their own lives were threatened by believers of election conspiracy theories promoted by the outgoing president. But since then, Republicans have mainstreamed the idea that they are under attack not from conspiracy theorists but from content moderators. They have made dismantling infrastructure for combating misinformation and disinformation a major part of their agenda. “Even before Donald Trump returned to the White House, the anti-anti-disinformation movement had chalked up a series of victories with a common set of tactics, combining independent media pressure, congressional scrutiny, and lawsuits that sometimes ran all the way up to the Supreme Court,” writes journalist James Ball in a recent story for The Verge, tracing the battle.

It should be a wake-up call: Misinformation and disinformation have potentially pushed a state governor out of seeking reelection, and appear to be on the cusp of taking away childcare from more than 20,000 children in Minnesota, thanks to the Trump administration halting federal funds over these fictions. Now the administration is reportedly planning to cancel funding for children and other social services to four additional Democrat-led states, premised on the same stories about immigrants stealing. These tales are perfectly suited to Trump's politics of grievance, defining a set of enemies who are always stealing what's rightfully the property and province of “real” Americans.

Misinformation and disinformation are how these people attain and build power. It's why they fight to protect communication and political channels in which to push lies, scapegoating, and propaganda. It's why you can't fact-check your way out of a conspiracy theory or disinformation. This was true in 2016, when Trump was a joke. It was true in 2020, when Trump was a loser. It's true now, with Trump in power again. There is still no coordinated response to misinformation that appears capable of confronting that truth: Lies are powerful. So long as there are people who can benefit from conspiracy theories, there will be people pushing them.

Paranormal Cirque isn't just a show—it's an experience. From the moment you approach the ominous circus tent, it's clear you're not walking into a traditional circus. The atmosphere immediately signals something darker, stranger, and more daring. Enter horror displays, vendors, and fun before you even enter the big top world. This is a fully immersive blend of circus arts, horror aesthetics, and dark comedy, designed to push boundaries and keep the audience slightly on edge from start to finish.



The show opens by setting a tone that's eerie yet playful, letting you know you're allowed to laugh just as much as you're allowed to feel uncomfortable. The production leans heavily into its horror theme with dramatic lighting, heavy music, and striking costumes, but it never feels cheap or reliant on jump scares. Instead, it builds tension through mood, character, and unpredictability.



The performers are the true stars. The level of talent on display is genuinely impressive—gravity-defying aerial acts, jaw-dropping contortion, feats of strength, and acrobatics that feel both dangerous and elegant. Several moments had the entire crowd holding their breath. What makes these acts even more effective is how seamlessly they're woven into the show's twisted narrative rather than feeling like isolated performances.



Adding to the experience are the clowns and host characters, who bring a perfect mix of menace and humor. Their interactions with the audience are unscripted enough to feel spontaneous, keeping everyone engaged and occasionally uncomfortable in a fun way. The comedy often catches you off guard, breaking the tension just long enough before the show pulls you right back into its dark world.

The pacing is tight, with very little downtime. There's always something happening—visually, emotionally, or musically—which keeps the energy high throughout. While some moments are intentionally provocative or shocking, they feel purposeful rather than gratuitous, aligning with the show's identity instead of distracting from it.

This is absolutely not a family-friendly circus and shouldn't be approached as one. Paranormal Cirque is geared toward adults who appreciate horror, edgy entertainment, and performances that challenge expectations. If you enjoy Halloween haunt vibes, alternative theater, or shows that aren't afraid to take risks, this is well worth your time.

Overall, Paranormal Cirque delivers a bold, memorable, and highly entertaining night. It's strange, thrilling, funny, and impressive in equal measure—and unlike anything else currently touring. You can check their tour dates at The Tour – Paranormal Cirque

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

"Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good."

An FBI investigation into an alleged terror plot in Southern California bears the familiar hallmarks of the bureau's long-running use of informants and undercover agents to advance plots that might not otherwise have materialized. The limited details available suggest an investigation that leaned heavily on a paid informant and at least one undercover FBI agent [who] were involved in nearly every stage of the case, including discussions of operational security and transporting members of the group to the site in the Mojave Desert where federal agents ultimately made the arrests. It is still unclear how the FBI first identified the group or how long the informant had been embedded before the bomb plot emerged — a period defense attorneys say is central to any serious examination of entrapment, whereby defendants are coerced into crimes they would not otherwise commit, a frequent criticism of stings involving paid informants and undercover agents. Despite comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Patel, and others characterizing the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a coherent group ... there's little evidence that any group by that name exists beyond a small digital footprint and a handful of attempts at organizing community events, including a self-defense workshop and a punk rock benefit show. A previous sting operation [involved] the so-called Newburgh Four, in which an aggressive and prolific FBI informant steered four poor Black men into a scheme to bomb synagogues and attack an Air Force base. Years later, a federal judge granted the men compassionate release, describing the case as an “FBI-orchestrated conspiracy.”


Note: The FBI has had a notorious history of manufacturing terrorist plots, often targeting vulnerable minors who have significant cognitive and intellectual disabilities yet no history of harming anyone. Read more about terrorism plots hatched by the US government, including cases in which alleged terrorists were acting on behalf of the CIA. This process not only pads arrest and prosecution statistics but also helps justify big budgets by misrepresenting the threat of terrorism.

Why Evolution Is True

Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats.

A person I know has, for the past year or more, been trying to convince me that Earth has been visited by UFOs, and that, indeed, some of those spacecraft have been captured along with the bodies of the piloting extraterrestrials. Her claim is that the bodies and the spaceships (presumably crashed) have been given to private companies by the government, and the craft are being reverse-engineered to suss out the technology behind the “UFOs”.  Further, the bodies of the pilots (bipedal like us, I'm told) are being examined to see what kind of life they represent.  As to why this is all being kept secret, I'm informed that there are important security considerations. But I'm not told which considerations are important enough to keep this  huge story secret.

I have read a lot of the information sent to me supposedly supporting this claim, and ultimately it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others who supposedly have seen the extraterrestrials and their craft. It's instructive to look up Grusch on Wikipedia, where you read stuff like this:

David Grusch is a former United States Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official who has claimed that the U.S. federal government, in collaboration with private aerospace companies, has highly secretive special access programs involved in the recovery and reverse engineering of “non-human” spacecraft and their dead pilots, and that people have been threatened and killed in order to conceal these programs. Grusch further claims to have viewed documents reporting a spacecraft of alien origin had been recovered by Benito Mussolini's government in 1933 and procured by the U.S. in 1944 or 1945 with the assistance of the Vatican and the Five Eyes alliance.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have both denied Grusch's claims, stating there are no such programs and that extraterrestrial life has yet to be discovered. No evidence supporting Grusch's UFO claims has been presented and they have been dismissed by multiple, independent experts.

Grusch also appears in an infamous 2½-hour hearing by the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs on “Unidentified and Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs”. I've put it below. The hearing starts at 18:00, several True Believers gives testimony, and Grusch first appears at 46:45 and also later (I have not listened to the whole thing today). Note that AOC is on the subcommittee.

More from Wikipedia, including about this hearing:

On June 5, 2023, independent journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal provided a story detailing Grusch's claims of a UFO coverup by the government to The Debrief, a website that describes itself as “self-funded” and specializing in “frontier science”.  The New York Times and Politico declined to publish the story, while The Washington Post was taking more time to conduct fact-checking than Kean and Blumenthal felt could be afforded because, according to Kean, “people on the internet were spreading stories, Dave was getting harassing phone calls, and we felt the only way to protect him was to get the story out”.According to Kean, she vetted Grusch by interviewing Karl Nell, a retired Army colonel who was also on the UFO task force, and “Jonathan Grey” (a pseudonym) whom Kean described as “a current U.S. intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC)”. Kean wrote that Nell called Grusch “beyond reproach” and that both Nell and “Grey” supported Grusch's claim about a secret UFO retrieval and reverse engineering program.

Grusch claims that the U.S. federal government maintains a highly secretive UFO retrieval program and possesses multiple spacecraft of what he calls “non-human” origin as well as corpses of deceased pilots. He also claims there is “substantive evidence that white-collar crime” took place to conceal UFO programs and that he had interviewed officials who said that people had been killed to conceal the programs.

Grusch elaborated on his claims in a subsequent interview with the French newspaper Le Parisien on June 7. He said that UFOs could be coming from extra dimensions; that he had spoken with intelligence officials whom the U.S. military had briefed on “football-field” sized crafts; that the U.S. government transferred some crashed UFOs to a defense contractor; and that there was “malevolent activity” by UFOs.

During a July 26, 2023, Congressional hearing, Grusch said that he “was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program to which I was denied access”and that he believed that the U.S. government was in possession of UAP based on his interviews with 40 witnesses over four years. He claimed in response to Congressional questions that the U.S. has retrieved what he terms “non-human ‘biologics'” from the crafts and that this “was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the [UAP] program I talked to, that are currently still on the program”.  When Representative Tim Burchett asked him if he had “personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal” the government's possession of “extraterrestrial technology”, Grusch said yes, but that he was not able to provide details except within a SCIF (Sensitive compartmented information facility).

So it's not just the government that knows this stuff, but private companies, who apparently retain for study the craft and jars of pickled aliens, or “biologics.” (It may be relevant that Grusch has a history of mental disorders, for which he's been committed twice to institutions.)  At any rate, you can see above that not just Grusch, but also two other people who have had respectable military or government jobs, testify to the credibility of extraterrestrial craft.

The hearing itself, with all three witnesses swearing to tell the truth, has been presented to me as giving credibility of the witnesses' stories. To me all that means is that three people believe in UFOs and extraterrestrials, and yet fail to present convincing evidence. I have no objections to a hearing, because if there were credible evidence of this stuff, the government would like to know about it. So would the rest of us, especially biologists and physicists.

Both the government and other experts who aren't True Believers have heard the verbal evidence, but for some reason material evidence never surfaces. I'll revert to Wikipedia for the last time:

Grusch's assertions are primarily based on alleged documents and his claimed conversations, rather than testable evidence. Claims that the government is engaged in a conspiratorial effort to conceal evidence of extraterrestrial visitation to Earth are broadly considered untrue by the majority of the scientific community, because such claims oppose the best currently available expert information.

Joshua Semeter of NASA's UAP independent study team and professor of electrical and computer engineering with Boston University's College of Engineering concludes that “without data or material evidence, we are at an impasse on evaluating these claims” and that, “in the long history of claims of extraterrestrial visitors, it is this level of specificity that always seems to be missing”.  Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, published a critique of the Grusch claims on June 22 with Big Think. Frank writes that he does “not find these claims exciting at all” because they are all “just hearsay” where “a guy says he knows a guy who knows another guy who heard from a guy that the government has alien spaceships”.   [JAC: that's an apt critique of the claims.] Frank also said of the Grusch account that “it's an extraordinary claim, and it requires extraordinary evidence, none of which we're getting”, adding “show me the spaceship”.

Where is the damn spaceship? Where are the bodies of the extraterrestrial pilots?

You can go down the rabbit hole of these claims for days, but all I'll say is I will remain skeptical until genuine evidence comes to light—and by that I mean production of the “biologics” and their craft.  The failure of proponents to provide such evidence, which is always “kept elsewhere” and is “a secret matter of national security importance”, make me think that what we have here is true conspiracy theory. Again, reporters and skeptics should look at this evidence, but they've always come up with bupkes.

When I asked my friend why the greatest news story in the history of humanity has not been broken by mainstream news, I get answers involving extreme secrecy. But give me a break: there existed pickled aliens and spacecraft remains, and none of it has been verified by mainstream news outlets, not in decades? Smells like Pizzagate to me!

Finally, when I'm told that the very testimony of people with decent credentials proves that they're correct, I respond with this: “Well, there are lots of people with decent credentials who said they have had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.” Plenty of Americans believe in the literal truth of the divine-Jesus story and have had Jesus Encounter Experiences, despite the lack of evidence—even historical, extra-Biblical evidence for a divine, crucified-and-resurrected Son of God.  These people far outnumber True Believers in UFOs. Should we then take their testimony about Jesus seriously?

I haven't followed this controversy closely, and perhaps readers, or people like Michael Shermer, have something to say about it. But until I see those pickled aliens, I think it's more parsimonious to think that their existence is about as likely as that of the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot.

I believe they're supposed to look something like the picture below. If so, it would be a remarkable example of convergent evolution following two independent origins of life on two different planets.

Yeah, they've been making these claims for decades. When i was a child i was fascinated by the possibility. But it's all bullshit. Seventy years of these claims and all we get are blurry photos and unconvincing stories. Every day there are more than a million take off and landings, every one of those planes carrying people with cameras. UFOs flying around? Bullshit. I dont think so.

Conspiracies can work if only a handful of people are involved. But this is a secret kept by thousands over decades? Not a chance. Put up or shut up.

I was at a skeptic convention talk given by a man (military?) who had extensively interviewed many of the scientists and technicians at NASA who would have had to have been involved in anything extraterrestrial, study or coverup. It was his considered opinion than these folks couldn't keep their mouths shut if their lives depended on it; like most nerdy aficionados, get on their pet topic and they'd happily go on and on and on. They, and other experts like them, were the last people to keep a secret and sit tight lipped on a huge scientific discovery for years. Maybe a week, tops.

Sounds likely.

. . . it all comes down to the assertions of one David Grusch, who relies on documents he can't show people and hearsay that he can't reveal given by others. . . .

Shades of John Smith. What is it Hitchens said, That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence? I assume that the True Believers are saying that the aliens will usher in the Age of Aquarius or some such Millenarian dream?

I think a light beam elevator into a flying saucer, where you will meet Ben Dover, and Probe-ably a case of amnesia afterwards.

In the 90s, there was an adult film actor named Ben Dover.

Now, his daughter has become an adult film actor. Her name is Eileen Dover.

They were both from Uranus, apparently.

Do believers explain how a culture with the technology to travel the distances required to reach Earth always crash or are taken hostage by Earthlings, with our far more primitive technologies? Or how how hundreds of people over the span of 80 years have all agreed to keep mum about extraterrestrials? Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague. I know the call for students to be taught “critical thinking ” sounds tiresome by now, but any educated person ought to be able to ask rational questions and dismiss this type of belief.

“Given their similarities to humanoids, we are lucky they have not introduced something equivalent to smallpox or plague.”
Right, and. it's all nonsense and crank stuff but never underestimate the  Credentialed Brave Independent Thinkers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_from_Space
Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have this covered.

I shoulda known…

No, they don't.  Because these thoughts do not occur to them.  And when these inconsistencies are pointed out, they either do not comprehend them, or ignore them out of some great emotional need for this story to be true.

It's very similar to the ridiculous “aliens built the Pyramids” claims.  Ok, so apparently aliens advanced enough to master interstellar travel visited ancient Egyptians, who just knew simple metallurgy and could quarry and construct basic stone structures.  So these aliens decided to give them a boost…by showing them more sophisticated ways of building stone structures.  No evidence of advanced metals, no alterative sources of power…nothing.

You can only imagine the disappointment of these Egyptians, enviously watching these aliens with their seemingly god-like technology.  The day comes that these aliens announce that they will share their secrets with humanity!  Will we now be able to fly like a bird, or instantly communicate with others very far away, or cure any wound, or any number of these incomprehensible abilities that they possess?

Aliens: “My dudes, today is your big day.”

Egyptians: “Oh we can't wait!!! What secrets will you share with us!?

Aliens:  “They are…slightly more advanced ways of building stone structures!  See how you can only make a pyramid about 100 cubits high.  Well, we'll help you increase that to 150!  And, with a bit more precision on the stone blocks…let's get those tolerances down. You'll still have to use your primitive tools and your own muscle power or those of your beasts to move them about, mind you.”

I don't know if believers in these types of conspiracies (i.e. ones that are not only very improbable, but internally inconsistent) suffer from deficits in basic thinking power, have psychological quirks that make them vulnerable to ideas of this type, or some combination of the two.

Very well put!

Very much like XKCD fore-told:
https://xkcd.com/2477/

Aliens built the Easter Island statues: I've seen that one, too.

Part of that claim used to rest on the breathless assertion that, like the Tycho Monolith in 2001, no trace of quarrying on Easter Island had ever been found.  (I think that was a claim from Chariots of the Gods.)  But in fact the stone beds the moai and the different coloured stone top knots were cut from are well known archeological sites, down to the stone tools the workers left behind when they knocked off shift for the last time.  Some of the quarries contain partially worked moai.  The volcanic tuff isn't all that hard to work.  Google even shows a reconstruction of how the moai could be “walked” vertically to their display sites without having to crane them from horizontal to vertical.

But of course I've never been to Easter Island to see for myself and the above is what “They” would want me to believe, isn't it….
[Cue Twilight Zone music.]

I've always wondered about the sci-fi scenario of alien microbes causing a plague.  It is probably true that our immune systems would be helpless to attack an alien microbe, but wouldn't the alien microbes be equally unable to exploit our alien biochemistry?  Terrestrial microbes that infect us have coevolved with us for hundreds of millions of years.  But it seems to me that if a truly alien microbe entered my body it would simply perish for lack of sustenance.  Wouldn't my proteins be useless or perhaps poisonous to it?  Not that I would volunteer to test this theory on myself.

I'm at my comment limit for the thread but just wanted to follow on to this…as yes I've always wondered this myself.  Also, it seems that at least one author understood that concept at least partially..in H.G. Wells “War of the Worlds”, the aliens successfully invade us but then are thwarted by our microbes, which we are resistant to (because of co-evolution as you point out) but they are not.  But then…wouldn't these advanced aliens have known this would be a problem to begin with???  It's basic biology man.

That to me demonstrates how hard it is to write science fiction, especially involving future technologies.

The Andromeda Strain
Michael Crichton
(Late 70s?)

Book and movie each one of my absolute favorites!

The book is so great because it has realistic data output from – IIRC – protein sequencing, X-ray crystallography/scattering, etc….

Chrichton was a clever man and wrote intriguing books. He was also very tall – 6'9″ (206 cm)!

It's intriguing, what captures peoples' attention. But that drawing can't be right. There are no antennae on the head. A more accurate rendition is, I think, In the Dick Tracey comics where the moon people show up, at least so far as I can glean from the Comics Curmudgeon website.

I'm impressed that they can walk around with those gigantic heads without toppling over. Carl Sagan thought that they looked like fetuses.

As Bryan points out in Comment 11 below, there is a religious element in how many people view aliens. People assume that if aliens come here, they will be wise, all-powerful beings who want to help us. Consider the movie “E.T.” : A being comes from the sky, performs miracles, dies, rises from the dead, tells his followers to be good, and then ascends into the sky. The poster for E.T. even alluded to Michelangelo's “Creation of Man,” with E.T.'s finger replacing God's.

“Starman” features Jeff Bridges as another alien who can perform miracles. He impregnates a human woman and tells her that she will give birth to a son who will be a great teacher; she protests that she is infertile, but he assures her that the seemingly impossible conception is true, and he then ascends to the heavens.

In “Cocoon,” aliens heal (restore vitality to) a group of senior citizens and end up taking them to a place where “they won't ever get sick, they won't get any older and they won't ever die.” When my mother saw this on TV, she said “People don't believe in Heaven any more, so they make movie9s like this.” I don't think she was wrong.

I wonder if science fiction in non-western cultures (one where Hinduism, say, is the dominant religion) is influenced by the religion in that culture?

As for how aliens can travel the necessary distances, Shirley MacLaine explained it to Johnny Carson on an episode of The Tonight Show: Thought can travel faster than light, and the fastest thought is love.  The starships are powered by thought, specifically love. I know Carson was a skeptic, and I imagine it took self-control to keep a straight face.

My first boyfriend, who had been brought up in a strict Ukrainian Orthodox family, was a fervent believer in UFOs and alien visitors. He thought the aliens were here to teach us and would give us the secrets of everlasting life. It always seemed to me that he had shed his religious upbringing but needed a “science-y” substitute.

Traversing the cosmos solely via the power of love was the theme of the finale of the big budget movie Interstellar, as I recall. Incredibly dumb. I groaned at the time.

Johnny Carson even attempting to keep a straight face would have caused great mirth in the studio audience.  They would have had to cut to a commercial.

Michael Shermer and Skeptic is the best for everything UFO.

I thought UFO stuff was a fad or pure entertsinment through the 70s, 80s, .. X-files… I thought Neil DeGrasse Tyson put the nail in the coffin.

But it is dawning on me that … IMHO … UFO stuff is a modern pseudoscientific version of ancient Gnostic cult thought, perhaps driven by certain incentives.

IOW human nature and its ‘bugs' have not changed in centuries.. millennia…. perhaps categorized as psychological aberration, but at root a consequence of human nature… ?

“wadda ya gonna do”…

Yep, Michael does a good demolition job of this nonsense here :

https://www.skeptic.com/article/the-aliens-are-here-again-a-review-of-the-age-of-disclosure/

The saying “Three may keep a secret, if two are dead” springs to mind. It's a conspiracy theory, like the covid lab leak, but far less plausible.

“Her claim is that the bodies and the spaceships (presumably crashed) have been given to private companies by the government, and the craft are being reverse-engineered to suss out the technology behind the “UFOs”.”

So possibly hundreds, even thousands, of individuals are walking around with this information, and no one is leaking credible clues or documenting this in a way that would be convincing to a skeptic?  Information that would be the most incredible discovery in human history has been given to members of PRIVATE organizations, and somehow not one person is coming forward?

The probability of this is close to zero.  I truly think that people who believe in conspiracies of this type have either a general intelligence deficit, or some psychological trait that renders them very bad at assessing probability from basic facts and premises.  A form of innumeracy, in fact.

I wonder if studies have been done on the cognitive capabilities of hard-core conspiracy theorists.

KNox's Conspiracy Conjecture: For every vast conspiracy X there is a strictly vaster conspiracy Y in which X is an intentional misdirection.

(The infinite ascending chain aspect of this is admittedly a difficulty, but there are workarounds.)

Examples:
● Big Tinfoil (Y) covertly fosters many conspiracies (X), some of them patently ridiculous, so that sales will increase.
● The Aliens (Y) covertly founded Big Tinfoil (X) so that the first wave of the invasion (a.k.a. the Greatest Replacement Ever) can more easily neutralise those few Insightful humans who know The Truth, by means of remote detection and detonation of tinfoil hats.
● The Aliens (Y) also either covertly influence (via mind control) or bribe or threaten some humans to make sarcastic comments about all conspiracies (X) so that the Insightful will be ridiculed, ignored, and generally reduced as a threat.  (The Aliens are not barbarians — they kill only when other methods fail.)

Prove me wrong.

The universe has a great many stars. The idea that intelligent life has only existed on just one doesn't seem very likely. The notion that aliens might visit our planet does not seem completely farfetched. I am not trying to attach credibility to any specific claim. Almost all UFO claims are complete BS. However, ‘almost all' is not ‘all'.

I'm not a scientist. Nor any kind of statistician. However, I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that in this case, ‘almost all' is all.
On the other hand, I have never been to Area 51.

Many stars indeed.  But we don't know the probability of life occurring. It may be vanishingly small.  And even if simple life is prevalent, there are many other improbable steps after that to get to a space-faring species.  And…there is a timing issue.  Perhaps an intelligent species did pass by, but it was 50 million years ago.

If technologically advanced species arise and fall at different times, and the distances between them are vast and the speed of light represents a genuine speed limit, then the chances of interactions are almost zero.

I agree but the problem is we don't know how likely intelligent life is to arise (we have a data sample N=1). And even if life did arise, the likelihood is that the distance from us would make communication, let alone visitation, virtually impossible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox

One assumption behind the Fermi paradox is this:

“If Earth-like planets are typical, then some may have developed intelligent life long ago.”

But we don't have the slightest idea how likely it is for an Earth-like planet to produce intelligent life. Fermi was having some fun but calling it a “paradox” is a big stretch.

“what we have here is true conspiracy theory”

Is that an oxymoron?

Naah. Of course I meant “classic conspiracy theory”

I can understand that a few people might sincerely believe this stuff for their own reasons. But I find more disturbing the fact that reporters, Congress, and other serious folks give these claims credence despite so little evidence supporting them and so a low probability of them being true.

It seems to me there is a serious hole in our education system; we have produced a crop of leaders who are not very good at weighing evidence or at even understanding what constitutes evidence. Some of JFK, Jr.'s beliefs regarding the dangers of vaccines come to mind. Maybe it has always been this way.

A parallel to religion just occurred to me, the way aliens in UFO conspiracies always look like humans – this is the inverse of Imago Dei (man created in the image of god) / but instead, human creation of aliens in their own image – “man” as god creating alien .. which themselves could be god of “man” … the Gnostic Ouroboros with Aliens ad infinitum…

Starry Messengers used to be angels, now they are Greys.

“I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise,
We climbed aboard their starship, and headed for the skies!”

. . . but much to my surprise . . .

An excellent song reference, Come Sail Away by Styx. When he wasn't home I'd sneak into my older brother's room and listen to this album (Grand Illusion) on his audiophile headphones, close my eyes and be transported to another world.

Thanks for the correction; I was just going from memory.

To me, it's the most perfectly secular couplet in the entire rock ‘n roll canon.

This is why I can't take these claims seriously. If aliens exist they would be fundamentally different from us in their body plan and maybe even in their biology.

Projection is what I think this all is … from opposite directions:

As seen in The Office meme :

• “Corporate wants you to tell us the difference between these two pictures”
• picture: | Imago Dei | Greys |
• “It's the same picture“

The lack of material evidence leaves me uncommitted. The nature of what is being claimed leaves me skeptical. I do not, however, dismiss the idea that government programs can be kept secret for decades—they can, they have, they do—though this is far more common for inactive programs. Anyone who has worked in or around such a program knows that to reveal convincing details would only make you a criminal, while anything short of that could make you look like a kook.

If you ever want to get caught up in the details, one of the best websites is Metabunk:

https://www.metabunk.org/home/

It was originally started by Mick West, but it's grown a decently large community that looks into a lot of specific claims of various UFO/UAP sightings. If you remember the trio of Pentagon released videos that made a splash a few years ago, they've got pretty good explanations of what all of those videos probably were in reality (spoiler: not alien spacecraft).

To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin from Poor Richard's Almanack, the only way three people can keep a secret “is if two of them are dead.”  A similar calculus would seem to apply to numbers greater than three.

My life experiences over my 72 years would support this.

Another relevant observation about human nature is that it's no fun to have a secret unless you let someone else know you're keeping it.

How many of Robert Park's signs of bogus science (reprinted at https://quackwatch.org/related/signs/) can we detect here?
1. Pitches claim directly to media;
2. Suppression by establishment;
3. Effect at limits of detection;
4. Anecdotal evidence;
5. Appeal to acceptance in popular culture (or history);
6. Discoverer is “independent” of colleagues, associations, agencies, etc.;
7. Needs new laws of Nature to support claim.

I count at least 5 on a quick review of his claims!

Outstanding article; thanks!

Robert Park is also the author of the excellent book Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud, which is the book for people who have already read Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark and want more of the same.

All of this requires faster than light travel, which remains theoretical. People don't pay enough attention to Douglas Adams: Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.

Yes, it would require something like “warp speed.” The probability that members of another civilization have visited Earth is practically zero. How can anyone believe this?

Not theoretical – completely speculative science fiction.  There is no evidence of worm holes, folded space to game the speed of light for faster interstellar travel, or “warp fields”.  It takes infinite energy to accelerate matter to the speed of light.  If black holes rending suns apart and spitting matter out of its poles in jets of particles cannot exceed the speed of light nor gravitational waves from cosmic collisions, then nothing at human scale building contraptions is going to.  Interstellar travel is a fiction stemming from human wishful thinking and my knowledge of physics strongly suggests that no creature will be capable of it.  Maybe robotic missions within a few lighyears of a home planet over hundreds or thousands of years but for us humans, ask yourself – how many fascinating ET creatures live not within the Milky Way galaxy but within 200 light years of Earth TO visit?  I'll wager zero.  We ain't abducting them, they ain't abducting us.

The “relying on documents he has but can't share” reminds me strongly of the Mormon Golden Tablets that Joseph Smith claimed to have but could never share.

Why can't he share the documents — was this clear to Jerry or his friend?

This is a timely post as we are just leaving the Santa Claus season and won't get to Easter Bunny time for a while.

Perhaps I should say that I am skeptical for the sake of bend-over-backwards formality, but the claims are so incredibly bogus to me that I am more in the camp of people who say this definitely is pure fantasy. Akin to the chances of there being unicorns and angels.
1. One is asking for 1000's of people, over generations, to keep an explosive secret. This won't happen. Threats and even assassinations won't be enough. And why even try to keep it secret? There is no reason to keep this secret totally secret. Why not say “yes, we have 'em. But we are keeping details secret”.
2. I don't think that interstellar space travel is even possible for organic beings. I doubt. there is a propulsion system, even in the range of nearby sci-fi fantasy, that can move such a mass at the required speeds for this to work. To say nothing of the ripplingly intense radiation that would be experienced, the relative energy of which only increases with speed.
3. Also, such a civilization would have to be well within ~ a 100 light years from us for them to detect our transmissions and to even know to pay a visit. And yet beyond 100 light years for us to not be in range to detect their transmissions.
4. Individuals with respectable military or government jobs might have a bachelor's degree. And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves.

“And technical training to be a military pilot absolutely does not mean they have high order critical thinking skills and above average abilities to not fool themselves.”

True, but I can't help thinking: Like all those people with post-graduate degrees who believe boys can be girls, and girls can be boys; think it unevidenced that men have a general advantage in most athletic competitions; believe that they had a 25%+ chance of dying if infected with COVID; thought that tales of Biden's demise were conspiracy theory; and found Kamala the fount of joy and competence? We could go on with the follies all day long.

Is that the type of high-order thinking from our “best and brightest” that you had in mind?! If only education were the antidote to bias and self-deception that you seem to believe it to be.

As an aside, all officers today will have bachelor's degrees and most will have master's degrees within ten years of commissioning (though of highly varying quality). Moreover, pilot trainees are drawn disproportionately from the top performers at the Academy and among ROTC distinguished graduates (top 10%); the average will have a STEM degree, and SAT scores well above 1400 (old scale or new) are commonplace. Elite? Some of them. Stupid? Few of them. But as I suggested, intelligence and education are overrated safeguards against folly and self-deception.

See Michael Shermer's book Why People Believe Weird Things, especially chapter 18, “Why Smart People Believe Weird Things”.

“From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.”

Richard Feynman

Gotta say I absolutely adore the claim that aliens could have got here using “different dimensions”. Unfalsifiable and also wicked cool.

My father was a USAF officer with sufficient rank to know pretty much all the secrets.
When I was a teenager, I asked him about aliens and whether we had encountered them.

He told me that if we had, the information would be highly classified, and he could not share it with anyone.

However, he pointed out “I do not believe in UFOs”.

If I were an alien in charge of investigating Earth I'd make sure that each UFO I sent out carried a demolition charge that could be triggered remotely in the event of a crash. Expressly to prevent bodies of the crew and advanced technology falling into the hands of the primitives.

If not, why not?

Recruitment barrier, I should think.

Also, the signal from home base to trigger the destruction would take hundreds of years to reach the detonator.  By that time the primitive earthlings would have figured out how the damn thing worked….and how to disarm the fuse.

One alien to another: “let's crash land on that little blue dot”

Skeptical homo: yeah alien! you have the technology and can traverse over light years, but when you have a problem you can't fix it because Dozo down in the engine room left the spare part at home?.

Kurt Vonnegut's brilliant Sirens of Titan explains the purpose of all of human history: our whole history was guided to produce a spare part for a broken alien spaceship.

This conspiracy thinking is analogous to religion. Perhaps they should start their own church. Claims that are not falsifiable. Influenced by cultural memes of the times (sci-fi books, movies, etc). A desire to believe in something amazing.

The odds of us seeing or interacting with an alien species are so low that it is not much different than believing in a god. Humans don't have the capacity to grasp the infinite vastness of time and space. There could very well be other life in the universe but the chances of us crossing paths with it are astronomically low.

Space aliens are the modern day version of angels. They watch over us stealthily, highly concerned with our welfare, and visit a privileged few only under mysterious circumstances. If they leave a message, it's usually a warning about something we're worried about – pollution and nuclear war being favorites.
