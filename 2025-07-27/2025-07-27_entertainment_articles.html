                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and lucky fans to unveil her tracklist. Sabrina Carpenter has taken the notion of “man's best friend” quite literally in the weeks leading up to her seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend. Set for release on Aug. 29 via Island Records, the LP's rollout has been anything but ordinary: Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and a pair of lucky fans to unveil her tracklist, two songs at a time, in a series of Instagram and Twitter posts that combined star power with canine cuteness. About a month after announcing the album, Carpenter began the tracklist reveal on July 23 by introducing track 12, “Goodbye,” alongside a photo of fan Mariah cradling the puppy in her arms. In her caption she wrote, “track #12 is ‘Goodbye' but mariah is helping us say hello to our tracklist reveal.” Two days later, Carpenter returned to the pup brigade to share track 11 — “House Tour” — featuring fan Neriah in a similar snapshot, captioned “neriah & a golden = home sweet home. !”) and urging fellow fans to rally: “Track 11 stans rise.” Beyond the puppy reveals, Carpenter has maintained momentum for Man's Best Friend by leaning into playful fan interaction and capitalizing on her comedic timing — qualities that have earned her more than 5 million Instagram followers and built genuine community around her music. The forthcoming album follows 2024's Short n' Sweet and arrives amid Carpenter's latest lead single, “Manchild,” released on June 5. Man's Best Friend will drop almost exactly a year after Carpenter released breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which spent four weeks at No. So far, fans have gotten to hear only one song from the new record — “Manchild,” which dropped in June and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking Carpenter's second-ever No. In keeping with the album's canine theme, Man's Best Friend is available to preorder in multiple formats, including a Jacob Rochester–painted picture disc that depicts Carpenter in a surreal tableau beside a suited figure.

It was only a matter of time until Jay Leno had something to say — although, whether he said anything actually in response to the dust up at “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” is a little less clear. In an interview posted last week by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, taped two weeks ago, Leno took the current slate of late night hosts to task. “I got hate letters [when hosting ‘The Tonight Show'] saying, ‘You and your Republican friends,' and another saying, ‘I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,” Leno related (via THR). Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.” Related Stories A Casting Director Asked Steve Buscemi ‘What Is Wrong with You?' in Massive Audition Fail ‘And Just Like That' Writers Address the Twice-Dead Dad Controversy — but Continuity Errors Aren't New Leno continued to explain how, in his day, friends didn't talk about their political positions — even those in the comedic realm. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other,” he said. If Leno still stands by this opinion two weeks later, it would put him on a lonely late night island. Virtually every other figure in the mainstream — from Jimmy Fallon to Jimmy Kimmel to Jon Stewart to previous “Late Show” host David Letterman — have expressed support for Colbert and lambasted the series' parent company. “What the fuck is Skydance, honest to Christ? I only wish this could happen to me… Fighting with network television management was number one in the playbook.” But Leno maintains a diverting approach — even in these unusual Trumpian times — from the style adopted by Colbert. “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? I like to bring people into the big picture. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. Last year on “The Talk,” Leno said something similar, but seemed to indicate that his style didn't work in the present era. “Now you kind of have to take a side,” he said (via THR). I was not a fan [of Trump], but that's OK. Let's all get together, thank you very much.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vanessa Kirby, much to her surprise, had no trouble committing to the sprawling MCU as she was cast in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, where she portrays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in Marvel Studios‘ official launch of Phase Six. 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' Blasts Off With $218M Global Bow; Milestones Aplenty For 'Jurassic', 'Superman', 'F1' & 'Dragon' - International Box Office 'Fantastic Four: First Steps' Lighter At $118M, But Still Super In Opening - Box Office Update For the role, Kirby did not audition, first meeting with helmer Matt Shakman over lunch and later on top brass Kevin Feige. “With this, I actually didn't have that, and I'm surprised to say that,” the Pieces of a Woman star explained. She becomes Malice, this really dark version of herself for quite a long time, and then she renames herself Invisible Woman having been called Invisible Girl and she goes off with Psycho-Man, like her history is incredible, so I felt like there's so much there to even [explore] psychologically. I mean, she has a stillborn, and people don't know that. More importantly, Kirby said she felt confident continuing her collaboration with the superhero studio alongside her fellow First Steps co-stars Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach: “I knew I wouldn't be without these three actors, and these three actors have genuinely become family, and I admired them so much, and I knew that we're a four and the four in the comics are never separated, so I assumed that we'd be together, and that really helped 'cause then you're not a lone ranger going to new, daunting environments.” It's been a complete privilege,” she said of filming, which she is doing while pregnant, adding that it's the “coolest” experience. Though plot details are currently tightly under wraps, audiences can expect the tentpole to center on supervillain and Fantastic Four arch nemesis Dr. Doom (Robert Downey Jr.). “[The Russo Brothers] describe it like they're making a recipe of different ingredients, and it's unbelievable that these Avengers movies work in such a beautiful way,” Kirby said. “You look at Infinity War and you've got all these different energies but somehow they all fuse together, and I remember them saying the first one they had no idea if any of them would go together, and it just works. It's quite exciting to be a part of something and go, ‘OK, this is my flavor, I don't know.' Lauding Downey Jr.'s leadership onscreen, Kirby said: “He's the most incredible human being, soulful, deep, kind — he's been an amazing leader to us considering we're the newbies, and a lot of the others have known this world for a really long time, and he's been a phenomenal leader, and also he's just doing the most amazing work.” In addition to the quartet from First Steps and Downey Jr., confirmed cast members include Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Letitia Wright, Florence Pugh, Simu Liu, Tom Hiddleston, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Danny Ramirez, Hannah John-Kamen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Channing Tatum, Tenoch Huerta Mejía and Lewis Pullman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lehrer, the influential song satirist whose darkly comic lyrics gained a cult following decades after he stopped making music, has died at the age of 97. Lehrer died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his longtime friend David Herder told the Associated Press. While Lehrer only recorded about three-dozen songs during his musical lifetime — he refocused on teaching mathematics in the Seventies — his work had an enormous impact on future generations, inspiring songwriters like Randy Newman, Steely Dan's Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, and “Weird Al” Yankovic, who heard Lehrer's songs frequently on Dr. Demento's radio show. “I used to sing that song in college at coffeehouses,” Yankovic said of “The Elements” and Radcliffe's performance. “Singing that song is an extremely nerdy thing to do.

Giving a platform to anonymous speculation is not only careless, it's harmful.” She ended the post with a single inspirational word: “Onward.” The message comes as gossip headlines about “Die Hard” actor Bruce Willis continue to circulate. Since his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in 2023, tabloids and entertainment sites have regularly published stories citing unnamed insiders, often without confirmation from the family. Heming Willis has now made it clear where she stands on that kind of reporting. This is not the first time Heming Willis has spoken out. Over the past year, she has used her platform to raise awareness about frontotemporal dementia and to advocate for respect and accuracy in coverage. Many fans also echoed her call for higher standards in celebrity reporting. Emma Heming Willis did not just post a warning. She drew a clear line between fact and fiction, and reminded readers to think twice before believing what anonymous voices have to say.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus: Alex Warren, Ozzy Osbourne, Jessie Murph and BTS shake-up the top 10. Tyler, The Creator scores his fourth No. After teasing a new project on social media, the artist announced the album on Friday, July 18, with a release date slated for an off-cycle Monday, July 21. Most albums are released on Friday of each week; Luminate's tracking week for the chart runs Friday through Thursday. (It's the second off-cycle release in a row to debut at No. More than half of DON'T TAP THE GLASS' first-week activity is owed to album sales (it's the top-selling album of the week with 128,000 sold). Those sales are largely from five physical offerings exclusively sold via the artist's official webstore (a vinyl LP, CD and three deluxe boxed sets containing a piece of branded clothing and a copy of the CD). All physical versions of the album contained one bonus track as compared to the standard 10-song widely available digital download and streaming edition of the album. Tyler, The Creator previously topped the chart with CHROMAKOPIA (2024), CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST (2021) and IGOR (2019). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump turned a press availability in Scotland that was supposed to be focused on a trade deal with the European Union into a long list of his personal grudges against windmills, the Jeffrey Epstein case, Democrats, and Gaza. President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said the U.S. and E.U. But he also addressed a wide range of topics, ranting so much that one reporter asked “why” he was in a “bad mood.” “Can I ask why you're in a bad mood? Was it a bad morning of golf?” the reporter asked. But while playing his round of golf at his Turnberry course (during which it appears he may have cheated), Trump caught sight of windmills he has long hated, having fought and lost a battle against their installation in the waters off his Scotland course. Trump also resurfaced one of his false claims: that windmills cause whales to go crazy and die. “You have a certain place in the Massachusetts area that over the last 20 years had one or two whales wash ashore,” Trump said. “And over the last short period of time they had 18. No, windmills will not happen in the United States.” “The other thing I say to Europe: We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. In April 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy dispelled that misinformation. “As of now, there is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys,” the  agency wrote. Trump, who launched his political career on the unfounded conspiracy theory that former president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., also accused the Democrats of promoting “conspiracy theories and nonsense.” “One year ago, our country was dead… because of an incompetent president and incompetent Democrats,” he said, “All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense. If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer, so much easier — be very successful.” If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer pic.twitter.com/YTYEf5f494 Trump at first tried to avoid the topic of Gaza. When asked, “What do the images of starving kids in Gaza make you feel?” he responded, “Well, it's terrible. Venezuela is acting up in a different way. Asked again about food for Gaza and whether Israel should allow more food across the border, Trump whined that the U.S. has not been thanked for sending aid. “We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food to Gaza. It'd be nice to at least have a thank you.” Poll: Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' Is a Flop With Voters GOP Sen.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned last week that “conditions on the ground in Gaza are already catastrophic and deteriorating fast — with death, displacement and destruction continuing to be reported as a result of ongoing Israeli military operations. Hunger and malnutrition increase the risk of illnesses that weaken the immune system, especially among women, children, older people, and those with disabilities or chronic diseases. But Trump appeared more worried about who hasn't thanked him for millions in food aid than starving Gazans. '…We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food to Gaza. Trump claimed the U.S. sent $60 million in food aid a couple weeks ago, although the details are not clear. “It was pushed through over the technical and ethical objections of career staff,” a source told the publication. Sources told The Guardian that GHF may be receiving $30 million per month from the U.S. to fund its operations in Gaza. GOP Sen.

Last week on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Steve Buscemi — from… well, everything — revealed that long before he was famous, he often found himself in rooms with casting agents and directors unable to connect at all. “I was always hot and cold,” Buscemi explained. And Buscemi has auditioned for the best of the best — including “Rain Man” filmmaker Barry Levinson when he was working on the 1987 movie “Tin Men.” He decided he had to “really prepare” for the meeting. Let's do it again, but this time try it…' and he gave me a very specific note.” Related Stories Jay Leno Says Late Night Hosts ‘Alienate' Viewers: ‘I Don't Think Anybody Wants to Hear a Lecture' George Lucas Makes His First Ever Comic-Con Appearance “There was this silence and we both just looked at each other. And he said, ‘Yeah, it's OK, it's OK.' Needless to say, I did not get that part.” When are you gonna have an opportunity to meet these people?” So off Bescemi went, and he killed it… but when he revealed he couldn't make the shooting dates, Taylor stared at him and said, “What is wrong with you?” Of course, Buscemi has proven himself several times over — enough to impress the Emmys (he has one on eight nominations) — in such diverse projects as “Fargo,” “30 Rock,” “Reservoir Dogs,” and “Boardwalk Empire.” It's a resume that doesn't need regurgitating. He's become such a recognizable face, in fact, he can play himself on “The Studio” in a season that also had cameos from legends like Martin Scorsese and Charlize Theron, also playing themselves. Buscemi is far from the only famous actor to struggle with an audition — even a now-A-lister like Hugh Jackman, who has since gone from Wolverine to “The Music Man,” bungled what might've been his big break: the Benjamin Bratt role in “Miss Congeniality” — an experienced he described as “humiliating.” I was a nobody,” Jackson once told Variety, though in spite of his unknown status he had the opportunity to shoot his audition with Sandra Bullock. I'm not even vaguely up to speed here.' Years before her own series “Girls” made her a household name, Lena Dunham auditioned for Penny Marshall's 2001 film “Riding in Cars With Boys,” and it did not go well… though not in a traumatic way. “When I was 12, I met Penny Marshall in a failed audition for a film, ‘Riding in Cars With Boys.' And that was really big for me,” Dunham related on “The Jess Cagle Show.” “I was treated actually really well. Dunham explained that Marshall asked each of the young performers to tell her their names, heights, where they were from, and… then… to smile. And Penny Marshall said, ‘It's called acting, honey. “The thing is, she was right,” Dunham said. “Would you hire an actor who is like I'm sorry, I can't smile on command?' The thing is, I'm with Penny on this one.” Watch Buscemi's full interview on “The Late Show” below. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former 'Tonight Show' host took aim at partisan late-night shows in a recent interview: "Why shoot for just half an audience?" Jay Leno took aim at late-night hosts whose political humor appeals to only “half their audience” by making jokes targeting only one side of the ideological spectrum. Steve Buscemi Recalls Failed Audition for Barry Levinson's 'Tin Men': "There Was This Silence" David Trulio, the president and CEO of the foundation, kicked things off by noting to Leno that his jokes were equally balanced between mocking Democrats and Republicans. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.” Leno concluded by saying: “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? I like to bring people into the big picture. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. CBS abruptly announced The Late Show would conclude in May 2026, and called the move a “financial decision.” But it came days after Colbert criticized the network for paying “a big fat bribe” to President Donald Trump in the form of a $16 million settlement over a 60 Minutes interview. Newsbusters, a right-wing media watchdog, claimed The Late Show has hosted 176 outwardly left-leaning guests since 2022 and only one Republican, and booked 43 left-leaning guests since the start of 2025. Other late-night hosts — including current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon — have rallied behind Colbert since the decision, with fellow talents working under parent company Paramount Global having been especially scathing.

She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag. In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.” The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans. “JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters. Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo has always been weirdly cagey about the personal details of its most iconic characters—to the point that you have to catch one of the company's executives on a very good day if you want them to confirm something as simple as whether Mario is Italian, a plumber, or has the last name “Mario.” When it comes to actual romantic connections between its characters, the Japanese firm is even more uptight, something it displayed aggressively this week, when it reminded fans that its iconic turtle-killing problem solver and his favorite unelected head of state, Princess Peach, are just friends—all but daring the wider internet to go “Oh, yeah?” Users were informed recently that “Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can,” which, when received in a normal brain, probably feels like a fairly anodyne statement. (Nintendo put out a Valentine's Day tweet a scant 15 years ago featuring the pair together, for instance, and referred to them as “Cutest Couple” in Mario Party 5. Also, Peach kisses Mario on the cheek or nose quite a lot, usually as a transactional reward for having rescued her—although it's worth noting that Super Mario Odyssey ends with her rejecting a marriage proposal from him and stranding him on the moon. Honestly, we get it: The folks in the Mario group of characters are, by design, pretty blank slates, designed to have little in the way of history or personality traits that would stop them from being dropped into new games and scenarios sans baggage. That being said, the only Nintendo fans who seem especially happy about the no-hook-ups ruling are the ones who were already ‘shipping these characters with someone else—the Peach/Daisy people have been eating well this weekend, from what we've seen on Bluesky—at least partly because it seems kind of disingenuous, given how much the pair have been depicted in such close proximity for so long. (It also feels weirdly timed, at a moment when video game marketplaces Steam and itch.io both announced that they were clamping down on games with sexual content or themes in order to appease credit card companies; Nintendo's never been at the forefront of sexuality in gaming, but there's still a mild vibe of “Hold our beer, our characters have never even kissed on the mouth” to the whole thing.) We did, in our capacity as journalists, run a quick tags search on internet fan-fiction archive A03—kind of the “checking the dipstick” of gauging internet horniness for character pairings—this evening, and will note that Mario/Peach massively outranks any other duo we could think of. (And some we wish we hadn't; shout out to the 129 Luigi/Mario fics in the pile, and their let's say controversial definitions of brotherly love.) So there is at least some clear indication that a lot of people naturally slot the pair into coupledom. Anyway: Here's your regular reminder that Nintendo can never touch the erotic mindscapes inside your own head; if you want Mario and Peach to have been long-term monogamous for the last 40 years, drive yourself wild, friend.

Rebecca Romijn is sharing an update on her return as Mystique in the highly-anticipated Avengers: Doomsday. 'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Delights Comic-Con With Upcoming Episode, Teases All-Puppet Installment At THR's suite at #SDCC, #StarTrek: Strange New Worlds' Rebecca Romijn talks about what it was like returning to the role of 'Mystique' for #AvengersDoomsday pic.twitter.com/BTCNKcUmwS Romijn kept her lips sealed when asked if she's read the entire script, noting, “I cannot confirm nor deny that I have read the entire script.” She also admitted she “can't say” who she's filmed scenes alongside, but it was a “surreal” experience shooting with some of her original X-Men co-stars with a new, blended cast. (Romijn made a brief cameo in 2011's X-Men: First Class.) I went back in with full ownership of her. It was very nice to go back and play that character, ‘cause I had imposter syndrome in the very beginning,” she said. And I did not have that going back this time. Marvel revealed the Avengers: Doomsday cast in late March, which notably includes a string of actors from 20th Century Fox's X-Men universe.
