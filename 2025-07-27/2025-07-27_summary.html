TEL AVIV, July 27. /TASS/. Israel is determined to achieve all of its goals in the Gaza Strip and eliminate Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

"We will continue to fight, we will continue to act until we achieve all of our war goals — until complete victory," he said in a vide address while visiting the Ramon Air Force Base in the Negev Desert. "We will eliminate Hamas."

"In order to complete this goal (Hamas elimination - TASS), and also the release of our hostages, we are making progress in fighting and negotiating," he said.

"In any path we choose, we will have to continue to allow the entry of minimal humanitarian supplies [to the Gaza Strip]. We have done this until now," Netanyahu said, adding that the United Nations is lying about Israel by saying that it is "not allowing humanitarian supplies to enter." "It is allowed. There are secured convoys," he stressed.

Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet in Stockholm on Monday to tackle longstanding economic disputes at the centre of the countries' trade war, aiming to extend a truce keeping sharply higher tariffs at bay.

China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with President Donald Trump's administration, after Beijing and Washington reached a preliminary deal in June to end weeks of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs.

Without an agreement, global supply chains could face renewed turmoil from duties exceeding 100 per cent.

The Stockholm talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, take place a day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meets Trump at his golf course in Scotland to try to clinch a deal that would likely see a 15 per cent baseline tariff on most EU goods.

Trade analysts on both sides of the Pacific say the discussions in the Swedish capital are unlikely to produce any breakthroughs but could prevent further escalation and help create conditions for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet later this year.

Previous U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva and London in May and June focused on bringing U.S. and Chinese retaliatory tariffs down from triple-digit levels and restoring the flow of rare earth minerals halted by China and Nvidia H20 AI chips and other goods halted by the United States. 

U.S. to discuss tariff deadline extension with China as Trump, Philippines reach deal

So far, the talks have not delved into broader economic issues. They include U.S. complaints that China's state-led, export-driven model is flooding world markets with cheap goods, and Beijing's complaints that U.S. national security export controls on tech goods seek to stunt Chinese growth.

“Stockholm will be the first meaningful round of U.S.-China trade talks,” said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at China consultancy firm Plenum.

Trump has been successful in pressuring some other trading partners, including Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, into deals accepting higher U.S. tariffs of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. 

He said there was a 50-50 chance that the U.S. and the 27-member European Union could also reach a framework trade pact, adding that Brussels wanted to “make a deal very badly”.

Two of Trump's top trade officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, will attend the Scotland talks and then travel to Stockholm. 

Analysts say the U.S.-China negotiations are far more complex and will require more time. China's grip on the global market for rare earth minerals and magnets, used in everything from military hardware to car windshield wiper motors, has proved to be an effective leverage point on U.S. industries.

In the background of the talks is speculation about a possible meeting between Trump and Xi in late October.

Trump has said he will decide soon whether to visit China in a landmark trip to address trade and security tensions. A new flare-up of tariffs and export controls would likely derail any plans for a meeting with Xi.

“The Stockholm meeting is an opportunity to start laying the groundwork for a Trump visit to China,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

Bessent has already said he wants to work out an extension of the August 12 deadline to prevent tariffs snapping back to 145 per cent on the U.S. side and 125 per cent on the Chinese side.

Still, China will likely request a reduction of multi-layered U.S. tariffs totaling 55 per cent on most goods and further easing of U.S. high-tech export controls, analysts said. Beijing has argued that such purchases would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached US$295.5-billion in 2024.

China is currently facing a 20 per cent tariff related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis, a 10 per cent reciprocal tariff, and 25 per cent duties on most industrial goods imposed during Trump's first term.

Bessent has also said he would discuss with He the need for China to rebalance its economy away from exports toward domestic consumer demand. The shift would require China to put an end to a protracted property crisis and boost social safety nets to encourage household spending.

Michael Froman, a former U.S. trade representative during Barack Obama's administration, said such a shift has been a goal of U.S. policymakers for two decades.

“Can we effectively use tariffs to get China to fundamentally change their economic strategy? That remains to be seen,” said Froman, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.

BERLIN, July 27. /TASS/. Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger has said that the country is open to discussing its potential membership in NATO and that such a discussion could be "quite productive" amid growing security threats.

"One thing is clear: neutrality alone cannot protect us," she said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. According to Meinl-Reisinger, the security situation is becoming increasingly instable and Russia is allegedly growing more and more aggressive. "[Austria] is protected by investments in defense and partner relations. I am principally open to discussing the future of Austria's security and defense policy," she stated.

"Although there is no majority in favor of the NATO membership either in parliament or among the population, such a discussion could be quite productive," she said. "I don't mean to say that we must join NATO triumphantly. But we cannot sit by saying: if we do no harm to anyone, no one will do any harm to us. It would be naive," she stressed, adding that the world has changed.

"However, I want to make thig clear: we have a partner, the European Union, who will defend us in an emergency situation. At the same time, we are contributing much to European security," she noted, adding that the Austrian military is participating in numerous EU peacekeeping missions. "In this context, Austria's neutrality has visibly changed since its accession to the European Union in 1995," he pointed out.

Earlier, her party, New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS), called on its partners in the ruling coalition to look at the possible participation in the creation of a European army instead of sticking to the country's neutrality. Austria's off-bloc status is committed to paper in a special constitutional law, which was passed by parliament in 1955.

Police investigate death of Ke'Torrius Starkes Jr, three, who was left inside car by contractor for state human resources

An investigation has been triggered after a three-year-old boy died after being left in a hot car by a contractor for the state human resources department in Alabama.

Ke'Torrius Starkes Jr, who was in foster care, had been picked up in the late morning on Tuesday by the worker after a supervised visit with his father, the New York Times reported. He was supposed to be transported to a day care program by a worker for the department, which oversees child protection other social services.

Instead the boy was left alone strapped in a vehicle with tinted windows on a hot day in Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham.

The Birmingham police department said officers went to a private home in Bessemer to respond to a report of an unresponsive child at around 5.30pm and found that the boy was “accidentally left inside of a vehicle while in the care of a third-party contracted worker through the Department of Human Resources”.

The boy was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.

The chief deputy coroner of Jefferson county, Bill Yates, told the Times that “the child was found in a car that was ignition off, doors closed, windows up and it was hot in the car” and so far there was “no other competing cause of death”.

“A child in DHR custody was being transported by a contract provider when the incident occurred,” a spokesperson for Alabama DHR said in a statement. “The provider has terminated their employee. Due to confidentiality, DHR cannot comment further regarding the identity of the child or the exact circumstances.”

Police are now investigating the incident to examine for any possible criminal charges in the case.

“We need answers, and we may need to examine state law to make sure this never happens again,” said state senator Merika Coleman, a Democrat.

The government is on track to launch the Build Canada Homes initiative this fall, according to Housing Minister Gregor Robertson's spokesperson Renée LeBlanc Proctor.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has been quiet since the federal election about the housing crisis, the same issue that contributed to the Liberals' fading popularity under their previous leader.

Behind the scenes, however, housing stakeholders are fielding a flurry of calls from government officials seeking their advice on the creation of Build Canada Homes, a new federal entity that Mr. Carney has said will get the government back in the business of homebuilding. 

His ambitions, announced during his campaign, were big: act as a developer to build affordable housing, spur innovation in the housing sector and offer low-cost financing to affordable-housing builders. 

However, trade turmoil has quickly overshadowed housing affordability in the political arena, creating a void of information on how the federal government plans to get more homes built.

Renée LeBlanc Proctor, a spokesperson for Housing Minister Gregor Robertson, said in a statement that the government was on track to launch the initiative this fall and stakeholders would learn more soon.

But questions still linger about how the new entity will function, and what its creation will mean for existing programs. Meanwhile, some leaders in the housing policy and advocacy spaces are worried that if the government doesn't move quickly to spur more supply, the economic slowdown caused by U.S. tariffs will set plans further behind. 

Mr. Carney promised the initiative would be a “lean, mission-driven organization” focused on building affordable housing by leveraging public lands and partnering with the private sector. He pitched it as a central piece of the government's plan to double the rate of homebuilding in the country.

Opinion: Ottawa must resist the temptation to fiddle with CMHC amid housing market slump

Raymond Sullivan, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association, an organization that represents the social and non-profit housing sector, said he's encouraged to see affordable housing at the heart of Build Canada Homes' mission. 

But given how long it can take to set up a new bureaucracy, Mr. Sullivan said the government should roll out elements of Build Canada Homes as they become ready, rather than wait for the entire organization to be set up.

“We're not going to have a cake that's fully baked and ready to launch in the fall. So let's focus on the pieces that are already available to us,” he said.

University of Toronto senior housing researcher Carolyn Whitzman said there are two versions of the initiative that are being discussed in policy circles: one that is limited in scope and focused primarily on partnering with developers to build affordable housing on public land, and one that also has a larger mandate encompassing financing and innovation programs. 

Figuring out what exactly Build Canada Homes will be responsible for and how it will distinguish itself from organizations such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation appear to be some of the details Ottawa is trying to hammer out, according to stakeholders consulted by the government. 

Mr. Sullivan said Ottawa should ensure social-housing projects in the pipeline are not affected by the organization's creation. 

“We don't want to see any kind of interruption. We need to know that the government is there as a partner with us, not sitting back for a year building a new structure, but ready to work on things that are ready,” he said.

Real estate is not a financial slam dunk, Canadians are learning the hard way

Some housing experts and stakeholders are skeptical that Build Canada Homes will be a sufficient solution to the housing shortage. 

The government has had mixed success with its housing initiatives in the past – such as the slow progress it's made on converting unused office space into affordable housing recently flagged by the Auditor-General – and a new organization will likely take time to begin delivering results.

“They've talked about partnering with industry to actually build the units, which will be important, because governments around the world have proven that they can't properly get into the actual construction game,” said Kevin Lee, CEO of the Canadian Home Builders' Association. 

Mr. Lee said building affordable housing on public lands also won't be enough to get the government to its goal of 500,000 housing starts a year. (The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts was 283,734 units in June.) 

Meanwhile, the private and social-housing sectors are impatient for clarity on other policy fronts, including the promised GST rebate for first-time homebuyers. Mr. Lee said the delay is affecting demand at a time when the economy is already slowing down the housing market. 

“Having something like that that was promised not get turned into official policy has really thrown another wrench into the system,” said Mr. Lee. 

Proposed GST rebate for first-time homebuyers could offer average relief of $27,000, PBO says

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne introduced legislation in late May to provide the GST rebates. But unlike the government's “One Canadian Economy” legislation, which was rushed through the House of Commons and Senate during the four-week sitting, the bill on GST rebates must wait for Parliament to return in the fall. 

The government's prioritization of fast-tracking approvals for major projects and managing trade tensions with the U.S. reflects a shift in the public's priorities, as well. Polling by Abacus Data shows U.S. President Donald Trump is the second-most important issue to Canadians, with housing and the economy nearly tied for third. (The rising cost of living – which includes housing costs – was the No. 1 issue.)

Mike Moffatt, founding director of the University of Ottawa's Missing Middle Initiative, said the shift in priorities is understandable, though he warned housing could become of greater importance again.

“The government would be doing itself favours if they do the legwork now, because if it becomes a big concern, or the primary concern for Canadians, again, it might be too late to really address that,” Mr. Moffatt said.

The trade war with the United States also has repercussions for the housing market, which won't make the government's job of spurring homebuilding any easier. 

RBC assistant chief economist Robert Hogue said the housing market is slowing down in part as “payback for an exceptionally strong period” after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“However, the trade war kind of put a damper on things and really affected confidence in most of Canada, and that's when we saw, through the winter and spring, a lot of potential home buyers saying, ‘might as well sit it out,'” he said.

These three housing markets are bucking national trends, and Trump is one reason why

“The challenge is to get more demand for new construction at a time when building costs have gone up and and you've got now more inventory in the existing home market, in many places around Canada.”

Mr. Moffatt said as the government works on setting up the organization, it needs to roll out policies that will have a more immediate effect on the housing market.

For example, the government could expand its proposed GST rebate so that all homebuyers of a primary residence are eligible, he said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in the spring his government would match the tax break if it were extended to all homebuyers.

Prof. Whitzman said social-housing builders also are seeking information on a number of programs, including the affordable housing fund, which provided capital for the repair of existing affordable and community housing. That fund recently ran out of money, leaving its future in limbo.

“I'm not saying Build Canada Homes is a bad idea,” she said. “But there's stuff that could be happening tomorrow and there's stuff that should be happening tomorrow.”

A man and a woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park as police seek a white male suspect

Two people were found dead along a walking trail in a state park in Arkansas, authorities said Sunday.

A 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park in Washington county, according to the Arkansas state police. Its criminal investigation unit is handling what it calls a “suspected homicide”.

The suspect is a white male wearing dark shorts, a dark tank top and weight-lifting type gloves. He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan whose license plate may have been covered by electrical or duct tape.

The vehicle may have been traveling on State Highway 170 or State Highway 220 near the park, police said.

The victims' bodies were being taken to the Arkansas state crime lab, where the manner and cause of death will be determined.

Russia wants to resolve its war in Ukraine through "diplomatic and political means" but would continue military operations until its "goals" are achieved, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on July 27.

Responding to a question from Russian state-controlled news agency Tass, Peskov said that "the goals of (war) must be fulfilled before the principles of future relations with Ukraine can be determined."  

Russia continues to push for the same core demands it outlined at the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022: a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, large-scale demilitarization of the country, and legal "guarantees" for the Russian language, culture, and Moscow-linked religious groups in Ukraine. 

The Kremlin has also demanded constitutional changes in Ukraine, including recognition of four Ukrainian oblasts as Russian territory, along with the Crimean peninsula, which it seized in 2014. 

Peskov claimed Russia would "prefer" to resolve the conflict through dialogue, but said military operations continue because "opponents rejected the path of negotiations."

Kyiv has consistently supported negotiations but refused to accept Russia's maximalist conditions, which are essentially capitulation.

Ukraine has also consistently rejected all demands that involve ceding territory or weakening its military. President Volodymyr Zelensky and top officials have said any peace must begin with an unconditional ceasefire. 

Peskov's comments came days after the third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, where Ukraine reiterated its call for a full ceasefire and humanitarian agreements. 

The latest round of peace talks between the two sides took place in Istanbul on July 23, marking the third formal meeting since negotiations resumed earlier this year after a long pause.

Ukrainian officials proposed a meeting between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of August, but the Russian side again declined the idea of a meeting between the two leaders.

Russia's delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, proposed creating three working groups to address political, military, and humanitarian issues. Moscow also offered to facilitate brief ceasefires to retrieve wounded soldiers and repatriate bodies and claimed it would return the remains of 3,000 Ukrainian servicemen through the Red Cross.

The revived diplomatic push comes as the U.S. increases pressure on Russia to end the war. On July 14, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he would impose "severe" tariffs on Russia unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days.

A Russian drone targeting a bus reportedly killed three and injured 20 in Sumy Oblast on July 27, according to local media.



The decision to cancel the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg, an event traditionally held on the last Sunday of July, was announced by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on July 27, who said it was made "for security reasons."

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the decree synchronizes Ukraine's sanctions with European sanctions. "As of now, all 18 sanctions packages are fully aligned and in effect in Ukraine," Zelensky wrote.

"We assessed your attempt yesterday to hit all of us at once," Brovdi said in the Telegram post,  without offering further details. The post ended with a string of insults aimed at the Russian forces behind the alleged attack.

"I am very open to having a public debate about the future of Austria's security and defense policy," Austria's Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger said. "Although there are currently no majorities in parliament and in the population for joining NATO, such a debate can still be very fruitful."

Protests sweep Ukraine in response to the new controversial law, which carries grim implications for integration into the European Union as peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations resume.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed Russia would prefer to resolve the conflict through dialogue, but said military operations continue because "opponents rejected the path of negotiations."

Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russian forces launched 83 drones overnight, 78 of which were taken out by air defenses.

"Despite having very good interactions with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and phone calls, it never leads to anything," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. "So, the time has come for some action."

The number includes 920 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

As another sign of deepening bilateral relations, Russia is set to launch direct passenger flights from Moscow to Pyongyang on July 27, marking the first air connection between the two capitals in decades.

Russian forces launched an overnight attack on Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast on July 26, targeting civilian infrastructure and leaving three people injured, local authorities reported.

The Vatican confirmed that Pope Leo received Metropolitan Anthony, the senior Russian Orthodox Church cleric who chairs its department of external church relations, along with five other high-profile clerics, during a morning audience on July 26.

According to operational data by Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, Colonel Lebedev was leading assault operations in the Velykyi Burluk area of Kharkiv Oblast.

            Thirty minutes into a routine appearance Thursday on Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Ron DeSantis abruptly turned his fire on a fellow Republican, accusing a veteran state lawmaker of betraying the party's voters.
    


            Hours later, President Donald Trump endorsed that same lawmaker, Joe Gruters, to become the next chairman of the Republican National Committee.
    


            For DeSantis, the episode reinforced a pattern: picking fights that come back to haunt him.
    


            Trump's inner circle was already full of people who have no love lost for the Florida governor — a reality that has isolated DeSantis within his home state ever since he ended his 2024 presidential campaign. Now, the most powerful official post in the Republican Party is likely to be filled by another foe, further clouding the political ambitions of both DeSantis and his wife, Casey.
    


            Ron DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could find himself running in a presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned. Casey DeSantis, meanwhile, has taken steps toward succeeding her husband in Tallahassee next year in a race that would pit her against Rep. Byron Donalds, a Naples Republican backed by both Trump and Gruters.
    


            The elevation of Gruters to lead the RNC blindsided Gov. DeSantis, according to people close to his political operation. With Trump's support, Gruters had previously filed to run for chief financial officer of Florida in 2026, a statewide position, and the RNC reelected the current party chairman, Michael Whatley, to another term in January following the GOP's successes last fall. While Gruters was RNC treasurer, a promotion seemed unlikely anytime soon.
    


            It also appeared as though DeSantis and Trump had largely buried the hatchet after their contentious presidential primary last year. They stood side-by-side earlier this month for the opening of a new migrant detention center in the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” where they showered each other in compliments.
    


            “You are my friend, and you'll always be my friend, and we may have some skirmishes, even in the future. I doubt it, but I will always come back, because we have blood that seems to match pretty well,” Trump said.
    


            But the political playing field changed rapidly Thursday, when Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, decided not to run for Senate in North Carolina. Whatley, a former party chair in the Tar Heel State, then made clear that he would run instead with Trump's backing, leaving an opening atop the party.
    


            By then, DeSantis had spent weeks trying to take down Gruters. He appointed state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a close ally, to become the state's CFO and immediately backed him in the GOP primary against Gruters. In appearances around Florida, he shrugged off Trump's endorsement while bashing Gruters' conservative credentials.
    


            “If George Washington rose from the dead and came back and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Will you appoint Joe Gruters CFO?' My response would be, ‘No,'” DeSantis said earlier this month. “I can't do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead this state in a conservative direction.”
    


            The criticism continued Thursday when DeSantis appeared just outside Gruters' district to pile on more attacks. But that evening, Trump threw his support behind Whatley for US Senate and Gruters for RNC chair in a post on social media. The ramifications of DeSantis' maneuvering against Gruters quickly crystalized.
    


            “The governor did not see this coming at all,” a person close to DeSantis acknowledged. “He fumbled this 1,000%.”
    


            A spokesperson for DeSantis' political operation did not respond to questions from CNN. Gruters declined to comment. A person familiar with Gruters' thinking told CNN that he hopes to lead the party through the 2028 presidential cycle.
    


            DeSantis has long earned a reputation in Florida for burning bridges on the way to the top. At first, the approach paid off.
    


            In 2018, DeSantis flouted the party establishment by running for governor and knocking off the preferred Republican thanks to Trump's support. He then unceremoniously jettisoned the operatives who helped him win, including veteran Republican strategist Susie Wiles and top adviser James Blair. As he amassed political clout, he stepped over other Republicans in the state, including many in the congressional delegation, who grumbled at their lack of relationship with the state's pugnacious leader.
    


            For a time, it appeared DeSantis could be the future of the party, and he ran for president over the objections of Trump, his former friend.
    


            But as DeSantis' presidential campaign floundered, the enemies he made along the way resurfaced. Many of those members of Congress endorsed Trump over their home-state governor. Wiles became Trump's co-campaign manager. Trump ridiculed DeSantis en route to defeating him.
    


            After his November victory, Trump named Wiles his chief of staff and Blair to oversee his political operation from the White House. Chris LaCivita, Trump's other campaign manager who feuded with DeSantis during the presidential primary, is spearheading the GOP's midterm efforts. Other Floridians more loyal to Trump than DeSantis have been handed key roles, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            DeSantis has yet to course correct as he regroups in Florida. He continues to recruit candidates to go up against Donalds — one of those Republicans who endorsed Trump over the governor — if Casey DeSantis doesn't run. He has publicly clashed with state lawmakers from his own party for blocking his agenda, lobbing personal attacks.
    


            Still, few people in Florida politics once close to the governor could comprehend why Ron DeSantis didn't appoint Gruters as CFO to extend a low-stakes olive branch to Trump. Now, they said, he may pay a price.
    


            “His blind spot is he doesn't have a magnanimous bone in his body,” a veteran Republican fundraiser in Florida said. “Once he has a negative opinion of someone, he cannot pivot even out of political necessity.”

            With her short hair and unshowy clothing, Fan Chunli looks every bit the middle-aged woman from rural China. Among a crowd of youngsters vying to become the next breakout star in one of China's most popular stand-up comedy contests, she stands out.
    


            But when the 50-year-old takes the mic, she beams with life and drips sarcasm, unloading jokes about her abusive ex-husband that bring the audience into a mix of laughter and tears.
    


            Hailing from a place where simply knowing how to use the internet “makes me the Elon Musk of my village,” Fan is the latest sensation in China's booming scene for stand-up comedy, an artform that offers an outlet for pent-up grievances in a country that often stifles open discussion of politics or society.
    


            But Fan's acerbic takes on patriarchy and domestic abuse have alarmed some officials in China, where women's rights remain a sensitive issue. Trying to boost birth rates and thwart a looming demographic crisis, the ruling Communist Party is urging women to embrace traditional gender roles. It has cracked down hard on the country's nascent feminist movement, which it deems a malicious Western influence.
    


            During the performance that shot her to fame earlier this month, Fan laid bare the absurdity facing many victims of domestic violence in the country.
    


            She said she was beaten by her ex-husband. But when she told her parents she wanted a divorce, her father warned her not to bring disgrace to the family.
    


            “When men are involved in domestic violence, it's not shameful. When women demand a divorce, it's shameful,” she said, drawing cheers during her performance at The King of Stand-up Comedy, a popular contest streamed by online platform iQiyi.
    


            Fan's performance appears to have chagrined at least one local government.
    


            As footage of her routine went viral last week, officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang issued a warning saying such jokes are “catalysts that provoke” gender conflict.
    


            The statement didn't directly name Fan, or the show in question, alluding only to a newcomer dubbed an “industry gem” – the nickname given to her by the show's judges.
    


            “The content of some talk shows is gradually deviating from its nature of humor, simplifying gender issues and repeatedly making a fuss about the ‘opposition between men and women,'” the local government's publicity department wrote on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The province has no specific link to Fan or the TV show, but the department occasionally posts commentaries on recent trends.
    


            Any discussion of gender issues, it said, should be “rational.”
    


            China's government has cracked down on feminist activism over the past decade. Most notably, a group of women who became known as the “Feminist Five” were arrested after planning protests on public transport against sexual harassment in 2015.
    


            Authorities have, however, allowed some mild-mannered discussion on social media, while movies featuring feminist themes continue to screen without a problem – as long as they do not amount to a call for action, experts say.
    


            But Fan's background – provincial, not well off or highly educated – may be contributing to official disquiet over her popularity, adding an extra layer of scrutiny.
    


            “She's a middle-aged woman who comes from a rural background, not one of those typical urban liberal elite feminists,” said Meng Bingchun, a communications professor who researches feminism at the London School of Economics (LSE).
    


            “And this seems to indicate that this kind of discontent and grievance related to gender issues and the traditional Confucian, patriarchal values is probably more widespread than they (the authorities) are willing to acknowledge,” she told CNN.
    


            Traditional social codes can sometimes prove as strict as any government diktat. Late last year, Chinese e-commerce giant JD faced a boycott by customers infuriated by its casting of trailblazing woman comedian Yang Li in a promotional live stream.
    


            Those leading the action were apparently still stung by Yang's signature quip from five years ago, chiding mediocre men: “How come he looks so average, yet still so confident?”
    


            Bowing to the online backlash, the company apologized and severed ties with Yang.
    


            Fan has never openly identified herself as a feminist. But in a post on the online platform Weibo, she wrote that she believes leaving behind the social constraints of rural life can lead to “the awakening of women.”
    


            “For example, when I say I want a divorce in my village, I'm seen as an unpardonable villain,” she wrote.
    


            “But when I talk about my divorce outside, the audience applauds.”
    


            Growing up away from China's major cities, she didn't receive any formal education until the age of 8, she told Chinese state-owned Sanlian Lifeweek in an interview. But that soon ended after junior high.
    


            Raised in an era when opportunities mostly went to men, she recalled picking up a job in a city before getting married, and her mother handing all the money she sent home to her brother.
    


            “Girls growing up in rural villages have no rights to inherit anything. Not the house. Not the land,” she told Sanlian. “At the time… I just wanted to get married.”
    


            But after getting married, she found out “family and marriage trapped women, making it impossible for them to make money.”
    


            For Fan, life before stand-up was a cleaning job at an obscure village in her home province of Shandong, in China's northeast.
    


            Her path to stardom started with an unlikely twist.
    


            In 2023, struggling to make ends meet, she recalled selling her jewelry to see a performance by her idol, a comedian named Li Bo, state-run media reported.
    


            At the show, she was supposed to be roasted during an improv segment, but Fan's quick-witted responses impressed the performer, who decided to introduce Fan to the trade, she said.
    


            Fan has plenty of experience to draw on when it comes to divorce, having contemplated her own for more than two decades.
    


            “I was already thinking about getting a divorce when my eldest daughter was born,” she told Sanlian.
    


            The mother of two described her ex-husband as a gambler, whose absence left her to look after her sick father-in-law alone. She also poked fun at his uncouth manners, saying he ate congee – a popular Chinese rice porridge – directly from the ladle.
    


            One time her ex-husband and his father beat her up so badly that her face was covered in bruises, she alleged. She ran home to tell her parents that she wanted a divorce, only to be deterred by her mother, who told her to break up the relationship only if he was having an affair.
    


            The last straw was a year or two ago when she caught her husband once again going ladle-to-mouth with the congee. “This time,” she recalled thinking, “I'm leaving without looking back.”
    


            By then, Fan had already got a grounding in comedy performance, with slots at local comedy clubs. After leaving her husband – conceding both of their two houses to him, to get him to agree to a divorce – she decided to give stand-up a real shot, she said.
    


            During her viral performance, she moved from innocent self-mockery to full-throttled roasting of her ex-husband, who she calls a “corgi” because of his diminutive stature.
    


            “How tough is it for a rural auntie to come to the city for work for the first time?” she asks.
    


            Then she considered her current, dire situation.
    


            “I glanced at my husband beside me and thought, ‘I'm not scared of this challenge.'”
    


            Apart from her marriage, she also opened up about other taboo topics for Chinese women, such as oft-marginalized biological realities.
    


            Noting her newfound late-life stardom, she said that – unlike many women who retire when their periods stop – “my menopause will come with my debut.”
    


            Fans who CNN spoke to are rooting for the rising female comedy scene in China, pushing back against Zhejiang officials' warning against “gender opposition.”
    


            Zhang Yuanqi said she watched Fan's show with her mother, who similarly left an abusive home, a decade ago.
    


            She said comedians like Fan are “not trying to stir up ‘gender opposition'; they're just turning their life experiences into jokes.”
    


            “What we want to hear is our own lives,” she said.
    


            “I started to wonder if my mom had similar worries that she kept to herself, thinking she had to handle them alone,” Huang Xueyao, a 21-year-old university student, said.
    


            Fan touched on issues women encounter daily, she said, adding that she couldn't understand the local government's warnings. “They tell us to stop. What's really behind the officials' thinking?” added Huang, who said she hopes to take her mother to see Fan perform in person.
    


            Meng, from LSE, said the Chinese government is grappling to understand this newly emerging form of entertainment, which may explain the cautious approach, though the warning from the Zhejiang authorities is unlikely to have further consequences on Fan.
    


            As of Sunday, Fan's Weibo account remains active (a deactivation would be one of the first signs a performer has fallen afoul of China's censorship apparatus) – though some posts railing against the veiled official warning have been removed.
    


            For the rising performer, comedy is more than just a newfound career, but also a way of getting catharsis.
    


            “The biggest change in me since I've started doing stand-up comedy is that I no longer get angry at my ex-husband's every move,” Fan told Sanlian.
    


            “There is a feeling of reconciliation.”

TOKYO, July 27. /TASS/. Three unidentified drones intruded the restricted airspace over the Genkai nuclear power plant in the Kyushu island, Kyodo news agency reported.

Kyushu Electric Power, the nuclear plant owner, informed authorities about drones. No damage was inflicted and the nuclear plant is operating normally. Police is searching for intruding drones.

Launch of drones in the airspace above important infrastructural facilities is prohibited in Japan unless a special authorization is issued.

Emmy-Award winning host John Walsh touts results: 1,200 arrests, 61 child rescues, as series returns to FOX.

The man imprisoned for kidnapping and murdering a six-year-old boy in New York City nearly 45 years ago has had his conviction overturned. 

64-year-old Pedro Hernandez has been serving 25 years to life in prison after being convicted in 2017 of killing Etan Patz in 1979. 

Patz vanished on the first day he was allowed to walk to the school bus stop by himself on May 25, 1979. He was one of the first missing children to be pictured on milk cartons in a case that drew national attention. 

President Ronald Reagan later declared May 25, 1983, the first National Missing Children's Day in memory of Patz.

COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTION, ORDERS NEW TRIAL OF MAN CONVICTED IN 1979 ETAN PATZ MURDER

On the morning of May 25, 1979, the first-grader was granted permission from his parents to walk alone to the bus stop, located just a block and a half away from where the family lived. His mother took him downstairs and watched him walk into the distance – he was never seen again. 

At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez was working at a convenience shop as a teenager in the child's downtown Manhattan neighborhood. He initially spoke with authorities as they were canvassing for the child, but he did not become a suspect until police received a 2012 tip revealing that Hernandez had previously made remarks about killing a child in New York, but had not mentioned Patz by name. 

Hernandez was arrested in 2012 and ultimately confessed to the crime after seven hours of questioning, telling investigators he had lured Patz into the store's basement with the promise of giving him a soda. Once inside, Hernandez said he had choked the child because "something just took over me," before putting Patz – who Hernandez said was still alive – inside a box and leaving it alongside a pile of trash.

However, Hernandez's lawyers insisted the confession was the result of a mental illness that caused their client to misinterpret his imagination from reality. The attorneys also pointed to Hernandez's very low IQ. 

"Several factors likely contributed to his confession, including low IQ, mental illness, and heightened suggestibility," Jonathan Alpert, psychotherapist and author of "Therapy Nation," told Fox News Digital. "These make someone more prone to internalizing guilt or fabricating details to meet perceived expectations." 

Alpert has not treated any of the individuals involved in the case.

Hernandez was initially tried in New York state court twice – with the first trial ending in a jury deadlock in 2015 – before an appeal transferred the case into federal court.  

At the time, prosecutors claimed that Hernandez was faking or exaggerating his illness, pointing to Hernandez reportedly admitting to the crimes before police read him his rights and began recording their interview in 2012. He went on to repeat his confession at least twice while being recorded. 

The confession ultimately led to questions from jurors during their nine days of deliberations, with their final inquiry revolving around whether they were required to rule out the two recorded confessions if they were to determine that the first one was invalid – with the judge telling them they were not. 

EXPERT WARNS IDAHO MURDERER'S PLEA DEAL STRATEGY IS A DANGEROUS CALCULATED 'LONG GAME'

An appeals court later ruled the judge should have provided a better explanation to the jury regarding their options, which could have included not factoring in all three of Hernandez's confessions. 

Referring to a jury note during the trial, the appeals court said the judge had provided a "clearly wrong" and "manifestly prejudicial" response to the question posed. 

The court's decision to overturn Hernandez's conviction and grant him a new trial raises questions regarding mental health and confessions in court cases, as Alpert points to the frequent susceptibility of individuals with mental health disorders to "have an intense need to gain approval from authority figures." 

SCOTT PETERSON'S 'STRONGEST ARGUMENT' FOR MURDER CONVICTION APPEAL IS A LONG SHOT: CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER

"When interrogators suggest a narrative, these individuals can absorb and repeat it, not out of deceit, but out of compliance. Over time, they may even start to believe it themselves, especially when under stress or exhaustion." 

While a new trial could bring additional clarity for a case that has spanned decades, Alpert warns that it could also lead to misunderstandings regarding testimony and evidence years later. 

"A retrial has the potential to bring clarity, especially if new psychological insights or evidence are introduced," Alpert told Fox News Digital. "But it could just as easily create more confusion, particularly if the case continues to rely heavily on interpretation rather than hard facts."

The case garnered national attention, with Patz's photo being one of the first to be circulated on milk cartons throughout the country. His parents spent decades in the same home and with the same phone number, in hopes of their son eventually returning to them. 

The child's family worked to help establish a national missing-children hotline and pioneered a new way for law enforcement agencies throughout the country to distribute information regarding such cases. 

"They waited and persevered for 35 years for justice for Etan, which today, sadly, may have been lost," former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. told The Associated Press after hearing about the reversal.

The court ordered Hernandez's release unless he receives a new trial within "a reasonable time period." 

"For more than 13 years, Pedro Hernandez has been in prison for a crime he did not commit and based on a conviction that the Second Circuit has now made clear was obtained in clear violation of law," Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We are grateful the Court has now given Pedro a chance to get his life back, and we call upon the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to drop these misguided charges and focus their efforts where they belong – on finding those actually responsible for the disappearance of Etan Patz."

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

"This case highlights a broader issue in the legal system," Alpert said. "Confessions are not always reliable. Mental illness, coercion or desperation can all lead someone to admit guilt falsely. Without physical evidence to support a confession, courts must proceed with extreme caution. Understanding the psychology behind a confession is essential before treating it as fact."

CIA Director John Ratcliffe suggested that statute of limitations protection would not affect the Trump administration in their effort to prosecute those involved in investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. 

Ratcliffe claimed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper could be prosecuted for their role, claiming that they were still involved in a criminal conspiracy against Trump. 

He said there was “no doubt in my mind” that Clinton, Brennan, and Clapper “conspired.”

“They conspired against President Trump, they conspired against the American people. So, I'll leave it to Pam Bondi and our DOJ and Kash Patel and our FBI to investigate the conspiracy to do what, and what charges that they're capable of bringing,” Ratcliffe said on Fox News.

“I don't think statute of limitations are going to impact, because in a conspiracy, Maria, the statute of limitations doesn't start to run until the last act in the furtherance of that conspiracy,” Ratcliffe said. “Part of why this is so important is that the people behind this are still furthering the conspiracy.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents earlier this month that she claimed provided evidence that the Obama administration's intelligence officials “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork” for the FBI's later investigation into Russian ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Gabbard has said she has “the evidence” to prosecute Obama administration officials and that she was referring to documents from Obama administration officials to the Justice Department in a “criminal matter.” 

The recently declassified documents prove that Obama and top White House officials at the time directed investigators to advance narratives tying Trump to Russia with little evidence, according to Gabbard. 

Special Counsel John Durham's 2023 report found the FBI's handling of the probe into Trump's ties to Russia was “seriously deficient” in spots. 

SENATORS STAND BY 2016 RUSSIA ELECTION MEDDLING REPORT DESPITE GABBARD'S CLAIMS

Some Senators are standing by the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2020 findings of Russian collusion in the 2016 election. At the time the report was released, then-committee Chairman Marco Rubio said “then-candidate Trump was not complicit” in the collusion.

Democrats have additionally criticized Gabbard's release and prosecution suggestion. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Gabbard's threat to refer Obama administration officials to federal law enforcement for prosecution “dangerous” and said there was “absolutely” no legal basis for their prosecution.

President Donald Trump blasted the European Union for not providing aid to Gaza on Sunday, adding that Israel must "make a decision" about how to handle the region with Hamas still holding hostages.

Trump made the comments while meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland. He said that the U.S. has given millions in aid to Gazans, but claimed there has been no assistance from European countries.

"We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food for Gaza, and nobody acknowledged it. Nobody talks about it. And it makes you feel a little bad when you do that. And, you know, you have other countries not giving anything. None of the European countries, by the way, gave – I mean, nobody gave but us and nobody said, gee, thank you very much. And it would be nice to have at least a thank you."

Trump went on to note that a deal needs to be made between Israel and Hamas to end the war and return the last remaining hostages to Israel, despite many of them being dead.

"But we have a lot of bodies, and the parents want those bodies as much as they would want their child if that child were alive," Trump said of the hostages and their families.

He suggested that Hamas is reluctant to make a deal for the final hostages because they feel it would be "the end for them" if they lose leverage against Israel.

"You know, they had a routine discussion the other day and all of a sudden they hardened up. They don't want to give them back. And so Israel is going to have to make a decision," Trump said.

The meeting comes as the IDF highlighted its efforts to deliver aid into Gaza after restricting the flow in recent months.

Israel is now conducting airdrops for aid throughout the region, and the IDF says it conducted 28 drops in a matter of hours on Sunday.

President Donald Trump says Israel's leaders must "make a decision" about how to end the war in Gaza. 

"Let me be clear: Israel supports aid for civilians, not for Hamas. The IDF will continue to support the flow of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza," an IDF spokesperson said, claiming Israel transferred roughly 250 trucks full of aid into Gaza this week.

The IDF argues the reports about starvation in Gaza were a false campaign promoted by Hamas, but hunger is spreading across the region after the United Nations and the IDF previously failed to reach an agreement about aid distribution, Fox News' Trey Yingst reported.

Sofia Vergara spoke to Fox News Digital about her fellow "America's Got Talent" judges, saying she loves that everyone takes the show seriously and understands that it's important to the contestants. 

Sofía Vergara shared a health update with fans.

The 53-year-old "Modern Family" actress posted photos of herself in the hospital in a July 25 Instagram post, sharing that she had undergone a second knee surgery, although she didn't share the reason behind the operations.

"Its done! Round 2 🙏🏼❤️❤️#knee," she captioned the post.

One of the photos featured a makeup-free selfie of Vergara on a hospital bed, resting her cheek on her hand as she smiled for the camera while dressed in a hospital gown.

Vergara was referring to her boyfriend at the time, orthopedic surgeon Justin Saliman, whom she dated for over a year before announcing they had split in January 2025.

Following her breakup from Saliman, Vergara sparked romance rumors with retired football player, Tom Brady. The two were photographed together while on the Ritz-Carlton yacht during a star-studded European voyage.

In the photo, Vergara can be seen posing with her eyes closed as singer J Balvin kisses the top of her head, while Brady smiled at the camera as he sat next to the actress.

            Wildfires that have engulfed Turkey for weeks threatened the country's fourth-largest city early Sunday, causing more than 1,700 people to flee their homes and leaving a firefighter dead.
    


            Meanwhile, firefighters elsewhere in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro, were also battling blazes fed by unusually high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.
    


            Overnight fires in the forested mountains surrounding Bursa in northwest Turkey spread rapidly, tinting the night sky over the city's eastern suburbs with a red glow. Dozens of severe wildfires have hit the country daily since late June, with the government declaring two western provinces, Izmir and Bilecik, disaster areas on Friday.
    


            Bursa governor's office said in a statement Sunday that 1,765 people had been safely evacuated from villages to the northeast as more than 1,900 firefighters battled the flames. The highway linking Bursa to the capital, Ankara, was closed as surrounding forests burned.

            A firefighter died from a heart attack while on the job, the city's mayor, Mustafa Bozbey, said in a statement, adding that the flames had scorched 3,000 hectares (7,413 acres) around the city.
    


            Orhan Saribal, an opposition parliamentarian for the province, described the scene as “an apocalypse.”
    


            By morning, lessening winds brought some respite to firefighters, who continued efforts to battle the flames. However, TV footage revealed an ashen landscape where farms and pine forests had earlier stood.
    


            Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said fire crews across the country confronted 84 separate blazes Saturday. The country's northwest was under the greatest threat, including Karabuk, where wildfires have burned since Tuesday, he said.
    


            Unseasonably high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds have been fueling the wildfires.
    


            The General Directorate of Meteorology said Turkey recorded its highest ever temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern Sirnak province on Friday. The highest temperatures for July were seen in 132 other locations, it said.
    


            Fourteen people have died in recent weeks, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers killed Wednesday in a fire in Eskisehir in western Turkey.
    


            Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said late Saturday that prosecutors had investigated fires in 33 provinces since June 26, and that legal action had been taken against 97 suspects.
    


            In Greece, firefighters battled active wildfires in the country's southwest and on the island of Kythera on Sunday, following a blaze that scorched the northern Athens suburb of Kryoneri on Saturday. High temperatures, reaching 38°C (100°F) or more, persist across much of the country, though winds have eased slightly.
    


            In Kryoneri, 27 residents were evacuated overnight with police assistance after some initially ignored warnings. Authorities urged the public to comply with evacuation orders, warning that resistance puts both civilians and rescuers in danger.
    


            The fire service reported three people hospitalized with breathing issues and one firefighter treated for burns at a military hospital. On the island of Evia, where another fire is now under control, media reports indicate large numbers of animals perished in barns.
    


            On Bulgaria's southern borders with Greece and Turkey, as well as the western Serbian frontier, firefighters battled wildfires as the government declared the worst-hit provinces disaster zones. Residents across nearly half the country were issued with a code red warning, the highest level.
    


            National Fire Service chief Alexander Djartov told reporters that 236 wildfires were burning, many fanned by strong winds. The government had asked EU partners for help, he added, and aircraft were expected from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Hungary and Sweden later Sunday.
    


            In the southwestern Strumyani region, overnight blazes forced firefighters to retreat. They were reinforced Sunday by soldiers. Dozens of people fled their homes in the western Tran region as flames threatened villages near the Serbian border.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) claimed former President Barack Obama oversaw disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal when Epstein first came into legal trouble under former President George W. Bush. 

“In 2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made under the Obama administration with Epstein,” Mullin said, adding, “That sweetheart has not been exposed.”

“No, that's not right. It was 2008. The U.S. attorney at the time was Alex Acosta. He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become President Trump's secretary of labor,” CNN's Jake Tapper replied on State of the Union.

Mullin continued, however, to claim incorrectly that the case was handled in 2009 under Obama. 

In 2008, Epstein struck a plea deal with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who was appointed to that role and several others in the Bush administration. 

The deal allowed Epstein to avoid a harsher sentence on allegations that he sexually abused underage girls by pleading guilty to state charges in Florida. Epstein served 13 months in Palm Beach County jail and was given extensive work release during the day. He also became a registered sex offender.

Many have questioned Acosta for the lenient deal. Acosta later served in the first Trump administration before resigning from his post as secretary of labor in July 2019, when Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, after months of scrutiny over the deal. 

Mullin objected last week to an amendment in the Senate to release files related to Epstein from Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) during a floor debate. In his objection, Mullin said he was trying to “give him cover” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump. 

“I'm sure this would be handled just like any other thing that they've tried to go after, like the baseless impeachments or the baseless special counsels or the unbelievable amount of charges they've tried to file against the president. I'm sure this would be handled the exact same way. What we're simply wanting to do here is give him cover,” Mullin said. 

MAGA ANGER OVER EPSTEIN FILES GIVES TRUMP LIMITED OPTIONS TO QUELL DIVISIONS

The Trump administration has been embattled by the uproar from Trump's voting base over its refusal to release the Epstein files. 

The Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo nearly three weeks ago that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino for years gave voice to conspiracies about Epstein's death and his so-called client list.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump's 'historic' trade deal with Japan and the advancements in artificial intelligence.

Japanese populist Sohei Kamiya stunned many in the country when his Sanseitō party won 14 seats in Japan's Upper House elections last week.

"From supermarket manager to bright political star … populism has hit the shores of Japan like a tsunami," Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital about 47-year-old Kamiya's surprise achievement. 

Holding 15 of 248 Upper House seats is not sufficient for Kamiya's party to submit legislation. However, polling data shows Sanseitō's impact with younger voters, as Kyodo News reported that more than 20% of voters from 18 to 40 voted for his party.

TRUMP SECURES HISTORIC $550B TRADE DEAL WITH JAPAN: ‘NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT'

Inspired by President Donald Trump's leadership style, Kamiya's rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to "blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.

Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump's MAGA motto, proclaiming "Japanese first" as his party promises to strengthen Japan's culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration. 

Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya's goals of "protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan" are "fairly populist," they do not represent "a radical move towards the right wing." 

In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, "are more right-wing than Sanseitō." Gatling described members of Kamiya's party as "pretty reasonable." 

Gaitlin said that Kamiya, formerly a reservist in the Self-Defense Forces and an English teacher, "doesn't appear to be playing." Kamiya "has been honing his message for some time," Gatling said.

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO BIDEN CLAIM THAT JAPAN IS ‘XENOPHOBIC': ‘UNFORTUNATE'

Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya's anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan "xenophobic" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. "It's not that we're xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures," Kamiya said. "You are meddling too much in our internal affairs." 

Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic "just doesn't ring true." He explained that the country has "one of the most astonishing cultures in history," formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create "a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world."

Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.

The rice trade would be critical to this arrangement, with Sanseitō eager to curb imports of U.S. rice. At present, imports of U.S. rice are set to increase by 75%, thanks to a $550 billion trade deal President Donald Trump signed with Japan on July 22.

Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseitō's desire to turn the nation's farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. "The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP," he explained. "I'm not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees."

While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseitō in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not "interested in building a coalition government." Gatling believes the party's future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that "they have reasonable policies."

Chang said Sanseitō's win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has "been adrift" since Abe's 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba "is weak and unpopular," and the LDP now finds itself "in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955," Chang said. "Ishiba is naturally catching the blame."

While the political waves leave Japan "rudderless," Chang said to "expect Sanseitō to only get stronger, which means Japan will turn inward. Around the world, societies have had enough of large foreign populations that do not assimilate, so we should not be surprised that Kamiya will become even more influential.

"Change occurs slowly in Japan until it happens all at once. Japan is now on the verge of an all-at-once moment," Chang said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday that Rep. James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, could question former first lady Jill Biden and the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Republican lawmakers have been rallying against former President Joe Biden for his use of an autopen to issue pardons. The committee has called Biden administration officials to Capitol Hill to testify.

“Even though Anthony Fauci has been pardoned, there is some question whether it's a legitimate pardon. His pardon wasn't signed by President Biden,” Paul said during an appearance on the radio show Cats Roundtable on WABC 770 AM.

“It's unclear whether President Biden is mentally cognizant enough of the situation to know who he pardoned. Hundreds and hundreds of people were pardoned in a day by a mechanical signature from a machine. We do know there's been testimony from the people running the machine that they never talked to the president, that they talked to an assistant that works for the president's wife,” he added. 

Many members of the Biden administration have pleaded their Fifth Amendment rights in the congressional investigation. Biden's chief of staff until 2023, however, testified for several hours last week. 

Biden has argued that other presidents in previous administrations have used an autopen. Republicans have still questioned their validity. 

Paul pointed to Biden's pardon of his son Hunter Biden that was seemingly not signed using an autopen.

“I think there is a question whether these pardons are valid. Interestingly, when he had to do the pardon for his son, he didn't take any chances by running it for the autopen,” Paul said.

“The pardon for Hunter Biden for any crimes committed over the last 10 years, any crimes, was done by personal hand signature by Biden, not the autopen,” he added.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss his push to move New Yorkers to Florida, the GOP aiming to confirm President Donald Trump's nominees and his meeting with Venezuelan leader Maria Corina Machado. 

Florida Sen. Rick Scott flew an aerial ad across the skies of New York City on Saturday with a message encouraging residents to relocate to the Sunshine State to escape socialism, should Zohran Mamdani become mayor of the Big Apple.

The banner was seen above Coney Island and Jones Beach as beachgoers soaked up the sun. 

"Hate socialism?" read Scott's aerial ad. "Us too! Move 2 FL."

Scott addressed the aerial banner in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

"While many New Yorkers are out enjoying the beach this weekend, we will be giving them a friendly reminder that in addition to our world class beaches, Florida is the state where you can escape socialism," said Scott, who headed the state as governor from 2011-2019.

The Republican senator slammed New York City and the politics of Mamdani.

"New York City once represented the American Dream – a city where anything was possible," Scott said. "Today, it has now become the city where only billionaires can prosper, Jewish students are attacked on campus, capitalism is shunned and radical socialists like Zohran Mamdani are celebrated."

Mamdani handily won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary last month against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is seen as a frontrunner in the race for City Hall, though many in the Democratic establishment have yet to fully embrace the socialist nominee.

Scott said New York City reaped the rewards of capitalism, "the best system in the world," which is now "being villainized by the Democrats all across this country."

"Democrats are working around the clock to discredit President Trump and tear down our country and rebuild it in their woke, radical image through socialist policies," the Republican said. "But, this isn't new.  It's just an old, barbaric, discredited idea that's failed every time it's been tried.  Just look at Cuba and Venezuela and the many families who fled those brutal regimes to live in Florida."

Scott said that during his time in political office he worked to ensure that families in Florida could achieve the American Dream, including good jobs, education and safe communities.

"That is the American Dream and it is deeply unfortunate that it is completely slipping away in New York," he said. "New York families deserve better."

A 12-foot-sculpted head of Elon Musk with the phrase "Make America Wait Again" is turning heads at Yosemite, Arches and Mt. Rainier National Parks this summer.

EXCLUSIVE: During this high summer season, visitors to several of America's most iconic national parks have found themselves face to face with something unexpected: the towering 12-foot-sculpted head of Elon Musk, smirking confidently atop a trailer. 

It's flanked by patriotic stars and a two-part message: "MAKE AMERICA WAIT AGAIN" and, in bold yellow below, "Now With Longer Lines Thanks to DOGE Cuts."

The sculpture has made surprise appearances at Arches, Yosemite and Mt. Rainier National Parks, drawing curious crowds and fueling viral conversations online.

Now, the anonymous organizer behind the spectacle has come forward exclusively to Fox News Digital to explain why he built it, why he picked Musk — President Donald Trump's former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leader and policy advisor — and why he wanted it seen in America's favorite outdoor spaces.

"You're not the first outlet people would expect to run this," the anonymous backer said during a phone interview. "Which is exactly why I wanted to talk to you."

Identifying only as a concerned citizen and "curious reader," the man insists he has no ties to any political organization, nonprofit, or corporate interest. "No organizations, no parties — just me and a few people who care," he said.

He explained that the sculpture is "part protest, part performance art," aimed at drawing attention to recent layoffs and budget reductions across the National Park Service.'AMERICAN HERO' OR 'FAILURE': ELON MUSK'S DOGE DEPARTURE DIVIDES CAPITOL HILL

"However you feel about the DOGE cuts, and we're using that word tongue-in-cheek, the reality is that thousands of people who love these parks and work to protect them were let go or impacted. And nobody's really talking about it anymore."

The parks were a deliberate choice. "National parks are one of the few truly nonpartisan joys we have in this country," he said. "Democrats, Republicans, independents — everyone loves the outdoors."

He chose Mt. Rainier for this weekend's installation, he said, because of the high-season congestion and overflowing parking lots. 

"It's incredibly packed. One lane in, one lane out. The parking lots are overflowing — you literally can't park to see the most popular spots," he said. "It just felt … poetic."

Park visitors' reactions were wide-ranging. Some posed for photos, others made rude gestures, and many simply stared.

"People crowded around it, took photos, laughed, flipped it off, gave it thumbs-up," he said. "It ran the gamut — a good cross-section of America."

The sculpture, built by a Michigan-based artist found online, was designed to look lifelike, and just exaggerated enough to be meme-ready. 

"We looked for someone who could do something photo-realistic on a big scale but still work within a budget," he said. "We really wanted the smirk. That very self-satisfied look."

As for the sign, "MAKE AMERICA WAIT AGAIN" was no accident. The nod to a certain president's famous slogan is deliberate, the backer admitted, but it isn't meant to target any particular political side. "It's meant to spark conversation," he said. 

"Everyone has an opinion about Elon Musk. But I wanted this to cut across political lines."

When asked why he insists on remaining anonymous, the backer didn't dodge the question. "There's something fun about the mystery," he said. "It's not important who I am. It's about what this statue represents."

Images of the Musk bust have set Reddit ablaze. Comments from just one post from r/pics include:

The mystery creator acknowledges the risks of such a public display but believes the message matters.

"Major things happen in our country, real, damaging things, and we forget them because the news cycle spins so fast," he said. "This is a loud, silly way to not forget."

When asked what he'd say directly to Musk, he didn't hesitate: "Stick to making cars, and stay out of screwing up the government."

The backer says the National Parks themselves are what unite Americans in divided times. "It is like common knowledge that becoming a park ranger is something you do for the love, not for the money," he said. "So when they were fired or stretched thin, it hurt something we all share."

When pressed about his own political leanings, he said only: "I'm definitely not a Republican, and I wouldn't call myself a Democrat either. . . . I think there are aspects of both parties that, in my opinion, do certain things right and certain things wrong."

But why bring the project to Fox News Digital? "Because I think that you're not the first audience people would think of to cover this. And I think that's fantastic," he said. "That makes me thrilled. Because we're all Americans and we all have different views and different things we enjoy. Funny things and weird things and bizarre things and pretty things."

As for what comes next, the head is going to more parks, but where and when remain a mystery. "I can't tell you, but I'm happy to keep telling you in the right moment."

            At least 21 people were killed on Sunday in an attack on church premises in eastern Congo by Islamic State-backed rebels, according to a civil society leader.
    


            The attack was carried out by members of the Allied Democratic Force (ADF) around 1 a.m. inside the premises of a Catholic church in eastern Congo's Komanda. Several houses and shops were also burnt.
    


            “More than 21 people were shot dead inside and outside and we have recorded at least three charred bodies and several houses burned. But the search is continuing,” Dieudonne Duranthabo, a civil society coordinator in Komanda, told The Associated Press.
    


            Earlier this month, the group killed dozens of people in Ituri in what a United Nations spokesperson described as a bloodbath.
    


            A spokesperson for the Congolese army in Ituri province, where Komanda is located, confirmed 10 dead.
    


            “What we know this morning is that there was an incursion by armed men with machetes into a church not far from Komanda, where about 10 people were killed and massacred and some shops were set on fire,” Lt. Jules Ngongo, the DRC Army's spokesperson in Ituri, said.
    


            The ADF, with ties with the Islamic State, is a rebel group that operates in the borderland between Uganda and Congo, has routinely conducted attacks against civilian populations.
    


            “We are truly disappointed because it is incredible that such a situation could occur in a town where all the security officials are present,” Duranthabo said. “Some citizens have started fleeing the area and are heading towards Bunia.
    


            “We demand military intervention as soon as possible, since we are told the enemy is still near our town.”
    


What's driving the deadly conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo? An expert explains



            The ADF was formed by disparate small groups in Uganda in the late 1990s following alleged discontent with Yoweri Museveni.
    


            In 2002, following military assaults by Ugandan forces, the group moved its activities to neighboring DRC and has since been responsible for the killings of thousands of civilians. In 2019, it pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The ADF's leadership conceives of an Islamist government in the East African country.
    


            The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) has long struggled against the rebel group, and it has now been grappling with a complex web of attacks since the renewed hostilities between the Rwanda-backed M23.

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., weighs in on Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Israeli and Qatari officials in Rome as the Trump administration continues the push for a ceasefire in Gaza.

The State Department and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have joined a chorus of analysts this week in warning Fox News Digital of "significant threats to U.S. national security" from the actions of Iran in Africa. 

Tehran is accused of reportedly buying uranium in Niger, supplying drones in violation of a U.N. arms embargo to forces in Sudan and promoting the growth of destabilizing Islamist fundamentalism and terrorism on the continent.

"Iran's long arm of terror stretches around the globe, including in Africa", Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, told Fox News Digital, adding, "Iran is an enemy to freedom everywhere, and a threat to U.S. national security; our partners in Africa must proceed with caution before engaging with this dangerous, authoritarian regime."

Reports surfaced initially last year from first the French media outlet Africa Intelligence, and then the Washington-based NGO the Institute for Science and International Security, that the West African nation of Niger had been negotiating the sale to Tehran of $56 million worth of so-called yellow cake – uranium oxide. The 300 tons of uranium, some of which, one source suggests, has been partly delivered already, would allegedly be enough to make 30 nuclear weapons.

Analysts say Niger could be preparing to sell even more ‘yellow cake' to Iran. Uranium in the country has up until recently been mined by mostly French companies, such as Orano. But Niger's military leaders, who came to power in a coup in 2023, announced that they will revoke mining licenses and nationalize mining operations. Iran is said to want to strike a deal to start uranium mining itself in Niger, particularly around Imouraren, an area where the ground is estimated to contain 200,000 tons of the metal.

In a move seen to be towards Russia and Iran, Niger ended an agreement with the Biden administration last year, which led to the closing of two U.S. military bases in the country that were used for anti-terror operations.

‘PEACEMAKER' TRUMP CAN END AFRICA'S BIGGEST WAR, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR SAYS

"In Niger, French outlets covering the continent have reported that there is a secret agreement between Iran and Niger trading uranium oxide for either drones or energy," Behnam Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. Taleblu, senior Director of the Iran Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) added, "The Islamic Republic is an opportunistic actor, both in the Middle East and further abroad."

A State Department spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Iran's activities in Africa are on their radar, saying, "On Niger, we are monitoring the possibility of an Iranian acquisition of uranium. We would have serious concerns about Niger, or any country, transferring uranium to Iran."

The spokesperson continued, "Iran's continued development of its nuclear program, (and its) role as the leading state sponsor of terrorism, and destabilizing regional behavior, pose significant threats to U.S. national security and to global stability.

"The President has been clear: Iran cannot ever have a nuclear weapon."

Iran, said to be interested in Sudan's gold, has been supplying Mohajer-6 drones to Khartoum's government, according to the U.S. Africa Command's Africa Defense Forum. They were used effectively by Sudan in recently reclaiming the capital city, Khartoum and the Presidential Palace.

The FDD's Taleblu added, "Iranian drones are active on four continents today, one of which is the African continent, particularly when looking at the conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia."

The State Department spokesperson weighed in "On Sudan, we are aware of reports. Both the RSF and the SAF have used weapons acquired from foreign actors against the civilian population and infrastructure and have committed human rights violations and abuses.

"Supplying arms to any of the belligerents prolongs the conflict and heightens the risk of further destabilization in Sudan and the region. The United States calls for an end to all external support to the warring parties, and urges all our partners to press for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities, and increased, unhindered humanitarian access," the spokesperson concluded.

Then there is Iran's reported psychological warfare against Africa's communities. "Iran's core Africa strategy is to export its ideology into those communities as a counter-balance to what it sees as anti-Iranian efforts in the Middle East," Frans Cronje, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom and a former head of the South African Institute of Race Relations told Fox News Digital.

IRAN VOWS RETALIATION IF UN SECURITY COUNCIL ISSUES SNAPBACK SANCTIONS ON ANNIVERSARY OF NUCLEAR DEAL

Cronje continued, "Africa has 1.5 billion people. Approximately a third of those are Muslim and make up a quarter of all Muslims worldwide, more than the number in the Middle East. Muslims serve as dominant groups across much of North Africa and down the African east coast." 

"The Iranian Africa strategy can be thought of as having three components," Cronje stated. "The first is the provision of training and material support to extremist groups in Africa to aid in the export of terror globally, and to target Christians and pro-Western communities on the continent, whilst creating a high-threat environment for Western investors.

"To that end the global terror threat index scores for several African countries have come to exceed those of traditional Middle Eastern terror staples. Africa's Christians face increasing volumes of horrific attacks, including Christian church burnings and beheadings, and it has become common for Africa to account for the bulk of global terror-related deaths annually.

In this June 6, 2018, frame grab from Islamic Republic Iran Broadcasting, IRIB, state-run TV, three versions of domestically built centrifuges are shown in a live TV program from Natanz, an Iranian uranium enrichment plant, in Iran.  

"The second is to identify both Shia and Sunni communities that can be radicalized against the West as well as against Iranian opponents in the Arab world. Iran has employed Al-Mustafa academic and cultural centers in over 30 African countries to train clerics and religious leaders.

"A third pillar of the strategy is that Iran has deepened diplomatic and economic cooperation ties with scores of African governments and business organizations to win trade and investment deals that help it evade global sanctions, as well as securing the diplomatic support of African governments on global fora such as the U.N., for measures ranging from its nuclear weapons program to its investment in proxy forces that threaten Israel.

"For example," Cronje concluded, "just a few months ago, over 700 delegates from nearly 40 African countries attended an investment conference in Tehran."

Summing up, the FDD's Taleblu said "the threat the Islamic Republic poses on the African continent is both significant and diverse. From seeking to export its revolution through religious indoctrination via state-linked religious seminaries, to drone sales, the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism has not missed this opportunity to cause chaos while flying below the radar of the West."

"The Blue Angels" documentary was made so that America and the world can see the team's "exceptionalism" and maybe even inspire people to join the U.S. Navy, filmmaker Paul Crowder and retired Navy Capt. Greg Wooldridge said.

Seattle climate activists are protesting an upcoming U.S. Navy Blue Angels airshow, claiming the jets pollute the environment, while a local woman filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the military jets traumatized her ailing cat. 

The Blue Angels, the elite military flight demonstration team consisting of 140 active-duty Sailors and Marines, aims to "showcase the excitement, precision, and power of naval aviation" with their performances, now in their 79th year, the Blue Angels website says. The squadron has been performing at Seattle's Seafair festival since 1972.

The Airshow Climate Action Coalition put up a billboard in Seattle this week declaring, "Say No to Blue Angels." The coalition, made up of members from local climate groups as well as the radical global climate group, Extinction Rebellion, is planning to march and hold a rally on August 2 in protest of the Blue Angels airshow that weekend.

The billboard depicts people with hands over their ears and others raising their fists in protest of the jets, which they wrote cause "war trauma" and pollution. At the billboard's unveiling on Tuesday, protesters held signs reading "Demilitarize Seafair" and "No military airshows."

‘BLUE ANGELS' DOC SHOWS HOW ‘INCREDIBLE' ICONIC AVIATION TEAM, U.S. NAVY ARE AMID RECRUITMENT WOES

The climate activists are calling for military fighter jets to be excluded from participating in the annual event and demanding military airshows be scrutinized for their "harmful waste of resources, pollution and carbon emissions."

Aedan McCall, who designed the billboard, lived on Mercer Island for over 10 years before leaving because of the effects from the show.

"The sheer amount of carbon emissions the Blue Angels create - 670 tons in one weekend - is immense and wasteful on top of being a big display of U.S. militarism, McCall told The Seattle Times.

Community organizer Kimberly Larson crafted a petition calling for the end of the Blue Angels show, which has garnered over 5,000 signatures.

The Blue Angels are also facing criticism from a Seattle woman who blames the noisy airshow for leading to the death of her sickly, elderly cat.

Lauren Ann Lombardi filed a lawsuit against Blue Angels officers in federal court on Monday, claiming her "beloved family member was terrorized" by the Blue Angels' "state-sanctioned acoustic torture."

The lawsuit claims the noise of the low-flying F/A-18 fighter jets spurred panic attacks in the cat, who was in critical condition due to her worsening congestive heart disease, and ultimately led to her euthanasia in August 2024.

Lombardi accused the Blue Angels of unconstitutionally blocking her profanity-laced comments criticizing the U.S. Navy squadron on its Instagram page. She is seeking a court order to unblock her account and prohibit the Blue Angels from blocking any other accounts "on the basis of viewpoint."

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on the 'closed-door meeting' as leaders wish to know more about the democratic socialist's plans to run the Big Apple on 'America Reports.'

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—two of America's most prominent socialist politicians—have committed identity theft. No, they did not pilfer a Social Security number or swipe the digits of someone else's credit card. They have done something more subtle: stealing the image of the oppressed for personal and political gain.

It's an old trick. Just as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., claimed Native American heritage as she ascended the ranks of academia, Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez adopted the identities of the poor and downtrodden as they ascended the ranks of politics. Both built their political personas on a small kernel of truth: Mamdani claimed on his college application to be black because he was born in Uganda, despite being the son of two famous, affluent, and educated Indians; Ocasio-Cortez claimed to be a "Bronx girl" because she lived in the borough until age five, when she moved to a tony corner of Westchester County, New York. Both have structured their identities around grand narratives of oppressor and oppressed, which they hope to convert into power and prestige.

The truth is that both Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez belong to groups—Indians and Latinos, respectively—that do not fit neatly into America's deepest historical binary, that between White and Black, colonist and slave. Though both could doubtlessly point toward some personal slight or past injustice against their ethnic group, neither Mamdani nor Ocasio-Cortez can lay a real claim to historical oppression. Indian Americans are among the most educated and affluent groups in America, and the vast majority of Latinos arrived in the United States after desegregation and the Civil Rights Act. The very fact that millions of people uprooted themselves from India and Latin America to try their luck in this country indicates that they considered America a land of opportunity, rather than injustice.

NYC SOCIALIST WOULD-BE MAYOR ZOHRAN MAMDANI THROWS LAVISH WEDDING BASH IN UGANDA

For Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, however, the myth of post-Civil Rights Act discrimination must be maintained at all costs. Both use their privilege—Mamdani, graduate of Bowdoin and son of a professor; Ocasio-Cortez, graduate of Boston University and daughter of an architect—to advance their narrative of oppression.

They do it because it works. Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez have translated the politics of resentment to win political campaigns in Queens and the Bronx, respectively. They motivate anxious, college-educated left-wing activists, who run the ground game for their campaigns and harvest the support of working-class and minority voters in the outer boroughs.

It has always been thus. Marx and Engels were sons of affluence; Lenin was a lawyer; Mao was a librarian at Peking University. Left-wing radicals abandoned the theory of spontaneous working-class revolution not long after they hatched it. The "vanguard of the proletariat" has been their dominant concept since the Russian Revolution. And identity theft—claiming to represent the poor, the downtrodden, the oppressed—has been their dominant tactic.

How should opponents respond? Pointing out the fraud might be effective. After all, Warren never fully recovered from the revelation that she misrepresented her ancestry in pursuit of power. But it will be harder with the new generation of identity thieves, such as Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, who are skilled at political agitprop and can rely on their racial minority status to make some critics reluctant to go after them.

The better approach is to frame the argument around two concepts: America and manipulation. First, critics should point out that millions of people around the world want to come to America for its opportunities, equality under law, and genuinely tolerant culture; the Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez families have become successful precisely because of this country's system, which should be celebrated rather than condemned.

Second, critics should portray such politicians as dishonest and self-serving, public figures who misrepresent their backgrounds in pursuit of personal status and manipulate voters to advance destructive ideologies. Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez's policies will yield the opposite of what they promise, as socialist policies have done in the past.

Regrettably, the identity-theft strategy will remain with us for the foreseeable future. When I was an undergraduate at Georgetown University, I noticed that many of the most affluent and connected students had prepared an oppression narrative or sob story—not out of modesty but ambition. They sensed, correctly, that a story of racial, psychological, or familial trauma would grant them status and a competitive edge. I saw the sons of Middle Eastern sheiks and the daughters of American moguls rehearsing lines about supposed oppression that are now familiar in the national discourse.

The trouble is that fake identities can yield real consequences. Zohran Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are elites masquerading as the oppressed. If they are successful, they will create a system that rewards people like them and punishes those below.

These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat.

During a nasty summer heat wave — see: much of the US right now — water is a reliable source of relief. Where there are no rivers or lakes to swim in, we still might have swimming pools, sprinklers, and popsicles to keep ourselves cool.

Wild animals don't have such luxuries.

Bouts of extreme heat and drought — which are becoming more common and less predictable as global temperatures rise — can cause natural watering holes in many different types of ecosystems to dry up. And animals don't have a tap they can simply turn on. That leaves them with few places to hydrate and cool off, putting their lives, often already imperiled, at risk.

But in some parts of the world, humans are offering help. In the jungles of northern Guatemala, which have been abnormally hot in recent years, environmental groups placed several large tubs of water in nature reserves. They refill them regularly, providing a reliable source of fresh water that animals can drink from or splash in, even when there's no rain. And luckily for us, they also put motion-activated cameras nearby to see which animals were using them.

You might call them thirst traps.

“The diversity of species using the water sources was amazing,” said Gabriela Ponce, head of Wildlife Conservation Society Guatemala, a group involved in the project with several others, including the local Guatemala NGO Foundation for Ecodevelopment and Conservation.

The footage reveals a diverse cast of jungle characters, including those that are rarely seen, like jaguars and tapirs — large herbivores with distinct trunk-like noses. It also exposed some interesting animal behaviors, Ponce said. Researchers noticed that spider monkeys seemed to prefer drinking from raised water containers — perhaps so that they can quickly escape if predators approach, Ponce said.

Wild animals are often more sensitive to environmental impacts than we are. They don't have technologies like air conditioning and water purification to survive all the ways in which we're altering the planet, from heating it up to filling it with pollution. And when climate disasters hit, the impacts are often devastating to wild animals, too.

But there are simple ways to help wildlife cope with the world we've created for them, like putting out (clean) hummingbird feeders and bird baths or extinguishing invasive mosquitos that are spreading avian malaria.

“Artificial watering holes are not a permanent solution,” Rony García-Anleu, who leads biological research at Wildlife Conservation Society Guatemala, said in a press release. “But they are a vital tool in helping wildlife adapt to increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions.”

French President Emmanuel Macron was likely motivated to declare his intent to recognize Palestine by a desire to quell Islamic separatism in his own country.

The decision, announced on Thursday, is a break from the ranks of the European establishment, which has offered limp support to a two-state solution without daring to recognize the territories during the ongoing conflict with Israel.

Growing discontent within his own nation's borders, concerns about religious extremism, and a government report pushing for Palestinian state recognition point to the idea that his decision might have been motivated by self-interest.

“France's recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state must be motivated by domestic French politics, because it certainly does nothing to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace,” Orde Kittrie, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and law professor at Arizona State University, speculated to the Washington Examiner.

Kittrie, who also served for over a decade as an attorney at the United States's State Department, pointed to the tumultuous relationship between the French government and Islamic communities within its borders as a possible motivator.

“France's Muslim population numbers over 6 million, the largest in Europe, and Macron has recently undertaken a crackdown on what he calls Islamic separatism in France, which has led to accusations that his government is making it harder for Muslims to express their identity.”

She continued, “Macron's foreign policy move to throw Israel under the bus was evidently taken to appease Muslim critics of his domestic crackdown on Islamic separatism.”

The assertion that Macron is offering gestures towards Palestine for domestic benefit is not without basis. The French government itself has acknowledged that such a move could help appease Muslim citizens, who accuse their leaders of Islamophobia.

The French Ministry of Interior released a report in May that noted a “tense climate prevailing in France following October 7 between Jewish and Muslim communities” and “deep unease within the latter, which perceives the French position as openly pro-Israel, in line with an alleged ‘state Islamophobia,' supporting Jewish Israelis against Muslim Palestinians.” 

The report claimed that this dichotomy is being weaponized by the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist groups operating clandestinely in France to radicalize Muslim citizens.

The Interior Ministry report explicitly suggested the recognition of Palestine as a means of quelling Islamic unrest, according to a translation from the Center for Security Policy.

“To counter this narrative, and independently of the measures mentioned in this report that would reaffirm that Muslim faith and culture are as respectable as others and that the Republic guarantees their free exercise and manifestation, France's recognition of a Palestinian state alongside Israel within secure and recognized borders could help alleviate these frustrations.”

France is home to approximately 9 million Muslims, the second-largest religion in the country behind Christianity.

The country has passed an abundance of laws cracking down on what Macron calls “Islamic separatism,” an ideology he believes is an “enemy of the Republic”. Previous laws restricting religious expression in public spaces have been augmented by crackdowns on illicit Islamic homeschools, doctors providing “virginity certificates,” instances of clandestine polygamy, and reports of forced marriages.

These measures have only inflamed tensions between Muslims and the rest of French society.

If Macron was hoping for support in his decision from across the Atlantic, he is likely disappointed.

President Donald Trump dismissed the announcement as meaningless while speaking to Friday's reporters at the White House.

UK, GERMANY, FRANCE HOLD CALL ON GAZA AFTER MACRON SAYS HE'LL RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE

“What he says doesn't matter,” Trump said. “He's a very good guy. I like him. But that statement doesn't carry weight.”

Kittrie claims the French government's decision to appease Palestinian leaders is weakening U.S. negotiating positions, providing the illusion of a path forward outside previously established demands.

“Macron's statement undercuts both the United States and Middle East peace by relieving pressure on the Palestinians to compromise with Israel,” she explained to the Washington Examiner. “Hamas is a lot less likely to agree to release the hostages, and Abbas is a lot less likely to agree to peace with Israel, when European leaders like Macron are making unilateral concessions.”

France's decision is expected to be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

A Republican senator who is pushing legislation to tax remittances that Mexican citizens in the United States send to Mexico described Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's campaign to guide Mexicans from paying the taxes as a “desperate” move.

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) blasted first-term Sheinbaum in a statement to the Washington Examiner for how she vowed to fight back against a 1% tax that Congress had authorized to be imposed on money sent to people outside the U.S. under the One Big, Beautiful Bill.

“Mass migration is not only a bad policy choice, it's also a booming industry, and Mexico is one of its top beneficiaries. That's why Claudia Sheinbaum is desperate to help her fellow countrymen here in the U.S. avoid our new tax on remittances,” Schmitt said.

Schmitt added that Sheinbaum's opposition to the remittance tax was the very reason why the U.S. needed to take action to address the underlying issue and the remittances.

Sheinbaum proposed last week that Mexicans living in the U.S. use a new government bank card to avoid paying the U.S. a tax on money sent back to people in Mexico. The card is generated by the Mexican government's Financial Institution for Well-Being, known as Finabien.

“Mexico refuses to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into our nation because they have a huge financial incentive to maximize mass migration into the U.S.,” Schmitt said. “It's time for Congress to pass my REMIT Act to increase the tax on remittances and end the financial incentives for mass migration.”

Last month, Schmitt proposed the Requiring Excise for Migrant Income Transfers (REMIT) Act, which would go significantly further than the recently passed bill and increase the remittance tax to 15%.

A newly released study by the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, an immigration organization that advocates restricting immigration, concluded that people working in the U.S. send more than $200 billion to their home countries annually.

The majority of that money was sent to recipients in Mexico, followed by India, Guatemala, the Philippines, and China.

“In some cases, remittances intentionally or unintentionally support cartels, human smugglers, terrorists, and organized crime,” according to a preview of the analysis obtained by the Washington Examiner.

“Approximately $4.4 billion out of the $58.5 billion in total remittances sent to Mexico in 2022 were potentially linked to cartels,” it added.

            If you regularly make donations to tax-exempt charities and non-profits, you should be aware of upcoming rule changes governing how much of your contributions will be deductible.
    


            Some of the changes, which are in President Donald Trump's recently enacted federal tax-and-spending cuts packag﻿e, affect filers who take the standard deduction. Others affect filers who itemize — which you do when your individual deductions combined exceed the standard.
    


            Here's a rundown of some key changes that will take effect in 2026:
    


            In the first two years of the pandemic, if you took the standard deduction on your federal income tax return, you also were allowed to deduct an additional $300 ($600 for married couples filing jointly) for charitable cash gifts you made. That special provision then expired.
    


            But, starting in 2026 you will be allowed to deduct up to $1,000 in cash donations ($2,000 for joint filers).
    


            “This applies only to direct cash gifts to qualifying 501(c)(3) charities — not donor-advised funds or private foundations,” said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals.
    


            Starting in 2026, those who itemize their deductions will — for the first time — be allowed to deduct their cash contributions ﻿only to the extent they exceed 0.5% of their adjusted gross income.

            For example, say your adjusted gross income is $100,000. You will be allowed to deduct the amount of your total cash gifts minus $500 (0.5% of $100,000. So if you make $2,000 in cash contributions, you only will be allowed to deduct $1,500.
    


            An existing rule that further limits itemizers will remain in effect: It sets a ceiling for how much you may deduct of your contributions to public charities in a given year. Specifically, you can't deduct the portion of your cash donations that exceed 60% of your AGI in the year you make them, O'Saben said. (The AGI limit is typically 30% for cash gifts made to donor-advised funds and private foundations, he added.)
    


            But you may be able to deduct any cash gifts you made outside the allowable limits in the next tax year. That's thanks to another existing rule that lets itemizers carry forward their “excess” contributions for five years and deduct them on future returns. The “excess” is any portion of your cash donations that exceeds the AGI ceiling and, starting next year, falls below the new floor of 0.5% of AGI.
    


            Say your AGI is $100,000 next year. You will be allowed to carry forward the first $500 of your cash gifts (0.5% x $100,000) plus any remainder of your donations above $60,000 (60% of your AGI).
    


            Lastly, O'Saben noted, “You cannot double-dip. If itemizing, you're not eligible for the $1,000/$2,000 deduction, as that's reserved for non-itemizers.”
    


            The value of one's deductions for anyone whose taxable income puts them in the top tax bracket of 37% will be treated as if they were in the 35% bracket.

            Here's how that will work: Say you itemize and are allowed to deduct $10,000 in cash donations after accounting for the new 0.5% of AGI rule above. Typically, the itemized charitable deductions will reduce your tax bill by an amount equal to your top tax rate multiplied by your deductible cash donations.
    


            But if you're in the 37% bracket, you won't get the full $3,700 (37% x $10,000) in tax savings. You will reduce your tax liability by only $3,500 (35% x $10,000), O'Saben explained.
    


            If you itemize, any non-cash contributions you make – such as clothes, food or household goods – are also subject to the new 0.5%-of-AGI floor.
    


            If you're taking the standard deduction, you won't be able to deduct your non-cash contributions since the $1,000/$2,000 limit for non-itemizers applies only to cash gifts.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge.

Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Philadelphia started the day a half-game behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.

Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series.

Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches.

Judge was out of the Yankees' starting lineup for just the second time this season. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said.

New York fell a season-high 6 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break.

Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season.




Ryan McMahon went 1 for 3 with a walk in his Yankees debut, a day after the third baseman was acquired from Colorado for a pair of pitching prospects.

Marcus Stroman (2-2) allowed four runs, five hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings.

Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half.

Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup.

New York is 21-28 following a 35-20 start.

New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.

Warner Bros. Discovery had a bountiful weekend at the global box office.

The studio had two films cross the $500 million mark worldwide — "Superman" soared to $502 million and Apple's "F1," which Warner Bros. distributed, topped $509 million in ticket sales.

The benchmark is a boon for Warner Bros.' DC Studios, as "Superman" is the first theatrical debut of James Gunn and Peter Safran since they became co-heads of the film and TV unit in late 2022. The pair has developed a 10-year plan to reinvigorate the studio's franchises across TV and film, including fresh spins on Superman and Batman.

At present, 2025's "Superman" is the fourth-highest-grossing film featuring Superman. Zack Snyder's 2016 "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" is the highest with $874 million in global ticket sales, while 2013's "Man of Steel" is second-highest with $669 million and 2017's "Justice League" with $661 million, according to data from Comscore.

"Superman" debuted in theaters just two weeks ago and continues to drive weekend moviegoing as well as weekday trips.

As for Apple's "F1," passing the $500 million mark is just another feather in the cap for the studio. Earlier this month, the film became Apple's best film release ever, surpassing Ridley Scott's "Napoleon," which generated $221 million during its 2023 run, to become Apple's then-highest-grossing theatrical release.

The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. "Killers of the Flower Moon" tallied $158 million worldwide, "Fly Me to the Moon" took in just $42 million and "Argylle" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally.

"F1" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX. Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology but also a three-week release in its theaters.

What superhero fatigue?

Twice in one month, a comic book film has rocketed to the top of the box office, debuting with more than $100 million in ticket sales.

Two weeks ago, it was "Superman," the first theatrical release from James Gunn and Peter Safran as co-heads of DC Studios at Warner Bros. Discovery. This weekend, Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" fueled an estimated $118 million in ticket sales during its first three days in theaters.

"The lesson is that if you build great movies, audiences will head to the multiplex," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.

Internationally, "Fantastic Four: First Steps" snared an estimated $100 million, bringing its global weekend haul to $218 million.

"Marvel bet big releasing their long-awaited introduction of the Fantastic Four as the last MCU film to hit theaters for at least another year, and it's paying off," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. "The franchise has had its share of hiccups in recent years, but Marvel's First Family is winning over fans and spurring the kind of enthusiasm that could bring back casual viewers who sat out some post-'Endgame' chapters."

Marvel has struggled in the wake of the record-breaking "Avengers: Endgame," the culmination of more than a decade of interconnected storytelling. While films like "Deadpool & Wolverine" and "Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3" enticed moviegoers to theaters, others like "Captain America: Brave New World," "The Marvels" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" failed to drum up the same enthusiasm.

Box office hauls haven't been the only hit-or-miss for the studio. Marvel films have experienced significant fluctuations since the release of 2019's "Endgame." Previously, no MCU film had a Rotten Tomatoes score below 67%, meaning each had earned the title of "Fresh," indicating that critics had a generally positive view of the film.

Since then, five films from the franchise have been below that metric and three of those were considered "Rotten," earning less than 50% positive reviews.

This year, "Captain America: Brave New World" tallied $413 million globally and earned a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But "Thunderbolts*" generated just $382 million globally — one of only five titles under the Marvel Cinematic Universe banner to tally less than $400 million worldwide — it secured an 88% "Fresh" rating.

Its newest theatrical entry, "Fantastic Four: First Steps," also has an 88% "Fresh" rating from the site.

"For Disney, this has truly been a magical summer and for Marvel a reaffirmation that their strategy to revamp the brand is certainly working," Dergarabedian said. "With 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' following in the footsteps of 'Thunderbolts*' Marvel is showing that a focus on quality rather than quantity is a recipe for success."

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal owns Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the European Union should agree to open its markets for U.S. exports to convince President Donald Trump to lower "reciprocal" tariffs on the 27-member bloc.

Lutnick's comments suggest that Trump is open to a deal with the EU, but reiterated that the president still believes there's roughly a 50-50 chance that one can ultimately be reached.

"The question is, do they offer President Trump a good enough deal that is worth it for him to step off of the 30% tariffs that he set," Lutnick said on Fox News.

The commerce secretary's comments still raise questions about what a "good enough" deal with the United States' largest trading partner would look like at a pivotal time for trade negotiations.

Trump is set to hold trade talks with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, days before the Aug. 1 deadline for Trump's tariffs to take effect.

Ahead of the pivotal trade deadline, Trump on Friday said that "we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU."

He said that sticking points remained "with maybe 20 different things," raising questions about whether the two leaders could move closer to a framework for a deal on Sunday.

As Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on the EU, the bloc has weighed countermeasures, such as using its "Anti-Coercion Instrument," a move that has been seen as the trading bloc's "trade bazooka." 

Such a move could hinder U.S. vendors' participation in the EU market.

Fast Money Live Event | June 5

The market may be trading around record highs, but the Verdence Capital Advisors CIO is worried trouble is lurking.

Megan Horneman, who oversees $4.1 billion in assets under management, thinks there's too much complacency around the Aug. 1 U.S. trade deadline.

"This market is pricing in the perfect situation," she told CNBC's "Fast Money" on Monday.

In addition to tariff concerns, she lists uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy and overbought conditions from a technical perspective as potential issues.

"Once we see that [rate cuts] might be priced off the table, coinciding with the fact that we're not quite sure what's going to happen with the tariff perspective, I think you can see a bit of a valuation correction," said Horneman, who's a former Deutsche Bank senior investment strategist.

Horneman is particularly concerned that technical levels are signaling overbought conditions in growth stocks — including Big Tech.

"These are things that we think might upset the rally that we're seeing here," she said.

Despite her short-term caution, Horneman considers herself a long-term bull and views pullbacks as opportunities. She lists international stocks among her top plays on market weakness.

"I'd warn that right now, they're expensive from a valuation perspective [but] cheap compared to the U.S.," she said. "They've been underloved for way too long, and I think you're seeing some of that rotation just begin. I think that can continue."

To navigate the uncertainty, her key advice to investors right now: Make sure you're allocated appropriately.

"Fast Money" trader Guy Adami also sees concerns, citing the number of retail investors driving recent market gains."Just in terms of valuation, things have gotten a tad frothy here," he said on Monday's show.

The S&P 500 closed at record highs every day last week. As of Friday's close, the index is 16% higher over the past three months while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 21% over the same period.

After spiraling from crisis to crisis over much of the past seven years, Boeing is stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg's leadership.

Ortberg, a longtime aerospace executive and an engineer whom the manufacturer plucked from retirement to fix the problem-addled company last year, is set this week to outline significant progress since he took the helm a year ago. Boeing reports quarterly results and gives its outlook on Tuesday.

So far, investors are liking what they've been seeing. Shares of the company are up more than 30% so far this year.

Wall Street analysts expect the aircraft manufacturer to halve its second-quarter losses from a year ago when it reports. Ortberg told investors in May that the manufacturer expects to generate cash in the second half of the year. Boeing's aircraft production has increased, and its airplane deliveries just hit the highest level in 18 months.

It's a shift for Boeing, whose successive leaders missed targets on aircraft delivery schedules, certifications, financial goals and culture changes that frustrated investors and customers alike, while rival Airbus pulled ahead.

"The general agreement is that the culture is changing after decades of self-inflicted knife wounds," said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm.

Analysts expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year.

"When he got the job, I was not anywhere as near as optimistic as today," said Douglas Harned, senior aerospace and defense analyst at Bernstein.

Ortberg's work was already cut out for him, but the challenges multiplied when he arrived.

As the company hemorrhaged cash, Ortberg announced massive cost cuts, including laying off 10% of the company. Its machinists who make the majority of its airplanes went on strike for seven weeks until the company and the workers' union signed a new labor deal. Ortberg also oversaw a more than $20 billion capital raise last fall, replaced the head of the defense unit and sold off its Jeppesen navigation business.

Ortberg bought a house in the Seattle area, where Boeing makes most of its planes, shortly after taking the job last August, and his presence has been positive, aerospace analysts have said.

"He's showing up," Aboulafia said. "You show up, you talk to people."

Boeing declined to make Ortberg available for an interview.

Boeing's leaders hoped for a turnaround year in 2024. But five days in, a door-plug blew out of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Portland. The almost-catastrophe brought Boeing a production slowdown, renewed Federal Aviation Administration scrutiny and billions in cash burn.

Key bolts were left off the plane before it was delivered to Alaska Airlines. It was the latest in a series of quality problems at Boeing, where other defects have required time-consuming reworking.

Boeing had already been reeling from two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that sullied the reputation of America's largest exporter. The company in May reached an agreement with the Justice Department to avoid prosecution stemming from a battle over a previous criminal conspiracy charge tied to the crashes. Victims' family members slammed the deal when it was announced.

For years, executives at top Boeing airline customers complained publicly about the manufacturer and its leadership as they grappled with delays. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told investors in May 2022 that management needed a "reboot or boot up the arse."

Last week, O'Leary had a different tune.

"I continue to believe Kelly Ortberg, [and Boeing Commercial Airplane unit CEO] Stephanie Pope are doing a great job," he said on an earnings call. "I mean, there is no doubt that the quality of what is being produced, the hulls in Wichita and the aircraft in Seattle has dramatically improved."

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby cast doubt over the Boeing 737 Max 10 after the January 2024 door-plug accident, as the carrier prepared not to have that aircraft in its fleet plan. The plane is still not certified, but Kirby has said Boeing has been more predictability on airplane deliveries.

Still, delays for the Max 10, the largest of the Max family, and the yet-to-be certified Max 7, the smallest, are a headache for customers, especially since having too few or too many seats on a flight can determine profitability for airlines.

"They're working the right problems. The consistency of deliveries is much better," Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said in an interview last month. "But there's no update on the Max 7. We're assuming we are not flying it in 2026."

Boeing under Ortberg still has much to fix.

The FAA capped Boeing's production at 38 Maxes a month, a rate that it has reached. To go beyond that, to a target of 42, Boeing will need the FAA's blessing.

Ortberg said this year that the company is stabilizing to go beyond that rate. Manufacturers get paid when aircraft are delivered, so higher production is key.

"I would suspect they would be having those discussions very soon," Harned said. "It's 47 [a month] that I think is the challenging break."

He added that Boeing has a lot of inventory on hand to help increase production.

Its defense unit has also suffered. The defense unit encompasses programs like the KC-46 tanker program and Air Force One, which has drawn public ire from President Donald Trump. Trump, frustrated with delays on the two new jets meant to serve the president, turned to a used Qatari Boeing 747 to potentially use as a presidential aircraft, though insiders say that used plane could require months of reoutfitting.

Ortberg replaced the head of that unit last fall.

"They're not totally out of the woods," Harned said.

Boeing and Ortberg also need to start thinking about a new jet, some industry members said. Its best-selling 737 first debuted in 1967, and the company was looking at a midsize jetliner before the two crashes sent its attention elsewhere.

"Already there's been a reversal from 'read my lips, no new jet.' I would like to see that accelerate," Aboulafia said. "He is the guy to make that happen."

As the stock market focuses on major earnings and negotiations on the tariff front, investors seeking a regular income stream continue to look for attractive dividend stocks amid ongoing volatility.

To this end, the analysis of top Wall Street analysts can provide useful insights that can help investors pick companies with solid fundamentals and the ability to pay dividends consistently.  

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Oil and gas exploration and production company EOG Resources (EOG) is first on this week's list. In May, the company announced a deal to acquire Encino Acquisition Partners (EAP) for $5.6 billion. EOG stated that the deal's accretion to its free cash flow supports a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend, to $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. At an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG stock offers a dividend yield of 3.4%.

Ahead of EOG Resources' second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 8, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on EOG stock with a price forecast of $155. In comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $138 on EOG stock with an "outperform" rating. Meanwhile, Sorbara stated that he expects EOG to report strong quarterly results on both the operational and financial fronts. 

The five-star analyst believes that investors will pay more attention to EOG's significant expansion in the Utica shale via the EAP acquisition, as the deal is expected to provide catalysts from the integration, synergies, and execution in the quarters ahead. 

"All in all, we are positive EOG into the print, especially since EOG should be more defensive in the current price environment," said Sorbara.

The analyst is also bullish on EOG due to its peer-leading shareholder returns, supported by its solid free cash flow generation, best-in-class balance sheet, and the Utica shale expansion. Sorbara expects EOG to maintain its commitment to return at least 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually via dividends and opportunistic buybacks. He expects $450 million of buybacks for Q2 2025. Overall, Sorbara estimates $976.6 million of capital returns, representing 107.7% of free cash flow and a 6.0% capital returns yield.

Sorbara ranks No. 178 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 22.5%. See EOG Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB) is the next dividend-paying stock in focus. WMB offers a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share (annualized dividend of $2.00 per share), reflecting a yield of 3.5%.

Heading into WMB's Q2 results scheduled for early August, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $63. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has a "neutral" rating on WMB stock with a price target of $63. Meanwhile, Scotto lowered the Q2 projections to reflect insights from the conversations with the WMB team, seasonal adjustments to marketing estimates, and RBC's updated commodity price deck.

Scotto expects sequential decline in commodity prices to be a modest headwind in the second quarter, particularly for WMB's upstream operations. The analyst expects Q2 results to be impacted by lower quarter-over-quarter marketing contributions due to normal seasonality and higher storage fees, partially offset by contributions from the recent investment in Cogentrix.

On the positive side, Scotto is confident about WMB's long-term growth, backed by its robust backlog of projects with low build multiples (less than five-times capex to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), with planned in-services dates through 2030. The analyst also expects WMB to benefit from additional behind-the-meter (BTM) projects and the potential revival of the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline and the Constitution pipeline project.

"Despite its recent selloff, we still view WMB as one of the best positioned companies within our coverage universe to benefit from growing natural gas demand," said Scotto.

Scotto ranks No. 72 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.5%. See Williams Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ). The company delivered solid results for the second quarter of 2025. Verizon raised the lower end of its annual profit guidance, reflecting robust demand for its premium plans and its reaction to the new tax law under the Trump administration.

The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, payable on Aug. 1. With an annualized dividend of $2.71, VZ stock offers a dividend yield of 6.3%.

In reaction to the Q2 print, Citi analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on Verizon stock with a price forecast of $48. Also, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on VZ stock with a price target of $49. Rollins noted Verizon's Q2 performance and the upgrade to the full-year EBITDA and EPS guidance based on the relative strength in the first half of the year.

He added that key performance indicators (KPIs) were mixed and continue to reflect a more promotional competitive backdrop. Notably, Rollins trimmed his postpaid phone subscriber outlook to reflect a year-over-year rise in churn, which is expected to persist in the second half of the year.

"Verizon indicated a more disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition, which is encouraging for competitive dynamics and its financials, albeit likely dilutive to its near-term volume KPIs," said Rollins.

Despite additional promotional costs and lighter volume, Rollins believes that Verizon is well-positioned to deliver its full-year guidance. Overall, Rollins remains bullish on VZ stock, given its relative value and opportunities for the company to sustain annual financial growth.

Rollins ranks No. 276 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. See Verizon Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Thailand and Cambodia on Sunday signaled their readiness to negotiate an end to a deadly border dispute following mediation efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump. The fighting, now in its fourth day, has killed at least 34 people and displaced more than 168,000.

Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday that he spoke to the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia and suggested he would not move forward with trade agreements with either country if the hostilities continued. He later said both sides agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said Sunday his country agreed to pursue an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire." He said Trump told him that Thailand had also agreed to halt attacks following Trump's conversation with Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai.

"This is positive news for the soldiers and people of both countries," Hun Manet said in a statement.

He said he tasked his deputy, Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, to coordinate next steps with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and to engage directly with Thailand's foreign minister to implement the ceasefire.

Thailand expressed cautious support. Phumtham thanked Trump and said that Thailand agreed in principle to a ceasefire but stressed the need for "sincere intention" from Cambodia, the Thai Foreign Ministry said. Phumtam called for swift bilateral talks to discuss concrete steps toward a peaceful resolution, it said.

The fighting first flared Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand closed its border crossings with Cambodia.

Despite the diplomatic efforts, fighting continued Sunday along parts of the contested border, with both sides refusing to budge and trading blame over renewed shelling and troop movements.

Col. Richa Suksowanont, a Thai army deputy spokesperson, said Cambodian forces fired heavy artillery into Surin province, including at civilian homes early Sunday. He said Cambodia also launched rocket attacks targeting the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple claimed by both countries, and other areas in a bid to reclaim territory secured by Thai troops. Thai forces responded with long-range artillery to strike Cambodian artillery and rocket launchers.

Richa said Trump's efforts to mediate was a "separate matter." The battlefield operations will continue and a ceasefire can only happen if Cambodia formally initiates negotiations, he added.

"Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law," Thailand's Foreign Ministry said separately.

Cambodian Defense Ministry spokesperson Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata accused Thai forces of escalating the violence with bombardment of Cambodian territory early Sunday, followed by a "large-scale incursion" involving tanks and ground troops in multiple areas.

"Such actions undermine all efforts toward peaceful resolution and expose Thailand's clear intent to escalate rather than de-escalate the conflict," she said.

Thailand on Sunday reported a new death of a soldier, bringing the total number of fatalities to 21, mostly civilians. Cambodia said 13 people have been killed. More than 131,000 people in Thailand have evacuated to safe locations and over 37,000 people fled from three Cambodian provinces. Many border villages are mostly deserted, with many schools and hospitals shut.

Pichayut Surasit, an air-conditioning technician in Thailand, said the sudden outbreak of fighting meant leaving his work in Bangkok to return home to protect his family.

"I didn't have the heart to continue with my work when I heard the news. I wanted to come back as soon as possible but I had to wait until the evening," he said. Now at a shelter in Surin housing some 6,000 evacuees, Pichayut worries for his wife and twin daughters, hoping the conflict will end soon so they can return to their home in Kap Choeng district, one of the hardest hit by shelling.

Bualee Chanduang, a local vendor who moved to the same shelter Thursday with her family and pet rabbit, is counting on swift negotiations to end the violence. "I pray for God to help that both sides can agree to talk and end this war," she said.

The U.N. Security Council has called on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional bloc, to mediate peace between the two members. Human Rights Watch has condemned the reported use of cluster munitions, weapons banned by International law, in populated areas, and urged both governments to protect civilians.

The 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The latest tensions flared in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand's domestic politics.

Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.

The 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades, and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the last several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.

Salary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.

Company filings with the US Department of Labor show Walmart sought to hire around 1,750 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the first half of this reporting year, largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up substantially from about 1,100 for the same period two years before.

This publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — only refers to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.

A Walmart spokesperson said the company's compensation packages include salary, bonus opportunities, and stock awards, and that it invests in employees' career growth.

Still, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in certain roles, and where the company is looking to grow.

Walmart boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.

More than two-thirds of the company's 45,000 open positions worldwide as of July 23 are for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 550 openings are tech and analyst roles.

The company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new EVP of AI acceleration, product and design who reports directly into the CEO and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.

Other employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.

Most of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.

Here's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:

Christian Schneider once had to psych himself up to talk to customers or make fundraising pitches to investors.

The CEO and cofounder of the startup fileAI describes himself as an introvert who's been able to push himself to go beyond what he finds comfortable. That's part of being human, he said.

"We have to adapt," Schneider, whose company helps companies use their unstructured data, told Business Insider.

Some of his fellow introverts could soon have to embrace Schneider's can-do approach or risk being sidelined by their more outgoing peers. That's because as AI takes over more tasks, much of the work that remains could involve human interactions, workplace observers told BI.

"The extraverted personality has potentially an advantage here," Schneider said, because certain tasks can't be offloaded as easily to computers. For instance, a sales team might use AI to help with data entry or analyze call transcripts, but ChatGPT can't wine and dine a potential client — at least for now.

A greater emphasis on these human tasks could be worrisome news for introverts and, of course, a win for the glad-handers. Even when they're good at what they do, some extroverts are able to propel their careers with a frenzy of fist bumps and finger guns.

"The personality hire might be the most safe in the face of AI because what they can do is read a room. They can stand out. They can be charming," Elizabeth Lotardo, a leadership consultant, told BI.

At least for now, she said, people who can easily build relationships in the workplace and draw insights from colleagues could have an edge.

"That is organizational currency that AI cannot replicate, generally," said Lotardo, author of the book "Leading Yourself."

Schneider, from fileAI, said he expects that interpersonal skills will become "super important" as AI absorbs even more of the tasks that are currently keeping workers busy.

"You're going to need a lot less people doing these things that keep them on their laptops eight hours a day," he said.

Some labor market observers warn that roles comprised of routine tasks face the greatest risk of automation, though some companies hope to have AI take on far more.

AI might create a premium on human-to-human communication, yet it might also mean we become worse at it.

Vanessa Druskat, an associate professor of organizational behavior and management at the University of New Hampshire's Paul College of Business and Economics, describes herself as an introvert.

She said one worry she has is that when people use AI to interact less often with others and to create "nice, clean, empathetic emails or texts," the part of the brain that handles those responsibilities could begin to atrophy.

"The way the brain works is it has kind of a use-it-or-lose-it capacity," Druskat said. If we outsource too many interactions to AI, she said, our own abilities are likely to weaken.

Druskat said that her concerns for introverts are similar to what she worries about in general for her students. Those who are using AI to write their professional emails could lose the ability to determine the "appropriate emotion" for the close of a message, she said.

"They're mental skills that we develop," said Druskat.

While Druskat sees risks in introverts losing some ability to communicate with others at work if they rely too much on AI, there can be a tangible boost for more reserved employees.

Brian Smith is an organizational psychologist who runs a leadership advisory firm. He's seen AI supercharge the abilities of some of the quieter people on his team, who he said sometimes found it difficult to engage with others.

Smith said team members have been able to query AI models to better understand the feedback they're getting from clients. That, in turn, he said, has enabled introverted team members to become more confident and "start to have better human conversations with the people that they were originally having difficulty with."

Yet for all the help AI can give workers of all personality types, it can't do everything, said Schneider, from fileAI.

For now, a bot won't be a big help, he said, if he has to talk to an investor in person. He still needs those interpersonal skills.

"It can upskill me, and it can sort of give me the playbook, but at the end of the day, I'm going to be standing there, and I'm going to have to deliver," Schneider said.

Google executive Mira Lane is all for following your passions and changing your career. That's exactly what she did.

But she encourages approaching a career shift with a plan.

"For people that are wanting to pivot, I would pivot with information," the senior director and founder of the Envisioning Studio at Google told Business Insider.

Lane, who started her career as a software developer and went on to create an AI prototyping lab that explores the impact of tech innovation on society, said that many people switch careers multiple times because they're uncertain. 

She said job seekers should gather as much information as possible to make sure that the career pivot they're making is the right move.

That includes talking to people in the industry, watching YouTube videos about jobs that interest you, and trying out internships, Lane said. If you're earlier in your career, you should also try to choose a college that provides opportunities to gain work experience.

The idea is to "constantly get some feedback," Lane said.

Whether you're just starting out in the workforce or looking to make a shift mid-career, changing careers is common. However, Lane's advice comes amid an ongoing workforce transformation driven by AI advancements. 

A 2025 World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally expect to reduce staff in the next five years because of the new tech, meaning more people may be forced to adjust.

"All the jobs are kind of evolving in this moment," Lane said. "Everything's kind of shifting. So you want to be in a space where you're getting a lot of signals."

That's how Lane navigated multiple career pivots. After starting her career as a software developer, Lane moved to program management and then later on transitioned to leading AI ethics and society at Microsoft.

After nearly two decades at Microsoft, Lane saw an opportunity for companies to engage more directly in conversations about the tools they were developing. That inspired her to build a team of creative strategists, philosophers, and researchers focused on discussing technology at Google.

"I don't like when technology is built, and then people have to deal with decisions that were made that weren't really intentional," Lane, who is also a visual artist, told BI.

Lane said when she was at Microsoft and was "poking around" for a new role, she met the person who would eventually become her boss at Google. She said he asked her what she wanted to do with her life and caught her off guard, so she asked if she could get back to him.

Even though she had an idea of her interests at the time, Lane said it was important to pause and think about what she really wanted.

"I wasn't prepared to just answer that on the fly," Lane said. "I thought, 'if someone's asking me, let me, reflect on it.'"

After some thought, Lane prepared a one-page pitch about the lab she wanted to create, which ended up becoming a reality.

Lane said once you get enough signals about what you like or don't like, you should listen to what "lights you up." If you find yourself following a path that doesn't make you excited, maybe it's not the right one.

I think most would agree that the news cycle has been relentless for most of 2025, but certain stories do seem a little "Groundhog Day" at the moment.

Earlier this month, I wrote about the conundrum facing the newsroom over how to approach President Donald Trump's then-trade talk deadline of July 9. Now, at the end of the month, we find ourselves in a similar position, but this time the date we are all watching is August 1.

Why? Once again, it's another deadline for countries across the globe to try and agree a trade truce with the United States, with the European Union in particular focus this time round.

Debate in the newsroom resurfaces … when is a deadline not a deadline?

The week has become even trickier to predict, with talks between the U.S. and China now taking center stage in Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday — potentially further complicating the picture for Europe.

A U.S. trade agreement with the European Union has seemed tantalizingly close, with CNBC's Silvia Amaro reporting that a 15% baseline tariff rate is the base-case scenario, according to an EU diplomat. These reports drove stock markets across Europe and the U.S. higher last week.

On Friday, however, Trump told reporters there was only a "50-50 chance" of a deal.

As CNBC's Holly Ellyatt explains, the EU is keeping its so-called "trade bazooka" — or Anti Coercion Instrument — warm in case an agreement is not reached by the August deadline.

The corporate world is crying out for an agreement, piling pressure on the European Union to put an end to the uncertainty. Puma, VW, Michelin and other corporates across Europe have downgraded their outlooks citing the impact of tariffs and the ongoing pressure the restrictions are putting on these businesses.

This week, all eyes will be on another raft of earnings from Europe, including banking giants UBS, Santander and Standard Chartered, drinks firm Heineken, pharma giant AstraZeneca and energy major Shell to name a few.

On the data front, GDP growth rates for France, Spain, Germany and Italy will be released on Wednesday, providing insight into the wider impact of the market uncertainty.

Last week, the tricky economic conditions saw the European Central Bank opt for a hawkish hold of the benchmark rate at 2%, with President Christine Lagarde saying the ECB is "in a good place to hold and watch how risks develop over the next few months."

And so Friday August 1st will be a crucial date for market participants and corporates (and the newsroom)… until it isn't.

Ethereum is rapidly emerging as the institutional favorite, with new ETF inflow data suggesting a seismic shift in investor focus away from Bitcoin.

According to figures shared by SosoValue and highlighted by market analysts like Crypto Rover, Ethereum spot ETFs attracted an eye-popping $1.85 billion in net inflows during the week ending July 25, 2025. In stark contrast, Bitcoin ETFs drew just $72.06 million in the same period.

The data paints a clear picture: investors are piling into Ethereum-based products at an accelerating pace. Over the last three weeks, ETH spot ETFs have collectively pulled in $4.94 billion in net inflows. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs brought in just over $5.83 billion across the entire month of July—but the inflows have been decelerating week over week.

Ethereum's strong ETF performance also boosted its total net assets to $20.66 billion, up from $18.37 billion the previous week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's total net assets held steady around $151 billion, but with sharply lower weekly momentum.

The latest spike in ETH ETF flows adds fuel to the rising “Utility Season” narrative, where investors shift their attention from Bitcoin's store-of-value status to more functional Layer 1 ecosystems like Ethereum. This shift is partly driven by Ethereum's diverse use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to enterprise blockchain adoption.

Analysts see the trend as a sign that institutional investors are now more interested in yield-bearing, smart contract-capable assets. The sustained flow into Ethereum may also be signaling growing confidence in the long-term roadmap of ETH, especially with its upcoming scaling upgrades and L2 growth.

While Bitcoin still dominates in total ETF AUM, Ethereum's rapid inflow growth could tilt the narrative if the pattern continues.

If ETH continues to outpace BTC in weekly flows, it may prompt a broader asset reallocation across crypto portfolios—one that favors utility and programmability over digital gold.

For now, all signs point to Ethereum taking the spotlight as institutional capital repositions for the next leg of crypto market evolution.







Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a breakout phase eerily reminiscent of its historic 2017 rally—but this time, the move is backed by deep institutional support and ETF inflows.

SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, is drawing attention following a major breakout on the charts—driven by surging total value locked (TVL) and growing anticipation around Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (BTCFi) infrastructure.

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently outlined his bullish stance on Ethereum, linking it directly to the rapid growth of the stablecoin sector.

Ethereum (ETH) has just triggered a golden cross against Bitcoin (BTC)—a technical pattern that has historically preceded massive altcoin rallies.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ripple (XRP) has emerged as a focal point in discussions about systemic solutions to global financial instability, with recent academic research and institutional analysis highlighting its potential role in addressing post-crisis challenges. A presentation at the IV International Scientific and Practical Conference hosted by the Russian Academy of Sciences' Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations underscored Ripple's integration into cross-border interbank transfer systems as part of broader fintech modernization efforts [1]. Dr. I.A. Kopytin, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Center, outlined how the 2008 financial crisis catalyzed the development of blockchain-based alternatives to traditional infrastructures like SWIFT. Ripple was explicitly cited as one of several innovations aimed at mitigating systemic risks through real-time settlements and reduced transaction complexity [1].  

The academic materials emphasized Ripple's role in reshaping trade finance, arguing that its blockchain technology offers transparency and programmability to counter the opacity that contributed to the 2008 crisis. By leveraging digital ledgers, Ripple's system purportedly enables granular visibility into financial exposures, reducing the likelihood of over-derivatisation—a key factor in the pre-crisis collapse. The presentation positioned Ripple alongside initiatives like IBM's Blockchain World Wire and JP Morgan Chase's Interbank Information Network, framing these technologies as part of a broader effort to modernize financial infrastructure [1].  

Crypto researcher SMQKE amplified these findings, noting that Ripple's academic citations were not isolated but appeared twice in formal economic literature. The first reference highlighted Ripple as a response to pre-crisis financial architecture failures, while the second emphasized its utility in ensuring stability through blockchain-driven transparency [1]. SMQKE's analysis also challenged perceptions of XRP as a speculative asset, pointing to its adoption by major institutions for cross-border payments. Partnerships with entities like American Express and Santander were cited as evidence of XRP's practical application in streamlining liquidity challenges [1].  

While the conference materials did not claim Ripple alone could prevent future crises, they framed its technology as a component of a systemic overhaul. The debate over XRP's role extends beyond academia, with institutional adoption metrics such as $133 million in tokenized assets on Ripple's chain reflecting incremental progress [4]. Analysts like Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered have projected XRP's price could reach $12.25 by 2029, though such forecasts remain speculative [2]. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously suggested the token could capture 14% of SWIFT's transaction volume, a benchmark that remains aspirational [3].  

The discourse underscores a broader tension in the crypto ecosystem between consumer-facing narratives and infrastructure-driven value. While XRP may not feature in everyday transactions, its backend utility for financial institutions—enabling real-time gross settlements and reducing costs—has garnered significant traction. This dynamic challenges critics who dismiss XRP's real-world relevance, particularly as blockchain solutions continue to address inefficiencies in global remittance flows [1].

Ethereum has rallied to more than $3,800 this week, gaining roughly 60% over the past month, according to data provider CoinGecko—a sign that “ETH season” is finally nigh. 

But as the altcoin rises from the doldrums, one question remains foremost for the token's holders: Will this ETH revival last? 

Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin programmer who worked on the blockchain alongside its creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than a decade ago, said Ethereum and its native token will thrive, largely due to the usefulness and ubiquity of its technology. 

“I'm not bearish on Ethereum because everybody is building on EVM,” Garzik told Decrypt, referring to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a decentralized computation engine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. 

The Bitcoin OG's endorsement of Ethereum comes as the layer-1 appears to recover from a crisis of confidence that coincided with ETH's plunge to $1,410 on April 7— its lowest price since March 2023.

The Ethereum Foundation also underwent leadership changes earlier this year amid fears the layer-1 was losing ground to rival blockchains such as Solana, with some investors raising concerns over the Foundation's roadmap for the project. 

But Ethereum's fortunes have improved recently. ETH sailed to $3,844 on July 21 and popped even higher earlier Sunday, and has remained roughly $1,000 below its all-time high of $4,878 set in November 2021, according to CoinGecko, buoyed by institutional and corporate investments into the altcoin.

Spot Ethereum ETFs notched $2.12 billion worth of inflows the week before last, nearly doubling their previous record, according to Farside Investors data—and then flipped Bitcoin ETF flows last week.

Meanwhile, a spate of Ethereum treasury companies—including Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink—have added billions of dollars in ETH to their coffers over the past few weeks.

However, Garzik believes it is Ethereum's technological contributions—not recent investor interest in its token—that signal the project's chances for long-term success. Garzik has tapped the EVM tech for Hemi Network, a layer-2 network that is compatible with both Bitcoin and Ethereum, that launched its mainnet in March.

“I look at it maybe from a different perspective than price,” the developer said. “What's going to be here 10 years from now, 20 years from now? I think it's unquestionably Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

Declining to offer a price prediction for ETH, Garzik noted that much of the crypto ecosystem is largely undergirded by Ethereum's technology. 

“The default choice for programmability…[and] for smart contracts is to be building on Ethereum tech,” the developer said. “Everybody wants to, whether it's an L1 or an L2.” 

EVM is used across many popular blockchains, including Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum. 

Asked about so-called Ethereum killers such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos, which use their own nodes and programming languages instead of the EVM, Garzik said: “You've got a lot of people saying, 'I've got this latest whizbang technology. It's gonna smoke Ethereum, [and] Ethereum is like yesterday's news.' [But] none of them have time in the market.”

Speaking about the rivalry between newer blockchains and Ethereum, Garzik recalled a joke about Microsoft and the browser wars in the late 1990s. 

“The joke goes, if Microsoft made a car, it'd go 1000 miles an hour, it'd randomly crash, turn left, and explode when you least expect it,” he said. “Some of the newer blockchains are like that.”

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Divine Research, a San Francisco-based startup, has issued 30,000 uncollateralized crypto loans—primarily under $1,000 in USDC—to borrowers in underserved regions since late 2024. The platform uses biometric verification via World ID, an iris-scanning technology developed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, to authenticate borrowers as unique individuals, reducing fraud and repeat defaults [1]. By bypassing traditional banking systems, Divine targets gig workers, vendors, and teachers excluded from conventional credit channels. Founder Diego Estevez noted that interest rates of 20% to 30% offset a 40% default rate on first-time loans, while reclaimable Worldcoin tokens help borrowers mitigate repayment shortfalls. Unlike traditional lenders, Divine's capital is sourced from everyday users seeking high-yield opportunities, creating a peer-to-peer model that balances risk absorption with returns for lenders.  

The uncollateralized crypto lending sector is expanding beyond Divine. Ethereum-based startup 3Jane, backed by Paradigm, is developing AI systems to automate lending decisions and streamline debt collection for defaults. Institutional-focused platforms like Wildcat are also exploring undercollateralized loans with flexible terms, relying on collaborative recourse mechanisms among lenders in case of nonpayment. These innovations reflect a shift toward algorithmic risk assessment and decentralized governance in lending. Meanwhile, traditional financial institutions are showing interest in crypto-backed alternatives. JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to offer loans backed by assets like Bitcoin and Ether, signaling growing institutional confidence in digital assets as collateral.  

The sector, however, remains shadowed by past failures. The 2022 collapses of Celsius and Genesis—and associated criminal convictions—highlight regulatory and operational vulnerabilities. Divine and similar platforms aim to address these risks by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) with digital identity tools, creating hybrid models that prioritize accountability. The broader trend leverages blockchain and biometric technologies to democratize financial services, replacing traditional credit scores with on-chain data and biometric verification. Yet scalability and regulatory scrutiny remain critical hurdles. Estevez's model, while promising, relies on user trust in both the platform's technology and the broader crypto ecosystem.  

As the industry evolves, sustainability questions persist. Can decentralized lending models withstand macroeconomic shocks, or will they face liquidity crises akin to earlier crypto lenders? The answer likely hinges on balancing innovation with robust risk management. Divine's approach, alongside competitors like 3Jane and Wildcat, underscores fintech's potential to redefine access to credit in underserved markets. However, long-term success will depend on addressing systemic challenges, including regulatory compliance and user education, while maintaining technological integrity.

The Indian government is intensifying its efforts to combat tax evasion in the cryptocurrency sector through a combination of advanced technology and regulatory measures. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digital forensics, tax authorities aim to identify suspicious transaction patterns and improve compliance with virtual digital asset (VDA) taxation rules. These initiatives, coupled with specialized training programs for tax officers, underscore a strategic push to close loopholes and enhance revenue collection from crypto-related earnings.  

Under the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), tax enforcement agencies have prioritized capacity-building for officers, including blockchain forensics training delivered through collaborations with institutions like the National Forensic Science University in Goa. These programs focus on equipping officials with expertise in digital evidence handling and blockchain analysis, enabling more effective tracking of VDA transactions. However, challenges persist in real-time matching of crypto transaction data reported in tax returns with information from Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Instead, discrepancies are currently flagged by comparing Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) returns from VASPs with individual tax filings [1].  

To address underreporting, the CBDT launched the NUDGE campaign, which targets taxpayers who failed to disclose VDA transactions exceeding 1 lakh rupees. Communications are being sent to these individuals, urging compliance with tax obligations. Meanwhile, legislative frameworks such as the 2022-23 tax year's Section 115BBH impose a flat 30% income tax on crypto profits, with no deductions permitted except the cost of acquisition. A 1% TDS also applies to certain transactions. During FY 2022-23, these measures generated 437 crore rupees in tax collections from VDA-related incomes, marking a significant increase compared to previous years [2].  

Technology remains central to enforcement. AI and machine learning tools are being deployed to detect anomalies in transaction patterns, while data analytics platforms like the Non-Filer Monitoring System (NMS) and Project Insight aggregate information to flag inconsistencies. These systems help cross-reference data from multiple databases, improving the accuracy of compliance checks. However, the absence of real-time VASP data integration highlights ongoing gaps in the system, particularly for cross-border transactions [1].  

The government's efforts have also prompted global crypto exchanges to align with Indian regulations. For instance, Bybit, a major international exchange, announced an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on services for Indian users, effective July 2025. This includes trading fees, staking rewards, and withdrawals, reflecting a broader shift toward compliance with local tax mandates [1].  

The combination of technological innovation, regulatory rigor, and international cooperation signals a decisive shift in India's approach to crypto taxation. While challenges remain, such as refining real-time data matching and addressing cross-border complexities, the government's proactive stance demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability in the digital asset space. For investors and exchanges, the message is clear: tax compliance in crypto transactions is no longer optional [2].

 Bitcoin suddenly ups the volatility into Sunday's weekly close, with key liquidation zones on the radar and predictions of bigger BTC "price swings" to come. 

Key points:

Bitcoin stages a late comeback into the weekly close as price approaches important liquidation zones.

Traders and analysts emphasize various key price points to reclaim next.

Volatility is expected based on large-volume trading behavior, analysis reports.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $119,000 Sunday as bulls extended a rebound from two-week lows.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD approaching a key reclaim area.

Now attempting a daily close above its 10-day simple moving average, the pair held onto a rebound from near $114,500 as the market forgot one of the largest-ever BTC sales.

The uptick came amid news that the US and China had agreed to further delay the introduction of reciprocal trade tariffs.

Market participants thus focused on the key levels to look for going into the new week.

“$BTC needs to break above $119.5K for a big move. If that doesn't happen, this consolidation will continue,” crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows summarized in a post on X. 

Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a slightly higher range ceiling just below the $120,000 mark.

“Bitcoin has Daily Closed above the blue Range Low, kickstarting a break back into the very briefly lost Range,” he told X followers alongside a print of the daily BTC/USD chart.

Others warned that price could still fill the daily downside wick left by the trip to $114,500.

In an X thread on the topic, fellow trader CrypNuevo identified a downside target confluent with an area of exchange order-book liquidity.

Liquidation clusters: we're in-between 2 liquidation clusters located at:• $121k - $120k• $114.5k - $113.6kBased on similarities with previous cases, we could go for the cluster above first, and then reverse again to the bottom one. It's a range-bound environment. pic.twitter.com/Z6XjzsVaKg

“If we zoom out, we can see that the main liquidation level is at $113.8k,” he commented. 

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass meanwhile puts the “max pain” for BTC shorts at around $119,650.

Should Bitcoin return to challenge all-time highs near $123,000, short liquidations would total over $1.1 billion.

“Strong resistance forming around 119,000–120,000, indicated by dense liquidation clusters,” crypto analysis platform Coinank agreed while examining its own liquidity data.

Analyst TheKingfisher additionally warned of heightened volatility on short timeframes.

“Seeing predominantly red on the BTC GEX+ chart. This indicates dealers are heavily short gamma, suggesting they may amplify volatility to hedge their positions,” he reported on X Sunday.

Strategy (MSTR) is pulling off some form of financial alchemy: using bitcoin, historically a volatile asset, to create something that looks a lot like stability.

That's the firm's $2 billion “Stretch” Preferred Stock (STRC) offering offers a variable 9% dividend and is designed to keep the share price hovering near $100.

The offering doesn't give investors direct bitcoin exposure, yet it's backed by the asset in spirit and structure, according to a recent NYDIG report.

Strategy holds $71.7 billion in bitcoin and just $11 billion in liabilities, giving it room to deliver income even if crypto prices dip, the report notes.

Historically, bitcoin has returned at least 3%–4% annually over any five-year stretch, while average returns have been significantly higher.

Strategy is betting it can use this return profile to sustain high payouts without touching its crypto stash, essentially turning long-term bitcoin appreciation into monthly cash flow.

“STRC looks to us like a high-yield, bitcoin-backed, money-market-style vehicle, designed to trade near $100 par while offering a far higher yield than traditional short-term instruments, albeit with a different liquidity profile,” NYDIG wrote.

That premise has proven popular. Investor interest drove Strategy to quadruple the offering size from $500 million to $2 billion.

STRC may not just be a yield vehicle, but rather bitcoin, reworked for traditional finance income investors. A kind of money-market fund, remixed with crypto under the hood.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has reignited discussion around Bitcoin's long-term parabolic trajectory by sharing an updated version of what he now calls the “Bitcoin Banana.”

In a tweet posted on July 27, Brandt humorously reaffirmed his claim to being the first to identify Bitcoin's parabolic structure back in October 2017. The updated chart includes a bold, yellow, banana-shaped arc encapsulating Bitcoin's historic price growth and future trajectory.

Brandt's chart, which spans from Bitcoin's inception to projections for 2029, shows the asset's remarkable rise within a broad, curved band—suggesting that despite periods of volatility, the overarching trend remains bullish. The “banana” curve captures each of Bitcoin's major bull and bear cycles, with the price consistently returning to the midline of this elongated parabolic zone.



The visual metaphor is more than playful. It underscores Brandt's broader thesis that Bitcoin operates within a predictable, albeit volatile, long-term growth pattern. He notes that recent price action—hovering around $118,000—still aligns with this curved structure. The red and black trend lines on the chart further reinforce key resistance and support zones embedded in this multiyear growth channel.

By coining the phrase “Bitcoin Banana,” Brandt highlights both the longevity and the consistency of Bitcoin's trajectory when viewed from a logarithmic, long-term perspective. This framing echoes his earlier work on identifying exponential growth assets and builds on the technical concept of parabolic advances.

Brandt also issued a friendly challenge to the crypto community: “If I'm wrong [about being the first], show the link.” It's a call to verify history, as well as a nod to the enduring significance of trader insight during Bitcoin's early technical analysis phase.

 







Bitcoin is once again mirroring global liquidity trends—and that could have major implications in the days ahead.

The crypto market is showing signs of cautious optimism. While prices remain elevated, sentiment indicators and trading activity suggest investors are stepping back to reassess risks rather than diving in further.

Citigroup analysts say the key to Bitcoin's future isn't mining cycles or halving math—it's ETF inflows.

Bitcoin may be entering a typical summer correction phase, according to a July 25 report by crypto financial services firm Matrixport.

Ethereum (ETH) has just triggered a golden cross against Bitcoin (BTC)—a technical pattern that has historically preceded massive altcoin rallies.

According to popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover, this is only the fifth time this bullish crossover has occurred on the ETH/BTC pair since 2019. Of the previous four instances, three resulted in explosive Ethereum price outperformance.

A golden cross is formed when a short-term moving average (usually the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (typically the 200-day). In this case, the ETH/BTC chart on Binance shows the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) overtaking the 200-day SMA, a widely followed signal by technical traders that momentum is shifting.

Crypto Rover posted a comparative chart on July 27 highlighting how each of the past golden crosses—marked by yellow circles—led to significant upward moves in ETH compared to BTC. Only one instance failed to follow through, suggesting a strong historical bias toward bullish continuation.



The chart also reveals the magnitude of the gains that followed each successful signal. For example, the 2020 golden cross preceded Ethereum's surge to new all-time highs. Similarly, the 2021 crossover sparked another parabolic phase.

What makes this latest signal intriguing is its timing. Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin for much of 2024 and 2025, pushing the ETH/BTC ratio near multi-year lows. Now, with renewed ETF momentum and a spike in institutional ETH interest, some analysts believe a rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum could be underway.

The golden cross could serve as a technical catalyst for such a shift—especially if supported by increased volume and broader market confidence. While skeptics warn that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, sentiment among Ethereum bulls is clearly growing.

If history is any guide, ETH may be poised to regain dominance over BTC in the coming weeks. Traders and investors will now watch to see whether this technical signal proves predictive once again—or if 2025 breaks the pattern.







Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has weighed in on $HYPE's recent price action, suggesting that the token may have completed the majority of its current bullish leg.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has reignited discussion around Bitcoin's long-term parabolic trajectory by sharing an updated version of what he now calls the “Bitcoin Banana.”

Ethereum's network just witnessed a seismic shift in activity.

Binance has officially launched a new airdrop event for Verasity (VRA) through its Binance Alpha platform, giving eligible users the chance to claim free tokens and compete for a massive prize pool.

Leading experts share their insights into the future of money as the GENIUS Act redefines finance in 2025 and beyond.

Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate's new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto.

If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office.

The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration's bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power.

Stablecoin issuer Circle's $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance.

Even Jamie Dimon's getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America's largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019.

So, what's with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead.

For those of you who've been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It's the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money).

The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance.

The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years' imprisonment).

Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog:

“The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.”

Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting:

“The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.”

Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said:

“This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.”

Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary:

“The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.”

What's more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused:

“We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.”

The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented:

“The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe

Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.”

Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments:

“The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.”

Poncin adds:

“The opportunity in stablecoins isn't in holding them, unless they're being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens.

We're seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.”

Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate.

While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry's most vocal critics.

The GENIUS Act's significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me:

“Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.”

Poncin expands:

“Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We're about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps', all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago.

Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We're seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There's also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols.

The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.”

One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says:

“Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that's where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department's projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns.

With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.”

Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered's Tokenization platform, comments:

“The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds.

The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there's a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don't. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.”

Gavryliak adds:

“Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It's a positive step forward for DeFi.

It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.”

With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it's too late for that:

“The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain's potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money.

Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That's what drives lasting adoption.”

Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says:

“During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases.

Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it's just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don't see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.”

With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms:

This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed.

We're entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that's precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.”

Simultaneously, f(x) wstETH position has claimed the 2nd place among the top collections over the past week. Hence, its sales volume has touched the $9,836,608, signifying a 31.75% increase in the meantime. Apart from that, Pudgy Penguins has attained the 3rd spot, with its sales volume touching $8,346,811 after a 9.63% decrease.

Following that, in the 4th position, Courtyard has reached $8,281,937 in terms of sales volume, denoting a 35.13% plunge. Subsequently, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) claims $5,862,545 when it comes to sales volume, underscoring a 62.33% upsurge.

The next leading NFT collection on the list is STRAT Option, as it has touched the $5,348,361 mark in sales volume. This development takes place as a result of a stunning 3052.05% increase. Additionally, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) occupies the 7th rank among the top-performing NFT collections of last week based on sales volume, reaching $4,874,728.

The top-10 list moves on to include Moonbirds in the 8th position as it has recorded a sales volume equaling $4,506,875 due to a 138.66% rise. Coming after that, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) claims $4,027,274 in weekly sales volume after a 41.06% upsurge.

Afterwards, $??BRC-20 NFTs is the 10th top NFT collection when it comes to 7-day sales volume. Thus, it has seen a 30.75% decline to touch $3,819,336 in its weekly volume.

Not all low-cost cryptos are equal. This month, a handful of coins trading under $1 are showing real traction, through product rollouts, exchange listings, and strong trading activity. Whether it's a presale breaking records like BlockDAG, or listed coins like DOGE and HBAR pushing through key levels, these aren't just cheap entries, they're loaded with catalysts.

For anyone scanning the market for top altcoins under $1, this list is a solid place to start. Prices are still affordable, momentum is visible, and fundamentals are holding up across the board. These aren't just names with history, they're pushing for serious moves in the weeks ahead. And BlockDAG is right at the front of that push.

BlockDAG is one of the few presales still under a penny that's actually delivering. Its current price is locked at $0.0016, with the Beat Vesting Pass extended until August 4, giving users full liquidity at launch, no lockups, no delays. This makes it a unique entry point for anyone looking at high-upside altcoins. The presale has already raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, with a confirmed listing price of $0.05, putting early buyers in position for 3,025% gains from day one.

What sets BlockDAG apart is the real product rollout. Its X1 mobile mining app now has over 2.5 million users, and the X10 miner demo is live. The testnet includes a working explorer, no-code token and NFT creator, and staking tools. Over 4,500 developers are already building and testing apps in the ecosystem. The network uses a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work structure, allowing parallel transaction confirmation, EVM compatibility, and low energy use, features not common in projects at this stage.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG offers unmatched momentum, a clear timeline, and actual working infrastructure. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release ending on August 11 and liquidity tools already in place, it's not just another low-cost coin, it's one with real weight behind it.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.2358, following a sharp 11% drop earlier in the week. That pullback came after institutional players offloaded over 2.26 billion DOGE, triggering high sell volume and market-wide liquidations. Prior to that, the coin had broken above $0.26 and touched $0.28 briefly. Support is now at $0.23, while resistance sits near $0.28.

The drop has opened up a lower entry point, and long-term forecasts are still intact. Analysts see DOGE pushing back toward $0.33 this year, with $0.75 not out of the question by 2030 if retail interest returns in force. As one of the most traded meme tokens with massive liquidity, DOGE remains one of the top altcoins under $1 that market watchers are still keeping on their radar, especially when volatility cools down.

Hedera (HBAR) has made one of the strongest moves this month. It surged to $0.29 following a successful mainnet upgrade and a high-profile listing on Robinhood on July 25. That combo triggered retail buying and pushed trading volume past $700 million, with HBAR now hovering around $0.27–$0.29. It's gained more than 100% since earlier this month when it traded around $0.15.

Analysts say that a breakout past $0.47 could push the coin toward $1. However, resistance remains tight, and a failure to hold momentum could lead to a pullback toward the $0.21–$0.23 zone. Still, with technical upgrades live and retail entry easier through Robinhood, HBAR is one of the top altcoins under $1 that's riding a real growth narrative this quarter.

Stellar's XLM has more than doubled in price since early July, now trading between $0.44 and $0.47 after rising from just $0.22. The main catalyst behind the move is the launch of Protocol 23, which boosted interest from developers and institutions alike. The volume shot up alongside this growth, with institutional flow topping 400 million XLM during the run.

Right now, support is sitting near $0.44. If that breaks, $0.40 and $0.33 are key fallback levels. On the flip side, if XLM manages a close above $0.52, analysts expect a stronger rally toward its 2021 highs. Technical indicators show some signs of exhaustion, but the broader trend is still intact. For buyers looking at high-volume movers with strong network upgrades, XLM makes the list of top altcoins under $1 to track this summer.

Each of these four coins offers a different angle, DOGE is dipping from meme highs, HBAR is climbing on new access, and XLM is riding a network upgrade. But BlockDAG is the only one where the price is still nearly free, with $0.0016 unlocking over 3,000% upside if listing hits $0.05. And unlike most low-cap presales, the team has already rolled out mining apps, testnets, and dApp tools.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG gives the most complete combo: full liquidity from launch, working infrastructure, 2.5 million miners, and a ticking deadline. For anyone looking at entry-level cryptos right now, this one is leading the pack on momentum, value, and actual delivery.

Michael Saylor's controversial bitcoin treasury strategy is no longer fringe — it's being mimicked across corporate America. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, companies have raised more than $85 billion in 2025 to buy cryptocurrencies for their corporate treasuries — more than double the amount raised in U.S. IPOs this year.

Unlike in 2020, when MicroStrategy's Saylor stood alone in selling shares to buy bitcoin, a new wave of companies — from toy manufacturers to semiconductor firms — is executing similar strategies with institutional backing. Capital Group, Galaxy Digital, and D1 Capital are among the firms pouring cash into companies that raise funds to accumulate digital assets directly. The surge has extended beyond bitcoin to include lesser-known tokens, often with higher risk-reward profiles.

One of the most prominent examples is Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI), a public crypto treasury company being formed to hold large reserves of HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid blockchain.



The HSI initiative was first disclosed on July 14, when Sonnet BioTherapeutics (SONN) announced a reverse merger with Rorschach I LLC, a newly formed vehicle backed by Atlas Merchant Capital, Paradigm, and other high-profile crypto investors. The deal will transform Sonnet into a platform for executing a corporate crypto treasury strategy focused not on bitcoin or ether — but on HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid blockchain.

Upon closing, the combined entity will be renamed Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI) and continue trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. HSI will initially hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens, valued at $583 million at the time of signing, and will deploy at least $305 million more to acquire additional HYPE on the open market. If fully executed, this will create one of the largest institutional reserves of a single altcoin ever disclosed.

According to Atlas CEO Bob Diamond, a former CEO of Barclays, who will chair the new company, the opportunity is not just financial — it's strategic. In his words, "We think HYPE is pretty special." Diamond said the team believes Hyperliquid offers a differentiated offering in the digital asset space, and that HSI is uniquely positioned to take advantage of it because of its mix of crypto-native and traditional financial leadership.

Matt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm, said institutional demand for Hyperliquid has been rising, but noted that direct access to the HYPE token is still limited in the U.S.

While Sonnet will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HSI and continue to manage its biotech programs, the company plans to divest non-core assets. Existing investors will receive contingent value rights (CVRs) tied to Sonnet's therapeutic portfolio.

The board of HSI will include Bob Diamond and Eric Rosengren, the former president of the Boston Federal Reserve, alongside incoming financial leadership. The deal is backed by Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, D1 Capital, Republic Digital and 683 Capital, and is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

Hyperliquid is the name of a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a high-performance layer-1 blockchain launched in 2023. It was designed to offer the speed and trading experience of centralized exchanges with the transparency and permissionless access of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Its infrastructure includes two core layers:

HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. It is used for staking, governance, trading incentives and as the core asset for value capture across the network. As of the time of writing, HYPE is the fifteenth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and Hyperliquid has processed over $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume.

The surge in institutional attention hasn't settled the debate around HYPE's valuation — despite its strong rally earlier this quarter from a low of $37.41 to nearly $50 (reached on July 14).

At the time of writing, according to CoinDesk Data, HYPE is trading at $42.77, down 3.69% in the past 24-hour period.

Crypto analyst "McKenna" suggested on Saturday that HYPE may still be undervalued based on revenue metrics. He estimated that if the token were trading at the same valuation multiple (known as SWPE, or sales-weighted price-to-earnings) it reached during its last market peak, its current 30-day average revenue of $3.2 million would imply a fair price of $77. His analysis uses a ratio comparing market cap to trailing platform revenue — a common method in both equity and token analysis.

By contrast, "Altcoin Sherpa" signaled caution earlier today. While he praised HYPE's fundamentals — including high user activity, reliable tokenomics and strong team execution — he stated that the move from $9 to over $40 likely exhausted the short-term upside. He said he was holding a small staking position for long-term exposure but was not actively accumulating more at current prices. He suggested he'd wait for a more substantial pullback before increasing his allocation.

The two views illustrate a key tension: even with high revenues and institutional backing, tokens like HYPE can become overextended in the short run — especially when driven by narrative momentum and speculative capital.

Whether HYPE continues climbing or cools from here, the creation of Hyperliquid Strategies Inc (HSI) marks a turning point in how corporate crypto treasury strategies are being executed. Unlike earlier models that focused on bitcoin as a digital reserve asset, HSI is being built around a single altcoin that didn't exist a year ago. With more than $888 million in combined token and cash commitments, the structure resembles a thematic crypto fund — but with a public listing and institutional leadership.

If this approach proves successful, more firms may follow — raising capital not just to hold crypto, but to take concentrated positions in tokens they believe will define the next phase of digital finance.

As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, savvy traders are turning their attention to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a key component of diversified portfolios. According to Bobby Ong, a prominent figure in the crypto space, users can now track NFT floor prices directly on the CoinGecko app, add their favorite NFTs to personal portfolios, and even set up price alerts to stay ahead of market movements. This reminder comes at a pivotal time when many anticipate the resurgence of 'NFT season,' a period characterized by heightened trading activity, soaring valuations, and innovative project launches. For traders, this functionality represents a game-changer, enabling real-time monitoring of NFT assets alongside traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), potentially uncovering arbitrage opportunities between digital collectibles and broader market trends.

Building an effective NFT portfolio requires more than just collecting digital art or virtual real estate; it's about strategic positioning for volatility and growth. With tools like the CoinGecko app, traders can analyze floor price fluctuations— the minimum price at which an NFT from a collection can be purchased— to gauge market sentiment and predict rallies. For instance, historical data shows that during previous NFT booms, floor prices for blue-chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks surged by over 200% within weeks, correlating strongly with Ethereum's price movements due to gas fees and network activity. Traders should focus on on-chain metrics such as trading volume, unique holders, and minting rates to identify undervalued assets. By setting price alerts, you can capitalize on dips below key support levels, say a 10-15% drop from recent highs, turning potential losses into buying opportunities. This approach not only mitigates risks but also aligns NFT trading with overall crypto strategies, where ETH's performance often dictates NFT liquidity.

Current market sentiment around NFTs is cautiously optimistic, influenced by broader economic factors including institutional interest in blockchain technology. While real-time data isn't specified here, traders should note that NFT trading volumes have shown resilience, with recent reports indicating a 20-30% uptick in monthly transactions across major marketplaces. This ties into stock market dynamics, where companies like those in the tech sector investing in metaverse projects could boost NFT valuations. For example, if AI-driven stocks rally, it might spill over to AI-themed NFTs, creating trading pairs worth monitoring. Risk management is crucial; diversify across categories like art, gaming, and utility NFTs to hedge against sector-specific downturns. Preparing for NFT season means simulating scenarios where floor prices break resistance levels, potentially yielding 50-100% returns for early movers.

Incorporating NFTs into your trading arsenal also opens doors to hybrid strategies, blending spot trading with derivative plays. Imagine pairing NFT floor price alerts with ETH futures on exchanges, where a spike in NFT demand could signal an impending ETH breakout above $3,000. Seasoned traders recommend starting small, allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to NFTs, and using stop-loss orders based on 7-day moving averages of floor prices. As we approach what could be a vibrant NFT season, leveraging apps like CoinGecko for alerts ensures you're not caught off-guard by sudden pumps or dumps. Ultimately, this preparation enhances overall portfolio performance, bridging the gap between speculative NFT plays and stable crypto holdings for long-term gains.

Looking ahead, the NFT market presents numerous trading opportunities, especially with the integration of advanced tracking tools. Focus on long-tail keywords like 'best NFT floor price tracker' or 'setting up NFT price alerts for crypto trading' to stay informed. Institutional flows, such as venture capital pouring into Web3 projects, could drive floor prices higher, with metrics showing a 15% increase in funding rounds this quarter. Correlate this with stock indices; a Nasdaq uptrend often precedes NFT rallies due to tech synergies. For actionable insights, monitor pairs like ETH/NFT indices, where a 5% ETH gain has historically led to 8-12% NFT floor appreciations. By setting up your portfolio now, you're positioning for alpha in a market ripe with potential, emphasizing data-driven decisions over hype.

 Sygnum's Fabian Dori says the GENIUS Act brings the U.S. closer to global consensus on stablecoin regulation, paving the way for real-world use cases. 

The GENIUS Act is poised to change the stablecoin landscape by steering issuers away from yield-based models and toward payment-focused use cases, according to Sygnum chief investment officer Fabian Dori.

“The GENIUS Act was recently amended to create a clear separation between interest/yield-bearing stablecoins and those used for payments,” Dori told Cointelegraph. He said this brings the US framework closer to the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, laying the foundation for “global consensus.”

Dori added that the real impact of the GENIUS Act goes beyond regulation. “By providing long-sought-after clarity, it gives confidence to organizations and issuers to develop original, innovative ‘killer apps' that don't just serve their customers' current needs, but create demand for entirely new services, including payments,” he said.

That confidence appears to be translating into growing demand. Giants like Mastercard and PayPal have laid the groundwork for compliant stablecoin use, and companies such as Amazon and Walmart are exploring applications in payroll and cross-border settlements.

He noted that tokenized money market funds are the better fit for investors chasing returns. These funds, which offer a stable value and daily liquidity, are currently yielding 4–5% in US Treasury-backed products, without blurring the lines between investment and utility.

With interest-bearing stablecoins now restricted, issuers are expected to lean into features like real-time settlement, low transaction costs and programmable capabilities that integrate into payment and trading systems, Dori said.

“Utility beats yield now,” Jason Lau, chief innovation officer at OKX, said. He argued that in an increasingly competitive space, issuers will continue to pursue innovative models to drive adoption and new use cases.

Lau also said that the benefits of stablecoin settlement and cross-border efficiency are poised to drive adoption in real-world commerce, with interest from payment giants like PayPal and Stripe signaling just the beginning.

Meanwhile, Aishwary Gupta, global head of payment and fintech at Polygon Labs, said the shift toward utility was already “underway” even before the passage of GENIUS Act.

Gupta said Polygon has observed significant growth in payment-focused stablecoin usage, with their micropayment volume rising 67% from February to June, reaching $110 million. He said:

Despite the shift, retail adoption remains a critical factor. “It's not fintechs that move the needle, but consumer adoption,” Dori said, emphasizing that user-friendly platforms will determine the pace of stablecoin integration.

Gupta also highlighted the importance of retail adoption, noting that Polygon is prioritizing stablecoin infrastructure that supports real-world applications, from enabling sub-cent transaction fees for micropayments to scaling performance for enterprise-grade deployments capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second.

The company is also seeing growing momentum in retail and B2B payment integrations. It is currently working with a firm operating 185 million phones across Africa to facilitate cross-border B2B payments.

“We have enterprises with 7-8 million wallets ready to go live,” he said. “Small payment volumes ($100-$1,000) on Polygon grew 190% to over $563M from February to June. We expect this trend to accelerate in the coming months.”

Meanwhile, Lau said DeFi protocols might be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this clarity, as stablecoins already anchor a tremendous amount of activity onchain. “While there will be some focus on synthetic yields and governance tokens, the opportunity to offer compelling and unique use cases will capture stablecoin demand,” he said.

Passed this month with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes the first federal framework for stablecoins.

Altcoins are pulling heavy attention this week with some surprising price moves and major ecosystem updates. Ethereum's ETF momentum is ramping up, Solana is seeing buy-ins from big traders, and XRP is testing important price levels despite recent dips. But the coin leading the narrative right now is BlockDAG, thanks to its extended BEAT VESTING PASS deadline, record-breaking presale, and a tech rollout that's hitting every milestone before launch.

Each of these coins is trending for a different reason, and together they show just how wide the altcoin playbook is right now. Whether it's speed, scale, or speculative upside, they're pushing forward in unique ways. These are the top trending altcoins making noise this week, and why they matter.

BlockDAG has once again taken the spotlight after extending its BEAT VESTING PASS deadline until August 4. This extension lets users unlock 100% liquidity at launch, with zero lockups, something very few presales offer. With over $353 million raised and more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins sold, the project is setting up for a GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The price is still just $0.0016 for a limited time, while the listing price is locked at $0.05, giving buyers a potential 3,025% gain.

The momentum is backed by real usage. The X1 mobile miner just crossed 2.5 million users, and the new X10 miner demo is live. BlockDAG isn't just talking about community, it's delivering tools. Its hybrid DAG + PoW architecture supports smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps, all while keeping energy costs low. Over 4,500 developers are already building on the network, and the testnet is live with token/NFT creation tools and staking simulations.

With strategic deals signed with Inter Milan, Seattle Seawolves, and Seattle Orcas, and CEX listings ready to roll out post-launch, BlockDAG is being tracked as the leader among top trending altcoins right now. For those watching for timing, the presale ends August 11, but BEAT VESTING PASS disappears even earlier. This is the final stretch to grab BDAG with full launch liquidity locked in.

Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong near $3,770, showing about a 22% gain over the week. The main driver has been the sudden inflow into spot ETH ETFs, $1.85 billion in new capital arrived this week alone, bringing the total ETF inflows to over $2.18 billion. This kind of movement is putting Ethereum back into breakout territory, with $4,000 as the next target. Traders are watching to see if ETH can hold its momentum and push through that level soon.

On the futures side, open interest in Ethereum contracts on the CME reached $7.85 billion by July 26, showing major institutional interest. ETH is also outperforming both XRP and BTC over the last five days. Analysts have identified $3,300–$3,350 as strong support, with breakout potential above $3,850. Ethereum has firmly secured its spot on the list of top trending altcoins, with whales and ETFs aligned for the next potential surge.

XRP is currently trading around $3.19, retreating from a recent high of $3.45–$3.53. That ~6% pullback came after broad market liquidations and some whale profit-taking. Still, the asset has gained around 23% over the past week, and analysts are not backing off. Several forecasts point toward $4 in the short term if the ETF narrative continues and volume returns. Others look ahead to $10 or more in the long run, depending on regulatory moves.

The XRP ecosystem is also growing. Ripple's XRPL now supports a new stablecoin (RLUSD), and real-world use cases are expanding in areas like healthcare through integrations with Wellgistics. While XRP has cooled slightly, it remains one of the top trending altcoins this week. Analysts are closely watching support levels at $3.10–$3.15 to see if the next leg up is coming soon.

Solana (SOL) is trading around $187, down from a recent local high near $200. This correction is tied to overall market pressure and broad liquidations. Still, analysts are projecting a move to $250 if sentiment rebounds. That number isn't random, it reflects trading volume builds and ETF-related optimism that could re-center attention on SOL if ETH and BTC slow down.



Despite the dip, Solana continues to draw attention from high-volume traders and smart contract developers. Some traders are reallocating profits from Ethereum into Solana and speculative tokens like Jupiter or Remittix. Even with short-term price dips, SOL is holding firm as one of the top trending altcoins, with real activity on-chain and developers continuing to deploy new projects. If the price holds current support, the setup for a bounce is already forming.

The trends behind Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are all real and show what's driving short-term volatility across the market. ETH has ETF momentum and strong support around $3,350. XRP is still showing solid upside after a temporary pullback. SOL's dip might be a setup for a bigger breakout once market sentiment recovers.



But BlockDAG isn't just catching up to these coins, it's outperforming on every metric right now: community size, user activity, presale performance, and real utility. The BEAT VESTING PASS gives full liquidity at launch, the presale price of $0.0016 offers an unmatched 3,025% upside, and the launch plan is live and transparent. Among the top trending altcoins, BlockDAG is the only one still in accumulation mode, making it the strongest contender for gains both before and after listing.

 Divine Research has issued 30,000 unbacked USDC loans using Sam Altman's World ID to verify borrowers, targeting underserved users. 

San Francisco-based lender Divine Research has issued around 30,000 unbacked short-term crypto loans since December, using OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's iris-scanning platform World ID to verify borrowers.

Divine offers loans under $1,000 in the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, mainly to overseas borrowers underserved by traditional finance. It uses World ID to ensure users cannot open multiple accounts after defaulting.

“We're loaning to average folks like high-school teachers, fruit vendors . . . basically anyone with access to the internet can get access to our funds,” Divine founder Diego Estevez told the Financial Times. “This is microfinance on steroids.”

Interest rates range from 20% to 30%, with a reported first-loan default rate of around 40%. “High interest rates compensate for these losses,” Estevez said, adding that free World tokens issued to borrowers can be “partially” reclaimed.

Estevez said Divine's lenders are everyday individuals seeking solid returns. “Anyone can provide liquidity. We've engineered the system such that after accounting for default rates and the [interest] rates on offer, providers will always make a profit.”

Divine is part of a growing group of high-risk crypto lenders capitalizing on renewed market momentum and political tailwinds, including support from former US President Donald Trump.

Another startup, 3Jane, recently raised $5.2 million from Paradigm and offers uncollateralized credit lines on Ethereum. Unlike Divine, 3Jane requires “verifiable proofs” of assets or income, but still no collateral.

3Jane plans to introduce AI agents that follow lending rules automatically, aiming to lower rates while enforcing repayment. Defaulted loans on its platform are sold to US debt collectors.

Other players like Wildcat cater to market makers and trading firms, offering undercollateralized loans with customizable terms. According to Wildcat adviser Evgeny Gaevoy, “In the event of a default, lenders co-ordinate directly among themselves to seek recourse.”

Lending remains a small slice of the crypto market but attracts growing attention as institutional players reenter the space. Last week, reports revealed that JPMorgan Chase is looking into crypto-backed loans, planning to lend directly against crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

However, the shadow of 2022 looms large, when major crypto lenders like Celsius and Genesis collapsed. Celsius's CEO Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years for fraud, and Genesis settled a $2 billion lawsuit.

The crypto industry's effort for a more supportive regulatory environment in the US has paid off throughout the year, as evidenced by a recent report from The Hill highlighting the rapid expansion of crypto lobbying efforts. 

According to a recent report by The Hill, at least 27 crypto companies and advocates have submitted their first lobbying disclosures over the past months, reflecting a growing desire to influence legislation that could shape the future of digital assets.

Per the report, these called “newcomers” represent a diverse array of interests within the industry, from betting platforms like Polymarket to gaming companies creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to high-profile events. 

Together, these entities have invested nearly $2.8 million between April and June to lobby for legislation promoting digital assets, targeting key regulatory bodies such as the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

This legislative effort has already yielded results. The recently signed GENIUS Act, which received bipartisan support, is regarded as a significant endorsement for the industry, with the aim of providing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins. 

The House has also advanced several other key bills, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC bill, during a dedicated “crypto week,” featuring creative lobbying tactics.

A total of 73 companies and associations reportedly engaged in federal lobbying activities related to cryptocurrency, spending about $11.4 million. 

Among the new entrants, KuCoin, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, led lobbying expenditures with $1 million, despite being barred from operating in the US market for at least two years due to regulatory violations.

Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Solana Policy Institute, emphasized that the industry has struggled not with innovation, but with understanding how emerging technologies fit within existing legal frameworks. 

While some companies like Bitdeer Technologies, which focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, continue to address currency-related issues, many firms are leveraging blockchain technology for a broader range of financial products. 

Polymarket, operating under the name Blockratize, allows users to place bets on various events using cryptocurrencies, while Gala Games sponsored the White House's Easter Egg Roll, promoting their online gaming platform that rewards players with crypto tokens.

Looking forward, the crypto industry is keen to see the Senate advance the CLARITY Act, which aims to provide a regulatory blueprint for federal oversight of crypto firms. 

Additionally, a bill banning the Federal Reserve (Fed) from issuing its own digital asset or central bank digital currency (CBDC) has garnered interest from within the sector.

However, Whitehouse-Levine expressed concerns about the potential for regulatory shifts, fearing a return to the cautious stance that characterized previous administrations. 

“The pendulum has swung from one extreme to another,” he noted, highlighting the need for consistent and stable regulatory conditions to foster growth and innovation in the industry.

Bitcoin Cash BCH$602.71 extended its recent rally on Sunday, rising 5.25% to $583.64 as of 08:54 GMT, according to CoinDesk data. The token has now gained 10.5% over the past week, 15.7% over the last two weeks and 17.3% over the past 30 days.

Sunday's breakout has caught the attention of several technical analysts, who flagged bullish signs in both price action and trading structure. 

Analyst “CW” noted that BCH is “breaking through the sell wall” — a term traders use to describe a heavy concentration of sell orders at a specific price level. When price breaks through such a wall, it often signals that buyers are absorbing that supply and that upward momentum could accelerate. CW pointed to $620 as the next potential target if this breakout holds.

Another analyst, “Ultimae GL,” focused on the long-term chart, observing that BCH had cleared a resistance level that had held for an extended period. Long-term resistance typically refers to a price ceiling that has rejected upward moves on multiple occasions. When that barrier is broken, it may signal the beginning of a new upward trend. Ultimae GL cautioned that traders might want to wait for a “decisive breakout” — which usually means a strong daily close above the resistance — before entering, but still projected that BCH could climb as high as $680 in the near future.

A third analyst, “XForceGlobal,” described the current price structure as highly bullish. They noted that BCH has stayed above its so-called “base trendline” for about a month. A base trendline is a diagonal line connecting the series of higher lows in an uptrend, and continued price movement above it suggests that buyers are consistently stepping in at higher prices—another sign of building strength. The analyst described the rally as “not just good news,” but “fantastic,” given the sustained buying activity.

Bitcoin Cash, a fork of bitcoin that launched in 2017, is designed to serve as a peer-to-peer digital currency with faster, cheaper transactions. Its recent upward trajectory, combined with accelerating volume and bullish chart setups, has renewed interest from both retail and technical traders.

According to Bobby Ong, GeckoTerminal now provides real-time tracking for over 10 million tokens across more than 240 blockchain networks, significantly enhancing transparency and accessibility for decentralized exchange (DEX) traders. This expansion offers crypto traders a comprehensive platform to monitor token prices, liquidity, and trading volumes, supporting more informed trading decisions in the rapidly evolving DeFi sector (Source: @bobbyong).

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading, tools that provide real-time insights into decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become indispensable for traders seeking an edge. According to Bobby Ong, the journey of GeckoTerminal began in late 2021 with a straightforward mission: to create an accessible real-time DEX tracker for everyone in the crypto space. Fast forward to today, and GeckoTerminal has expanded dramatically, now monitoring over 10 million tokens across more than 240 blockchain networks. This growth underscores the increasing demand for transparency in the crypto community, especially as the market matures and attracts more participants. For traders, this means enhanced visibility into token performances, trading volumes, and liquidity pools, which can directly influence decision-making in volatile markets like those involving Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

As GeckoTerminal tracks a vast array of tokens and networks, it empowers traders to identify emerging opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine spotting a sudden surge in trading volume for a lesser-known token on a network like Solana or Binance Smart Chain – such insights can signal potential breakouts or reversals. With the crypto market's 24/7 nature, having access to real-time data on over 10 million tokens allows for precise entry and exit points. For instance, traders could analyze on-chain metrics such as token swaps, holder distributions, and liquidity changes to gauge market sentiment. This transparency is crucial in a space where scams and rug pulls are risks, helping users avoid pitfalls while capitalizing on genuine momentum. In terms of broader market implications, GeckoTerminal's expansion reflects the growing institutional interest in DeFi, potentially driving more capital flows into tokens like Uniswap (UNI) or PancakeSwap (CAKE), which could lead to increased volatility and trading volumes.

The emphasis on transparency highlighted by Bobby Ong aligns with current market sentiments, where regulatory scrutiny is intensifying. Traders can leverage GeckoTerminal to monitor how news events impact token prices across multiple chains, correlating with overall crypto market trends. For example, if Bitcoin's price hovers around key support levels, GeckoTerminal's data might reveal correlated movements in altcoins, offering arbitrage opportunities between chains. Without specific real-time prices today, we can note that historical patterns show DEX volumes spiking during bull runs, often preceding price rallies in major pairs like ETH/USDT or BTC/USDT. Institutional flows, as seen in recent ETF approvals, could further amplify this, with tools like GeckoTerminal providing the granularity needed for high-frequency trading strategies. Traders should watch for resistance levels in popular tokens, using the tracker's insights to predict breakouts, especially in emerging networks where new tokens launch frequently.

From a trading perspective, GeckoTerminal's milestone opens doors to diversified portfolios across 240+ networks, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges and mitigating risks like outages. Long-tail strategies might involve scouting low-cap tokens with rising volumes, potentially yielding high returns if timed correctly. However, risks remain, such as network congestion affecting trade executions. Overall, this development boosts crypto trading efficiency, fostering a more informed community. As the market grows, expect more integrations with AI-driven analytics, possibly influencing AI tokens like Fetch.ai (FET) by enhancing data-driven trading bots. Traders are advised to integrate such tools into their workflows for better risk management and opportunity spotting, ultimately contributing to a more transparent and robust crypto ecosystem.

Delving deeper into trading opportunities, GeckoTerminal's comprehensive coverage enables scalping strategies on high-volume pairs, where minute price fluctuations can be exploited. Consider the correlation between stock market events and crypto: a downturn in tech stocks might trigger safe-haven flows into BTC, visible through DEX data. This cross-market analysis is vital, as institutional investors bridge traditional finance with crypto, potentially increasing liquidity in pairs like SOL/USDC. With over 10 million tokens tracked, traders can identify undervalued gems based on metrics like total value locked (TVL) and daily active users. For voice search queries like 'best DEX tracker for crypto trading,' GeckoTerminal stands out for its accessibility. In summary, this evolution not only democratizes data but also sharpens trading edges, promising exciting prospects amid ongoing market innovations.

The NFT market is showing real signs of recovery. 

After months of sideways trading, we are finally seeing momentum: floor prices are rising, market caps are rebounding, and some familiar names are surpassing established NFTs. From Pudgy Penguins surpassing BAYC to Art Blocks' unexpected return, the market atmosphere is changing. 

This article will parse the latest data, highlight the best performing categories and series, and explore whether this is a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a larger trend. 

Key Takeaways:

The NFT market is showing strong signs of recovery. Since the beginning of the month, market capitalization has risen 94% to $6.6 billion, the highest level since early 2025. 

Weekly trading volume jumped 51% to $136 million, on track to make July one of the best performing months since February. 



Sales increased by 7% month-on-month, but the overall sales this month will not exceed that of June. Last month's sales exceeded 5 million, and July just broke the 3 million mark. What's the reason? ETH is rising, and NFT is also rising. In just 7 days, the average price of NFT soared 40% to $146. 



Trading volume decreased, prices rose, the market is changing. The blue chip stock boom is back. 

With the apparent return of the blue chip craze, this article focuses on the best performing NFT categories over the past week, and as expected, PFP leads the way, accounting for 37% of total trading volume. RWA NFTs follow closely behind, accounting for 11%, indicating that the tokenization narrative still has vitality. 



But not all categories have joined the rise. NFTs in the sports, music and fashion sectors have not seen an upward trend. Although game NFTs performed steadily in the second quarter, their popularity has cooled slightly, with sales falling significantly this week. 

Nevertheless, PFP's dominance is in line with current market sentiment. Whenever the NFT market heats up, PFP always takes the lead, just like in previous bull cycles. Some things don't change easily. 

This week's market focus is on the big moves of the top NFTs, the return of popularity, and a series of floor price activities. 

Pudgy Penguins: The new heavyweight collectible

Pudgy Penguins' market value has officially surpassed Bored Ape Yacht Club and is now second only to CryptoPunks. The floor price has risen by 539% since its release, and it has risen by another 7% in the past 7 days. 

How did Pudgy Penguins do it? Simple: they were released during the bear market. From IRL benefits to connecting Web2 and Web3, and now expanding in Asia through plush toys, the brand's emergence is at the right time, especially now that collectibles hype is hot. 



CryptoPunks: Back in the spotlight

The punk era never really ended, but it seems to have regained its luster. This week alone, the floor price has risen by 53%, and the series is still one of the most actively traded collections. 

Don't forget, this was a free mint in 2017. Whenever there is new vitality in the market, the punk series will return to the spotlight. They remain the gold standard for Web3 influence. For some, owning a punk collectible is more than just about making money — it's a status symbol, pure and simple. And now, that status is becoming increasingly popular. 



Moonbirds: Surprise rebound

Moonbirds is back again, and to be honest, it's a bit surprising. After fading from blue chip status, Moonbirds staged a strong rebound: 

What caused this? Following its acquisition by Orange Cap Games in May, the company announced a partnership with Towns on July 19. Holders can now access a private on-chain space and increase points ahead of the airdrop. 

It's worth mentioning that Moonbirds is still down 64% in USD value since launch, so there's still a long way to go. That said, momentum is building. 



Art Blocks: Quietly Return

If anything can release the energy of a bull market, it is the return of Art Blocks. This week, it ranked among the most traded collections, with an average selling price soaring 156%. 

On July 10, the platform announced a major change, launching collector profiles, wallet aggregation, achievement systems, and providing a better user experience for ordinary collectors. 

The market has noticed this too. Top projects like Fidenza have rekindled interest, and Feels like Art is starting to come back into the NFT discussion. 



PFP and art are accelerating, and if history is any indication, this combination will kick off the next NFT bull run. No conclusion has been drawn yet, but the signal has emerged. Looking forward to next week's trend. 

The past week has given us a glimpse of the possible resurgence of NFT: the floor price has climbed, PFP has regained its dominance, and Art has quietly returned with strength. Pudgy Penguins surpassed BAYC, CryptoPunks heated up again, and Moonbirds spread its wings, all of which hint at one thing: the market is shifting and attention is refocusing on NFT.

Key Takeaways:

In a bold move that places it among the global leaders in blockchain infrastructure, Vietnam has officially launched NDAChain, a Layer-1 blockchain platform designed to be the backbone of its digital data ecosystem. This marks a significant milestone in the country's journey toward decentralized data management and Web3 adoption.

Vietnam's digital economy is rapidly evolving, driven by an ambitious government roadmap that emphasizes national data sovereignty and secure infrastructure. The unveiling of NDAChain on July 25, 2025, is not just a technological event but a strategic declaration: Vietnam is here to lead in the Web3 era.

Built and maintained by the Data Innovation and Exploitation Center under the Ministry of Public Security, and developed by the National Data Association (NDA), NDAChain is now officially the trust layer for the country's National Data Center. The blockchain addresses long-standing issues in centralized data architectures such as limited scalability, data breaches, and poor transparency, by establishing a decentralized, auditable system.

NDAChain runs as a Layer 1 permissioned blockchain, meaning access to operate validator nodes is restricted to approved institutions, yet its infrastructure is designed to serve public needs. At launch, the system is operated by a consortium of 49 validator nodes, including by both government agencies and private companies Zalo, SunGroup, Masan, Sovico, VNVC, and MISA.

Fundamentally, NDAChain utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus, which favors the speed and trust over decentralization. Augmented by Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), the latter applies privacy to transactions on the blockchain, so data verification is not made at the expense of phoning home on the user.

Each validator node holds a distributed ledger, can deploy smart contracts, and supports identity verification which are all integrated with Vietnam's national digital ID system (VNeID).

One of the largest NDAChain use cases is NDA DID – Decentralized Identity for Vietnam. It permits people to confirm their identity when making transactions over the internet, or when using public services, or when signing digital contracts in a secure way. The entire solution is fully compatible with VNeID and other national-level databases.

NDAKey enables citizens to verify in real-time claims about their identities, an important component of Vietnam's battle against fraud, impersonation and scams as the country's economy becomes increasingly digitized.



Vietnam is also pushing to transform its export economy by leveraging NDATrace, a traceability system powered by NDAChain. Each product receives a unique digital passport, a UID compliant with GS1 standards and compatible with the EU's EBSI system.

This digital certificate traces a product's journey from production to consumption, enabling:

By embedding these UIDs as QR codes or RFID chips, manufacturers can register tamper-proof records of a product's history directly on NDAChain.

The NDAChain rollout is aligned with Vietnam's National Blockchain Strategy, formalized through Decision No. 1236/QĐ-TTg (2024). The strategy sets ambitious national goals:

With over 20 million crypto users – nearly 20% of the population, Vietnam already ranks among the top 5 globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. NDAChain is now the government's flagship Web3 infrastructure piece.

Vietnam's launch of NDAChain follows in the footsteps of other major economies:

Unlike these, Vietnam has adopted a hybrid model: balancing control and performance with open architecture, allowing Layer 2 applications and private-sector innovation on top of a government-backed chain.

Vietnam's approach:

The government has outlined a phased implementation plan:

Future services expected on NDAChain include:

These applications are being encouraged through incentives for startups and blockchain developers to build on NDAChain's infrastructure.

In the same vein as weather forecast models that predict developing storms, researchers now have developed a method to predict the cell activity in tissues over time. The new software combines genomics technologies with computational modeling to predict cell changes in behavior, such as communication between cells that could cause cancer cells to flourish.

Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) co-led the study that published online on July 25 in the journal Cell. It is the result of a multi-year, multi-lab project at the interface of software development with important collaborations between bench and clinical team science researchers. This research eventually could lead to computer programs that could help determine the best treatment for cancer patients by essentially creating a "digital twin" of the patient.

"Although standard biomedical research has made immeasurable strides in characterizing cellular ecosystems with genomics technologies, the result is still a single snapshot in time -- rather than showing how diseases, like cancer, can arise from communication between the cells," said Jeanette Johnson, PhD, a Postdoc Fellow at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at UMSOM and co-first author of this study. "Cancer is controlled or enabled by the immune system, which is highly individualized; this complexity makes it difficult to make predictions from human cancer data to a specific patient."

What makes this research unique is the use of a plain-language "hypothesis grammar" that uses common language as a bridge between biological systems and computational models and simulates how cells act in tissue.

Paul Macklin, PhD, Professor of Intelligence Systems Engineering at Indiana University led a team of researchers who developed the grammar to describe cell behavior. This grammar allows scientists to use simple English language sentences to build digital representations of multicellular biological systems and enabled the team to develop computational models for diseases as complex as cancer.

"As much as this new 'grammar' enables communication between biology and code, it also enables communication between scientists from different disciplines to leverage this modeling paradigm in their research," said Daniel Bergman, PhD, a scientist at IGS and Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at UMSOM and co-leading author with Dr. Johnson.

Dr. Bergman and his colleagues at IGS then combined this grammar with genomic data from real patient samples to study breast and pancreatic cancer, with technologies such as spatial transcriptomics.

In breast cancer, the IGS team modeled an effect where the immune system cannot curtail tumor cell growth and instead promotes invasion and cancer spread. They adapted this computational modeling framework to simulate a real-world immunotherapy clinical trial of pancreatic cancer.

Using genomics data from untreated tissue samples of pancreatic cancer, the model predicted that each virtual "patient" had a different response to the immunotherapy treatment -- showcasing the importance of cellular ecosystems for precision oncology. For example, pancreatic cancer is a difficult cancer to treat, in part, because it is often surrounded by a dense structure of non-cancerous cells called fibroblasts. The team used new spatial genomics technology to further demonstrate the ways fibroblasts communicate with tumor cells. The program allowed the scientists to follow the growth and progression of pancreatic tumors to invasion from real patient tissue.

"What makes these models so exciting to me as someone who studies immunology is that they can be informed, initialized, and built upon using both laboratory and human genomics data," said Dr. Johnson. "Immune cells are amazing and follow rules of behavior that can be programmed into one of these models. So, for instance, we can take data and treat it as a snapshot of what the human immune system is doing, and this framework gives us a sandbox to freely investigate our hypotheses of what's happening there over time without extra costs or risk to patients."

"Ever since my transitioning from my training in weather prediction at the University of Maryland, College Park into computation, I have believed that we could apply the same principles to work across biological systems to make predictive models in cancer. I am struck by how many rules of biology we don't yet know," said Elana J. Fertig, PhD, Director of IGS, Associate Director of Quantitative Sciences for the Greenebaum Comprehensive Center, and Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at UMSOM and a lead author on the study. "Adapting this approach to genomics technologies gives us a virtual cell laboratory in which we can conduct experiments to test the implications of cellular rules entirely in silico."

Dr. Fertig calls the research "a tapestry of team science" with additional validation of the computational models coming from clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University and Oregon Health Sciences University. The National Foundation for Cancer Research funded the project.

The new grammar is open source so that all scientists can benefit from it. "By making this tool accessible to the scientific community, we are providing a path forward to standardize such models and make them generally accepted," said Dr. Bergman. To demonstrate this generalizability, Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, PhD, the Terkowitz Family Rising Professor of Neuroscience and Neurology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (JHSOM) led researchers in using this approach in a neuroscience example in which the program simulated the creation of layers as the brain develops.

"With this work from IGS, we have a new framework for biological research since researchers can now create computerized simulations of their bench experiments and clinical trials and even start predicting the effects of therapies on patients," said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and UMSOM Dean. "This has important applications to enable digital twins and virtual clinical trials in cancer and beyond. We look forward to future work extending this computational modeling of cancer to the clinic."

The team of senior authors on this study include, Paul Macklin, PhD, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education and Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering at the Indiana School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University, Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, Bloomberg Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Assistant Director Single-Cell Training and Analysis Center (STAC) at Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Fertig are continuing efforts to disseminate this software and extend its integration with genomics data for automatic model formulation through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Informatics Technology in Cancer Research Consortium, who funded this study. Additional benchmarking of this study and applications of the software to breast and pancreatic cancer are supported from numerous NCI grants, the Jayne Koskinas Ted Giovanis Foundation, the National Foundation for Cancer Research, the Cigarette Restitution Fund Program from the State of Maryland, and the Lustgarten Foundation.

UCSF scientists have discovered how microglia engulf and break down amyloid beta, a protein that builds up in Alzheimer's, with devastating consequences for the brain.

In Alzheimer's disease, proteins like amyloid beta form clumps, known as plaques, that damage the brain.

But in some people, immune cells called microglia break down these proteins before they can cause harm. This leads to fewer and smaller clumps -- and much milder symptoms.

Researchers at UC San Francisco identified a molecular receptor that enables microglia to gobble up and digest amyloid beta plaques.

Without the receptor, ADGRG1, the microglia barely nibbled on the toxic protein. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers observed how the loss of ADGRG1 led to the rapid buildup of amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and problems with learning and memory.

"We think this receptor helps microglia do their job of keeping the brain healthy over many years," said Xianhua Piao, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist in the UCSF Department of Pediatrics.

Indeed, when the researchers reanalyzed a prior study of gene expression in the human brain, they found that individuals who died of mild Alzheimer's had microglia with abundant ADGRG1, and mild cognitive impairment -- implying that the microglia ate well and kept the disease in check. But in those who died of severe Alzheimer's, the microglia had very little ADGRG1, and the plaques proliferated.

ADGRG1 is one of hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors, which are routinely targeted in drug development. This bodes well for a rapid translation of the discovery into new therapies.

"Some people are lucky to have responsible microglia," Piao said. "But this discovery creates an opportunity to develop drugs to make microglia effective against amyloid-beta in everyone."

New findings from studying over two decades of satellite observations reveal that the Earth's continents have experienced unprecedented freshwater loss since 2002, driven by climate change, unsustainable groundwater use and extreme droughts. The study, led by Arizona State University and published on July 25 in Science Advances, highlights the emergence of four continental-scale "mega-drying" regions, all located in the northern hemisphere, and warns of severe consequences for water security, agriculture, sea level rise and global stability.

The research team reports that drying areas on land are expanding at a rate roughly twice the size of California every year. And, the rate at which dry areas are getting drier now outpaces the rate at which wet areas are getting wetter, reversing long-standing hydrological patterns.

The negative implications of this for available freshwater are staggering. 75% of the world's population lives in 101 countries that have been losing freshwater for the past 22 years. According to the United Nations, the world's population is expected to continue to grow for the next 50 to 60 years -- at the same time the availability of freshwater is dramatically shrinking.

The researchers identified the type of water loss on land, and for the first time, found that 68% came from groundwater alone -- contributing more to sea level rise than the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets combined.

"These findings send perhaps the most alarming message yet about the impact of climate change on our water resources," said Jay Famiglietti, the study's principal investigator and a Global Futures Professor with the ASU School of Sustainability. "Continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating. The consequences of continued groundwater overuse could undermine food and water security for billions of people around the world. This is an 'all-hands-on-deck' moment -- we need immediate action on global water security."

The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from the US-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. Terrestrial water storage includes all of Earth's surface and vegetation water, soil moisture, ice, snow, and groundwater stored on land.

"It is striking how much non-renewable water we are losing," said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU. "Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Instead of using them only in times of need such as a prolonged drought, we are taking them for granted. Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy."

Tipping point and worsening continental drying

The study identified what seems to be a tipping point around 2014-15 during a time considered "mega El-Niño" years. Climate extremes began accelerating and in response, groundwater use increased and continental drying exceeded the rates of glacier and ice sheet melting.

Additionally, the study revealed a previously unreported oscillation where after 2014, drying regions flipped from being located mostly in the southern hemisphere to mostly in the north, and vice versa for wet regions.

One of the key drivers contributing to continental drying is the increasing extremes of drought in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, for example, in Europe. Additionally, in Canada and Russia, snow, ice, and permafrost melting increased over the last decade, and the continued depletion of groundwater globally is a major factor.

In a previous study, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002 -- 2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized 'hotspots' for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected -- forming the four continental-scale mega drying regions.

These include:

Southwestern North America and Central America: this region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities such as Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and Mexico City.

Alaska and Northern Canada: this region includes melting alpine glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia, snow and permafrost melting across the Canadian high latitudes, and drying in major agricultural regions such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan

Northern Russia: this region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes

Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Pan-Eurasia: this region includes major desert cities including Dubai, Casablanca, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran; major food producing regions including Ukraine, northwest India, and China's North China Plain region; the shrinking Caspian and Aral Seas; and major cities such as Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Dhaka and Beijing.

In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate models -- sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios. Continuous records are critical in understanding the long-term changes in the water cycle.

"This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage," said Chandanpurkar. "GRACE records are really getting to the length where we are able to robustly see long-term trends from climate variability. More in-situ observations and data sharing would further support in making this separation and inform water management."

A Planetary Wake-Up Call

The unprecedented scale of continental drying threatens agriculture and food security, biodiversity, freshwater supplies and global stability. The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change.

"This research matters. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale," said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former Senior Water Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea level rise and help preserve water for future generations."

The study calls for immediate action to slow and reverse groundwater depletion, protect remaining freshwater resources, and adapt to the growing risk of water scarcity and coastal flooding. The research team goes on to say that strategic water management, international cooperation, and sustainable policies are essential to preserving water for future generations and mitigating further damage to planetary systems.

The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis.

About the Study

The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from US-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. The full report details the scientific analyses and regional breakdowns of the drying trends, which have proven robust and persistent despite climate variability.

A new material developed by researchers from University of Toronto Engineering could offer a safer alternative to the non-stick chemicals commonly used in cookware and other applications.

The new substance repels both water and grease about as well as standard non-stick coatings -- but it contains much lower amounts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of chemicals that have raised environmental and health concerns.

"The research community has been trying to develop safer alternatives to PFAS for a long time," says Professor Kevin Golovin, who heads the Durable Repellent Engineered Advanced Materials (DREAM) Laboratory at U of T Engineering.

"The challenge is that while it's easy to create a substance that will repel water, it's hard to make one that will also repel oil and grease to the same degree. Scientists had hit an upper limit to the performance of these alternative materials."

Since its invention in the late 1930s, Teflon -- also known as polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE -- has become famous for its ability to repel water, oil and grease alike. Teflon is part of a larger family of substances known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

PFAS molecules are made of chains of carbon atoms, each of which is bonded to several fluorine atoms. The inertness of carbon-fluorine bonds is responsible for the non-stick properties of PFAS.

However, this chemical inertness also causes PFAS to resist the normal processes that would break down other organic molecules over time. For this reason, they are sometimes called 'forever chemicals.'

In addition to their persistence, PFAS are known to accumulate in biological tissues, and their concentrations can become amplified as they travel up the food chain.

Various studies have linked exposure to high levels of PFAS to certain types of cancer, birth defects and other health problems, with the longer chain PFAS generally considered more harmful than the shorter ones.

Despite the risks, the lack of alternatives means that PFAS remain ubiquitous in consumer products: they are widely used not only in cookware, but also in rain-resistant fabrics, food packaging and even in makeup.

"The material we've been working with as an alternative to PFAS is called polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS," says Golovin.

"PDMS is often sold under the name silicone, and depending on how it's formulated, it can be very biocompatible -- in fact it's often used in devices that are meant to be implanted into the body. But until now, we couldn't get PDMS to perform quite as well as PFAS."

To overcome this problem, PhD student Samuel Au developed a new chemistry technique that the team is calling nanoscale fletching. The technique is described in a paper published in Nature Communications.

"Unlike typical silicone, we bond short chains of PDMS to a base material -- you can think of them like bristles on a brush," says Au.

"To improve their ability to repel oil, we have now added in the shortest possible PFAS molecule, consisting of a single carbon with three fluorines on it. We were able to bond about seven of those to the end of each PDMS bristle.

"If you were able to shrink down to the nanometer scale, it would look a bit like the feathers that you see around the back end of an arrow, where it notches to the bow. That's called fletching, so this is nanoscale fletching."

Au and the team coated their new material on a piece of fabric, then placed drops of various oils on it to see how well it could repel them. On a scale developed by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, the new coating achieved a grade of 6, placing it on par with many standard PFAS-based coatings.

"While we did use a PFAS molecule in this process, it is the shortest possible one and therefore does not bioaccumulate," says Golovin.

"What we've seen in the literature, and even in the regulations, is that it's the longest-chain PFAS that are getting banned first, with the shorter ones considered much less harmful. Our hybrid material provides the same performance as what had been achieved with long-chain PFAS, but with greatly reduced risk."

Golovin says that the team is open to collaborating with manufacturers of non-stick coatings who might wish to scale up and commercialize the process. In the meantime, they will continue working on even more alternatives.

"The holy grail of this field would be a substance that outperforms Teflon, but with no PFAS at all," says Golovin.

"We're not quite there yet, but this is an important step in the right direction."

An analysis of studies incorporating data from almost 30 million people has highlighted the role that air pollution - including that coming from car exhaust emissions - plays in increased risk of dementia.

Dementias such as Alzheimer's disease are estimated to affect more than 57.4 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to almost triple to 152.8 million cases by 2050. The impacts on the individuals, families and caregivers and society at large are immense.

While there are some indications that the prevalence of dementia is decreasing in Europe and North America, suggesting that it may be possible to reduce the risk of the disease at a population level, elsewhere the picture is less promising.

Air pollution has recently been identified as a risk factor for dementia, with several studies pointing the finger at a number of pollutants. However, the strength of evidence and ability to determine a causal effect has been varied.

In a paper published on July 24 in The Lancet Planetary Health, a team led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature to examine this link further. This approach allowed them to bring together studies that on their own may not provide sufficient evidence, and which sometimes disagree with each other, to provide more robust overarching conclusions.

In total, the researchers included 51 studies, including data from more than 29 million participants, mostly from high-income countries. Of these, 34 papers were included in the meta-analysis: 15 originated in North America, 10 in Europe, seven in Asia, and two in Australia.

The researchers found a positive and statistically-significant association between three types of air pollutant and dementia. These were:

According to the researchers, for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³) of PM2.5, an individual's relative risk of dementia would increase by 17%. The average roadside measurement for PM2.5 in Central London in 2023 was 10 μg/m³.

For every 10 μg/m3 of NO2, the relative risk increased by 3%. The average roadside measurement for NO2 in Central London in 2023 was 33 µg/m³.

For each 1 μg/m³ of soot as found in PM2.5, the relative risk increased by 13%. Across the UK, annual mean soot concentrations measured at select roadside locations in 2023 were 0.93 μg/m³ in London, 1.51 μg/m³ in Birmingham and 0.65 μg/m³ Glasgow.

Senior author Dr Haneen Khreis from the MRC Epidemiology Unit said: "Epidemiological evidence plays a crucial role in allowing us to determine whether or not air pollution increases the risk of dementia and by how much. Our work provides further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults.

"Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate, and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems."

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how air pollution may cause dementia, primarily involving inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress (a chemical process in the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins, and DNA). Both oxidative stress and inflammation play a well-established role in the onset and progression of dementia. Air pollution is thought to trigger these processes through direct entry to the brain or via the same mechanisms underlying lung and cardiovascular diseases. Air pollution can also enter circulation from the lungs and travel to solid organs, initiating local and wide-spread inflammation.

The researchers point out that the majority of people included in the published studies were white and living in high-income countries, even though marginalised groups tend to have a higher exposure to air pollution. Given that studies have suggested that reducing air pollution exposure appears to be more beneficial at reducing the risk of early death for marginalised groups, they call for future work to urgently ensure better and more adequate representation across ethnicities and low- and middle-income countries and communities.

Joint first author Clare Rogowski, also from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, said: "Efforts to reduce exposure to these key pollutants are likely to help reduce the burden of dementia on society. Stricter limits for several pollutants are likely to be necessary targeting major contributors such as the transport and industry sectors. Given the extent of air pollution, there is an urgent need for regional, national, and international policy interventions to combat air pollution equitably."

Further analysis revealed that while exposure to these pollutants increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the effect seemed stronger for vascular dementia, a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Around 180,000 people in the UK are thought to be affected by this type of dementia. However, as there were only a small number of studies that examined this difference, the researchers did not class it as statistically significant.

Joint first author Dr Christiaan Bredell from the University of Cambridge and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust said: "These findings underscore the need for an interdisciplinary approach to dementia prevention. Preventing dementia is not just the responsibility of healthcare: this study strengthens the case that urban planning, transport policy, and environmental regulation all have a significant role to play."

The research was funded by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and from the European Union's Horizon Europe Framework Programme.

A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000.

A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000.

Led by Professor Melody Ding from the School of Public Health, the study was published in The Lancet Public Healthand analysed data from 57 studies from 2014 to 2025 that were conducted in more than ten countries including Australia, USA, UK and Japan.

The largest and most comprehensive review to date, the researchers examined the impact that different daily step counts have on the chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and developing diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. Professor Melody Ding says the findings offer a more achievable benchmark for people who struggle to meet traditional exercise guidelines.

"Aiming for 7000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn't been looked at before," said Professor Ding.

"However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2000 to 4000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain.

"We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes -- including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms."

Health benefits at different step counts

The researchers looked at studies in which participants wore step counting devices, such as pedometers, accelerometers and fitness trackers, to track their daily step counts. Starting at 2000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes of people walking more steps a day at 1000 step increments to see whether there was any difference in the risk of early death or other major diseases.

When compared with 2000 steps a day, researchers found that:

"For people who are already active, 10,000 steps a day is great," said Dr Katherine Owen, co-author and chief analyst of the study from the School of Public Health. "But beyond 7000 steps, the extra benefits for most of the health outcomes we looked at were modest."

The researchers are working with the Australian government to use the evidence from this study to inform future updates to physical activity guidelines.

"Our research helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements," said Professor Ding.

Experts are calling for future studies to explore how step goals should vary based on age, health status and region, and to include diverse populations and longer-term data to strengthen the evidence. Professor Ding says this kind of detail is rare and will be useful for health practitioners when tailoring advice for patients.

So much for optimizations.

Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has endured a rocky launch, with widespread reports of poor performance overshadowing its otherwise positive critical reception. Despite favorable reviews, subpar optimization has sparked significant furor among players. In response to the backlash, publisher 505 Games has rolled out a series of patches aimed at improving performance, something that's become customary for modern AAA releases.

Unfortunately, in their rush to "fix" the Soulslike title, the developers may have crossed a line by misleading players about the game's graphics settings. Acting on community reports, popular hardware analyst Daniel Owen tested the game's performance, comparing the launch build with the latest 1.4 patch, only to discover that the internal rendering resolution is now clamped below native, even when the resolution scaling slider is set to 100%.

For context, a game at 100% resolution scaling is supposed to render natively — meaning it outputs frames at the same resolution as your display without relying on upscalers like DLSS or FSR. Upscaling only comes into play when the internal resolution is lowered to gain performance, but in this case, the game is apparently using hidden upscaling while falsely reporting a native resolution.

In his testing, Owen compared Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' launch version with the 1.4 patch that just came out, using an RTX 3060 at 1440p Ultra settings. This distinction is important because lower-end GPUs are the ones that can show the discrepancy the best, as more peformant cards will simply produce more FPS from the get-go.

In the launch version, at 100% resolution scaling, TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) delivered 29 FPS, serving as the baseline for native performance. Lowering the scaling to 67%, 59%, and 50% progressively increased performance to 45 FPS, 50 FPS, and 58 FPS respectively, as would be normal for upscaling. These are modest improvements that make sense.

However, once the game was updated to patch 1.4, the results became quite suspicious. At 100% TSR, performance suddenly jumped from 29 FPS to 37 FPS — a 28% increase that far exceeds typical optimization gains from a minor patch. Meanwhile, at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling, the performance boost was a modest 2–3 FPS, suggesting that the "native" 100% setting was no longer truly native.



The behavior with DLSS and FSR confirmed Owen's suspicions. On the launch version, DLSS at 100% (labeled as “DLAA,” or native-resolution antialiasing) delivered 28 FPS, with predictable gains as the resolution was lowered. But on the 1.4 patch, DLSS at 100% suddenly matched the performance of DLSS Quality mode from the original build — roughly 45 FPS — even though the menu still displayed 100% resolution and told that DLAA was active.

Moreover, FSR showed similar behavior. At 100%, it reported 39 FPS post-patch, compared to 28 FPS at launch. Yet, again, the performance at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling improved only slightly, pointing to a hidden resolution cap at what seems to be 80–85% of native resolution, even when players think they are running fully native.

According to Owen, this behavior is a direct manipulation of the resolution scaling slider: “I'm absolutely not on board with a game lying about being at native rendering resolution. Players who have hardware powerful enough to run natively simply can't anymore. It's just making the game look worse.”

What's more, patch notes for version 1.3 included a vague line about “adjustments to super sampling resolution limits on select GPU models,” which may have been a quiet attempt to hide this change. In reality, the update seems less like a performance optimization and more like a forced upscaling placebo to artificially boost frame rates.

While upscaling has become an industry standard — most modern games encourage using DLSS, FSR, or TSR for better performance, one would at least expect the game to run at native if they choose to do so. By clamping resolution and mislabeling settings, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is going beyond just blatantly lying about the image quality, rather they're robbing players of control over their graphics fidelity.

Hahaha this game is the gift that keeps on giving. After people ceaselessly complained about bad perf, the dev patched it so that the internal resolution slider in the gfx settings never gets to 100%, despite setting it to 100%. Thankfully AMDaniel Owen caught them red-handed. https://t.co/QSzCWFMc2D pic.twitter.com/0SPw2c7NeIJuly 26, 2025

For players, this means the game looks softer or more pixelated even when maxed out. What's funny is that there is a clear 2-3 FPS improvement with the optimization patch at non-native scaling, meaning that actual work has been done to extract more juice out of the game. But instead of laser-focusing on that, the devs took a strange shortcut and shot themselves in the foot.

This discovery is likely to cause further backlash unless 505 Games issues a statement or reverts these changes. As the host pointed out, the difference between launch and patched builds suggests that the "performance improvements" were mostly achieved by lowering visual quality... without telling the players.

Until then, users with sharp eyes (and sharp GPUs) may find Wuchang: Fallen Feathers looking worse than ever, despite what the settings menu claims.

The material reminds us of wattle and daub, a home building material harking back 6,000 years.

Japanese company Lib Work has outlined its 3D house building technology, which relies on soil as its primary constituent. The company's Lib Earth House Construction (machine translation) process uses a massive 3D printing assembly, rather like others we have seen used for building coffee shops, bus stops, and so on. However, instead of relying on cement to create concrete, Lib Earth dwelling utilize a patent pending mix of earth, slaked lime, and natural fibers.

The materials mix outlined above reminds us somewhat of wattle and daub, a building material and technique that has been around perhaps 6,000 years. Wattle and daub buildings have been known to remain serviceable for as long as 700 years. So there should be no real worries about living in a ‘mud' house, as long as the construction has been finished correctly. Actually, Lib Work notes that its structures “have a strength equivalent to earthquake resistance grade 3, making it a safe home to live in even in Japan, a country prone to earthquakes.” Indeed, grade 3 is the highest rating for such architectural durability in Japan.



Another attraction of the 3D printed house is that it opens up the flexibility of free form design. Structures which would be a challenge to fabricate from traditional building sheet materials don't phase 3D printers. Lib Work unveiled their first Lib Earth construction a year ago, but that was basically just a small hut. The Lib Earth model B, unveiled recently, with its cluster arrangement, is far more sophisticated and home-like, as you can see from the imagery.

Lib Work's charts indicate that its 3D printing mix for homes is made from 65% soil and sand, the with the next largest chunk consisting of slaked lime binding material, finished off with a few percent of natural fibers and ‘other' stuff.

The firm has done some CO2 emissions calculations / measurements. According to these figures, the new material's reliance on “soil, lime, and natural fibers that are abundantly available on Earth,” and eschewing of cement, means far lower CO2 generated per residence.

The Lib Work figures show that building a typical house of this stature might cause about 45,000kg of CO2 emissions. This figure is reduced by more than half, to 22,434kg of CO2, when using the new 3D printing construction tech and sustainable materials. That's even better than a ‘wooden house,' it goes on to claim.



If you think the above Lib Earth project is pretty ambitious, moving further down the linked page, you will find some eyebrow-raising information about the firm's Mars Building Project.

Naturally, on Mars, the planned major component of buildings from Lib Work would be Martian dirt.

Soil and dirt are generally regarded as lowly materials, even extending to being insults. However, common earth's status might improve by becoming a valued building material for modern, sustainable 3D printed dwellings.

Soil is actually one of the key ingredients of Hikaru Dorodando shiny balls. Numerous YouTube videos provide evidence that it is possible to polish dirt. Whether this technique could be used in the finishing of your 3D printed soil house, for marble effect features, remains to be seen.

"Nuclear modernization" refers to the development of the Sentinel missile to replace the Minuteman III missile. It is arguably not a modernization at all. It is a spectacular example of spreading seemingly endless money around for political ends. It's a $140+ billion boondoggle that has somehow escaped the attention of DOGE while they were hunting down what they claim is $170 billion in fraud and waste in places like the national parks.

A transitional step for manufacturing and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Kioxia and SanDisk have begun sample shipments of their ninth-generation BiCS FLASH, a NAND flash technology that blends legacy architectures with modern enhancements to create a bridge between the current BiCS8 generation and the forthcoming BiCS10. While BiCS10 is expected to deliver higher capacities through a cutting-edge 332-layer design, BiCS9 takes a more cost-optimized approach, targeting enterprise SSDs built for AI workloads and mid-tier storage solutions where efficiency and performance balance are key.

What sets BiCS9 apart is its hybrid construction, achieved through CMOS directly Bonded to Array (CBA) technology. In this process, the logic and memory cell wafers are fabricated separately under optimized conditions before being bonded into a single, high-performance package. This innovation allows Kioxia to mix and match mature cell structures—such as a 112-layer BiCS5 or a 218-layer BiCS8—with a modern I/O interface. The result is a chip capable of delivering Toggle DDR 6.0 speeds of up to 3.6 Gb/s, with peak speeds reaching 4.8 Gb/s under controlled testing conditions.

Despite employing fewer layers than BiCS8 or the next-gen BiCS10, BiCS9 still brings meaningful upgrades. Write performance is up by 61%, read speeds improve by 12%, and power efficiency rises by 36% during writes and 27% during reads compared to previous 512 GB TLC designs. An 8% increase in bit density further underscores the careful engineering that allows BiCS9 to deliver strong performance without inflating costs.

Kioxia's roadmap positions BiCS9 as a transitional step, enabling the company to refine manufacturing techniques and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture. This strategy is particularly relevant as AI-driven data workloads demand faster, power-conscious storage solutions capable of feeding GPUs with minimal latency, especially with the extreme ambition associated with the AI boom.

Kioxia's approach with BiCS9 contrasts with rivals like Samsung and Micron, who are betting on aggressively scaling layer counts to achieve capacity gains. While competitors push beyond 300 layers, Kioxia is focusing on hybrid architectures that offer faster time-to-market and better cost efficiency. Working with a consumer-facing industry veteran like SanDisk ensures Kioxia, who invented NAND flash, stays highly competitive through mixed R&D efforts.

Therefore, the company's long-standing partnership with SanDisk has been instrumental in shaping the BiCS series, combining Japanese manufacturing expertise with SanDisk's deep storage market presence. Since their joint venture began in 2006, the two companies have co-developed multiple generations of 3D NAND technology, pushing the limits of scaling and performance. BiCS9 serves as their new marquee offering, alongside Kioxia's own efforts to set new industry standards.

Popular bleach brand Clorox filed a case against Cognizant, its IT provider, after the company discovered that the latter had simply given away access credentials to hackers posing as employees. According to an NBC News Report, this breach allowed Scattered Spider, a hacking group that targets company service desks, to infect Clorox with ransomware in August 2023. This IT support gaffe allegedly resulted in around $380 million worth of damage and disruption for Clorox.

Cognizant manages Clorox's internal networks, and employees who have issues with their passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and VPNs must coordinate with the IT provider to regain access to their system. However, Clorox alleges that the Cognizant Service Desk gave access passwords without verifying the identity of the caller. Such action would contradict the policies that have been set in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access, which Ars Technica says include an internal verification and self-reset password tool. In case the user does not have access to this, Cognizant must check their identity by asking for their manager's name and their username. This would reset their password, but it will also email the employee and their supervisor to help ensure some level of security.

Unfortunately, this did not happen in several instances. Instead, Cognizant staff simply handed over the passwords without confirming the identity of the caller, it is claimed. One partial call transcript provides evidence of this, with the alleged hacker telling the Cognizant employee, “I don't have a password, so I can't connect.” They then replied without hesitation, “Oh, ok. Ok. So, let me provide the password to you, okay?”

Assuming the identity of authorized personnel is one of the most basic social engineering attacks, which is why many IT companies deploy several measures against it. However, it seems that Cognizant's employees were too trusting and violated protocol, potentially leading to millions of dollars in losses for Clorox. This goes to show that no matter how robust and sophisticated your cybersecurity is, it can always be breached at its weakest point.

“Cognizant was not duped by any elaborate ploy or sophisticated hacking techniques,” the lawsuit asserts. “The cybercriminal just called the Cognizant Service Desk, asked for credentials to access Clorox's network, and Cognizant handed the credentials right over.”

On top of layoffs and uncertainty for future nodes.

Intel's transformation under CEO Lip-Bu Tan is entering a ruthless new phase. The company, which only days ago revealed $2.9 billion in quarterly losses and the slashing of 15% of its workforce (something it already planned since last year), is now spinning off its Network and Edge Group (NEX) as a standalone business. It's the latest move in a "sweeping effort" to streamline Intel's core operations while divesting anything that doesn't fit Tan's new, AI-first strategy.

The plan, confirmed through a customer memo first reported by CRN and later corroborated by The Register, outlines Intel's intention to find strategic investors for NEX. Intel will remain an “anchor investor,” much like it did with Altera—the programmable logic division it acquired in 2015 and partially sold off earlier this year. The NEX business, which covers networking silicon, Ethernet, and communications infrastructure, will now chart its own course. “Backed by Intel, this new, independent company will be positioned to accelerate its customer-facing strategy and product roadmap by innovating faster and investing in new offerings,” said Sachin Katti, the group's chief and Intel's current AI strategy lead.

For Tan, the NEX spin-off is emblematic of a broader philosophy shift: Intel is exiting everything that's not essential to its x86 and AI ambitions. During its Q2 earnings call, Tan described Intel as being “overextended and inefficient,” citing a workforce reduction to 75,000 employees—a drop of over 30,000 from early 2025—and a pivot away from its once all-consuming foundry expansion plans. Even Intel's crown jewel, its process technology roadmap, is on the chopping block. Tan warned that Intel's next-generation 14A (1.4nm-class) node could be canceled entirely if the company fails to secure a major external customer, effectively surrendering the cutting-edge process race to TSMC and Samsung.



Intel's core CPU roadmap remains on track, at least for now. Panther Lake, built on the 18A node, is still planned for late 2025 with a heavy emphasis on AI performance and reintroducing Hyper-Threading to P-cores. On the server side, Granite Rapids is progressing, but AMD's EPYC dominance continues to challenge Intel's position in hyperscale workloads. With the NEX division spun out, Intel hopes to tighten its focus on these critical markets while cutting off segments that dilute margins.

The parallels to Altera's spin-off are impossible to ignore. Like Altera, which Intel sold a 51% stake in to Silver Lake earlier this year, NEX could thrive as an independent entity free from Intel's corporate bureaucracy. But the timing of the move raises questions about Intel's ability to stabilize its finances while keeping pace with rivals in both AI and semiconductor technology. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has already admitted to having fallen way behind in a previous memo as well.

To no one's surprise, Intel stock already took an 8% hit following its earnings report, and the news of the NEX spin-off underscores just how aggressively Tan is restructuring the company. Whether these bold moves will pay off depends on Intel's ability to execute on its AI roadmap, deliver competitive x86 products, and—perhaps most critically—find the partners it needs to keep its process technology ambitions alive.

Say goodbye to EufyMake 3D printers—for now, at least.

It's safe to say the 3D printing landscape has changed significantly from year to year, with many companies coming and going. A solid few have managed to stick around with notable success but today, however, it looks like one more might be backing down as Anker is reportedly pulling away from the 3D printer market. This information comes to us from an interview with Anker spokesperson Brett White shared by The Verge.

Anker has sold 3D printers under the name EufyMake for a while, with the AnkerMake M5 and AnkerMake M5C standing out as their flagship printers. These devices are no longer available, as well as a few critical replacement parts and accessories. Shortages, according to White, are due to supply issues that have made it impossible for Anker to reliably source the critical components they need.

While the two printers have been removed from the EufyMake website, you can still find a UV printer available. This is way different from your standard FDM 3D printer. This printer can print onto surfaces like textiles or wood and was recently part of the most successful Kickstarter campaign ever. The components that Anker is unable to source seems, at the moment, isolated to their FDM devices.

White confirmed that the AnkerMake M5 and AnkerMake M5C will no longer be made available for sale on an indefinite basis. It's possible that sales may resume in the future if components are more readily available. However, it's just as possible that Anker will no longer support these devices or create new models in the future.

White did assure that some accessories will remain available to customers but aren't listed for the public, so they can't be found on the website. Thus, customers need to reach out to EufyMake support (support@eufymake.com) to inquire about replacement components. It is also important to note that the availability of hotends and extruders for the M5C in particular are a hot issue, and these pieces may not be available even through support.

In 2021, researchers in Antarctica noticed giant cracks developing on the Brunt Ice Shelf, an enormous stretch of ice on the continent's northwestern corner. Two years later, the fracture grew so large that a gigantic iceberg almost twice the size of New York City broke free in a process called calving, sending scientists scrambling to investigate the icy chunk, which they named iceberg A-81.

A team of researchers affiliated with the British Antarctic Survey sought to understand the forces driving this “crack behavior” in the huge ice shelf. By devising a mathematical model to account for natural forces affecting ice shelves, the researchers found that iceberg A-81—and most other icebergs, for that matter—likely snapped off from tidal forces buffeting the ice shelves in spring, when the currents are strongest. 

The paper, published in Nature Communications on July 24, supports common-sense assumptions about environmental forces playing a major role in driving calving events, but the proposed model could also improve prediction models for calving events, a historically challenging task.

“Understanding what controls the timing of these events is crucial, because calving not only affects the shape and melt rate of ice shelves but also their long-term stability,” said study lead author Oliver Marsh, in a statement. “It's incredibly exciting to uncover a link between something as predictable as the tides and the dramatic, sudden process of iceberg calving.” 

For the paper, Marsh and his colleagues first devised a mathematical model to calculate the threshold for crack behavior in the ice shelves using ocean tides or wind patterns as potential stressors. Next, they tested their predictions against GPS and radar data, paying close attention to the subtle movements and stresses that appeared within the ice shelf over time. They noticed that the fractures tended to grow most in spring, which happens to be when tides are strongest.

The model, however, is a simplified interpretation of real-life dynamics in Antarctica, the study authors admitted, and it better explains smaller, gradual changes in crack behavior. This means that more dramatic events—like extreme temperatures from climate change—will cause even bigger rifts in the ice. “Tides and wind are key to the timing of small individual rift growth events here,” the authors wrote in the paper, “but it is notable that an iceberg collision in 2021 caused more substantial rift growth in a single event than throughout 2020.”

Nevertheless, the study marks a crucial step in modeling the role of environmental drivers in calving events, which the authors argue will subsequently inform our models of iceberg calving under such extreme atmospheric or ocean conditions. Large icebergs also influence ocean circulation and local ecosystems, so the new model could serve as a useful tool for structuring research projects in Antarctica, Marsh explained. 

“Icebergs like A-81 can be thousands of square kilometers in size and account for roughly half of all ice lost from Antarctica each year,” Marsh said. “This kind of insight brings us closer to forecasting major ice loss events and their impact on sea level with far greater precision.”

The annual festival brings together science, YouTube and little mayhem.

Open Sauce is a California festival that brings together crazy inventors, makers of every sort, and 150 nerdy YouTubers for a weekend of hands-on exhibits, live demos, and community connection. Founded by YouTuber William Osman, the event is like a science fair for grown-ups, with over 500 projects on display, from combat robotics to 3D printed musical instruments.

The YouTube element sets Open Sauce apart from other festivals. YouTube creators were invited to host panels and presentations on a number of topics, like 3D printing, science education, animation, prototyping inventions, rocketry, and much more. They also shared strategies for becoming a successful YouTuber. When they weren't on the stage, fan favorite creators could be spotted touring the exhibits and giving autographs. Presentations were live-streamed for a Virtual Open Sauce experience and recorded for on-demand playback through Sauce+, a streaming service dedicated to Open Sauce creators.

I had a chance to sit down with founder William Osman, a well known YouTuber and engineer to ask him why he started the festival. “I did it for the community," he said, “YouTube in the early days was a bunch of people who had a weird hobby, who would get together and collaborate making videos.”



He told me he wanted to bring back that earlier sense of community, and give nerds like himself a place where everyone could show up, hang out, and share their projects and “unhinged inventions.” He also said that Open Sauce is a place for makers to go crazy with their projects without worrying about how polished and professional the results might be. Osman feels that Open Source shows people, especially kids, that science and engineering are accessible and fun.

“It turns out that most people aren't actually really good at science and engineering,” he said. “They're pretty bad at it, and you just keep making mistakes over and over again until you make something more. And so when people come to Open Sauce, what I want them to see is that process, the real engineering process. I want them to look at what people have done and feel like I could do that myself, and come to the realization that it's not about being perfect, but it's about trying things until it works.”

Osman said that YouTube is an important element for the maker community as an outlet for sharing their creations. In the real world, many people do not have access to a community of like-minded creators like what they can find online.

“YouTube is a very important part of inspiring the next generation of engineers because it's the easiest place to show off fun, interesting engineering. And that's why we have 150 YouTubers at the Open Sauce to just communicate STEM and science and creativity out loud, online.”

I spent the whole weekend seeking out 3D printing makers and the projects they brought to Open Sauce. Several well-known 3D printing YouTubers were at the event, such as CNC Kitchen's Stefan Hermann, Made with Layer's Thomas Sanladerer and Joel Telling, the 3D Printing Nerd. I found Telling at the Elegoo booth checking out a set of mechanical cosplay wings printed in PETG by fellow creator Willow Creative. Willow was unable to attend the show, but she lent her wings, made on a Centauri Carbon and Orange Storm Giga, to Elegoo to show off. The amazing wings are lit with addressable 3 mm LED strips and powered by batteries worn on a backpack.



Elegoo also brought several 3D printed games for visitor to play, as well as tiny open source dancing robots, based on the OTTO robot design and run on ESP32-S3 chips. The shells were printed on the Centauri Carbon.



Elegoo also brought its latest 3D printers to the show, such as the Centauri Carbon and the yet to be released Jupiter 2, a 16K resin printer with a 14-inch LCD screen. Disclaimer

Full disclosure: Elegoo sponsored my travel to San Francisco.

Some projects were so well done, you couldn't even tell right away that they included 3D printing, like this “world's largest laptop” by No Bitrate's Alex Corea. The laptop is a massive 500% copy of a 16-inch Alienware X16 gaming laptop, with a fully functional trackpad, wireless mouse, and 77-inch screen. The light-up keys are each four inches wide, and the not-so-portable device weighs in at 370 pounds. It's about the size of a dining room table.



Some 3D printed projects were literal works of art, like this dragon skeleton made by YouTuber Bobby Duke Arts using a hand held 3D pen then sanded down with a Dremel tool. The dragon was on display in the Creator Museum, along with other projects created by featured YouTubers.



On the complete opposite end of the spectrum was Rob Cockerham's project, titled “3D print your name in 38 seconds”. I have to admit, my eyes lit up when I saw he was using my first 3D printer, a stock 2016 Creality CR10. Cockerham used a special script to print any name in, you guessed it, about 38 seconds. I gave him my twitter handle, which took more like 46 seconds. Cockerham said he chose to bring this project because demonstrating 3D printing normally takes way too long.

I've seen 3D printed guitars, violins and drums, but this was the first time I've seen a 3D printed “brass” instrument. Ben Heath and his dad brought several bugles, a natural horn (the precursor of the French horn) and a trombone for people to experience. Visitors to the booth could play one of the 3D printed buisines (a long straight horn from medieval times) using a printed mouthpiece they could keep. The horns were all printed in segments on a Creality Ender 3 using PLA, then glued together and sealed with epoxy to make them airtight. They actually sounded very good, especially when Heath demonstrated them using a standard metal mouthpiece.



One of the most intriguing booths was run by a local branch of the non-profit Precious Plastic, a worldwide, open source community of plastic recyclers. The group showed how plastic can be shredded, melted down and injection molded into products that could be sold. They demonstrated their technique by making Open Sauce coasters, using a mold that was carved with a CNC machine. Though the booth was recycling bottle caps, the method could be used to recycle 3D printer scraps, like PLA poop from multicolor machines.



Several of the exhibitors were showing off projects to launch businesses, like Andrew Swaim with his Kit of Plants Kickstarter. His faux plants are a mix of handcrafted fire-resistant paper and 3D printed parts. He originally made the plants to decorate his camper (also on display as a mobile maker studio).



If you want to see more Open Sauce goodness from an awesome electronics nerd, then check out my friend Jeff Geerling's vlog on his second channel, Level 2 Jeff.

Hi, we're Shraman and Shreyas Kar, brothers and founders of Golpo: the most powerful AI video generator for explainer videos. Golpo turns your documents, internal workflows (PDFs, Jira boards, GitHub repos, Google Calendars, etc.) into fully produced, customizable explainer videos through our platform or API in any language. Our videos can be used for anything from creating complex workflows, product demos, technical papers, or even stories starring your baby cousin and Captain Underpants in Bengali.

Ask: Try it: video.golpoai.com

Reach out: If you want to use our API or generate videos at scale, email us at founders@golpoai.com. We'd love to chat.

Here is a video made by Golpo explaining Golpo.

https://youtu.be/3jyBks8QxQo







Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc…

But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. A video can change someone's mind in a way almost no other medium can.

Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. If you need to actually communicate something, no AI video tool would be useful for you.

We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents.

Golpo is built specifically for use cases on explaining, learning, and reporting, and feels authentic and engaging in a way no other AI video generator does.

After Golpo generates a video, you can fully customize its animations frame by frame. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes

We are both brothers and Stanford CS students and have been building together our entire lives.

This is exactly why governments should step in and regulate Visa and MasterCard, to prevent them from banning porn or other adult services.If this kind of banning goes too far, there will come a point when even Joe Blow and his dog start using cryptocurrency. And once (truly private and anonymous) cryptocurrency becomes widely circulated, people will no longer need to exchange it back into fiat currency. Joe might start paying other people directly with crypto and eventually, perhaps even his rent, utilities, groceries...?And then what? How will governments collect tax revenue?

That game advocates staunchly for civil rights and the autonomy of women, children, and other minorities. The Holocaust allegory is so on the nose you can't even call it veiled. It says domestic abuse is unforgivably, undeniably wrong.They don't even care about marginalized groups or even women themselves. Any piece of content that gives them the heeby jeebies, any media that has conflict: banned. Doesn't matter if it even supports their purported agenda.

Say 50% of the queer content on itch is innocuous dating sim games much which may not have any pornographic images at all.There is another chunk, idk the amount, that is clearly not nice and what dishonest groups bundle that 50% into.There is seemingly little interest even acknowledging that other chunk of content as being a problem though. I dont want queer dating sims to be banned but they are gonna be if no one is honest about what shows up next to them in places where they exist.

You don't get porn movies on Netflix or Disney stream. You don't get adult toys in your local grocery store. Why do we sell porn on Steam?Why haven't game stores just spin off separate store front for porn content? It is basically free, since they already have the infrasructure.While being removed from general stores, porn has become very visible on big gaming platforms which majority of customers don't associate with porn. Backlash is inevitable.I think we can expect a bigger push against porn in general as pendulum swings back on the other side.

For extremely explicit stuff, sure, the adults-only line might be clear for a lot of folks. But other stuff is not as clear cut: if media describes sex at all, is it adult? Even Supreme Court justices have trouble defining in this area.…and all of that is ignoring the elephants in the room: whether or not explicit media even should be restricted for non-adults, the fact that there are highly variable and localized levels of people's preparedness for adult media (even more variable and subjective than developmental cutoffs for alcohol sale), and the abundant historical evidence that attempts to draw an acceptability/adults-only line in subjective areas like this are inevitably extended to provide cover for political agendas (e.g. homophobia).

But the problem isn't porn. That's the low hanging fruit for a massive power grab The problem is that card companies can/will/did blackmail multiple companies into changing, and in some small cases shut-down their entire businesses.In a post-cash world, this is completely unacceptable, and a blatant power grab. If the payment processors are allowed to set this precedent, then there will be nothing to stop these for-profit companies from blocking anybody, anywhere from buying anything - for any or no reason.People are blaming a specific protest group. Personally I believe they are being scapegoated. And honestly if a tiny group from a tiny economy are so easily able to control international macroeconomics, then the root cause is still that the card services are vulnerable to such an attack.The only appropriate response is swift and severe regulation of these critically necessary card and banking services, up to and including the dissolution of both Visa and MasterCard - and in the US strict caps on card fees, as well as an amendment to the Constitution ensure that our right to own property permanently includes the right to buy property.Are the payment providers going to weaponize their de facto control over all purchases to target guns next? Churches? Birth control? Inner-City hospitals?
Which apps or social music companies do you think they'll allow to live, or die? 
Will they blackmail the Internet service providers? Political parties? Entire countries? Which side of which wars do you think Visa will force us to support? Is a company called "MasterCard" for or against letting people with your skin color buy food?
You don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody should have to know.It doesn't matter where you land politically, the point is that these companies cannot be allowed to wield this kind of control.
Our society really does depend on it. 
...Because we can't go back to cash anymore, and they very much know it.

I mostly agree with this.  There are legitimate issues with even the biggest and most respected porn sites being very lax with taking down underage and nonconsensual content.  The card companies AFAICT aren't being pressured to reform because of this kind of content, but more the LGBT content which is harming nobody.

Credit has become ubiquitous, in a manner that belies its supposed purpose, at least as was originally practiced before consumers were offered and employed credit for absolutely everything.Then again, governments and "regulated" entities are also capable of blackmail. I'm not sure these private companies would ever have an incentive to care about what you spend their money on unless governments gave them a reason to - which is why this is happening. At the end of the day you run into the same perpetual problem - you want x, some mob wants y. Good luck.

In the US at least the classier vibrators have been starting to be sold first at shops like Sharper Image, and now, indeed, grocery stores.  The packaging of course would not raise any questions from kids, and they are sold in the same aisles as condoms and lubricant.  "Sexual health" is the umbrella term which feels like it is in play.

I'd be more interested in questioning these than why porn is available on Steam. I mean, Disney is essentially an anti-porn product, so I get that, but Netflix is a perfectly reasonable platform for porn. I don't see any reason adult toys can't be sold in Walmart or whatever.> Backlash is inevitable.I don't know. This doesn't seem like a grassroots movement.

Collective Shout, the group behind this latest censorship push, also wanted Detroit Become Human to be banned because the story depicted someone abusing a child. If we're banning that, why not ban memoirs of child abuse survivors or "James and the Giant Peach"?You suggest it would be easy for Steam and Itch to run alternative storefronts. Given that they removed content that was offensive to their payment processors, they'd need to engage with high-risk payment processors to power these new store fronts. To say nothing of the technical work involved,  those high-risk payment processors certainly charge more for their services. That'd raise the already high 30% that Valve takes on most transaction.Additionally, if a games journalism website also has relationships with payment processors, are they allowed to review adult games even if those reviews don't include pictures? Or are they going to be equally punished for giving adult content a positive rating?This all limits the options available of responsible adult consumers and costs creators of LEGAL content revenue.===†Here's a longer look at your examples:Define adult toys. I assume you mean dildos. Walmart doesn't sell those in physical stores, but they do sell them online. Additionally they, like most other stores, do sell lube, condoms, and vibrating rings in their brick and mortar store. Every clothing store that sells underwear sells something many would describe as lingerie. Target has an entire lineup of "after dark" board games stocked right next to Candyland."After Netflix published a marketing poster showing the [11 year old girls] twerking in revealing cheerleading outfits without any context, an online petition calling for the cancellation of the US release received more than 140 thousand signatures."'According to a source close to the production, Pixar's next feature film, “Lightyear” does feature a significant female character, Hawthorne, who is in a meaningful relationship with another woman. While the fact of that relationship was never in question at the studio, a kiss between the characters had been cut from the film. Following the uproar surrounding the Pixar employees' statement and Disney CEO Bob Chapek‘s handling of the “Don't Say Gay” bill, however, the kiss was reinstated into the movie last week.'

Because the payment processing is unreliable and prohibitively expensive. For all the whining about "moral pearl clutching", the reality is that adult oriented businesses deal with massively higher rates of fraud and charge-backs. Visa and Mastercard couldn't care less about the ethical issues, it's simply a risk calculation for their business.

reply

The answer is, I think, monopoly environments: they contain poor incentive structures for competitive differentiation, and encourage extreme risk aversion by the monopolists. Add to that the “it's not really about chargebacks, it's a culture war” agenda (which isn't just lobbying pressure on payment processors; plenty of the calls are coming from inside the house there), and the outcome of de facto censorship is likely.

reply

This gets repeated, but it's not the real reason. If it were, Visa/MasterCard would be fine with a store like Steam offering those games as e.g. crypto-only purchases.

reply

reply

The risk is not from Valve; disputes pass through to the processor. This is the same problem dating sites, gambling, etc. all deal with. Any sufficiently large adult oriented business becomes a de-facto payment processor, where their entire core business function is in managing this risk, not whatever they actually do for the end user. It's either that, or charge the exorbitant fees that come with using a niche provider who takes on that risk.

There have been several scandals related to payment processing and money laundering, and some of them connected to companies that do a lot of business with porn. Usually, you will see banks breaking away when those scandals break to the public.However, banks do not break away just because they don't like the transactions they're seeing. What they actually do is to enforce stricter rules by financially penalizing those who make them lose money. Your transactions are getting canceled a lot (by having to be flagged/undone/paid back etc.)? You'll have to pay higher fees, and if it keeps happening, you will lose your license.You know when they do often break immediately, however? When there are campaigns by special interests groups, usually connected to conservative groups, to paint companies as having illegal content, even when they don't have this problem any more than any social media platform. In those cases, they don't wait for any tribunal.

Yes but no. Currently the issue is that these two payment systems - both credit/debit card networks - (1) have the power to decide with impunity, because they have critical mass. And (2) have visibility into who each vendor is and what they are selling. If there is one case of abusing market dominance, this is it - and for all we frequently hear, this is REALLY not all that common. (And it's "funny" that we hear a lot about Apple's app store - but not about their anti-adult content rules!)For example, right now a bank would have a VERY hard time preventing you from paying for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT with crypto. That bank would have no visibility into who you are paying with that crypto. There are other crypto intermediaries but they are "diffuse". Nobody in there has both visibility and power.For example, right now some vendors accept gift cards as payment. Buy a Home Depot gift card in cash at your local store and use it to pay for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT. Obviously this is not a very efficient payment infrastructure but it exists.But yes of course, imposing to credit card networks to be content-blind would be helpful and soooo much more efficient.

They could not allow those games to be sold through those particular payment processors and require wire transfers instead. More cumbersome payment method, but better than outright banning them.If the payment processors try to dictate what content these sites may host even when it  involves competing processors that sounds quite anti-competitive practice.

They're not "targeting" payment processors. Payment processors have to deal with significantly more problems due to the nature of porn games and chargebacks. Fix those problems and the payment processors won't have a reason anymore to ban porn (or anything). What's the point of a capitalist economy if not for startups to target market needs like these?

reply

This is commonly repeated, but doesn't hold up. Chargeback fees (especially for card-not-present transactions) are paid by the merchant and are simply increased (with reserves required) for high-risk accounts. It also wouldn't make sense to target hyper-specific niches if it were really about chargebacks, they would go after all of it, and go after things like the CS marketplace.But the biggest giveaway IMO is that they do not allow, e.g., Steam selling these games crypto-only. It's either remove them entirely or remove credit cards entirely. If it was really about specific titles having high fraud/chargeback rates, selling them some other way would be fine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point> Operation Choke Point was an initiative of the United States Department of Justice beginning in 2013 which investigated banks in the United States and the business they did with firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other companies that, while operating legally, were said to be at a high risk for fraud and money laundering.There's a whole list on the Wikipedia article of the kinds of legal businesses that were targeted by this.  Some of them make sense, but others look like very serious 1A and 2A violations.

You can read the bill's author (Kevin Cramer) discussing that bill and his motives for writing it:https://web.archive.org/web/20250715113010/https://fedsoc.or... ("Debanking: The Newest Threat to Free Speech and Religious Liberty?) (2024)> [Senator Kevin Cramer] "...I've heard that one from some pretty big bank presidents - but they get a lot of noise in their left ear and you have activist investors and whatnot that are saying, hey, you know what? We don't like coal. We don't like oil, we don't like natural gas. We don't like private prisons, or we don't like ammunition shops or gun manufacturers or whatever the case might be, the entire category or industry and says, "Well, so we're not going to bank them. We're going to debank them. We're not going to bank them. You're disqualified from getting money from us.”,  and they're starving these industries out. And all this really is, in my view, you guys is this is a political agenda where they're utilizing the leverage of the financial services sector to accomplish policy goals that they can't accomplish any other way."

Had to look into it a bit.From looking at the text of the bill, it looks like the sponsor did not like Operation Choke Point [0], which was specifically targeting banks that did business with Payday Lenders, Ponzi Schemes, and other shady vendors.This also included pornography, but I'm willing to bet that's not what Sen. Cramer was upset about. More likely, he's simply serving the interest of his donors.He also might have extremist "small business" constituents that are perhaps selling racist/sexist/homophobic merch, and they don't like being told that their bank/credit card processors are refusing to process payments on that swag.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point

Between that and someone actually creating a viable Steam competitor, I will say the government breaking them up and rolling out their own solution would be even less likely. You'd have fights on both sides of the isle and from privacy groups. Not that we have much privacy now under the current scheme, but there's at least a tiny bit of separation between V/MC and the government.What should happen instead is regulation. They should be held to the same standards as legal tender since they're used in place as such. They shouldn't get to decide how it's used, and that should be enforced.

When I used to kill cops in GTA Vice City as a kid, 20 years ago, I wasn't killing actual cops(duh!). Has society lost their collective marbles since then, and can't differentiate what's a real crime and what's manufactured fiction anymore? Should we also ban all porn off the internet on the same logic?None of the games banned by Valve in the Visa/Mastercard scandal had any CSAM related stuff in them, they were just weird/degenerate for puritans, however they were not illegal.BTW, has anyone seen the female erotica book section in Barns & Noble? If we banned those games for being too erotic, we should also ban those books then, because in those books, women subject themselves to a lot of degenerate smut and they love reading that shit, yet nobody judges them or asks for that to be censored.So then why is society and the private sector bowing down to some screeching harpies activist group who just want to ban all stuff they dislike, even though it's all legal to the T and nobody is being hurt?Why isn't this activist group putting pressure to release the Epstein files, since actual kids have been harmed there? Are they going undercover with police officers into human trafficking orgs to fight child abuse? NOOO, of course not, it's much easier to claim you scored a victory for child abuse by going after people's video games for having computer generated pixels of kids. Get effed!

I suspect the answer is unironically yes to that question. I have seen far too many people citing fiction as 'evidence' for their positions. I think media literacy in the bottom half of the bell-curve has literally gotten so bad that distinguishing fiction from reality is beyond the capability of at least 10% of the population. In adults without any diagnosed mental disability.

I'm beginning to wonder if that's exactly what these religious cults are having issues with.If we think about it, liberalism came to existence partly as antithesis to medieval church ideologies. Maybe principles such as freedom of speech and freedom of thought within liberalism used to be specific reactionist smite against whatever religious bigotry around back in 1400s-1600s, and stressing what everyone thinks as the most liberalist, neutral, and rational take on these topics is what they find insulting.Not that I necessarily care, but I do want to know if there's any good ways to get them up to at least year 2000 and beyond. It's 2025 after all.

In this case with Steam and Itch.io they are targeting legal games and is just 100% in the wrong. There is a checkered history of Visa/Mastercard dropping legitimate causes because it's hot politically. Which is also in the wrong.Bitcoin/crypto was supposed to be the way around this kind of censorship, but that's basically a ponzi scheme so that's not the way forward. Unfortunately Visa/Mastercard have a monopoly on the market and they use it regularly to keep out competition. Regulation/investigations need to be done to fix this, but that sure as hell isn't happening under this presidency.

The point I'm more interested in here is the "Why do you people always presume they know what is best for other people?". To which my answer is that many people make it their job to care about what people are exposed to. Often it's rooted in extensive experience and literature. I don't think it's a good notion to outright disregard everyone who seems to have a better idea on how people should live. Among other things, not everyone needs to make the same mistakes over and over again, like falling into an addiction, just because "they can't tell me to not fall into this addiction".And yeah, there will be a lot of busybodies as well. When there's power, there will be abuse as well.

Well. Let's examine the context of the conversation. You replied to the statement "Don't like porn? Cool, don't buy it or avert your eyes!" with "Why do you then tell others how to live their lives? Is really leaving everyone to their own devices the good idea?"Most folks have a healthy relationship with porn, and a reasonably-healthy relationship with sex in general. Given that the US is a reasonably-free society, its default stance is "Mind your damn business, and everyone else will mind theirs.". You rejected the call to avert your eyes from something that is moderately offensive. This indicates that -when it comes to porn- you're not content to mind your own business while people quietly go about their own. This means that you are the busybody poking his nose in other people's business.

It would be ridiculous to deny a water supply hookup or electrical mains to a church because the water or electrical companies are opposed to those beliefs.Analogously, legislation should be passed to prohibit considering downstream use for all financial transactions.If the government wants to go after criminals, it can do it by itself.

The claim isn't "we don't like it", the claim is "this is damaging to society".I don't agree with such things in many cases (and many people disagree with me when I'm the one saying something is damaging to society), but it's important to note the difference or you will always be arguing against something other than their claim.> No one, including governments or payment processors, should be in the position to decide whether a platform can sell something or not.It's kinda the job of the government to decide such things; but an automatic extension of that is, it's not the job of the payment processors… and I think they should be banned from doing so because it's damaging to society to let them take on this role.

That's their framing, it's not what they actually do.If Collective Shout was a group that studied which things caused harm, and then campaigned against those things, then the point you're trying to make could stand.They're not. They've campaigned to ban rap artists, GTA 5, "50 Shades", lingerie ads, whatever random thing is around at the time - always under the pretext that it harms someone, but never with any evidence or substantial arguments that it does.In practice groups like this campaign against whatever they don't like, so it's correct to refute them on those grounds.

If anything, it's actually the other way around. Their puritan views of what makes a healthy society is what informs their likes/dislikes.They are legitimately fighting for what they legitimately think will make a healthier society. If you assume otherwise, you will misjudge them.

This defines them as identical. Morals are what people think makes society better, and their absence worse.There's lots of other ways to dislike something besides morals.For example, I don't like spectator sports. It's not a moral issue, just taste, so me not watching sport is genuinely sufficient.Conversely, I think analytics tracking is harmful to society even though I also find it interesting to see the results, and should be banned. Me simply not using it isn't enough.Anti-porn people? I disagree with them. If they are motivated by religious fundamentalism, then I disagree with the foundation of their worldview. But this is how it is not simply enough to respond with "if you don't like it, don't buy it".

You've indicated two things here which you assert are legitimate:* Their fight for their goals* The thinking underlying these goalsOn the latter: Nobody except the people doing the thinking can (at least with current technology) truly know.  And it may be entirely unimportant.  My best guess is that u/fenomas has it about right; their aesthetic seems to have informed a manufactured narrative about societal impact.  It may be that these people have personal unresolved sexual trauma which is activated by these subjects.  Surely no matter their reasons, they deserve to be treated with compassion.  But I don't think that u/fenomas is being illogical here, or failing to steelman their position; I think that it's perfectly reasonable to question someone's basis for advocacy of censorship.However, on the former, I more strongly disagree with your use of the word "legitimately".  Using the heavy hand of the state (including the unfortunate configuration in which payment processors need its anointment and good graces and are thus vulnerable to political pressure) to censor the internet - a resource characterized chiefly by its cross-cultural and cross-political availability and unity - is not a legitimate tactic.  The internet does not seem to tolerate this variety of censorship; in every instance, the Streisand Effect, May 35, and similar phenomena have quickly and decisively punctured the erected walls.Whether these people truly view these materials as likely to harm society or not, their legitimate avenue of change is through voluntarily persuasion, not censorship by way of force.

That's inferiority complex pushed into moral superiority feeling. All just emotions of unbalanced/uneducated people who should know better but clearly don't. No place for such behavior in truly democratic society, their rights to decide what should be happening and what shouldn't generally end at the door of their house (and even that just within legal framework).Otherwise lets give some room for neonazis too for example, they certainly have a vision about how the society should look like and behave. They are at the end just bunch of folks who want to change society for what they consider a better one, right?

In some countries, maybe.  In the US, there were concerted attempts (like the First Amendment to the Constitution) to prevent that from being the government's job, because of the fear that government would use that job to suppress dissent and coerce opinions.If payment processors are picking up that job, and doing so in a coordinated manner that doesn't allow porn companies to simply say "use these payment rails to do business with us, not those ones," it is not unreasonable to suspect that they are doing so not for their own business interests but as a proxy for powers that the government is denied.  Someone should be taking a long look at whether the US-based payment processors are becoming a tool of censorship and, if so, how that censorship is being coordinated.  It's not like Visa and Mastercard come up with these things independently and on a whim.

Anyway, some people wouldn't even call it censorship if private businesses disagree and decide not to do business, for any reason, even if it's public pressure. Should private payment processors be free to choose whose money they process? If not, why not? Be really careful with your answer, because taking away their freedom to choose is a type of censorship, and possibly a worse one because it would be a public/government censorship and not a private transaction censorship. Steam and Itch.io do still have the right to ship all these games, they're choosing not to. They also still have the right to use other payment processors, and/or create their own.I'd be willing to bet the payment processors in question would rather not be forced to cut off business, and do not care whether people pay for porn. They are simply trying to avoid public backlash and avoid being blacklisted by a large number of people who happen to believe porn is damaging.

If I were to take a stab such a protocol, it would live on a web of trust that kept track of interpersonal debts.  So if Alice owes Bob, and Bob owes Charlie, then Charlie can "pay" Alice by instructing Bob to cancel both of those debts.  In this case Bob is the clearinghouse.  Some network connectivity is needed (Alice, Bob, and Charlie all on the same network) but it still works if the internet partitions.  We incentivize Bob to keep his device available for this by creating a new debt when the transaction settles: this time it's one where Alice and Charlie owe Bob for having been the transaction processor.If Bob didn't want to act in this capacity, he wouldn't have trusted Alice and Charlie to begin with.  Charlie would then need to find a different path to Alice if he wanted to use the network to pay her.  (Presumably they don't trust each other directly, otherwise they'd be creating new debts instead of cancelling transitive ones).  In this scenario I suppose Bob would be acting as "censor" but his capacity to do so is not greater than any other user of the network.For Charlie to be fully denied the ability to pay Alice, one of them would have to be behaving so badly that everyone refuses to trust them. That's a desirable outcome, if we must have something like censorship, it should not depend on the feeling of some guy who owns a bank but is otherwise unconnected with the parties of the transaction.  It should be decided by the people who are near to Alice and Bob on the trust graph and therefore have to deal with the real world consequences of Alice and Bob's behavior.  If they want to collectively prevent those two from doing business, that's their right since it's their community that that business is happening in.One imagines this featuring in cases where some rich foreigner wants to set up mining operations that would poison the drinking water.  The locals can collectively prevent that foreign money from buying local groceries, thereby limiting the ability of the foreign actor to harm them.So that's my harebrained idea.  But I'm not making up fictions and asking people to treat them like money.  The people involved with USD are. If they want us to continue participating in their harebrained idea, they should recognize that giving us a system with problematic properties represents a risk that they might lose their privileged position.  My point is just that it's on them, the designers of the system, to figure it out how to make it all work--we need only accept or reject it.

There's a 3rd explanation: fetishes aren't inborn, but they're not instilled by porn either.  Instead, they develop through a complex interaction of psychological, developmental, neurological, and cultural factors.One theory is that, if a person repeatedly experiences sexual arousal in the presence of a specific object or situation (even coincidentally), the brain may begin to link that stimulus with arousal (classical conditioning).  Or if the experience isn't repeated but it is intense, it can become imprinted as erotically significant.  In both cases, the fetish can be considered “latent” in the sense that it existed prior to one's encounter with porn related to that fetish.  Porn simply revealed what was already there (and showed the viewer there are others out there like them, too!).So-called “normal” sexual behavior is just the median of millions of data points.  There is not one person who fits that median in all respects.  Even if you can't find a partner who finds your specific fetish “appealing”, there are plenty of women out there who won't specifically judge you for it either.  Failing that, just enjoy the fetish in your own mind and don't divulge it to your partner.  You're entitled to an inner life, after all.Just as we have a biological imperative to procreate, we also have one to eat.  But I'd disqualify any potential partner who thought less of me for liking tacos.  Again, as long as one's fetish doesn't harm others, why should sex be any different?

she is awesome, and very responsive in the bedroom, but she is no longer a beautiful woman in her 20s. if i've been watching porn in the last month or so, my satisfaction with our sex is much lower. if i haven't, i'm happy.there is also a lot of stuff that seems default in porn, like choking or anal. when i watch porn, i want those things. when i do not watch porn, i don't. my wife does not enjoy those things, but will do them if i ask. but they honestly do not make the sex any better for me.you will say, "well don't watch porn then." but it isn't easy to not watch it. it has a powerful draw. i enjoy watching it in the moment. and it is always just a few taps away on the phone.  it takes willpower not to watch it. if all the tube sites were banned, my life would be better.the damage to me is small. i do not have an addictive personality. i do have a lot of willpower. other people might not be as lucky.

Porn might involve large media files which gives it an up-front advantage re: "more", but it doesn't create shockwaves the way censorship does.  Remove a porn video and the world stays largely unchanged.   Undo an act of censorship and, well, maybe the world stays unchanged, or maybe everything is different.

Irl, if a crazy person gets on a soapbox and starts shouting at everybody, then people can shout back. 
Online, anybody who flamebaits is protected by the platforms and can censor the responses. They delete opposing comments, shadowban users, harsh language usually gets automatically deleted by the platform  - and all that shouting-down is actually just counted as "engagement" which algorithmically boosts and spreads the bad idea further. The argument just directly profits the person with the bad idea, and incentivizes them to come up with even worse ideas to make everybody even madder.This kind of censorship is causing a whole lot of problems right now.

If porn production was widely legal and appropriately regulated, there'd be significantly less market for the edgy stuff filmed in Eastern European basements (i.e. the exact same argument as for marijuana legalisation).There are also a bunch of regimes around the world who love censorship, and also engage in a bunch of human trafficking.

I question the bit about sex trafficking. From my perspective a lot of consenting adults are making a lot of money by willingly participating in the industry. If someone is abusing that and forcing someone to participate, that's already a crime that should be prosecuted. It's not an excuse to shut down commerce between consenting adults.

I have news for you my friend, the Christian right is fucking people up way more than porn.So is the NoFap/incel movement.There are some pretty fucked up people who see women as breeding machines. This is tied pretty closely to the great replacement conspiracy theory and similar white nationalist conspiracy theories.People who believe this junk promote the idea that porn is bad because they want young men desperately horny so they breed with women either with or without their consent. This is the same reason it was a major priority for them to deny women's rights to their own bodies.

It's the same with porn and the Christian Right.  If people feel incomplete and try to fill that gap with a porn habit, the porn is an indicator of a problem, not the problem itself.  Filling that gap with right wing propaganda doesn't address the problem, it just changes it into something that can be used for political advantage.You're missing the root causes here.

It may not be good logic, or even self-consistent, but everyone is always using some logic. I'm saying "find it if you want to convince them." Very few people see themselves as evil, or more accurately intentionally choosing evil. And I say this as someone who was once a member of a religion that has its own state. You're not going to pull people out of that by acting like they're evil. They're trying very hard to be good, just misguided.There's an saying that I believe was popularized during the Cold War.

However, I disagree in two ways.Firstly, while villainizing them is unhelpful convincing them is utterly impossible when religion is involved. It doesn't matter if we learn to understand their perspective, especially as logic/reason often doesn't apply and they aren't being honest about their goals and motivations.I think the best anyone can hope for in such cases is for all parties to agree that we all have belief structures, and that we don't get to force those beliefs on others via the law. IE - "The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins." It's the only rational basis for a society in which different belief systems coexist. The United States used to understand this, but we seem to have forgotten.Secondly, I do agree that it might be easier to reason with folks the further you get from the top of the ladder. The "true believers" who fly airplanes into buildings or who want to outlaw eating candy because it might lead to smiling on a Sunday didn't start down that path last week.The issue with the bottom up approach is that the folks on the bottom seldom have any real power, and for good reason. If pawns were allowed to move backwards they would kill their kings.

Yet, there's a lot of porn there too. A whole lot of voyeur porn too. As well as prostitution, which is also illegal.Making something legal or illegal is just signaling. The real part is how it actually is implemented in practice. And as you imply, things are pretty complex. We really need to be careful about our own tendencies to want things to be simple.

Given that there are two payment processors that have about 90% global market share (excluding China) and your bank chooses the payment processor for the most part, yes we should regulate them and force them to process payment for any legal business.They have the ability to effectively determine what we can spend our money on when we can't get cash to the vendor in person, and almost every alternative processor has to deal with them and is also subject to their rules.The only way around this is via informal networks. Cryptocurrency isn't an option for many as it's very hard to obtain, due to the duopoly coercing banks and governments to keep people on their systems.I don't live in the US, and where I live has a local electronic non-credit card payment system which has been around since the 80s. It's less popular now because only the card networks support contactless payments instead of swipe/chip and pin. All the systems support contactless use, but banks won't enable it because it has no interchange fees.

I ran an online porn website for almost 20 years. For 15 years it was my primary source of income.I'm in Canada which, compared to the USA is extremely progressive.In 2022, after a decade of doing business with a certain bank as this business, never having hidden anything about what we did,  my wife and I received an urgent, signature required, overnighted letter from our bank informing us that they were terminating our accounts and that we had one month until we would no longer have access to any funds.The way this played out was that we had an incoming wire transfer get flagged and they phoned us to ask us questions about the wire. We answered everything on the phone honestly and transparently. We were doing nothing wrong.A few months later we get another phone call from our branch asking us to come in in person, urgently, and do an "extreme due diligence" check. During this process we had to answer an insane amount of questions about our business activities. They saw a credit card transaction from JetBrains, for example, and asked us to explain who JetBrains was and why we were doing business with them etc.A couple of weeks later we were informed about the termination with a brief letter explaining that we fell outside of their "risk appetite."We managed to get an extension on the closure, and for two months we tried in vain to find any banking in Canada that would take us... and we ultimately ended up shutting down a business that represented two decades of our lives.During that time we reached out to industry insiders, some of which we happened to know were in Canada. They all told us that they bank in the USA.One branch manager at a bank we met with was extremely empathetic but obviously couldn't put her own job on the line, and she explained exactly what was going on.The issue is "Know Your Customer" regulations that are coming into effect that are meant to target things like money laundering. These regulations force banks to ask questions that they never really cared about before. This branch manager explained that a local strip club used to say they were a "banquet hall", and everyone at the branch knew exactly what they were but it was "don't ask / don't tell."But once they start digging into these details because the government is forcing them to, then these things get to their compliance departments. And the policies 
exist because they're afraid of things like human trafficking and other things.And our major banks have foreign investors from all around the world. Including from countries where porn is actually illegal.While you point the finger at puritanism in the USA ... consider that in countries like Iceland, producing porn can land you in jail. Now consider MAJOR investments originating in countries like Saudi Arabia etc. and consider how that might impact your bottom line if they all pull out due to nonsense morality conflicts.

I understand the risk tolerance aspect from a bank, they wouldn't want to give a massive loan to a property developer or oil driller going under water. But when it comes to basic deposit services where nobody is asking them to risk their own money, they should be forced to allow any customer who isn't breaking any laws, such as in your case.

If you take that statement at face value (not sure if you should), it's fascinating to think that your business was able to operate for two decades with what I assume are the standard problems people in the porn industry face (e.g. chargebacks from customers unwilling to admit they subscribed in their SO's presence and so pretending it was a scam, etc.)And yet seemingly none of the bank's risk heuristics based on actual transaction profiling ever went off.Wouldn't that mean that, in practice, being in the porn industry isn't as high-risk as banks / payment processors think it is?And would this not then suggest a gap in the market, for an (ideally vertically-integrated) bank + payment processor + card issuer + KYC provider, who is willing to1. evaluate risk on a customer-by-customer basis (through e.g. continuous dynamic network analysis of transaction flow, with txs annotated with their KYC info) rather than by actuarial categorization; and2. avoid seeking any investment (at any remove) by parties who would insist they avoid these types of customers?

I'm not sure if Bitcoin is the right answer due to the 51% attack vulnerability. And a network of miners where everyone can join in principle sounds pretty yolo, but it seems the be the one of the few organizations that exist outside of government? At least, it does in principle, the fact that the whole crypto industry is a mix of scams and recreation of the actual finance industry isn't helping that case, but a part of it definitely still exists outside of it.We need more digital systems that exist outside of governments. I'm not sure if it's feasible, but stuff like this is egregious.I wonder what our view on all of this is in a 1000 years. People in the future probably look at us in disbelief with how we practiced our ethics.

I think it also follows from such a principle that in general the relevant reasoning should be explicitly articulated when discussing the topic.> It's one thing to recognize that it happens, another to recognize the practice as legitimate, virtuous, or even desirable.Suppose that a thing is explicitly chosen by the majority of the world's population, or dictated by the majority of governments, or imposed by the majority of cultural norms. I am suggesting that dismissing it in favor of your own reasoning is fine, but that doing so lightly is arrogant and misguided.

Humans engaged in tribalistic groupthink committing moral atrocities is a tale as old as time.It is never wise to accept a majority or status quo position reflexively without thoroughly interrogating the ideas held within. A great deal of majority positions are morally reprehensible and ethically indefensible, and that has always been the case throughout human history.Human sacrifices of the innocent were not a "different culture", they were barbaric murders that were always wrong. They were also normative in much of the world for much of human history.The values espoused (but not always upheld) by western societies that many of us take for granted today are the exception to the rules throughout human history - rules that promoted needless bloodshed, widespread suffering, and persecution of the innocent.It is not arrogant to assert that loss of innocent human life is reprehensible and the societies that normalize it should be condemned. To assert otherwise isn't simply innocuously defending pluralism, it's defending atrocities.All life is inherently valuable and I will not apologize for asserting that, no matter how many billions of people disagree for tribalistic, persecutory reasons.

Perhaps the fact that you made a claim without bothering to explain this supposed "extensive, careful, and deliberate thought" of yours? Also the fact that your tone generally comes across as ideologically charged; in my experience zealots rarely engage in patient critical thinking.Certainly I don't suggest that one should blindly favor the status quo when given the chance to think things through. However absent careful thought the status quo is the obvious default. When in Rome and all that. There is nearly always a reason that things are done the way they are done although often the particulars will be quite convoluted.> It is not arrogant to assert that loss of innocent human life is reprehensible and the societies that normalize it should be condemned.Is it really your intent to imply that I have called for such? That is quite the wild leap. I feel compelled to object that the turn this exchange has taken does not come across as being one of good faith.

No, that was not my intention. You are right to object here. I allowed myself to get worked up by inadvertently framing your more methodological perspective as a moral perspective, and your perception that I came on too aggressively in response to that is correct.

I acknowledge that the conservatives raise a number of hard hitting points about corrosion of the social fabric, but observe that even jurisdictions with far stricter laws than the US still appear to suffer the same ills (in addition to those caused by the laws themselves).My view is that this is due to modern technology having fundamentally changed the social dynamic. Continually eroding civil liberties in a doomed attempt to regain some imagined ideal of the past strikes me as nothing more than an obscene parallel to the war on drugs.Given that we clearly recognize that certain activities are detrimental to society when flaunted in public surely we could apply the same principle to various forms of expression? It's not much of a leap - you'll already land yourself in trouble if you go around shouting your head off or intimidating people for example. Analogous to alcohol consumption, I'd much prefer a clear distinction between standards for public displays, secluded public business establishments, and private gatherings than the bizarre scenarios that the current obscenity laws inevitably give rise to.

We live in a world where technology made everyone live in their own bubbles, only consume and reinforce what they already believe, create narrow identities with strict rules enforced by groupthink, and lose track of the things and people that we actually interact and have to deal with on a day-to-day basis.Yet, people think this small stuff that has been around forever, that are tiny parts of our society or lives, that this stuff is the problem with everything today.

See the Steven Donziger[1] case. It was just done more Americanly. Private corporation threw their full weight at a lawyer defending an indigenous population who had their water supply poisoned. Chevron hired a private prosecutor who had him locked up on house arrest for years.Similar to this porn case, the censorship and suppression is coming from market interests rather than government, but they're nearly equally untouchable and even more difficult to hold accountable. You can't vote out the leadership of mastercard or chevron.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger

I've been following the case closely. This is the first time anybody has claimed he's a journalist, AFAIK.Am I missing something?Edit: according to Wikipedia he worked as a journalist for three years before attending law school. So I guess he's an ex-journalist, and ex-lawyer for that matter.But calling the persecution of journalists is false. Maybe persecution of environmental lawyers, but lawyers, unlike journalists, are heavily regulated, and face much higher liability for bad acts.

I used Steven as an example if private prosecution, where a private organization can take away your freedom outside of public prosecutors.Steven did similar work to an investigative journalist at a high level, he brought attention to, and fought for a marginalized group. He did it through the court system rather than through publication. Despite doing it legally.I don't see much of a difference. As recent times have shown, much of the legal system(and legal protections) depend on someone enforcing. Without that, there's little difference between the government boot and the corpo boot.

A habit I've noticed is that a person vulnerable to being addicted to X is more prone to fall back on Y, Z, etc. even when X is fixed. So I only see "this hurts certain people" as a scapegoat. Stairs probably hurt more people in any given day than many activities, we don't base law purely on harm and potential harm.

The issue with GGP is that in context it appears to be an argument in favor of increasing restrictions (ie in favor of the events that the article is talking about) despite disclaiming that "You don't have to agree that it should be banned". That's analogous to a loaded question. Expressing agreement with the literal wording of GGP seems to also carry an implication of agreement with some rather different things as well.

It's perfectly fine to say "I think porn is generally unhealthy and would suggest people not partake, but I think they ought to be able if they'd like". It's also reasonable to say "I think things like porn, alcohol, cigarettes, violence, and/or gambling should be accessible to adults, but they should not be able to advertise in spaces where children are likely to visit (like an online video game store), and stores should check ID to purchase those things, and 'paying via advertising' should not act as a loophole for those ID checks." There's a wide range of reasonable positions to debate that are entirely shut down by basically implying that people are unreasonable to disagree.

I'd actually hypothesise that if you locked three sets of teenage boys in rooms, one with only porn games, one with only social media and one with only sitcoms, that the first group would likely emerge the healthiest of the three. I'm basing this on my bias towards activity and that nobody seems to have bothered with actually doing research on porn games, the organisation pushing for these bans included [1], instead proxying research on porn as a whole for this specific category.[1] https://www.collectiveshout.org/research

Whatever you want. Substance abuse rates. Marriage or long-term partnership rates. Employment. Income. Wealth. Serum cortisol.My assumption is someone actively participating in something, even something unhealthy, is going to maintain cognitive and executive function above someone simply observing. (To the degree these games may be destructive, I'd argue it's in its game mechanics.)We have no evidence pornography causes negative outcomes across population. (Versus among a vulnerable subset.) We have lots of evidence for social media addiction causing broad psychological issues, particularly in children.

Evidence. If you think something is harmful to society, you have a hypothesis. The next step is to test it. Not assume it's true and ban everything.I have seen zero evidence that any of these games are harmful. If I had to hazard a guess, and this is again just a hypothesis, I'd actually suspect that a teenager exposed to porn games is less likely to suffer mental-health issues than one on algorithmic social media or forming intimate connections with chatbots.

Of course, these things don't live in a vacuum; the manufacturers of e.g. pesticides have a vested financial interest in selling their product, because money. They pay for scientific studies in favor of their product, they schmooze (= bribe) with decision makers and politicians, they overwhelm the system, they take their product global and sell it to whoever is buying, etc.Same with cigarettes or asbestos or lead paint; it's part "we didn't know" because it's long-term effects or the science wasn't there yet, but part "shut up and buy my product" too.Anyway, proof that it's harmless is not easy to get in certain cases, not when the effects only show up long-term or when the science doesn't yet know how to test. Was science at a point where they could test for the presence and endocrine effects of microplastics in the human body?

My long-held belief is that there's a certain hubris to saying that you know best for everyone. So I default to letting people do things, since preventing them is exerting power over them. With that framing, you would need evidence that something is harmful if you're going to exert power over other people to prevent them from doing it.

This makes sense. If anybody at any point thinks that something might be bad, it should immediately and permanently be prohibited for everyone. We don't need a mechanism to check this because people are never mistaken or misled, and there is no such thing as a bad actor.Since the principle should always prevail, it applies to people as well. If anybody thinks that another person could do harm in the future, they should be allowed to kill them in order to protect society from harm.A system where the only rule is “every person gets to make the rules for everyone else” isn't the stupidest imaginable thing because

If that's the case, then all these studies were observational studies, which lack the ability to infer causality. They can at best hint at directions to pursue for studies that can infer causality.As a concrete example of the way that observational studies can go wrong despite good intentions: It was believed for a long time that paedophiles have lower average IQs than the general population. This was based on the observation that a larger fraction than would be expected of those caught and sentenced for sexual crimes involving children were of low IQ. Of course, a better explanation of this observation is that paedophiles with higher IQs are better at covering their tracks and evading suspicion.

Until genuine evidence is available, either outcome seems plausible. It could be that consuming CSAM pushes people towards committing sex crimes, or it could be that it "magically" doesn't, the same way people playing violent video games are "magically" unaffected by doing so.ETA: An example of the inability of porn to influence sexual behavior is the plight of gay Western men in the 1950s-1980s. During this time homosexuality was absolutely demonised across essentially all of Western society, so there was ample interest from gay men in "correcting" their "errant" desires (this is not to say that all gay men felt this way). At the same time, heterosexual porn was widespread and easily available, though admittedly to a lesser extent than it is today. Given these forces at play, if it were possible for a gay man to develop an interest in having sex with women merely by looking at heterosexual porn, it does seem like there would have been large numbers of gay men who successfully "converted" to straight men. But AFAIK it is disputed that any such genuine conversion has ever taken place.

The first is that you're banning free expression, and banning free expression is inherently harmful.There's also the displacement theory - with the legal content being much more accessible and regulated to ensure minors aren't involved in production, it displaces illegal content that does harm minors.

And the difficult thing about that is that externalities do exist for some things. Pollution affects everyone, for instance, and those externalities need to be accounted for. It's not a trivial definitional problem to distinguish valid externalities from spurious/invalid claims, unfortunately.

These people are on one end of the authoritarian spectrum. The other are anarchists, usually ancaps in places I frequent, and they are just as wrong because they are ignoring how people in the real world will actually behave. Negative externalities are precisely the thing that they ignore, minimize, or try to redirect your attention by linking you to a 2 hour video which is supposed to address it but doesn't.Well, at least they do generally get out of other people's lives though. But it's a system which doesn't work and when it fails, leads to the rise of authoritarians.

A better example would be to consider that pre-op transgender people, namely MtF, can share the same spaces that were reserved to biological women. For instance in sport. If I'm a woman and now I have to compete with a biological man in MMA because society chose that it's the new normal, yes, I'm going to suffer from it.If society decides that it's fair to feed Tiktok to toddlers who end up having their neurons fried, I'm going to suffer from it as well when they grew up as they won't be able to do their job well. If society decides that it's fair to allow CSAM everywhere, I guess that a few children are going to suffer as it becomes mainstream.We don't live in a vacuum.

I cannot agree with the toddlers example: 1) it's possible it does some damage but as I said, to even consider it, we need proof; 2) even if they are bad at life, it doesn't automatically harm another individual - don't hire incompetents and they won't harm your business. They might harm society in general but society does not IMO have any right to force people to optimize for society's goals. The balance might change if this was true and happened on such a scale that society measurably declined but then I am still of the opinion that we should have mechanisms how a group of people should be able to get together separate themselves from others. We have no right to force the Amish to start using modern tech, even if a few more able bodies would probably be beneficial on some scale. Similarly, if the majority feed TikTok to their toddlers and a minority does not, they should be able and allowed to form their own society with its own rules, as long as everyone participates willingly.

According to your thinking, no one can "force" medical faculties to say that now anyone can buy a surgical doctor degree for 10$, that said if you have to get urgent surgery you'll pay for the consequences as the "doctor" who'll operate won't be qualified.This is why we need basic rules, norms and constraints that allows us to reach a better optimum than the free-for-all that you recommend. It's also a question of personal values: I value more living in a CSAM-free society, than one where pedos can watch it freely. Amishes value being in a highly religious and low-tech society than giving birth without pain or having air conditioning.I agree that leaving the society should be possible (emigration, for instance, as the Amishes did). But each society has its local optimum, so you'll have to choose with different constraints. You can for instance go to Russia where it's legal to own and watch CSAM, but with other constraints.

I have trouble parsing that sentence, did you mean "prevent" instead of "force"?If yes, then it doesn't follow from my thinking at all. Lying is an offensive action by which the liar gains an advantage at someone else's expense. There are expectations of minimum quality standards for doctors, both informal (people's expectations) and formal (state exams / certification). Somebody claiming to be a doctor without fulfilling these expectations is clearly directly harming other people (whether actual harm is done - even if he somehow through sheer luck managed to perform one surgery successfully, the expected outcome is still harm and expected outcome should absolutely factor into his punishment).> This is why we need basic rules, norms and constraintsI never said we didn't.

The problem is actually the slippery slope happened earlier, with advertisers. The slippery slope was advertisers not wanting to advertise on porn sites and adult content. It is the same thing we see with the creation of Algospeak and self-censorship. As the article points out, it is also very hard to accurately classify this information. I mean even on YouTube the other day I got a video in my shorts feed that was flagged for sensitive topic. The video? About a veteran who was wearing a shirt that said "Do not give in to the war within. End veteran suicide." Here's the vid, it still has the content warning[0]. What about this video is sensitive? That it mentions the word "suicide?" (Twice?) There's not even options in the settings and YouTube definitely knows I'm in my 30's.... How do I even say "this was improperly flagged?" We're just letting algorithms shape our culture in a way we clearly don't want. We wouldn't have Algospeak if we wanted it... Sure, covert speech has formed in the past but mostly under duress and the current form allows for a much more rapid iteration and I really don't think that's good for society. It comes with the best intentions, but I guess we all know the old clique, right? The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. As much as it sucks to admit, a lot of "evil" is created by "good" people trying to do "good" things (quotes to let you define good and evil however you want)The reason I point out the argument is we can modify "Don't like porn? Don't buy it." can be modified to "Don't like porn? Don't advertise on those sites."But I think payment systems should have a different regulation. Similar to internet, common carrier. I'm actually surprised this isn't already a rule (it has to be, right?). As long as it is legal, they should be compelled to perform the transaction. Anything else seems like it is actually holding your money ransomed.I'll admit I'm biased and I think payments should be private and we should try to make the system so that digital transactions are as similar to cash transactions as possible, but I'm not convinced either party is in favor of that, nor the banks themselves which would like to make money on that information.[0] https://www.youtube.com/shorts/x6WzOx01Tws

Historically, my observation is that some of the most evil things ever perpetrated by humans were done in the name of trying to make society better. So I'm pretty hesitant to enforce my views on other people or even attempt to. If they were acting in good faith, this would be sort of like a Black Lives Matter type of approach that is trying to raise public awareness around an issue. But they're not acting in good faith in trying to get society to see their point of view. Instead, they are trying to go after the fulcrums of society and enforce their view using backroom deals. It's a transparent power play, and it's not in good faith: real good faith actors look at both sides of the issue, both the values and the harm, and they try to develop a balanced response. This is not what's happening here.

But even if that was true, who's to say that population has to keep growing? There's 8 billion of us, isn't that enough? Housing prices are through the roof and most young people can't even hope to be able to afford a house. Human population has doubled about 4 times in the last 100 years. If it doubles yet again there's going to be 16 billion of us. Do you think the world and humanity can sustain infinite exponential growth? I don't think so. The only reasons to want population growth is because the pension system is a Ponzi scheme, but that's a completely different problem.I also find it interesting that on one hand the argument against porn is, "porn is bad because it encourages X behavior in real life", but then another is "porn is bad because it discourages sex in real life".

The issue is bigger then that. It's weird though. First for context, when population grows, that growth is compounding usually. There's an acceleration.Now that the population is in freefall, the freefall is also compounding. Like there are structural impacts that will effect most of the asian countries (where this problem will hit first) that will effect them economically.

As one of the “dudes satisfying themselves”, I'd happily “do the real thing” if that was an option. This is like complaining that people play spaceship simulator games instead of going out to drive an actual spaceship.

Porn is illegal in South Korea, yet it's the country with the lowest fertility rate. If anything, this suggests a reverse of the correlation.

Sure, games can be beneficial for living out fantasies, but how will it affect your view on women if you frequently consume highly sexist content?  The bottom line of my point is that I think this type of content is too easily available nowadays, and especially too much of it.

reply

I personally don't see the difference. Violence is a primal instinct and studies on video games and violence only concluded short term increases in aggression. Why would a similar conclusion with yet another primal instinct not conclude with short term increased arousal? I don't see arousal as inherently dangerous.>how will it affect your view on women if you frequently consume highly sexist content?Do you feel that people just find "sexist content" from some algorithm, or that already sexist people seek out content to conform to their views?

Just a simple tag system recommending other content with similar tags and good ratings.I agree with the undertone that we need better sex education. Those early years where we don't sell content to 10 year olds should be used to talk about the dangers before sending them off. Too bad such groups also go for an all-abstinence approach.

Seems like everyone is pro-censorship, when they disagree with those being targeted.  Most people supported censorship for anti-vaxers during Covid for instance.  So in most cases it really just comes down to how many people are anti-porn, rather than any stance on censorship in general.

Games that are pedophilia is very different form games that appeal to potential pedophiles. The first one is not only not allowed on Steam but outright illegal overall.

Another way to think of this is 'long tail risk'. Some subset of people out there will develop real life problems from: porn, sex work, alcohol, weed, drugs, gambling, other 'moral' issues. It is difficult to meaningfully address both the median user and the problematic user.See also decrim.

I think many of these slippery slopes are defined in hindsight. What all of these represent are simply struggles for power.

reply

Exhibit A - emotional: the government has outlawed violent crime and wants to outlaw intimidation. Argument “once they outlaw intimidation, next they'll outlaw regular insults, next they'll outlaw criticism”. This is a bad slippery slope argument because (I'm assuming) intimidation should be outlawed. Insults and criticism should not, but are not. If the government votes in evil-gov or you encounter evil-cop, it's as easy for them to harass you for insults and criticism, as it would be had intimidation never been outlawed.Exhibit B - physical: the government wants to give every citizen a brain implant that can be remotely activated to stun them. This would significantly prevent crime. However, it would also be a terrible idea, because now if you get evil-gov or evil-cop, it's significantly easier for them to remotely stun you for non-crime.The key is that in Exhibit A, evil-gov and evil-cop face equal resistance for punishing insults and criticism regardless of whether intimidation is outlawed, because either way, people understand that intimidation should be outlawed and insults and criticism should not. More generally, moving the Overton Window to contain a “good” thing doesn't make it contain a “bad” thing, at least not enough so that the “good” thing isn't worth it. But in Exhibit B, evil-gov and evil-cop face ineffective resistance for stunning people for insults and criticism, because people allowed good-gov and good-cop to give them stun implants for punishing crime; whereas if evil-gov or evil-cop stepped up and said “alright, we're going to give everyone stun implants to punish insults and criticism”, they would face effective resistance.—-Put into perspective: Visa and Mastercard using their Monopoly to effectively prevent payment for depictions of incest and rape, assuming you think that is OK, is Exhibit A. However, Visa and Mastercard having a monopoly in the first place is Exhibit B. My argument is “we should break the Visa and Mastercard monopoly (or popularize crypto) to prevent them from restricting LGBTQ and firearms etc. in the future” (this argument still applies if they're restricting some of that now).

Exhibit B - physical: the government wants to give every citizen a brain implant that can be remotely activated to stun them. This would significantly prevent crime. However, it would also be a terrible idea, because now if you get evil-gov or evil-cop, it's significantly easier for them to remotely stun you for non-crime.The key is that in Exhibit A, evil-gov and evil-cop face equal resistance for punishing insults and criticism regardless of whether intimidation is outlawed, because either way, people understand that intimidation should be outlawed and insults and criticism should not. More generally, moving the Overton Window to contain a “good” thing doesn't make it contain a “bad” thing, at least not enough so that the “good” thing isn't worth it. But in Exhibit B, evil-gov and evil-cop face ineffective resistance for stunning people for insults and criticism, because people allowed good-gov and good-cop to give them stun implants for punishing crime; whereas if evil-gov or evil-cop stepped up and said “alright, we're going to give everyone stun implants to punish insults and criticism”, they would face effective resistance.—-Put into perspective: Visa and Mastercard using their Monopoly to effectively prevent payment for depictions of incest and rape, assuming you think that is OK, is Exhibit A.

Money talks, and it's one of the few ways I have to show my opposition. I hope others will do the same. It's sad, because itch is kinda one of the last few places for "indie" as a thing with the vibe of indies, at least (I mean they aren't Steam or the other big publishers).  I'm surprised Epic didn't buy them out yet just like they did with Bandcamp.  Probably next on the block.

reply

It strikes me that they had a gun held to their head by a mobster. If itch didn't comply, they'd lose all their revenue, and we'd lose the website in its entirety, which is much more than just smut.Pushing back against the payment processors, rather than itch under duress, would have made money talk in the right direction.

It's the same thing as a company needing a building for their factory. They decide they don't want to pay rent anymore, they're going to control their own properties they own themselves now. But the business of managing the property now falls to the business to do. So even when companies own their own properties they often end up hiring a property management company to deal the the day to day operations of running a commercial property. Because in the end they don't want to have to worry about their janitorial contracts, handling elevator certifications, landscaping contracts, maintenance techs, etc. They want to focus on producing widgets.Same thing with hosting a digital storefront. Sure one could spend all the time managing servers on your own offices and ensure good uptime and security and what not, or you can just sign up for Shopify or others and they'll manage it all for you. If managing servers and software stacks and digital security isn't your main business competency, why get into it?Most companies won't want to deal the logistics of handling crypto. So they'll often outsource that work, because I'm the end they want to focus on selling widgets not handling payments. For the same kinds of reasons why they'll hire a company to do cash logistics.Do you need to hire payment processor to accept crypto? No. But in the end you will need to do that work though.I'm not the reason why people choose these big centralized services. I'm not that powerful.

For all of the talk (hype) about how crypto has the potential to avoid the exact type of meddling and manipulation and pressuring we're seeing now, it surprises me that no equivalents to PayPal have really popped up - that best that can be done is apparently something along the lines of what Linux was on the desktop a decade or two ago. Basically, before Valve and others picked up the slack and worked on things your average person actually cares about - notably, gaming and simple(r) to use desktop environments and software stores.Where's the flagship platform for payments that's built on crypto but lets you ignore the technical details, that's trivial to implement as a merchant and is a download away on app stores? If there are a few of those, why would anyone bother with these puritan payment processors?

(Unaffiliated, I hold some pocket money on there not to run a Lightning node myself)The on-chain transaction is just to "fund" a channel between two parties. These two parties can then make unlimited trasnfers between each other instantaneously for free. These nodes are organised in a network and can relay payment from other nodes as well. It's a bit like the Internet. You don't need to peer with everybody, you just need a path from A to B.If you and I have a channel funded with 100 sat, we can move these around as many times as we wish, even on behalf of others, but if you need to transfer more than you have on your side, you need to fund the channel with another on-chain transaction. That's where the Phoenix 1% fee comes from, as they deal with this exact problem for you, so you don't have to worry about it.

Predictably, we get another round of "free speech on the internet is sacred!" polemics. Hate to break it to HN, but Visa and MasterCard aren't reading Hacker News, and they don't care about constitutional takes or appeals to values or consistency. Legal arguments won't do squat here. There is one way to reverse this and it's leverage and pressure, period.If you want to fix this, you actually have to organize and go after the payment processors, because it's not going to be solved by writing essays in the comments or waiting for Steam to suddenly develop a spine. That means collective action, campaigns, actual activism. Exactly the stuff that makes tech people itchy and nervous.It's the same reason tech unions never get traction. Everyone wants to be a cowboy and nobody wants to be part of a posse. If you're serious about reversing this kind of censorship, you'll have to do the one thing that feels worse: banding together, working as a group, and aiming your outrage at the folks actually making the calls.Or keep writing little op-ed comments and maintain the losing streak, because Visa and MasterCard will keep steamrolling as long as nobody pushes back.Sorry, but that's the game. Arguing that the rules aren't fair or trying to play out the same losing tactic isn't a winning strategy. Plan an actual demonstration. Visa and MasterCard conveniently have offices in SF and NYC. All it takes is working together.

Okay. If you have any wisdom or ideas, I'd love to hear them. But as is, this comment is about as effective as mine on fighting Visa/Mastercard. "Just come together and yell at Steam!"I'm not opposed to activism, I'm ignorant of it. The big issue of the internet is that we are all scattered very wide and that makes it harder to collect ourselvves under one goal. And as of now, I'm a laid off tech worker (who doesn't live in SF) who has no real capital to contribute to such a cause. I feel powerless.

The basic sequence is simple:Set up a Discord. Market it to attract a handful of early adopters. Run a book club using Organizing for Social Change[1] or Beautiful Trouble[2]. Along the way, you build shared language and alignment.

You'll know how to set up a continuous recruitment and onboarding loop. You'll be ready for a second round of action. For example, something sharper, louder, more public-facing. From there, it's just iteration after iteration.The most important seed is a vision holder, someone whose primary job is building solid relationships and gradually offloading the core functions: facilitation, comms, outreach, tech, and education.

Itch.io is heavily saturated with anime porn games along with steam to the point I find both difficult to navigate even with nsfw filters turned on. Turning those filters off and it is pretty egregious the volume of it all let alone subject matter. I dont care about porn but the platforms have done a piss poor job for the majority of people who are not looking for porn games but find games like cyberpunk totally acceptable. How can i see cyberpunk but not hentai?This is happening because it was too easy for someone to pull up the home page on said platforms and point to several incest porn games. Using payment processors is not a solution i favor but people cannot find that experience acceptable.On a personal note, i dont want to live in a society that deems it acceptable to have a “no incest” filter for games. That is line for me and not for religion but because I find incest disgusting.

There are filter by tags too. Works pretty well to filter out like all anime or hentai games.

The fact the default is porn games in your home page IS the issue. It gives all this ammunition for xyz group to do whatever.The politics of payment processors being the bad guys is nonsense.

Almost all bitcoin validators bowed down to us sanctions banning wallet addresses for example. That cat has been out of the bag for years.

Googling for news, it seems like the story between DLSite and M/V is a push and pull. Many articles turn up that say they have an agreement, then a disagreement, then an agreement again, then a suspension, then they bring it back again etc.My point here is that their relationship with M/V seems to have failed to actually change them, so, the point "they're powerless to change Japan" stands.

I used to work for a fintech. As new employee I had coffee with a colleague who explained KYC, AML, and other compliance topics to me.

For the better part of a decade feminists have been wildly anti-objectification, not anti-sex. It's an important distinction.For example, most modern feminists are pro sex-work, but only under conditions that guarantee safety, autonomy, and health care for the sex workers. That's very different from how most sex work is done today. So a modern feminist might say that we should be doing more to protect the sex workers who are held in bondage by a pimp, and forced to walk the streets while simultaneously arguing in favor of well regulated, protected brothels or private sex work.

In a different context I might be more sympathetic to this specific formulation of the concept since it's not always clear how much agency the background dancers in a music video or advert have. However, on the original topic of video games, the notion of "character agency" is rather pernicious.

In Kotor 2, there's a character called "The Handmaiden", who will join your party if the player character is a male. She talks at great length about her situation and the decisions the player should make. She's depicted as a chaste, virginal religious character. But one of the very first things you can do with her when she joins your party is spar with her. And she strips into black lingerie to do so. Then she stays in black lingerie on your ship while you go and do other stuff.She's clearly there as an object for the audience to drool over. It's given a very surface level justification ("we always spar with only our bodies"), but that justification is provided the instant before the player sees her in her undies. (Which, it's important to note, aren't like modest undergarments one might expect from a religious figure like this, but are specifically sexy underwear.)Compare this to another Star Wars game, Jedi: Fallen Order, where the Night Sister Mirrin can becomes romantically involved with the player character. She has a well developed culture, and is given space to articulate her personality, choices, and opinions in a cogent way. She can be a romantic interest without being an object. She is as complex as all the other characters, and we don't see her positioned in sexy lingerie suddenly out of the blue.I can come up with other examples if those aren't illustrative.

What I'm disputing is any application of objectification theory to media analysis wherein there are no actual agents involved. Neither The Handmaiden nor Night Sister Mirrin ever possessed any agency, nor were they deprived of it. There is simply no moral valence in how one treats or regards them.The demand here is that they be treated as if they possessed agency. I see no reason or obligation to do so.

With something like OnlyFans, where there's money to be made, the 'sex work is real work!' slogan comes out. And there's a reluctance to criticise big porn sites even after claims of links to sex trafficking etc.But at the same time, scantily-clad videogame characters designed to appeal to the male gaze are deemed unacceptable/objectifying/regressive. And 'sex robots' are seen as a horrifying prospect.

I guess every publisher could just sell direct to customers on their own website, but that wouldn't address this issue at all (it would make it even easier for payment processors to abuse their duopoly), while also severely damaging the discoverability of games.And, considering that companies can already do this if they want but still choose to sell via a platform, I'm guessing there are several benefits beyond discoverability that I'm not thinking of.

The only solution is you download stuff and it remains runnable and usable without any connection or authorisation to any service. The distribution of it can remain wherever and you can go via a side channel if you want. But being tied to a platform is utterly wrong.If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere. With Stream as the distributor, you can't. It's a single point of failure.

I agree, but that could still be done even when using a centralized distribution platform. I would say those are two separate issues. I think (not positive) that's the whole premise of GOG, isn't it?>If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere.Not really, though. If the payment processor stops doing business with your company, your shit out of luck. Instead of pressuring steam or whoever, they just pressure you directly.

It takes a certain kind of person to stand up for pornography.  And most are not that kind of person.

Keep all the porn that is great. But there has to be a line somewhere and even the most accepting countries have a line.Often the groups defending porn are defending the most egregious stuff which makes it hard for people to support.

I don't get this. Let's say it openly: what's the problem with sex and nudity in games? Why is it so unacceptable -- that even people against the censorship must loudly proclaim it's not "their thing" -- but violence, guns, war, etc are not? Or not enough to pull from the stores, anyway?What I don't care about are the finer points of whether this technically counts as "censorship", because in pratice it is. There SHOULD be a place to buy games which depict nudity and sex. The quality of those games is not and should not be the focus of conversation (e.g. "they are AI slop" or "badly made", etc), because that's NOT what bothers the people doing the censorship -- they'd also be against the best, AAA made, high quality games with sex and nudity.Again, I ask: what is wrong with sex and nudity in games, that makes it worse than gore, violence and war? Why cannot whatever age-restriction measures taken for the purchase of violent games be also applied to sex games?Finally: we all know they are not going to stop at this, right?

The other context is that global companies must cater to multiple countries cultures which conflict so they take the path of least resistance.

reply

I don't buy the "multiple countries' cultures" excuse because this seems to be spearheaded by conservative groups from the Christian anglosphere, the same culture that produces these same games to begin with; and also: other cultures forbid depictions of explicit violence, alcohol, women without their heads covered or publicly disagreeing with their husbands, etc. I don't see a push to ban games which depict alcohol consumption or independent women, do you?Let's call a spade a spade, and recognize this for what it is.Also: there's absolutely nothing wrong with erotica in games. Just place it behind the same safety checks as violent games. If those don't work, then they also don't work for violent games, in which case: shall we ban all games with violence?

This comparison alone soundly defeats your argument.  Prohibition of hard drugs has been a spectacular failure, directly resulting in increased rates of death, disease, and crime, and elevating drug cartels to enormous international influence.The danger of porn as an addictive substance - which is very real as you point out - is a great argument against its prohibition.

There's no law (as of now). If there was a law, Valve would happily de-list these things. For example, a recent custom map for Mount and Blade that was banned in South Korea: https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-bann...

I think one solution for Valve/Itch to continue with the 'no policing policy' is for governments to step in and say all video games needed classification like films do.I think a few of these video games that are sold would be found to breaking some law if anyone cared to test it.

Video games don't even involve actual human bodies like GoT does. It's crazy that "Collective Shout" thinks this is worth invoking violence and violating peoples volition for. Certainly not consistent with all other aspects of entertainment in society. Makes me think there are probably other fame, power and money motivations behind their behavior. But it doesn't explain people agreeing with them. That's the weirdest part of this.

The USCSS Maginot, a Weyland Yutani research vessel, crashed into the large lawn next to Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con this weekend. Onlookers remarked they hoped there was nothing dangerous on board, as containers had spilled all over the surrounding area.

That's both the tease for a very cool activation put together by FX for its new show, Alien: Earth, as well as the setup for Alien: Earth itself. The show, which debuts August 12, centers on a crashed ship and all the horrors that it contains. One of them is a xenomorph, everyone's favorite killer alien with acid for blood. But the xeno isn't the only creature on the Maginot. At least on the show. At Comic-Con, it was the main one, but there were teases of others.

io9 was lucky enough to walk through the Alien Earth activation during the daytime of the con, with the understanding this was just half the experience. You could also come back in the evening, and what was once light, bright, and open becomes dark, dim, and scary. It's a whole other, more terrifying experience.

But even in the daylight, the amount of work and detail that's been put into this activation is impressive. You enter through an almost military installation surrounding the crashed ship. Containers with those classic Alien eggs are scattered about, as well as some new, odd, yellow eggs. You enter the MUTHUR computer room, just like out of the original film, and traverse two long hallways, both of which have been torn to pieces by… something. Finally, you enter a massive research facility, which offers a hint of just how many different species had been collected by the ship, only to, in the end, finally be greeted by the Xeno itself. Luckily, we survived. Here's a video of the experience.

And here are a few photos.

If you're at Comic-Con, the Alien: Earth exhibition is on the Hilton Bayfront Lawn and is open Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the one experience and then 4:30 to 10 p.m. for the “Code Red” evening experience. The daytime experience will also be open Sunday from 11 a.m. to a.m.-3 p.m.

Alien: Earth is on FX August 12, and we'll have more soon.

Vampires, witches, and demons, beware: the Talamasca, a secret group that fans of Interview With the Vampire will already have an inkling about, has you under surveillance. But can the watchers themselves be trusted? The first teaser trailer for Talamasca: The Secret Order, AMC's latest show in its Anne Rice Immortal Universe, suggests that even those on the inside should definitely watch their backs.

The trailer heavily features a very blonde Elizabeth McGovern doing her best to recruit Nicholas Denton's character (who has a rare talent, we're told) into the group.

You also get a glimpse of guest star Jason Schwartzman having what appears to be an absolute blast playing a vampire—as well as Eric Bogosian, reprising his fan-favorite journalist character Daniel Molloy from Interview With the Vampire.

The rest of the cast includes William Fichtner, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, and Celine Buckens; the co-showrunners are John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) and Mark Lafferty (Halt and Catch Fire).

Talamasca: The Secret Order hits AMC October 26.

≡ FIFPRO vs. FIFA HEATS UP ≡

It's nasty now. The player union FIFPRO, working with 72 players unions worldwide, and the worldwide governing body FIFA are now in an open fight, hurling insults in competing interviews and news releases.

● On Wednesday, FIFPRO head Sergio Marchi (ARG) told The Athletic in a striking interview:

“The biggest obstacle to FIFPro today is the autocracy of FIFA's president. [Gianni] Infantino lives in his own world, the only thing that matters to him are these grand spectacles.”

Marchi has been campaigning for better defined player rest periods between club play, national team matches and exhibitions and most recently, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Multiple matches were played in hot conditions in outdoor stadiums, with Marchi complaining:

“It's perverse to schedule matches at noon in that kind of heat. What are they waiting for? A tragedy? A collapse on the field?”

In a FIFPRO statement, Marchi added:

“We're in the 21st century and thousands of players still go unpaid. Meanwhile, FIFA celebrates record ticket sales. Let them have their party, but the people who built the game should be paid too.

“Football is deeply inequitable. It's unjust. And we're in a profession that ends at 35, with a whole life still ahead.

“It was announced that tickets for the World Cup are now going on sale, millions will surely be sold, according to the [FIFA] president, who says it will generate over three billion dollars in revenue. And it's incredible. Yet I'll say it again: There are still footballers who haven't been paid their salaries for two, three, even four years.

“Most of the time players are afraid speaking up could hurt their careers. But it's up to us, their representatives, to speak for them.”

● On Friday, FIFPRO held a meeting with 58 player unions in Amsterdam (NED) and added a statement that included:

“FIFPRO expressed its deepening concern over the way FIFA is currently managing global football.

“At the same time, FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players – rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance.

“The overloaded match calendar, the lack of adequate physical and mental recovery periods, extreme playing conditions, the absence of meaningful dialogue, and the ongoing disregard for players' social rights have regrettably become pillars of FIFA's business model; this is a model that puts the health of players at risk and sidelines those at the heart of the game.”

FIFA was hardly silent, responding with an exceedingly blunt statement, that included:

● “FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPRO leadership as this approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles – which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests.”

● “On Saturday, 12 July 2025, following a protracted period of unsuccessful efforts to bring FIFPRO to the table in an environment of non-hostility and respectful, progressive dialogue, FIFA convened with multiple player unions in New York, United States, to announce and reaffirm concrete, progressive measures designed specifically to protect the physical and mental wellbeing of players worldwide.”

Among the announced changes are to be a minimum of 72 hours between matches and a minimum, 21-day rest period between seasons.

● “These concrete measures go beyond what FIFPRO has been pretending to be asking for, and FIFA is extremely surprised by their leadership's reaction.

“Instead of welcoming these unprecedented announcements that benefit players all around the world, FIFPRO has responded with a series of personal and disrespectful attacks.

“This approach reveals a lot about FIFPRO priorities. It suggests that their leadership does not really care about the players, but rather about internal political fights and their image. FIFA's proposed reforms are about impacting genuine change to support players and are far more important than preserving FIFPRO's perceived image.”

At the end, the statement challenged FIFPRO:

“FIFA invites FIFPRO to return to the negotiating table, once they have stopped their blackmail and withdrawn their complaints, and once they have published their statutes, their full financial reports (including all their sources of income, the detailed intellectual property rights of the players they claim to own, and the funding one of their regional divisions receives from some football organisations), and the full list of individual members they claim to represent.”

Observed: Both sides are dug in and frustrated, with the conditions at the Club World Cup a flash point for multiple players, clubs and leagues which had issues with FIFA's expansion of the tournament.

FIFPRO filed a claim against FIFA related to the expanded Club World Cup in June 2024, “asking the Brussels Court of Commerce to refer the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) with four questions for a preliminary ruling.”

That filing, based on the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, is still pending and there might not be any movement until that case moves forward or is stopped.

FIFA's meeting with other player groups outside of FIFPRO and the criticism of the conditions of the Club World Cup in the U.S. are pressure points for the federation, which weathered the human-rights angst with the Qatar World Cup in 2022, but has since handed the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia, reigniting the debate.

No calm seas in sight.

Pep Guardiola has unveiled a striking new look ahead of Manchester City's pre-season return, swapping his clean-shaven face for a bold moustache. The 54-year-old Spaniard, who once complimented a reporter's facial hair as “sexy,” is now turning heads with his own transformation. Fans have been quick to react and compare the Spaniard with television's favourite coach, Ted Lasso.

Tomé became the first woman to take the Spain job following the sacking of Jorge Vilda, who won the 2023 Women's World Cup. 

Monste Tomé, the head coach of Spain's women's national team, has continued where predecessor Jorge Vilda left off in her two years in the job, leading La Roja to the final of Euro 2025 less than two years after their 2023 FIFA World Cup victory. 

Tomé, formerly the team's assistant coach, took over from Vilda in unusual circumstances in September 2023, just after La Roja had won the FIFA Women's World Cup for the very first time. 

Vilda was relieved of his duties amid an unsavory episode involving former Spanish Soccer Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales, who kissed striker Jenni Hermoso on the lips following Spain's World Cup final victory over England. 

Rubiales was applauded by Vilda after initially refusing to resign from his post, with the connection between the two ultimately costing the World Cup-winning coach his job. 

Tomé, who had been Vilda's assistant coach since earning her UEFA Pro licence in 2018, had been the clear candidate to take the reins.

A former player with Oviedo Moderno, Barcelona and Levante, she was a Spanish league champion on two occasions and was capped four times by Spain.

After hanging up her boots in 2013, Tomé initially carved out a career as a primary-school PE teacher. However, she could not resist the lure of her lifelong passion and, after securing her coaching badges, she returned to soccer as Vilda's Spain assistant.

In January 2020, in the wake of Toña Is' departure as head coach of Spain's Under-17s, Tomé took charge of the team in combination with her duties with the senior side. The demands of job sharing proved too great, though, and she later made way for Kenio Gonzalo as Under-17s boss, allowing her to focus on the top team.

As Vilda's chief assistant, Tomé's analytical abilities made her a key part of his coaching staff.

What's more, despite her connection to the highly unpopular former head coach, she has an excellent relationship with the players. Indeed, she was among the Spain assistants who had the closest and best rapport with the squad.

The choice of Tomé as Vilda's successor persuaded several Spain players to return to the international fold. After the World Cup victory, a number of Spanish players said in a joint statement that they would no longer play for La Roja unless structural changes were made.

Tomé took charge of the Spanish women's national team for the first time in September 2023 and has managed 36 games, winning on 28 occasions.

Although Spain finished fourth in the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024, they won their first UEFA Nations League in 2023-24 and could add a maiden European Championship to their trophy haul at Euro 2025.

The stage is set for an epic 2025 UEFA Women's Euro final on Sunday between reigning champs England and reignign World Cup winners Spain. A championship game two years in the making will pair two of Europe's giants for the continent's biggest crown. The match at St. Jakob-Park in Switzerland will serve as both a rematch and standard-bearer for the current state of women's football in Europe as Spain and England square off just two years following the FIFA 2023 Women's World Cup final.

Spain, 2023 World Cup champions, will place their technical mastery against England, 2022 Euro champions, and tournament lionhearts. The margins for error between the two sides are slim but just enough for each squad to feel confident about their chances. 

Both sides have been the top attacking teams this tournament, scoring 32 goals, with 17 for Spain and 15 for England, and 21 different goal scorers between the two nations, with England (11) edging out Spain (10) by one player. On the defensive end, Spain have three shutouts with two clean sheets in the knockout rounds and have only allowed three goals. England have conceded six goals and have one clean sheet in the tournament.

England enter the final after two extra-time knockout matches -- a quarterfinal penalty kick shootout against Sweden, and an extra-time victory against Italy in the semifinal, with sparks off the bench in Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. Spain, meanwhile, eliminated host nation Switzerland in the quarterfinal and defeated Germany for the first time in its program history during the semifinal.

Now, the two nations meet 707 days following their 2023 World Cup meeting with another trophy on the line. Spain look to win their first-ever Euro title, while England eye history with a potential repeat, which would be the first in over a decade.

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

The Big One, the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final: There were plenty of high stakes as the two sides met during the 2023 World Cup final. England was considered the heavy favorites following their 2022 Euro win, and Spain was seen as a team motivated to prove its federation and coaching staff for better conditions. The match played out to a narrow scoreline, with Spain the victors, 1-0, with a goal by defender Olga Carmona.

The Most Recent One, 2025 UEFA Nations League: The two sides have met since their World Cup match. They split two games earlier this year, more one-goal victories, during the 2025 UEFA Nations League. England got the better of Spain, 1-0, with a goal by Jess Park back in February, while Spain returned the favor in June. Spain's 2-1 win kicked off their sizzling summer, as Claudia Pina scored two goals off the bench and eliminated England from the competition.

England's 2022 Euro championship immediately launched the Lionesses into conversations around global elite programs and further set expectations for them at the 2023 World Cup. They ended up as runners-up in the 2023 final, and the build-up toward the 2025 Euro has seen the retirements of multiple key figures from the 2022 roster. Still, there are 14 players on England's Euro roster who were on the 2023 World Cup squad, eight of whom were starters during the World Cup final. 

Former Lionesses striker Ellen White, midfielder Fran Kirby, defender Rachel Daly, and goalkeeper Mary Earps were key players during England's magical Euro run but absences for this year's tournament -- with Earps announcing her departure in May, just two months ahead of the competition. During their current run, the group has had to manage injuries along the way. Forward Lauren James is nursing an ankle injury from the semifinal, and her status is in flux, while Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze are playing through leg injuries as well.

Head coach Sarina Wiegman has faced some criticism about stale tactics and a lack of rotations and late-game substitutions, but as nerve-rattling as the late-game heroics from Agyemang and Kelly have been, the coaching methodology has worked. This squad has emerged as the tournament lionhearts for their efforts.  

England are chasing a bit of history of their own, not only as title holders looking to repeat, but also as the first team to ever win a Euro after losing their opening match. They rallied through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final, and if they've expended this much energy and emotion, they'll empty the tank with just one more game to lift the title. 

Similarly to England, Spain's World Cup victory helped reset the program among the top three FIFA-ranked teams after being rated outside the top five before their 2023 World Cup run. Their Euro participants feature 11 players from the World Cup-winning roster, either eight starters from the final returning. Spain's key personnel changes from the 2023 World Cup to the 2025 Euro truly begin at the federation and coaching level. 

Their World Cup win was overshadowed, however. Former RFEF president Luis Rubiales initiated a non-consensual kiss with player Jenni Hermoso on the medal podium, and his close ties to former manager Jorge Vilda -- who players revolted against ahead of and after the World Cup due to his coaching style and leadership methods -- led to his firing and also the coach's eventual dismissal.

Montse Tome has been the head coach of the group since September 2023, and the program settled for a fourth-place finish at the 2024 Olympics after making their debut at the Summer Games. The former player turned coach faced criticisms for her lineup choices and somewhat predictable tactics during the competition, but making it this far is no small feat.

Spain's midfield mastery with the trio of Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guijarro continues to set the standard for their possession-based play, while forward Esther Gonzalez leads the team, and Euros, in the Golden Boot race. With plenty of holdovers from the World Cup final, Claudia Pina emerged as a bench player to a sure starter, and she has shown off her relentless efforts in attacking play and as a set-piece service threat. 

The team is making its first appearance in the Euro final and will aim to become the eighth different country to win the tournament. If they win, they will join Germany as the only nations to immediately follow a World Cup win with a Euro title. The Netherlands are the only team in the last 30 years to win the Euro (2017) in their first final appearance.

England: Hannah Hampton; Lucy Bronze, Leah Williamson, Esme Morgan, Alex Greenwood; Georgia Stanway, Kiera Walsh, Ella Toone; Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo

Spain: Cata Coll; Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Laia Aleixandri, Olga Carmona; Aitana Bonmati, Patri Guijarro, Alexia Putellas; Mariona Caldentey, Claudia Pina, Esther Gonzalez

There will be little that separates the two sides on the pitch, meaning the tactical matchups will be all the more intriguing. Could this be the game that England finally runs out of gas and personnel? Probably not, but it might make stretches of the game difficult for them to chase if they can't figure out how to play over Spain's midfield. Each team will score, but Spain will be the victors in extra time. Pick: Spain 2, England 1

Manchester United's 2–1 victory over West Ham United at MetLife Stadium on Saturday wasn't just a showcase of pre-season Premier League football—it was a historic night for U.S. soccer attendance.

A staggering crowd of 82,566 fans packed the stadium, setting a new record for the largest attendance at a football match in the United States in 2025.

The turnout eclipsed the previous high set earlier this year during the FIFA Club World Cup final, which drew 81,118 spectators.

The match, part of United's U.S. pre-season tour, saw The MetLife Stadium, home to the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, transform into a sea of red and claret as supporters turned out in full force.

On the field, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes stole the spotlight with a commanding performance, scoring both goals in the victory. The 30-year-old Portuguese midfielder was clinical and composed, reminding fans why he was named United's Player of the Year last season.

The match was competitive throughout, with West Ham pulling one back in the second half, but the result remained in United's favor. The quality of play, combined with the electric crowd atmosphere, created a memorable experience for all in attendance.

Growing Popularity of European Football in the U.S.

Saturday's attendance milestone underscores the surging interest in European football among American audiences. With elite clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich regularly including the U.S. on their pre-season itineraries, fan engagement has soared.

With less than a year to go until the 2026 World Cup, political tensions and U.S. policy threaten to pose problems as Canada, the United States and Mexico prepare to co-host the tournament.

Next year's FIFA World Cup will be the biggest ever, with the three countries hosting a record 48 teams. Between June 11 and July 19, they will play 104 matches, most of them in the U.S.

With millions of fans expected to cross borders to attend the games, U.S. President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies — which include travel bans on some countries, immigration raids and mass deportations — are generating anxiety.

“This is all being driven by the United States. And we're entirely the guilty party here,” said Victor Matheson, a professor at College of Holy Cross in Massachusetts who specializes in sports economics.

“You could have significant immigration problems with fans and players going across borders.”

The U.S. has travel bans in place for 12 countries and restrictions in place for seven, and is considering banning travellers from another 36 countries.

Though there are exemptions for athletes, staff and families, the unpredictability of Trump's administration means no one knows for certain what kind of rules might be in place by the time the tournament starts.

Economist Andrew Zimbalist, who wrote a book on the economics of hosting the World Cup, said Trump has the ability to make it difficult for people to travel, but it's not clear whether he will actually do so.

“I think probably Trump himself might not have the answers because … he responds very impetuously to changes in his environment,” he said.

Concerns about visas or political opposition to Trump might lead some soccer fans to decide not to attend at all, while others opt to attend the games in Canada instead, Zimbalist suggested. But he also pointed out that the quarter, semifinals and final are all taking place in the U.S.

A spokesperson for Canadian Heritage said Canada could see a million international visitors during the tournament.

“Given the tri-national nature of the event, it is anticipated that international and domestic travellers will move back and forth between Canada and the United States. The focus will continue to be on the flow of movement, the safety of travellers and the security of the borders,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the Canada Border Services Agency said the agency is working closely with federal government departments, host cities and FIFA “in the safety and security planning for this international event.”

Matheson said fans — particularly those from countries that have found themselves in Trump's crosshairs — have good reasons to be worried.

“I would be very concerned about planning a vacation that has you travelling from Mexico or from Canada into the United States and back. I don't think that you can guarantee that vacation of a lifetime is actually going to be there for you to actually take,” he said.

He said it's one thing to be denied entry, another to end up in jail and deported — potentially to a prison in El Salvador.

“No one wants to go to the World Cup to watch some soccer games and then end up in jail,” he said.

Trump's moves to impose tariffs on much of the world, including Canada, could also affect the World Cup.

Matheson offered the example of someone who makes jerseys for a country's team who would want to ship those jerseys across the border with the team.

“Tariffs make that type of inventory management pretty challenging,” he said.

Tim Elcombe is a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University whose areas of expertise include sports, politics and international affairs. He said “there was a sense that having the event in Canada, the United States and Mexico would almost be a bit of a calming of the political waters,” as the cup returned to Western countries.

Instead, he said, the 2026 tournament may be even more politically charged than the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Canada is co-hosting one of world's biggest sporting events with a country whose president has instigated a trade war and threatened annexation. Canadians have cut travel to the U.S. and stopped buying American products — and it's not clear what all of that might mean for the World Cup.

While Vancouver and Toronto will host some games, “really this is an American-centric competition,” Elcombe said.

“So how will Canadians feel about this? Will we get behind it? Will it become the event I think they were hoping it would be?”

In early July, labour and human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, wrote to FIFA president Gianni Infantino to say U.S. policies under Trump pose a “serious threat” to individuals, especially non-citizens.

The letter accused FIFA of ignoring “the clear evidence of the significant deterioration of the rights climate in the United States.”

Elcombe said while the United States is likely to take the brunt of scrutiny, Canada is not immune.

“Canada is going to have to be prepared for a very critical eye in terms of focus on some of the issues in Canada from a human rights perspective, because I think they will be exposed,” he said, citing Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples as one example.

MacIntosh Ross, a fellow at the Scott McCain and Leslie McLean Centre for Sport, Business and Health at Saint Mary's University, said Canada should put pressure on the U.S. government “to make sure that things happen in a safe or as safe a manner as possible.”

“The Canadian organizers and the Canadian government need to be very clear about their expectations for their partners in this World Cup and reiterate them and state them over and over again,” he said.

Elcombe noted Infantino, who has “very much established himself as a friend and supporter of President Trump,” could be a key player in determining how the coming months unfold.

It's difficult to predict what Trump might do, Zimbalist said. If there are political issues in the United States that he wants to distract people from, “you can see him doing crazier and crazier things internationally to get people's minds off of what's actually happening.”

But Trump also has shown that he cares about the World Cup and looking good as he hosts the tournament.

“I think he does care about image and he does care about being on the world stage,” Zimbalist said. “So I can see that being a significant deterrent, actually.”

Real Madrid deemed the new Club World Cup in the United States extremely important. They wanted it to be treated as seriously as the Champions League.

Although the end result was not in Madrid's favor, it was worth a try.

Madrid even paid Liverpool 10 million euros to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month early, and the Englishman lived up to expectations.

But for the players, the tournament was an additional burden after an already rigorous season. They were more fatigued and had less time for rest and vacation. A feud even broke out with Javier Tebas over the same issue.

Understandably, Los Blancos had to make it up to the players. And according to Marca, the club paid a bonus of 280,000 euros to each player for participating in the tournament.

According to the report, Real Madrid bagged more than 80 million euros from the tournament. The amount is significant, especially considering how few matches Madrid had to play and the fact that they did not even reach the final.

Given that the earnings came from the players' hard work, it was only fair to reward them. The bonus of 280,000 euros was negotiated by the Real Madrid captains. The breakdown includes 50,000 euros for advancing from the group stage, 80,000 for the Round of 16, and 150,000 for reaching the semifinals.

The massive earnings from such a short tournament could be one of the key reasons Real Madrid support holding the Club World Cup every two years instead of the current four-year cycle.

Participation in the tournament cut the players' vacation to just 24 days, significantly shorter than the usual break of over a month.

The upcoming season is going to be excruciatingly demanding for all the players. They will have to perform better, deliver stronger results than last season, and win more trophies to make up for last season's drought.

Liverpool are set to soften their stance on Luis Diaz and accept a bid of under €80 million (£69.9m/$93.9m) from Bayern Munich. The Colombian forward, who still has two years remaining on his current deal, has already expressed his desire to leave Anfield this summer, with his preferred destination being the German champions.

Having a championship point at Roland Garros without winning the title is something that Jannik Sinner experienced earlier this year.

Sinner had three championship points against Carlos Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final that he lost in five sets.

This defeat was crushing for the Italian, with Sinner needing time to get over his heartbreaking defeat in Paris.

Sinner is now a four-time Grand Slam champion after winning Wimbledon, but another ATP player who experienced something similar was never able to recover.

Guillermo Coria was one of the big favourites for the Roland Garros title as the third seed in 2004.

The Argentinian was coming into the Paris major that year in impressive form, having won the Monte Carlo Masters and reached the final of the Hamburg Masters in the weeks leading up to Roland Garros.

Coria continued this form into Roland Garros, where he reached his first Grand Slam final by dropping just one set.

In the final, Coria would play an unlikely opponent in the 2004 Roland Garros final in his Argentine compatriot Gaston Gaudio, who was unseeded.

Gaudio had never reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal before Roland Garros in 2004, leaving Coria as the big favourite to win the title.

This was especially prevalent, as Coria had won three of his four previous matches against Gaudio, all of which were on clay.

The expected outcome of the match appeared to be playing out, as Coria dropped just three games to take a two-set-to-love lead.

Despite Coria leading the third set 4-4 40-0, Gaudio started to make a comeback and won the third and fourth sets to take it to a decider.

Coria would regain authority in this fifth set, taking a 4-2 lead, and looked to be on his way to an elusive Grand Slam title.

The then 22-year-old served for the match on two occasions, and had two championship points at 6-5 40-15, but Coria could just not get over the line.

After hitting the ball wide on those two championship points, Gaudio would fight back to beat Coria, 0-6 3-6 6-4 6-1 8-6.

In his press conference after the match, an emotional Coria suggested that nerves got the better of him.

“I think I was thinking too much at that stage,” Coria said after the match. “There was one very long rally at 40-15. I was thinking that if I had won that point, I could have won the match. He won the game, unfortunately for me.

“Then I was under pressure. I was thinking too much. What happened, happened. I have no words to describe it.”

Coria was the first man to lose a Grand Slam singles final in the Open Era after having championship points, with there now three players who have lost a major final from match point up.

The other two players who lost Grand Slam finals after having a championship point are Roger Federer and Sinner.

However, both Federer and Sinner have won multiple major titles, while Coria took a big decline after this heartbreaking loss.

While Coria would still enjoy some positive results after Roland Garros in 2004, he would never reach a Grand Slam semifinal ever again.

The Argentinian only won one more title in his career at the Croatia Open in 2005, and only made two more appearances at Roland Garros.

After struggling with injury, Coria only played at Roland Garros again in 2005 and 2008, losing in the fourth round and first round, respectively.

Coria suffered a dramatic fall down the rankings after playing just two matches in 2007, and was never able to return to form in his comeback from a shoulder injury.

At just 27 years old, Coria would retire from tennis in April, 2009, and would never win a Grand Slam title despite having two championship points to do so.

Although Guillermo Coria no longer plays on the ATP Tour, his younger brother Federico Coria has been an active player since 2010 and has a career-high ranking of world number 49.

Naomi Osaka of Japan leaves the court after losing to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova during a third round women's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday, July 4, 2025.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Naomi Osaka and coach Patrick Mouratoglou are done working together after less than a year, the four-time Grand Slam champion announced Sunday on social media.

“Merci Patrick,” Osaka began her post, with a photo of her hitting a practice serve while he stands nearby. “It was such a great experience learning from you. Wishing you nothing but the best. You are one of the coolest people I've ever met and I'm sure I'll see you around.”

The news comes three days after Osaka lost her second match at the D.C. Open and just before she begins competing in Toronto. The U.S. Open, the year's last major tournament and an event Osaka won twice, begins in New York on Aug. 24.

Osaka hired Mouratoglou — who was the longtime coach of Serena Williams — when she fired Wim Fissette shortly after her second-round exit at last year's U.S. Open.

Osaka, a former No. 1, is currently ranked 51st and has a 21-11 record this season.

She hasn't been past the third round at a Grand Slam tournament since winning the 2021 Australian Open.

18 first-round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP National Bank Open in Toronto, and fans will get exciting action all day long. This article features Fabian Marozsan and Arthur Rinderknech alongside some other solid players. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

These two players are very close in their current rankings, but there is a significant difference in their level on hard courts. Vit Kopriva is a clay court specialist and has won just two tour-level matches in hard. Meanwhile, Yunchaokete Bu has won all his tour-level matches on hard courts, and his game excels on this surface. He hits hard and will dictate the points here. Kopriva will retrieve a lot of balls, but I expect the Chinese to come out on top.

Prediction: Bu in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Since reaching the semifinals in Marrakech, Roberto Carballes Baena has won just one tour-level match, and this form won't help him on hard courts, which is not his favourite surface. However, he has shown some promise on this surface earlier in the season and will look to imitate that level. Camilo Ugo Carabelli is in much better form coming into this match, but this is not his preferred surface either. With just two tour-level wins on this surface, Carabelli could be vulnerable here, and the Spaniard should take advantage.

Prediction: Baena in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

After a horrible first half of the season, Arthur Rinderknech is moving in the right direction and looks confident in his game. He has notched some impressive wins in the last couple of months and will be looking to start his North American hard-court swing on a high. He will face local wildcard Alexis Galarneau, who has never won an ATP Tour match. Galarneau is making his third appearance at the Canada Masters. Rinderknech's big serve and aggressive playstyle should help him dominate this match.

Prediction: Rinderknech in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Fabian Marozsan is going through a rough patch in the last couple of months, but his first-round record has been good. His record at the Masters is also impressive, and Hugo Dellien, who is primarily a clay courter, shouldn't present a lot of difficulties for Marozsan here. Marozsan has the clear advantage here due to his comfort on this surface. It would be an upset if Dellien wins this.

Prediction: Marozsan in 2

French players Gael Monfils and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard are among the names to watch on the first main draw day of the National Bank Open, ATP Toronto. Our panelists offer all their predictions for the matches.

The former NCAA player Smith is well on his way to the top 100 and a breakout run on the US Open Series. Smith qualified for Washington, and did the same in Toronto. He has two Challenger finals this year and he won one of them. The teenager Tien won two matches in D.C. and at 13-16 on the season, he's well on his way to being a credible ATP player. These are two young guns, but Tien is further along the ATP learning curve despite being younger, so in the All-American matchup I'll give him the edge. Prediction: Tien in 3

Fearnley is 14-14 at tour level this year, he struggled a bit on the grass court swing and is looking to find form again. Ficovich is ranked outside the top 100 but did come through qualifying after reaching the quarters in Los Cabos. The 28 year old has reached two Challenger finals this year, he prefers clay, but he's playing excellent tennis right now and this is a test for Fearnley, that he should survive. Prediction: Fearnley in 2

Perricard is a mercurial player, he's just 6-15 at tour level this year, the 22 year old Japanese player Mochizuki is approaching the top 100 in the rankings. Twice a challenger finalist, he's bound to cause Perricard problems if GMP is not serving lights out. I'll go with an upset based on ranking, but no on form. Prediction: Mochizuki in 3

At 38 and 17-13 on the season, Monfils is still capable of magic, he hasn't posted a losing record on the tour his entire career (dating back to 2004). His trouble has been fitness and consistency. The qualifier from Chile, Barrios Vera hasn't won a tour match this year (0-7) but is 22-10 on the Challenger Tour. Given all of his recent finals have been clay Challengers, he's unlikely to pull off an upset in this one, but Monfils is not playing his best. Prediction: Monfils in 3

The journeyman Blanchet is 11-13 on the year, he qualified for this tournament, and did win a Challenger in January. Safiullin is an awful 4-13 on the season and really trying to turn things around. Blanchet is the kind of opponent he should still be capable of beating though. Prediction: Safiullin in 3

Tennis is one of the most gruelling sports there is, commanding both physical and mental toughness on an unparalleled scale.

Players are thrown out onto a court, either alone or with a sole partner, and expected to do battle for hours and hours in swirling wind or baking sunshine. Unless they are winning tournaments, they are always losing, and when one tournament ends, another immediately begins.

It's relentless, and not everybody can compete at the apex of the sport for a decade and beyond. As such, careers within tennis can be cut short in an instant.

However, for some, like Martina Hingis, there is little that can stop them from coming back to tennis time and time again.

Hingis was the quintessential wonderkid when she burst onto the scene in the mid to late 90s, turning professional in 1994 at just 14 years old.

Many were likely stunned by this Swiss youngster who sprang into the limelight, but that decision was vindicated just two years later when she became the youngest-ever Grand Slam champion, winning the doubles title in 1996.

Then, less than a year later, she had begun hoovering up major titles in singles as well.

First came the Australian Open in 1997, before she was beaten in the final of the French Open. This loss proved costly, as Hingis won every other major that year, meaning she was just one win from completing the calendar Grand Slam.

She would defend her title in Melbourne for two more years, but failed to win at any of the other events in singles.

However, her doubles prowess remained sharp, with 1998 marking her standout year. There, she managed what she had failed to do in 1997, and completed the calendar slam by winning all four majors.

These made up a chunk of the 13 titles she won at this level, added to the five singles majors she won too.

Hingis was, during this period, the true dominant force on the tour, and naturally set a number of ‘youngest-ever' records that will likely never be broken. 

Alas, one player on the WTA has been compared to Hingis recently…

Hingis' glittering career was strangely offset by a string of retirements, brought about by various reasons.

Her first retirement came in 2003, aged just 22 at the time, citing chronic pain and unrelenting injuries as the reason.

The tennis world stood still, but this hiatus only ended up being two years long as she slowly began her comeback in 2005. She insisted it would not be a permanent return, but 2006 marked her full-fledged comeback on the WTA Tour.

Then, in 2007, came Hingis' second retirement, after being handed a suspension following a drugs test. Admittedly, the ITF ended up changing the rules because of her, allowing for future flexibility in cases of unintentional or unexplained ingestion.

She would make small forays back into the sport, but 2010 marked her true return after that second retirement.

And finally, Hingis' very last retirement came in 2017, officially bringing her tumultuous, magical career to a complete end.

Six male players have amassed winning streaks of at least 25 matches at Grand Slams, while just one man has registered 30 successive wins at majors.

Here are the nine players with the longest win streaks in Grand Slam men's singles matches in the Open Era (including only the longest streak for each player).

Rafael Nadal‘s best Grand Slam streak began at the 2010 French Open, where he steamrolled Gianna Mina, Horacio Zeballos, Lleyton Hewitt, Thomaz Bellucci, Nicolas Almagro, Jurgen Melzer and Robin Soderling without losing a set to secure the trophy.

At Wimbledon, Nadal completed the Channel Slam by defeating Kei Nishikori, Robin Haase, Philipp Petzschner, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Soderling, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych.

Nadal then achieved the Career Grand Slam at the 2010 US Open as he saw off Teymuraz Gabashvili, Denis Istomin, Gilles Simon, Feliciano Lopez, Fernando Verdasco, Mikhail Youzhny and Novak Djokovic.

The Spaniard took his run to 25 straight wins by beating Marcos Daniel, Ryan Sweeting, Bernard Tomic and Marin Cilic at the 2011 Australian Open before he lost to David Ferrer in the last eight.

Pete Sampras won the 1993 Wimbledon Championships to start his best-ever Grand Slam run, earning wins over Neil Borwick, Jamie Morgan, Byron Black, Andrew Foster, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker and Jim Courier.

The American then overcame Fabrice Santoro, Daniel Vacek, Arnaud Boetsch, Tomas Enqvist, Michael Chang, Alexander Volkov and Cedric Pioline to win the 1993 US Open.

At the 1994 Australian Open, Sampras triumphed against Joshua Eagle, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Stephane Simian, Ivan Lendl, Magnus Gustafsson, Jim Courier and Todd Martin to win a third straight Slam.

Sampras added four more wins at the 1994 French Open — against Albert Costa, Marcelo Rios, Paul Haarhuis and Mikael Tillstrom — before falling to Courier in the quarter-finals.

Jimmy Connors started his 25-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1974 Australian Open, where he defeated Jean-Louis Haillet, Graeme Thomson, Syd Ball, Vladimir Zednik, John Alexander and Phil Dent for the trophy.

After missing the French Open, Connors resumed his run at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships as he downed Ove Bengtson, Dent, Adriano Panatta, Jaime Fillol, Jan Kodes, Dick Stockton and Ken Rosewall to secure the title.

Connors then claimed the 1974 US Open crown by beating Jeff Borowiak, Ove Bengtson, Alexander, Kodes, Alex Metreveli, Roscoe Tanner and Rosewall.

The American narrowly missed out on defending his crown at the 1975 Australian Open, where he lost the final to John Newcombe after seeing off Chris Kachel, Ulrich Pinner, Raz Reid, Kim Warwick and Dick Crealy.

Roger Federer‘s best major streak started with his triumph at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships, where he overcame Paul-Henri Mathieu, Ivo Minar, Nicholas Kiefer, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Fernando Gonzalez, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick.

The Swiss then beat Minar, Fabrice Santoro, Olivier Rochus, Kiefer, David Nalbandian, Hewitt and Andre Agassi to win the 2005 US Open.

At the 2006 Australian Open, Federer extended his run with a third straight Grand Slam title as he saw off Istomin, Florian Mayer, Max Mirnyi, Tommy Haas, Nikolay Davydenko, Kiefer and Marcos Baghdatis.

Federer took his run to 27 straight wins at majors with victories over Diego Hartfield, Alejandro Falla, Nicolas Massu, Berdych, Mario Ancic and David Nalbandian at the 2006 French Open. He fell one win short of a non-calendar Grand Slam as he fell to Rafael Nadal in the Roland Garros final.

Rod Laver began his 29-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1969 Australian Open, where he downed Massimo Di Domenico, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, Tony Roche and Andres Gimeno for the title.

The Australian continued his run with victory at the 1969 French Open as he defeated Koji Watanabe, Richard Crealy, Pietro Marzano, Stan Smith, Gimeno, Tom Okker and Ken Rosewall.

Laver then added the 1969 Wimbledon title as he claimed wins against Nicola Pietrangeli, Premjit Lall, Jan Leschly, Smith, Cliff Drysdale, Arthur Ashe and John Newcombe.

At the 1969 US Open, Laver overcame Luis-Augusto Garcia, Jaime Pinto Bravo, Jaime Fillol, Dennis Ralston, Emerson, Ashe and Roche to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam.

Laver's next major appearance came at Wimbledon in 1970, where he beat Butch Seewagen, John Alexander and Frew McMillan before his streak was snapped by a fourth round defeat to Roger Taylor.

Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most consecutive Grand Slam victories having gone 30 matches without defeat at majors between 2015 and 2016.

The Serbian's run started at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, where he saw off Philipp Kohlschreiber, Jarkko Nieminen, Bernard Tomic, Kevin Anderson, Cilic, Richard Gasquet and Federer for the title.

Djokovic then beat Joao Souza, Andreas Haider-Maurer, Andreas Seppi, Roberto Bautista Agut, Feliciano Lopez, Cilic and Federer to win the 2015 US Open.

At the 2016 Australian Open, Djokovic earned wins over Hyeon Chung, Quentin Halys, Seppi, Gilles Simon, Kei Nishikori, Federer and Murray to lift the title.

He then lifted his maiden French Open title as he beat Lu Yen-hsun, Steve Darcis, Aljaz Bedene, Bautista Agut, Berdych, Dominic Thiem and Murray.

This triumph saw Djokovic complete the Career Grand Slam and made him just the second man to win four successive majors in the Open Era.

Djokovic took his Grand Slam win streak to 30 by defeating James Ward and Adrian Mannarino at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, before his run ended with a shock third round loss to Sam Querrey.

Nick Kyrgios is often vocal with what he thinks about players and rules in tennis.

Kyrgios keeps having injury setbacks, and has not played a singles match since March at the Miami Open.

His most recent appearance on the matchcourt in doubles did not go to plan either, with Kyrgios losing in under an hour with Gael Monfils.

Although Kyrgios' recent experience on the court has not gone so well, he does now appear to have changed his mind about a player he once criticised.

As part of the Washington Open's media day, players including Kyrgios, Emma Raducanu and Jessica Pegula were asked who they think is the smartest on tour.

Both Ben Shelton and Emma Navarro agreed that Pegula was their smartest player on tour, while she actually picked another American in Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

World number one and Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner was selected by Lorenzo Musetti and Daniil Medvedev.

Medvedev, himself, was selected by compatriot Andrey Rublev, while Holger Rune picked 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, and Elena Rybakina chose Barbora Krejcikova.

Hailey Baptiste played doubles with Venus Williams at the Washington Open this year,  but revealed that she thought Serena Williams was the smartest player.

Raducanu also chose a retired player and picked one of the pioneers of the WTA Tour in Billie Jean King.

When it came to Kyrgios' selection, he chose Casper Ruud and suggested that he thought the Norwegian appears to have his life together.

“I'm gonna go Casper Ruud,” said Kyrgios. “I feel like he's very smart he's got his stuff sorted.”

Who do you think is the smartest player on tour? 🤓#MubadalaCitiDCOpen pic.twitter.com/jqXbz6Xy2T

While Kyrgios and Ruud appear to be on good terms now, that has not always been the case.

At the Italian Open in 2019, Kyrgios was defaulted in a match against Ruud for throwing a chair onto the court.

This ignited a feud between the pair, with Ruud calling Kyrgios an ‘idiot' in an interview with Tennisportalen after he had been criticised for celebrating the default win.

Well…Kyrgios gets a game penalty and then walks off court, handing Casper Ruud a place in the last 16#ibi19 pic.twitter.com/T4jhvbV1RN

Kyrgios did not take too kindly to these comments and called Ruud boring in a rant on X (formerly known as Twitter).

He wrote at the time, “Hey @CasperRuud98 next time you have something to say, I would appreciate you say it to my face, I'm sure you wouldn't run your mouth so much after that. Until then I will continue to rather watch paint dry then watch you play tennis, boring **.

“But again, I also understand why you have to keep my name in your mouth, because people don't even realise that you play tennis (laughing face emoji) Goodluck in Milan champ x.”

But again, I also understand why you have to keep my name in your mouth, because people dont even realise that you play tennis 😂 goodluck in Milan champ x

Kyrgios continued his criticism of three-time Grand Slam finalist Ruud for a few more years after this, but it appears that all is now forgotten.

At an exhibition event in December last year, Kyrgios and Ruud actually played doubles together and were joking about any previous fallout.

In the build-up to the US Open, the first Masters 1000 event of the North American hard-court swing is set to get underway next week. 

The Canadian Open has seen some big names drop out already, with Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic withdrawing, before Carlos Alcaraz announced he would not feature in Toronto. 

With multiple stars pulling out, a huge opportunity has presented itself for the likes of Lorenzo Musetti and Ben Shelton, who have never won a Masters crown.  

Plenty of points are on offer for stars looking to rise in the rankings, but for one former major champion, the tournament marks one last dance on the ATP Tour. 

At the Canadian Open, former Wimbledon doubles champion Vasek Pospisil will play his last match in front of a home crowd. 

Pospisil emerged victorious at the All England Club in 2014 alongside Jack Sock to clinch his first and only Grand Slam title. 

His Canadian compatriot, Denis Shapovalov, said of his last dance: “I would love to see his match.

“In terms of his legacy, I mean, for me personally, he's one of the first big players in Canada, and he's definitely left a big mark in Canadian tennis.

Pospisil's best finishes at Grand Slams in doubles: 

“I remember growing up watching him and Milos playing Davis Cup ties, playing in important matches, playing semifinals here, the Rogers Cup.

“I mean, he's done a lot for Canadian tennis, he's done a lot for guys like me and Felix [Auger-Aliassime].”

Shapovalov continued: “When we were coming up, I remember he was one of the first top players that I was able to speak to and get advice from.

“He was always super, super nice, and very welcoming to me. So that definitely always stayed with me, and I think we have a great relationship for that reason.

“I think he's a great person, obviously with everything he's done with PTPA and to help the players really shows the type of person that he is.

“I mean, you see more behind closed doors about how good of a teammate he's been over the years, and how much he's really given back to my generation and to everyone around

“I think all the Canadians speak very highly of him. It's very sad to see him go. I definitely feel like he's got, I think he's got more to give, you know, if he could get healthy and get in shape, but for sure it's amazing to look back on what he's been able to achieve.”

Pospisil has been granted a wildcard for the event and will play his first match on Centre Court.

Former British player Barry Cowan has identified what makes grass and hard courts Emma Raducanu's best surfaces as he looked ahead to the US Open.

Raducanu continued her positive 2025 campaign with an impressive run to the semi-finals of the Citi DC Open in Washington this week.

The 22-year-old saw off Marta Kostyuk, Naomi Osaka and Maria Sakkari without losing a set before falling 4-6, 3-6 to Anna Kalinskaya in the last four.

The Brit holds a 21-15 record this season and she has climbed 13 places from 46th to 33rd in the Live WTA Rankings with the 195 points she has gained for her run at the WTA 500 event.

Raducanu lost six of her first nine matches of 2025 before kickstarting her year with a run to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in March after linking up with coach Mark Petchey.

In an interview with Tennishead, Cowan addressed Raducanu's chances at the 2025 US Open, which will begin on August 24.

“Yeah, I think grass and fast hard courts are her best surfaces,” said the former world No 162.

“I think the reason for that is that she is a great timer of a tennis ball. And when she won the US Open, she predominantly played her tennis on the baseline and used her great timing to hit the ball early and rush her opponents.

“Obviously, on the slower hard courts, on the clay courts, it's a totally different type of style that is required, but yeah, I mean, she can do well at the US Open, but I think that the women's tour is something where I do feel, you know, I look back to Washington last year as a good example. I thought she'd played a great in Washington.

“She played two really good matches, she won, she built momentum, she lost narrowly to [Paula] Badosa in the quarter-finals, and then she didn't play after that until the US Open.

“Well, you can't expect to play, you know, one great week and then not play for three or four weeks and then pick it up. At 30 years of age or 35 years of age, if you're a [Novak] Djokovic, or further back, Serena Williams — that's okay.

“But for Raducanu, she needs matches.”

Raducanu will face world No 56 Elena Gabriela Ruse in her opening match at the WTA 1000 event in Montreal next week.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina stunned Ben Shelton last night, beating the American in straight sets to reach the Washington Open final.

Davidovich Fokina, seeded 12th, defeated Shelton 6-2 7-5 under the DC lights, setting up a match against Alex de Minaur in the final.

The Spaniard was an unlikely contender heading into the tournament, but has since proven his worth, beating the likes of Taylor Fritz and Learner Tien on his way to the final.

His achievements in Washington – a tournament he did not compete at in 2024 – have seen him enter a new conversation that few would have expected heading into the 2025 ATP Tour campaign.

The ATP Tour Finals, which take place in November in Turin, Italy, showcase the top eight players from the calendar year.

The tournament does not rely on a player's ranking but rather on the total number of ATP points accumulated during the calendar year. The top eight players qualify for November competition each year.

Davidovich Fokina's remarkable run in Washington has placed him directly in that conversation.

The Spaniard has gained 350 points so far this week. This has seen him rise seven places in the race, above the likes of Alexander Bublik, Tommy Paul and Holger Rune.

A post shared by Tennis TV (@tennistv)

Davidovich Fokina, who is in 11th place, sits behind only Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud and Ben Shelton, who sits in eighth place.

The world number 26 will contest a particularly important match against Alex de Minaur on Sunday. The match will decide the winner of the Washington Open, while also strengthening, or weakening, either player's chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour finals.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Alex de Minaur have a long history on the ATP Tour.

The pair first played each other at the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2019, with the Australian triumphing in four sets. de Minaur reached the final at the tournament, before losing to Jannik Sinner.

The Spaniard and Australian next met in 2021, with Davidovich Fokina winning in straight sets at the ATP Masters 1000 Monte-Carlo.

The Spaniard followed this up with victory at the 2022 Queen's Club Championships before de Minaur enacted revenge at the 2023 ATP Masters 1000 Canada.

Remarkably, Davidovich Fokina has never won an ATP Tour title. He will have a chance to change that against de Minaur on Sunday evening.

Novak Djokovic's window of opportunity is slowly closing.

The Serbian superstar is aiming to win his 25th Grand Slam title, which would break his jointly-held record for the most singles Grand Slams won by any player – a record currently shared with Margaret Court.

Despite his unmatched achievements, Djokovic has struggled to capture that elusive 25th major crown. When Djokovic plays at the US Open, it will mark two years since his last Grand Slam triumph.

Djokovic, who has withdrawn from the upcoming Toronto Open, has seen his past rivals – Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – retire from the sport.

Unfortunately for Djokovic, these icons have been replaced by future icons: Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

Mansour Bahrami, another icon of the sport, has weighed in on Djokovic's chances of winning another Grand Slam in his career.

After an impressive playing career, Mansour Bahrami has transformed himself into one of tennis' most prominent entertainers.

Bahrami, who performs numerous tricks and highlight-reel shots during invitational matches at Grand Slams, expressed his admiration for Novak Djokovic while speaking to Gigi Salmon on the Courtside Conversations Podcast.

Bahrami, who recently revealed what he said to Jannik Sinner before the Wimbledon final, noted that Wimbledon may have been Djokovic's last opportunity to win a 25th slam, while also pinpointing the tournament where Djokovic is most likely to break that elusive record.

Bahrami said: “I thought that he is going to do it. I know that it's going to get more and more difficult.

“For me Wimbledon was maybe the last one so it would be unbelievable and he has done so many things unbelievable that we all are amazed how great he's done. 

“He's a great champion, he's won everything and so is he capable at almost 39 to go and win Australian Open. I would say if there is one that would be Australian Open.

“But it's going to be very, very hard.”

Djokovic's latest opportunity went up in smoke at Wimbledon. The Serbian star lost to Jannik Sinner in straight sets at the semi-final stage – a repeat of the French Open.

Speaking after his record-equalling title in Flushing Meadows, Djokovic conveyed the experience of living his childhood dream, noting his opportunity at a ‘shot at history.'

Djokovic said: “It obviously means the world to me.

“I'm really living my childhood dream to compete at the highest level in this sport, which has given me and my family so much from difficult circumstances.

“I never thought I would be here but the last couple of years I thought I had a shot at history. Why not grab it when it is presented?”

Emma Raducanu turned heads when she teamed up with Elena Rybakina for doubles at the Citi Open.

The 2021 U.S. Open champion and the 2022 Wimbledon victor, both having faced their share of ups and downs post-titles, joined forces in Washington. They were forced to play in blistering heat in the United States, with Raducanu making her feelings clear on the playing conditions.

The pair, nicknamed ER-squared, cruised into the semifinals after securing two victories, first against Olivia Nicholls and Tereza Mihalikova, followed by a win over Giuliana Olmos and Aldila Sutjiadi, without dropping a set.

However, their streak came to an abrupt halt in the final four when they faced Taylor Townsend and Zhang Shuai, as Raducanu fell ill and they had to retire early in the first set. Despite the setback, this may not be the last we see of Raducanu and Rybakina as a team, with the Wimbledon champion speaking highly of her partner.

"Yeah, I think she's really nice girl. It was a lot of fun," Rybakina commented on Raducanu during her press conference. "Of course [it was a] tough match, but I'm happy that I played doubles, and I think it's good as a practice, preparation for singles. So it was fun, and yeah, hopefully we can play a bit more in the future too."



This dynamic duo was a long time in the making, as Raducanu disclosed that they had been planning to join forces right after Rybakina clinched the Wimbledon title by defeating Ons Jabeur in the 2022 showdown.

"How it came about, so in 2022 in Cincinnati, me and Elena were going to play doubles together, and that fell through," the world No. 46 explained.

"Then here, when I was in D.C., I thought it would be a good idea to play doubles, get some extra matches in these conditions. It's very different. And also the fact we were able to play before singles, I think that really helped.

"So, yeah, she was walking off the practice court, and I was on the practice court, and I was just, like, okay, I'll give it a shot. I wasn't really bothered if she said no. I asked her, and she was, like, Yeah, sure. That's how it came about."

The duo has also made impressive strides in their respective singles tournaments, with Raducanu choosing to double down on both fronts in the 2025 editions to boost her physical game.

She teamed up with Britain's top player Katie Boulter at Queen's, then put up a valiant fight at Wimbledon, pushing Aryna Sabalenka to the brink in a promising loss, before heading to North America to join forces with Rybakina – a partnership that might just have a future.

Elena Rybakina has had a couple of concerning collapses this year and the latest came this past on Saturday, when the Kazakh blew a big lead and suffered a shock Washington semifinal loss.

After sealing a tight first set versus world No. 36 Leylah Fernandez, the No. 3 seed also went 3-1 up in the second set and had three consecutive break points to open a double-break second-set lead. 

But then, Rybakina's troubles started. First, the Kazakh didn't manage to get a break in the fifth game. Then, the 2022 Wimbledon champion got broken for the very first time in the match when she was serving to seal the win in the 10th game. To make it all worse, she completely disappeared in the second-set tie-break and won only three points there.

The third set was an extremely tight contest as not a single break point was seen. But then, the tie-break quickly turned into a one-sided battle as Fernandez took the opening four points before completing a 6-7 (2) 7-6 (3) 7-6 (3) comeback win.

Over the last two months, Rybakina - ranked at No. 12 - has had three baffling losses. 

In the French Open round-of-16, the Kazakh was all over Iga Swiatek early on and opened a dominant 6-1 2-0 lead before allowing the Pole to come back and win 1-6 6-3 7-5. In the Berlin quarterfinal, the 2022 Wimbledon champion had four consecutive match points in the third-set tie-break against Aryna Sabalenka before stunningly losing the next six points and seeing the Belarusian win 7-6 (6) 3-6 7-6 (6).

In Washington, Rybakina had yet another collapse and lost herself when the time came for her to get over the finish line. 

Rybakina is now 33-14 on the year. She has been ranked outside the top-10 since April and that won't change on Monday.

After career-high rise, 20-year-old returns to tour with a tricky draw before US Open

Dubai: The hardcourt season was supposed to be her moment to shine. But just as Alex Eala begins her US Open build-up, the Filipino star finds herself facing an early challenge — a rankings drop and a first-round clash against a Grand Slam champion.

Eala, 20, has slipped from a career-best No 56 to world No 69 in the latest Women's Tennis Association (WTA) rankings following a three-week break from competition. The brief pause — which included a homecoming in Manila — came after a gruelling run through the European summer, where she made her debut in the main draws of both the French Open and Wimbledon.

Now back in action at the National Bank Open in Montreal, Eala faces one of the toughest opening-round assignments in the draw: 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova on Sunday. The Czech left-hander, a former world No 6 and Olympic silver medallist, is currently ranked 65th and brings far more experience to the clash at the IGA Stadium.

For Eala, however, tough draws are nothing new. Earlier this season in Miami, she stunned the tennis world with a sensational run to the semi-finals, knocking out three Grand Slam champions — Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and then-world No 1 Iga Swiatek — before losing to Jessica Pegula. That breakout propelled her into the top 60 for the first time in her career.

Since then, the former US Open junior champion has continued to make steady progress. In Eastbourne, she reached her first WTA final before narrowly losing in a three-set battle to Australian teenager Maya Joint. At Wimbledon, she faced a brutal first-round test against eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova and went down fighting in straight sets.

The recent break was seen as both a mental and physical recharge after a demanding stretch. But the downside is a dip in momentum and the loss of valuable ranking points, setting up a tougher road in the coming weeks as she builds toward the year's final Grand Slam.

Montreal will be the first of several tune-ups for Eala, who is expected to feature in Cincinnati before a final stop in Monterrey, Mexico before heading to New York. She's expected to face top-tier opponents in all three tournaments, including world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Grand Slam champions Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff.

Her goal: secure direct entry into the US Open main draw, scheduled from August 24 to September 7 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and prove that Miami was no fluke.

Despite the rankings dip, the Filipino tennis community remains optimistic. At just 20, Eala has shown she has the tools to compete with — and beat — the very best. But the next fortnight will test her ability to handle the grind, rebound from a setback, and navigate a tough schedule in the lead-up to Flushing Meadows.

But for Eala, the coming weeks are about more than just results. “There's still so much for me to achieve,” she told the media in Manila recently. “Of course, I want my first Grand Slam main draw win. But right now, I just want to enjoy playing on this stage.”

If she finds her rhythm early, another memorable run could be just around the corner. But for now, the focus is firmly on surviving Montreal — and the formidable challenge that awaits in Vondrousova.

Having twice saved a break point in the second set, a double fault and undercut forehand drop shot from Shelton enabled his opponent to move ahead 4-3.

Alex de Minaur overcame a scrappy, error-prone performance to halt the run of French lucky loser Corentin Moutet 6-4, 6-3 and advance to the final of the Mubadala Citi DC Open Saturday night.

The Australian will need to sharpen his game ahead of Sunday's final against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina after spraying 33 unforced errors, including 21 in the opening set, and 21 for the match on his backhand, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Spaniard Davidovich Fokina completed a hat-trick of victories against American players, backing up victories over Learner Tien and top seed Taylor Fritz with a 6-2, 7-5 win over fourth seed Ben Shelton in the evening's second semi-final. 



"It wasn't pretty tennis, but I knew it was going to be a tricky match without a lot of rhythm," De Minuar said. "That's what he's able to do to opponents. I had the mentality of doing whatever it took to get into the title match tomorrow."

After winning 14 consecutive points to start the second set, De Minaur seemed to be coasting to victory but double faulted to drop serve at 4-1 and later failed to serve out the match at 5-2 in a game that started with a double fault.

In a more promising sign, De Minaur won 17 of 22 points at net, regularly approaching Moutet's weaker backhand wing with impunity.

De Minaur, who also reached the Washington, D.C. final in 2018 (l. to Zverev), improved to a Tour-leading 21 hard-court wins on the season. He also has the most wins at the ATP 500 level (41) since the start of the 2023 season.

By reaching the final, De Minaur passed Andrey Rublev at No. 10 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. 

Moutet, who came into the tournament as a lucky loser after losing in qualifying, has this week climbed 13 spots to No. 46 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, cracking the Top 50 for the first time in his career. 

Davidovich Fokina, hit just 10 winners but capitalised on Shelton's 35 unforced errors, including seven double faults. The 12th seed backed up impressively after the previous night rallying from 2-5 in the third set to beat World No. 4 Fritz around 1 a.m.

He becomes just the second Spanish finalist in Washington, following Alex Corretja's surprise victory over five-time champion Andre Agassi 25 years ago in 2000. 

The recently married 26-year-old claimed a career-best 33rd win on the season and a fifth Top-10 win of the year. He now sits at a career-high No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, ensuring that he will make his Top 20 debut on Monday.

"I knew that I wouldn't be fresh after such a late finish, but I knew with Ben that there wouldn't be a lot of long rallies and it would be a quick match. I knew I had to be there for every point,” Davidovich Fokina said.

"It's always special to win against a Top 10 player. To beat one of the best guys in the world is always special. Coming back from 2-5 against Taylor last night was a huge achievement.”

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Sunday's final at the 2025 Citi Open has arrived in Washington, D.C. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina will look for his first title of his career in what should be a riveting match against World No. 13 Alex de Minaur. LWOT previews and predicts the ATP 500 title match.

Head-to-head: 2-2

As former ATP NextGen stars, these two players first met in 2019 at the NextGen ATP Finals, showcasing their athleticism and speed at a young age. De Minaur won that match, Davidovich Fokina returned the favor in their next two meetings, and de Minaur won their latest meeting 6-1 6-3 in Canada two years ago. Both players have had strong careers, though de Minaur has thrived on the ATP Tour with nine titles and has certainly had the higher ground on Tour.

Davidovich Fokina has played some of his best career tennis this week. His quarterfinal win over Taylor Fritz concluded after 1 a.m., a match that he trailed deep into the third set. In his 6-2 7-5 semifinal win over Ben Shelton on Saturday, he rebounded and had to fight off a vocal crowd after Shelton got a late push in the match during the second set. The Spaniard has been particulary strong on the forehand wing this week.

De Minaur made the final of this tournament seven years ago as a teenager, falling to Alexander Zverev in the title match. He's become more aggressive on court and strengthened his serve since then, something that will thrive on these faster courts. The Aussie has only dropped one set all week, claiming a brutal three-set win over Jiri Lehecka in the third round. He defeated Corentin Moutet in the semifinals 6-4 6-3, who had just come off an upset sh0ck over Daniil Medvedev.

It's easy to pick de Minaur as the favorite with his ATP final experience, but Davidovich Fokina is long overdue for an ATP title. The Spaniard is 0-3 in ATP finals, and some of the losses have been brutal. He's had a strong 2025 season, nearing a career high ranking and reaching two finals, but he faced debilitating pressure in both of those final matches. With the Spaniard playing clean tennis, and managing the pressure as an underdog in two successive matches, he may be able to play more freely being an underdog against the Aussie.

Ultimately, de Minaur should be hoisting the trophy on Sunday afternoon. The Aussie is one of the game's top returners, and he'll be able to capitalize on Davidovich Fokina's often inconsistent serve. While the Spaniard has served well this week, that stroke is often the first to crumble under pressure. De Minaur is also used to these conditions, and can grind out a player surely to be fatigued after a long week. Davidovich Fokina will have to play consistent tennis, but also shorten rallies as much as possible in order to avoid any long points that will let De Minaur settle in.
Prediction: De Minaur in 3

One game away from defeat, Leylah Fernandez battled all the way back to win a 3-hour and 12-minute, three-tiebreak epic over Elena Rybakina in the Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals. In the final, she will meet Anna Kalinskaya, who boasts a 9-2 main-draw record in Washington.

Leylah Fernandez was a single game away from defeat in Saturday's Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals, but she battled all the way back to pull off a grueling, three-tiebreak victory and reach her first final in over a year.

On another toasty day in the American capital city of Washington, D.C., Canada's Fernandez overcame No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-6(3) in a 3-hour and 12-minute marathon.

There was nearly a rematch of the memorable 2021 US Open final on Sunday, but it was not to be. Instead, Fernandez will face Anna Kalinskaya, who eased past 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu 6-4, 6-3 in the day's second semifinal.

Sunday is a huge chance for World No. 36 Fernandez and World No. 48 Kalinskaya, both of whom have previously been ranked inside the Top 20. This WTA 500 trophy would be the biggest career title for either of them -- in fact, Kalinskaya has yet to win a WTA singles title at all.

Fernandez narrowly defeated Kalinskaya in their only previous meeting, which was over four years ago. On the hard courts of Guadalajara in 2021, Fernandez squeaked past Kalinskaya 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.

The final is at 2:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon local time (7:30 p.m. BST). Let's break down the cases for the two unseeded finalists:

In Saturday's first semifinal, Elena Rybakina had not lost serve through 7-6(2), 5-4, where she served for the match. Naturally, Leylah Fernandez had her exactly where she wanted her.

"When I first started playing tennis, there was like a mini camp and they were doing a physical test, kind of a straight-line sprint," Fernandez said after her quarterfinal win on Friday. "I was probably the slowest out of all of the girls there.

"The coaches were concerned, like 'She's not very good physically.' They talked to my parents, and my parents said, 'Yeah, but if you put a tennis ball in front of her and you ask her to run for every ball, she's gonna do it. Her heart and her belief in herself is much bigger than most of the girls in that camp.'"

Heart and belief continue to pull Fernandez into and through bigtime matches. Toting a water bottle emblazoned with the words "hard work" and "fight," Fernandez never lets a match go.

That came to pass in her epic win over Rybakina. Staring down match game at 5-4 in the second set, Fernandez's cracking returns helped the Canadian earn her first service break of the day when she needed it most. 

Once the third set hit, Fernandez was the sturdier player in rallies down the stretch. Bolstered by her never-say-die attitude, these returns and rally groundstrokes could lead Fernandez to her fourth career title, and her first since 2023 Hong Kong. All of her three career WTA singles titles have come on hard court.

"We're doing things right," Fernandez said on Saturday. "The results are going to come. [I'll] keep enjoying it, and to not focus too much on results but focus on how my game is improving."

On paper, Anna Kalinskaya has "upset" three players ranked ahead of her in her last three rounds. However, Washington is starting to feel like a home-field event for the former World No. 11.

The Mubadala Citi DC Open is arguably Anna Kalinskaya's best stop on tour. She holds a 9-2 main-draw win-loss record at the event and has never lost before the quarterfinals here, including a semifinal showing in 2019 as a qualifier ranked No. 160.

Kalinskaya went one further this year and is into her second career WTA singles final, following WTA 1000 Dubai and WTA 500 Berlin, both last year. After narrow losses in both of those finals, she has another opportunity to join the club of WTA singles titlists.

These hard courts suit Kalinskaya's unfussy groundstrokes and placid demeanor. Dominating with her forehand, Kalinskaya had 19 winners to Raducanu's 13 in their opening set.

Proving she is lethal from both wings, Kalinskaya fired consecutive backhand winners to break Raducanu in the opening game of the second set, and she was off to the races from there.

"I always like to be aggressive," Kalinskaya said on Saturday night. "I like that style of the game. Yeah, I guess the fast court fits me very well, but you need to be fast at making decisions. It's also very challenging.

"But I guess when I serve good, return fast, that's what I like the most, and to try to be aggressive as much as I can, and the fast court helps."

If she can find the holes to power past speedy Fernandez on Sunday, Kalinskaya could be hoisting the champion's trophy for the very first time at tour level.

Sunday action is in the cards for the National Bank Open, ATP Toronto Masters 1000. Here is your look at all the action.

Adam Walton is at a career high ranking after reaching the semis in Los Cabos, a late bloomer on the ATP Tour, he's into the top 100 now and 8-11 at tour level this year, along with a Challenger final and a title at that level. Bonzi at just 6-13 on the year really wants to find some form on hard courts this summer. His result in Washington was a first round exit, and Walton looks well positioned to hand Bonzi a second consecutive opening match defeat. Prediction: Walton in 2

The teenage wild card Arseneault is making his ATP main draw debut this is a big stage for him against the veteran Djere who is a respectable 15-12 on the season and won a title on clay this year. Djere's career hard court record is quite bad and Arseneault will have every chance, but it's hard to predict an upset in favor of a player who has rarely played opponents of Djere's caliber. Prediction: Djere in 3

With a record of 9-8 on the season, Ofner is trying to play his way back into the top 100. He's a credible all surface player, while Opelka at #74 in the world is 18-16 on the season overall, and has mostly played at the ATP level. Opelka comes off a tough loss to Daniil Medvedev in the second round of D.C., with his serve he looks like the favorite here. Prediction: Opelka in 2

Kecmanovic won a hard court title this year but is looking to bounce back from an opening match loss in D.C., Halys is just 12-19 on the season and has a worse record than his opponent. With both players suffering the same fate last week, neither can be said to be in good form, but Kecmanovic has been playing better on the season. Prediction: Kecmanovic in 2

Frances Tiafoe's quest to win the Mubadala Citi DC Open title in his backyard will have to wait another year.In an all-American quarterfinal on Friday night in the nation's capital, fourth-seeded Ben Shelton got the better of Tiafoe for the third time in four career meetings, 7-6(2), 6-4. Shelton has now reached the semifinals in D.C. in back-to-back years, making him the third American to do that this century after Andre Agassi (2001-04) and Steve Johnson (2015-16).All four matches between Tiafoe and Shelton have come in a less than two-year span. After Tiafoe got revenge for a four-set 2023 US Open defeat to Shelton last year in Queens in five sets, he celebrated by exclaiming that Arthur Ashe Stadium was "his house."But at his hometown tournament, which he grew up attending since childhood in College Park, Md., Shelton got the last word.Read more: Frances Tiafoe not happy with Taylor Townsend roasting Washington Commanders-inspired fit at DC Open

Tiafoe failed to serve out the first set at 6-5 before Shelton roared back. Continuing his success in tiebreakers, the lefty won six straight points to take a one set lead, and broke Tiafoe again at 3-3 on the way to a straight-sets win."We know tennis is a long journey. We're going to play each other a bunch of times," Shelton said post-match, adding that "it's tough not to cheer for a guy like that" after the two hugged it out at the net.Shelton finished the match with 29 winners to Tiafoe's 20. He also hit just 18 unforced errors to Tiafoe's 28. But most impressively, 31 of Shelton's 55 serves went unreturned.

"This court does a lot for my serve," Shelton later added. "The ability to get the ball out of the zone is huge, especially against a guy like Foe who is so good in the pocket. So my ability for my flat serves not only to be coming in at 145 [mph] but also rising above his shoulders is huge."Second serve, too. He's one of the best in the world when he's locked in, attacking second serves and making you feel like you're on the back foot, taking a second serve and coming to the net. My winning percentage on second serve was probably the highest that it's ever been against him."My aggressive brand of serving, and then I was willing to take chances on the return of serve, and I executed a lot. So I think that combination was kind of tough to deal with in these conditions."The 22-year-old seeks his second final of 2025, after finishing runner-up to Alexander Zverev in Munich, against either No. 1 seed Taylor Fritz or No. 12 seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Leylah Fernandez emerged victorious in a gripping battle with Elena Rybakina Saturday to reach the Mubadala Citi DC Open final in Washington, D.C.And she did so after Rybakina served for the match in the second set, leading to a dramatic encounter lasting three hours and 16 minutes.On a day that produced little to separate the competitors, it was Fernandez who out-served the 2022 Wimbledon champion when it counted to secure the 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory."'Hard work' and 'fight' has been the pillars, my tennis journey, my dad and I and our family on everyday life," Fernandez told press.

The left-hander won 16 of her first 17 points on serve, but watched as Rybakina rocketed consecutive return winners in the opening tiebreak to swing the momentum in her favor. The Kazakh appeared to be in control by securing an immediate break to launch set two, but an inability to extend her lead to a double break despite chances in her next two return games—including 0-40 at 3-1—would later cost the No. 3 seed.Sensing Rybakina's tightness, Fernandez worked the energy of the crowd to her advantage to level for 5-5. Back in another now-or-never situation, the Canadian opened a 5-0 lead en route to trading tiebreaks on the scoreboard.

Neither player managed to create a break point in the decider, leading to one final shootout. Fernandez saved two of her best forehand strikes of the encounter to open a 4-0 advantage. While Rybakina regained one of the mini breaks, Fernandez would not be denied to complete the comeback effort when her opponent's forehand flew long.The 22-year-old is through to her first final of the season and is 3-3 in her previous trips.

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in a wet-dry Belgian Grand Prix, extending his Drivers' Championship lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in the Belgian Grand Prix, holding off McLaren team mate and title rival Lando Norris in a wet-dry affair at Spa-Francorchamps to extend his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Heavy rain ahead of the 44-lap race delayed proceedings by almost 80 minutes but once racing got underway on Lap 5, the crucial moment came immediately as Piastri got a better run on his team mate and polesitter through Eau Rouge.

The Australian's run was so great he completed the pass along the Kemmel Straight well before the braking zone of Les Combes and thereafter managed a margin of roughly one second in the early running.

With the circuit having substantially dried and with track position, Piastri pitted on Lap 12 for the medium tyres with Norris forced to complete another lap, and after making his own stop the following tour for hard rubber, the Briton found himself nine seconds adrift.

Despite having to manage his softer compound, Piastri maintained a healthy gap which only reduced in the final laps to as much as 3.1s, but a small mistake from Norris at La Source on the penultimate lap meant the margin extended to 3.4s at the chequered flag.

The two title challengers were well clear of Charles Leclerc in third, the Ferrari driver finishing 20s behind Piastri but having held Saturday's Sprint winner Max Verstappen at bay throughout, the Red Bull man just 1.5s away from another rostrum.

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Mercedes' George Russell enjoyed a lonely race for P5, having passed Alex Albon early on, with the Williams driver surviving constant pressure from Lewis Hamilton in the second half of proceedings to claim sixth.

Hamilton had climbed 11 places in his Ferrari after a pit lane start and was one of the first to switch from the intermediate tyres at the crossover point to eventually finish seventh.

Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto claimed 8th and 9th respectively, with Pierre Gasly's Alpine taking the final point on offer in P10 after heading a DRS train for much of the race.

This was headed by Haas' Oliver Bearman, with Nico Hulkenberg P12 after making a second stop having been running in the points, while Yuki Tsunoda lost two places in the closing stages.

The Red Bull driver finished ahead of Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Esteban Ocon (Haas), Kimi Antonelli, Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz - the Mercedes, Aston Martin and Williams drivers all starting from the pit lane.

Alpine's Franco Colapinto and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the order as all drivers reached the chequered flag as there was no caution period once racing had got underway after the delayed start.

With Saturday's Sprint having been held in sunshine and optimal conditions, drivers and teams were thrown a huge curveball on Sunday afternoon as heavy rain hit the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit less than 30 minutes before the start of the scheduled 44-lap race.

Unsurprisingly, the race started behind the Safety Car with polesitter Norris leading the field away from McLaren team mate Piastri with all drivers on the intermediate Pirelli tyre and searching for grip amongst the standing water.

Several drivers started from the pit lane after power unit and set-up changes, including Sainz, Hamilton, Antonelli and Alonso, with the quartet joining the back of the Safety Car queue as the formation lap got underway.

But with less than a lap completed, Race Control took the decision to red flag proceedings due to the large amounts of spray with Norris reporting, “I can't see a lot behind the Safety Car”, as all drivers entered the pit lane.

After nearly an 80-minute delay and suspension of the starting procedure following another heavy spell of rain, the field took to the track again behind the Safety Car under bright skies and the race officially got underway.

After four laps behind the Safety Car and with standing water at a minimum, racing finally commenced on Lap 5 with Norris leading Piastri, Leclerc and Verstappen into La Source at the rolling start.

Up Eau Rouge Piastri was nailed to the back of his team mate and comfortably moved ahead along the Kemmel Straight, completing the move well before the braking zone into Les Combes.

The Australian pulled a margin of one second by the end of the lap, while further behind, Russell moved up to fifth at the expense of Albon and Stroll dropped behind both Sainz and Hamilton down to 18th.

As the two McLarens began to clear out at the head of the field, Verstappen started to mount pressure on Leclerc for P3, while the second Ferrari of Hamilton passed Sainz for 16th into the final chicane on Lap 7 as Antonelli ran deep behind.

Hamilton's charge continued, passing Colapinto around the outside into Les Combes and Hulkenberg at the final chicane on Lap 8, with Gasly his next victim on the following tour into Stavelot.

By Lap 10, Piastri's margin to Norris sat at 1.7s, the race leader reporting that slick tyres would be needed soon, with Leclerc 5.5s adrift in his battle with Verstappen as the Ferrari driver struggled for rear grip.

But having added downforce compared with the Sprint, Verstappen struggled to gain a run on Leclerc along the Kemmel Straight despite much better exits from La Source.

Hamilton became the first driver to take the plunge for slick tyres, pitting at the end of Lap 11 from P13 and the Briton was joined by Gasly, Hulkenberg and Alonso as all drivers switched to the medium compound.

The following lap, Piastri pitted from the lead for the medium tyre as Norris continued on another lap, but behind the majority of drivers also stopped, only Tsunoda, Hadjar and Ocon staying out on their used intermediates.

Ocon soon became a roadblock for Leclerc, Verstappen and Russell, the trio passing the Haas driver at high speed through Blanchimont as Norris pitted at the end of the lap.

The decision was made to switch to the hard tyre in the hope of running to the end of the race, but the Briton lost time with a small problem fitting the front-left tyre and found himself 9.1s adrift of Piastri once up to speed.

Behind, Leclerc still headed Verstappen, Russell and Albon, with Hamilton now up to P7 as less than four seconds covered the group, with Lawson, Hulkenberg and Bortoleto completing the top 10.

The two Kick Saubers swapped positions on Lap 20 at the end of the Kemmel Straight, while behind, Antonelli demoted Colapinto for P15 as Hadjar made a second stop on Lap 21, swapping the medium tyre for hards.

At the halfway point, Piastri led Norris by 8.1s but was unsure whether he could manage his medium tyres without stopping again, claiming over the radio “I think it will be tough to get to the end”.

Outside the top 10, Gasly was several seconds away from the points but had a DRS train behind him in P11 consisting of Tsunoda, Bearman, Alonso and Antonelli.

Norris lost a further second in his pursuit of Piastri, running wide at Pouhon on Lap 26, while Antonelli moved ahead of Alonso for P14 into Les Combes the next lap as Sainz in P19 received a black and white flag for track limits at Eau Rouge.

Sainz had recently pitted for a set of hard tyres along with Colapinto, as the pair joined Hadjar at the back of the field as the only drivers to have made two pit stops.

Alonso was the next to stop at the end of Lap 29, with drivers struggling to manage the medium tyres on an almost completely dry circuit, with Antonelli and Hulkenberg also feeling the need to come into the pits over the following laps.

Hulkenberg, who had pitted from P10, moved up to 14th at the expense of Ocon along the Kemmel Straight and quickly closed a gap of more than six seconds to Stroll in front.

Antonelli was next to challenge Ocon after sweeping around the outside at Les Combes, but the Frenchman was able to move back ahead through the following bend as Alonso came to challenge the pair behind.

Out front, the gap between the leading pair began to close rapidly as Norris reduced the gap to just 5.5s at the start of Lap 38, and which came down to 3.8s on Lap 41, with Piastri told to potentially expect drops of rain at La Source over the remaining laps.

A deep moment into La Source on the penultimate lap all but ended Norris' charge having brought the gap down to 3.1s, eventually finishing 3.4s behind Piastri who extends his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Leclerc was 20s adrift in third but having held off Verstappen, with Russell a lonely fifth from Albon and Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion having moved up 11 places.

Lawson, Bortoleto and Gasly completed the top 10, with Bearman just missing out on the points after passing Tsunoda, who also lost a further position to the charging Hulkenberg on fresh rubber.

Stroll, Ocon, Antonelli, Alonso, Sainz, Colapinto and Hadjar completed the order as all drivers finished in a race which featured no further cautions after the delayed start.

"I knew that Lap 1 was going to be probably my best chance of winning the race, and I got a good exit out of Turn 1 and lifted as little as I dared through Eau Rouge and then it was enough," said Piastri.

"The rest of the race we managed really well, struggling a little bit at the end, maybe the medium wasn't the best for the last five or six laps through last laps but we had it mostly under control, which is what I wanted. I was pretty disappointed with myself after yesterday, but turns out starting second at Spa is not too bad after all."

F1 will travel directly from Spa-Francorchamps to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix over the weekend of August 1-3. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne looks at the heart-stopping crash that inspired the backstory of Brad Pitt's Sonny Hayes in F1 The Movie.

At the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix weekend, Martin Donnelly crashed into the barrier at an estimated 160mph, throwing him out of his Lotus 102 and leaving him motionless on track. The devastating accident cut short his F1 career and changed his life forever.

Thirty-five years later Donnelly's journey helped inspire the team behind F1 The Movie, with the backstory of Brad Pitt's character Sonny Hayes based on the Northern Irishman's experience. Hall of Fame Journalist David Tremayne remembers the day that changed Donnelly's life...

There is an ugliness to violence. Not what you see in the movies, but the real stuff. When something so far beyond the norm of everyday life happens right in front of you.

We're all used to seeing cars spin, or even crash, either when we're watching the TV coverage or spectating at a race. But this real-time stuff, that happens right before you when something really goes wrong, with all of its horror and brutal soundtrack… That's something else. And it never really leaves you.

Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and lucky fans to unveil her tracklist.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Sabrina Carpenter has taken the notion of “man's best friend” quite literally in the weeks leading up to her seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend. 


	Set for release on Aug. 29 via Island Records, the LP's rollout has been anything but ordinary: Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and a pair of lucky fans to unveil her tracklist, two songs at a time, in a series of Instagram and Twitter posts that combined star power with canine cuteness.

	











	About a month after announcing the album, Carpenter began the tracklist reveal on July 23 by introducing track 12, “Goodbye,” alongside a photo of fan Mariah cradling the puppy in her arms. In her caption she wrote, “track #12 is ‘Goodbye' but mariah is helping us say hello to our tracklist reveal.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Two days later, Carpenter returned to the pup brigade to share track 11 — “House Tour” — featuring fan Neriah in a similar snapshot, captioned “neriah & a golden = home sweet home. track #11 is ‘House Tour.'” Both posts drew hundreds of thousands of likes, with fans applauding the innovative, heartwarming approach.


	Carpenter then took to X to amplify the moment, reposting excited reactions from @overdosedontun (“omggg sabrina asked me to reveal track 11 ‘House Tour' from Man's Best Friend !!!”) and urging fellow fans to rally: “Track 11 stans rise.” Beyond the puppy reveals, Carpenter has maintained momentum for Man's Best Friend by leaning into playful fan interaction and capitalizing on her comedic timing — qualities that have earned her more than 5 million Instagram followers and built genuine community around her music.

	











	In the days that followed, titles “Don't Worry I'll Make You Happy” (track 10), “Go Go Juice” (track 9) and “When Did You Get Hot?” (track 8), and “Never Getting Laid” (track 7) were unveiled, with the countdown expected to continue.


	The forthcoming album follows 2024's Short n' Sweet and arrives amid Carpenter's latest lead single, “Manchild,” released on June 5. Man's Best Friend will drop almost exactly a year after Carpenter released breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. So far, fans have gotten to hear only one song from the new record — “Manchild,” which dropped in June and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking Carpenter's second-ever No. 1 song.

It was only a matter of time until Jay Leno had something to say — although, whether he said anything actually in response to the dust up at “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” is a little less clear. In an interview posted last week by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, taped two weeks ago, Leno took the current slate of late night hosts to task.

“I got hate letters [when hosting ‘The Tonight Show'] saying, ‘You and your Republican friends,' and another saying, ‘I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,” Leno related (via THR). “That's how you get a whole audience. Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.”

Leno continued to explain how, in his day, friends didn't talk about their political positions — even those in the comedic realm. “Rodney Dangerfield and I were friends. I knew Rodney 40 years and I have no idea if he was a Democrat or Republican. We never discussed politics, we just discussed jokes. I like to think that people come to a comedy show to get away from the pressures of life. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other,” he said.

 










No matter when it was filmed, the timing of its release would seem deliberate, considering that Stephen Colbert‘s series has been the subject of “was it cancelled because of its politics?” rumors since the news broke on July 17 — especially considering the timing of the CBS/Paramount-Skydance merger approval by the Trump Administration's Justice Department. If Leno still stands by this opinion two weeks later, it would put him on a lonely late night island. Virtually every other figure in the mainstream — from Jimmy Fallon to Jimmy Kimmel to Jon Stewart to previous “Late Show” host David Letterman — have expressed support for Colbert and lambasted the series' parent company.

“I don't think it was money… it was pure cowardice,” Letterman said on his YouTube channel July 25. “What the fuck is Skydance, honest to Christ? Is it a discount airline? Is that what it is? I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS, who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed because this is this is gutless. I only wish this could happen to me… Fighting with network television management was number one in the playbook.”

But Leno maintains a diverting approach — even in these unusual Trumpian times — from the style adopted by Colbert. “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group — or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what's funny,” he concluded.

 










Last year on “The Talk,” Leno said something similar, but seemed to indicate that his style didn't work in the present era. “Now you kind of have to take a side,” he said (via THR). “It's a little bit different, but the nice thing about this election is, it was fair. I was not a fan [of Trump], but that's OK. It's the president of the United States. Let's all get together, thank you very much.”

Vanessa Kirby, much to her surprise, had no trouble committing to the sprawling MCU as she was cast in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, where she portrays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in Marvel Studios‘ official launch of Phase Six.


	During a recent interview with Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast, The Crown alumna talked about falling in love with the famed comic book character and what it's been like reprising the role for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.


	“When this one came around, I was so genuinely moved by the fact that this was a woman who was pregnant and was a new mother, and also has these superpowers,” Kirby said. “It helped me ground it in something — to try and understand what it would be like to have both those things happening at the same time was a challenge, but I was grateful for that because it rooted it in this kind of domesticity, in this family and home, which made it easier.”

	For the role, Kirby did not audition, first meeting with helmer Matt Shakman over lunch and later on top brass Kevin Feige. The actress said she was excited to mine the “counterculture and super meaningful” '60s comic book era to bring the character to life, adding that because of Sue Storm's expansive journey she didn't have any trepidation agreeing to future MCU pipeline projects.

	“With this, I actually didn't have that, and I'm surprised to say that,” the Pieces of a Woman star explained. “I think it was because I really liked her so much and because I'd read so many of the comics and she goes through so many different iterations. She becomes Malice, this really dark version of herself for quite a long time, and then she renames herself Invisible Woman having been called Invisible Girl and she goes off with Psycho-Man, like her history is incredible, so I felt like there's so much there to even [explore] psychologically. I mean, she has a stillborn, and people don't know that. She's gone through a lot.”


	More importantly, Kirby said she felt confident continuing her collaboration with the superhero studio alongside her fellow First Steps co-stars Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach: “I knew I wouldn't be without these three actors, and these three actors have genuinely become family, and I admired them so much, and I knew that we're a four and the four in the comics are never separated, so I assumed that we'd be together, and that really helped 'cause then you're not a lone ranger going to new, daunting environments.”

	











	Speaking to the much-hyped Doomsday, Kirby said more shoots are on the way: “I'm loving it, absolutely loving it. It's been a complete privilege,” she said of filming, which she is doing while pregnant, adding that it's the “coolest” experience.


	Shakman previously spoke to Deadline about how his MCU entry is able to “pass the baton” to the Joe and Anthony Russo-directed 2026 movie. Though plot details are currently tightly under wraps, audiences can expect the tentpole to center on supervillain and Fantastic Four arch nemesis Dr. Doom (Robert Downey Jr.).


	“[The Russo Brothers] describe it like they're making a recipe of different ingredients, and it's unbelievable that these Avengers movies work in such a beautiful way,” Kirby said. “You look at Infinity War and you've got all these different energies but somehow they all fuse together, and I remember them saying the first one they had no idea if any of them would go together, and it just works. It's quite exciting to be a part of something and go, ‘OK, this is my flavor, I don't know.' It's in their hands to work out what flavors go with what and how and where and there's a surrender in that.”


	Lauding Downey Jr.'s leadership onscreen, Kirby said: “He's the most incredible human being, soulful, deep, kind — he's been an amazing leader to us considering we're the newbies, and a lot of the others have known this world for a really long time, and he's been a phenomenal leader, and also he's just doing the most amazing work.”


	In addition to the quartet from First Steps and Downey Jr., confirmed cast members include Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Letitia Wright, Florence Pugh, Simu Liu, Tom Hiddleston, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Danny Ramirez, Hannah John-Kamen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Channing Tatum, Tenoch Huerta Mejía and Lewis Pullman.

	Daniel Kreps



Tom Lehrer, the influential song satirist whose darkly comic lyrics gained a cult following decades after he stopped making music, has died at the age of 97.


	Lehrer died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his longtime friend David Herder told the Associated Press. No cause of death was provided.


	The New York City-born, Harvard-educated Lehrer began making music while studying mathematics in college, applying his humor to song to tackle issues ranging from racism to militarism to religion to nuclear war in the Fifties and early Sixties.


	Among Lehrer's best-known songs include “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,” “It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier,” “The Vatican Rag,” “The Masochism Tango,” and “The Old Dope Peddler,” the latter of which was sampled by 2 Chainz decades later.


	While Lehrer only recorded about three-dozen songs during his musical lifetime — he refocused on teaching mathematics in the Seventies — his work had an enormous impact on future generations, inspiring songwriters like Randy Newman, Steely Dan's Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, and “Weird Al” Yankovic, who heard Lehrer's songs frequently on Dr. Demento's radio show.

	











	“My last living musical hero is still my hero but unfortunately no longer living. RIP to the great, great Mr. Tom Lehrer,” Yankovic wrote on social media Sunday.

	











Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe was also an admirer of Lehrer — “the cleverest and funniest man of the 20th century, and kind of my hero,” Radcliffe said — and once delivered the satirist's complex “The Elements” on British late-night television; Radcliffe's impromptu performance of the elemental table was in part responsible for the actor later landing the role of “Weird Al” in Yankovic's quasi-biopic.


	“I used to sing that song in college at coffeehouses,” Yankovic said of “The Elements” and Radcliffe's performance. “Singing that song is an extremely nerdy thing to do. It's off-the-charts nerdy. And I thought, ‘OK, this guy gets it. This guy's a kindred spirit. He can embody me onscreen.'”

	Despite a stacked list of celeb cameos, one of Saturday Night Live‘s original ‘Not Ready for Primetime Players' opted to skip the show's 50th anniversary.


	After the comedian was notably absent from SNL50: The Anniversary Special, Dan Aykroyd revealed why he missed out on the milestone celebration with his fellow NBC sketch comedy alums in February.


	“I wanted to be at home and I wanted to watch the show beginning to end,” he recently explained to Entertainment Weekly.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I knew if i was there, I'd be in a dressing room, I'd be working. I wanted to see it live,” added Aykroyd. “I'm a fan of the show today, and I watch it all the time. I love these new players; I think they're just great. I just wanted to see and live nostalgically with my family in my own home, eating my own popcorn.”

	











	Aykroyd previously praised Lorne Michaels' programming as “triumphant” after watching the anniversary special and SNL50: The Homecoming Concert.


	“All Heads up toasting triumphant SNL 50th,” wrote Aykroyd on X at the time. “Advantage of not attending – got to see every second of concert and show on TV. Quote from my children: ‘Look at daddy's smile!' Had it from start to finish. Congratulations Lorne. Well done as usual.”


	Aykroyd — who appeared on SNL from its inaugural season in 1975 to 1979 and also originated such characters as the Coneheads and the Festrunk Brothers — was referenced several times during the anniversary weekend.

	











	Sans Aykroyd, the OG SNL cast members took a bow with Michaels during February's special, which saw 14.8 million viewers across Peacock and NBC.

Emma Heming Willis is once again using her voice to protect her family. As speculation around “The Sixth Sense” star Bruce Willis continues to spread online, she is making sure to let fans know that certain reports are not fact. 

In a strongly worded Instagram Story, Heming Willis urged her followers to avoid stories that begin with phrases like “sources close to the family say.” She followed that with a direct message to the press, writing, “To any outlet that runs with those kinds of stories, do better. Giving a platform to anonymous speculation is not only careless, it's harmful.”

She ended the post with a single inspirational word: “Onward.”

The message comes as gossip headlines about “Die Hard” actor Bruce Willis continue to circulate. Since his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in 2023, tabloids and entertainment sites have regularly published stories citing unnamed insiders, often without confirmation from the family. Heming Willis has now made it clear where she stands on that kind of reporting.

A post shared by The Open Field (@openfieldbooks)

This is not the first time Heming Willis has spoken out. Over the past year, she has used her platform to raise awareness about frontotemporal dementia and to advocate for respect and accuracy in coverage. Her latest comments continue that mission.

Supporters quickly responded to her message, praising her for standing up for her family's privacy. Many fans also echoed her call for higher standards in celebrity reporting.

Bruce Willis, known for his iconic roles in “Die Hard,” “Pulp Fiction,” and “The Sixth Sense,” stepped away from acting in 2022. He and Emma share two daughters. He also has three daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore, who has remained actively supportive of the entire family.

Emma Heming Willis did not just post a warning. She drew a clear line between fact and fiction, and reminded readers to think twice before believing what anonymous voices have to say.

Plus: Alex Warren, Ozzy Osbourne, Jessie Murph and BTS shake-up the top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



Tyler, The Creator scores his fourth No. 1, all earned consecutively, on the Billboard 200 albums chart as his latest album, DON'T TAP THE GLASS, debuts atop the tally (dated Aug. 2). The set launches with 197,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending July 24, according to Luminate.

	











	After teasing a new project on social media, the artist announced the album on Friday, July 18, with a release date slated for an off-cycle Monday, July 21. In turn, the album arrives on the Billboard 200 with only four days of activity in its first tracking week toward the chart. Most albums are released on Friday of each week; Luminate's tracking week for the chart runs Friday through Thursday. (It's the second off-cycle release in a row to debut at No. 1, following the JACKBOYS 2 project a week ago, which dropped on a Sunday.)


	More than half of DON'T TAP THE GLASS' first-week activity is owed to album sales (it's the top-selling album of the week with 128,000 sold). Those sales are largely from five physical offerings exclusively sold via the artist's official webstore (a vinyl LP, CD and three deluxe boxed sets containing a piece of branded clothing and a copy of the CD). The five physical sets went up for sale in the webstore shortly after the album's announcement. All physical versions of the album contained one bonus track as compared to the standard 10-song widely available digital download and streaming edition of the album.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Tyler, The Creator previously topped the chart with CHROMAKOPIA (2024), CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST (2021) and IGOR (2019). In total, GLASS is Tyler, The Creator's eighth top 10-charted effort, the entirety of his charting titles on the Billboard 200.


	Elsewhere in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Alex Warren hits the top 10 for the first time with You'll Be Alright, Kid; the late Ozzy Osbourne is remembered as The Essential Ozzy Osbourne jumps 134-7 (marking his 10th top 10); Jessie Murph collects her first top 10 with the arrival of Sex Hysteria; and BTS notches its eighth top 10 with the bow of PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE (LIVE). 


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 2, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 29. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Of DON'T TAP THE GLASS' 197,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 24, album sales comprise 128,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart), SEA units comprise 69,000 (equaling 93.34 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 4 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.

	











	Morgan Wallen's chart-topping I'm the Problem bumps 3-2 on the latest Billboard 200, earning 142,000 equivalent album units (down 4% — though it returns to No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums for a ninth nonconsecutive week on top). The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack rises 5-3 (89,000; up 5%) and JACKBOYS and Travis Scott's JACKBOYS 2 falls 1-4 in its second week (78,000; down 66%).


	Alex Warren hits the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the first time as You'll Be Alright, Kid jumps 19-5 after it was expanded with 10 added songs. The set earned 73,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week (up 207%). Of that sum, SEA units comprise 59,000 (up 157%, equaling 80.19 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it moves 15-5 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 13,000 (up 9,483% — it debuts at No. 7 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 71%).


You'll Be Alright, Kid includes Warren's smash single “Ordinary,” which has spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart (through the most recently published list, dated July 26). The expanded album's sales got a boost from its availability across five vinyl variants (including a signed editions) and two CD editions (one of them signed).


	Justin Bieber's SWAG shifts 2-6 in its second week on the Billboard 200, earning 72,000 equivalent album units (down 55%).


The Essential Ozzy Osbourne vaults 134-7 the Billboard 200, following Osbourne's death on July 22. The best-of collection reaches the top 10 for the first time (it previously peaked at No. 81 in 2003, the year it was released) and marks the 10th top 10-charted set for the late metal god. Essential earned nearly 44,000 equivalent album units in the July 18-24 tracking week (up 309%). Of that sum, SEA units comprise 35,000 (up 287%, equaling 48.70 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 9 on Top Streaming Albums), TEA units comprise 6,000 (up 888%) and album sales comprise 3,000 (up 197% — it re-enters at No. 30 on Top Album Sales).

	











	Osbourne previously hit the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with Patient Number 9 (No. 3 in 2022), Ordinary Man (No. 3, 2020), Scream (No. 4, 2010), Black Rain (No. 3, 2007), Down to Earth (No. 4, 2001), Ozzmosis (No. 4, 1995), No More Tears (No. 7, 1991), Tribute (with Randy Rhoads, No. 6 in 1987) and The Ultimate Sin (No. 6, 1986). Osbourne was also the longtime frontman for Black Sabbath, which claimed two top 10s: 13 (No. 1 in 2013) and Master of Reality (No. 8, 1971).


	Jessie Murph achieves her first top 10 on the Billboard 200 as Sex Hysteria debuts at No. 8 with 44,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that figure, SEA units comprise 35,000 (equaling 48.23 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 10 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 9,000 (it debuts at No. 10 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


Sex Hysteria is the third-charted project for Murph on the Billboard 200, following That Ain't No Man That's the Devil (No. 24 in 2024) and Drowning (No. 162 in 2023). The new album was preceded by a pair of Hot 100 hits in “Blue Strips” (her highest-charted song and first top 20, hitting No. 15 in May) and “Touch Me Like a Gangster” (No. 56 in June).


Sex Hysteria was issued as a 13-song widely available digital download album, a 15-song version (widely available as a download and on streamers; it includes two additional tracks: “Donuts” with Gucci Mane and “Ain't But a Thing”) and a 15-song physical version (on CD and vinyl, with two additional tracks: “Ur a Bitch” and “No Chance”). The album was pressed on two vinyl variants (one signed by the artist) and two CD iterations (one signed).

	











	Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out falls 4-9 in its second week on the Billboard 200, earning 43,000 equivalent album units (down 63%).


	Closing out the top 10 is BTS' PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE (LIVE), debuting at No. 10. The act's first live album also marks its eighth top 10-charted project. The live set launches with 43,000 equivalent album units earned, with album sales comprising 36,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 5,000 (equaling 6.58 million on-demand official streams of its songs) and TEA units comprise 2,000. The album was issued as a standard 22-track project via streamers, and to purchase as a digital download and CD (across five variants, each containing branded collectible ephemera, some randomized). This is the second live album to reach the top 10 in 2025, following Taylor Swift's Lover: Live From Paris, which hit No. 2 in January.

	Following the animated return of Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s Dutch to the Predator franchise, the actor could soon reprise the role in a live-action capacity.


	During Friday's Predator: Badlands panel at Comic-Con, director Dan Trachtenberg teased the Hall H audience that he's planning to “cook up stuff for that guy” after a recent breakfast meeting with the Golden Globe-winning actor and former governor of California.


	Schwarzenegger starred in the original John McTiernan-helmed Predator (1987) as Major Alan ‘Dutch' Schaefer, who encounters the titular extraterrestrial with his paramilitary team during a rescue mission in a Central American rainforest.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Although the franchise has expanded to nine movies over the years—including two crossovers with the Alien franchise and the upcoming Badlands, premiering Nov. 7 in theaters—Schwarzenegger has yet to reprise his role.


	Following the release last month of the franchise's first animated installment, Predator: Killer of Killers, Trachtenberg debuted an epilogue scene from a new cut now streaming on Hulu, featuring Schwarzenegger's Dutch, Danny Glover‘s Lt. Mike Harrigan from Predator 2 (1990) and Amber Midthunder‘s Naru from Prey (2022), each in a floating coffin being carried by Predator warriors.


	Trachtenberg noted that he got Schwarzenegger's approval to use his likeness in the scene during their breakfast meeting.


	Marking Trachtenberg's third installment in the franchise after Prey and Killer of Killers, Predator: Badlands stars Elle Fanning in a story said to examine an unlikely allyship between her character, Thia, and a young Predator outcast from his clan on a remote planet.

So many iterations of Predator and the only good movie to this day is the first one.

No, dude, Predator 2 is awesome. 

“You can't see the eyes of da demon…until him come calling. This is dread, man. Truly dread.”

Most of them aren't great, but Prey absolutely rocked.

	One of Coldplay's concerts sparked a viral moment when a couple was caught having an affair during the “kiss cam” portion of the concert. We went to the streets of Beverly Hills to find out what people really think about what happened in that moment. 


	What do you think of Coldplay's affair couple? Let us know in the comments.


	Jerah Milligan:


	What's up, folks? It's your boy, Jerah Milligan, here. I'm in Beverly Hills talking to people about that Coldplay video. You know which one I'm talking about. You've seen it. The spicy one. Have you seen the Coldplay “cheating footage” is what we're calling it. 


	Guest 1:


	I certainly have. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	What did you think about it? 


	Guest 1:


	I thought it was really hilarious and also sad.


	Guest 2:


	They sold themselves out, absolutely, where he ducks down and waves his little hands. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	Bro, how you feel about the video? 


	Guest 3:


	[inaudible]


	Jerah Milligan:


	That's crazy. I saw it too. He saw it. 


	Guest 3:


	[inaudible]


	Jerah Milligan:


	What you is- Man, he said he got caught like that too on Hollywood Boulevard that's why he over here.


	Guest 4:


	Yeah I saw it. Actually, I'm from Brazil, and all Brazilians are talking about it. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	Have you seen the Coldplay video? 


	Guest 5:


	Coldplay video?


	Jerah Milligan:


	Yeah. The one that was the cheating with the couple? And it's like, the dudes hugging the woman, but they like, run away because he got caught cheating on camera. Look at that shot. 


	Guest 5:


	I have seen that, yeah. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	So tell me my man. Have you seen the Coldplay affair video? 


	Guest 5:


	I have now. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	What do you think about it?


	Guest 5:


	That's wild dude. Like, I don't know if you're gonna do something like that. Don't be silly.


	Jerah Milligan:


	And silly, you mean, don't be on camera. 


	Guest 5:


	Yeah, pretty much. 


	Jerah Milligan:


	What should they have done?

Donald Trump turned a press availability in Scotland that was supposed to be focused on a trade deal with the European Union into a long list of his personal grudges against windmills, the Jeffrey Epstein case, Democrats, and Gaza.


	Appearing alongside E.U. President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said the U.S. and E.U. have a “good chance” of reaching a trade deal. But he also addressed a wide range of topics, ranting so much that one reporter asked “why” he was in a “bad mood.”


	“Can I ask why you're in a bad mood? Was it a bad morning of golf?” the reporter asked.


	“No,” Trump said. “The golf was beautiful.”


	But while playing his round of golf at his Turnberry course (during which it appears he may have cheated), Trump caught sight of windmills he has long hated, having fought and lost a battle against their installation in the waters off his Scotland course. That could explain why he went on an extended anti-windmill rant on Sunday.


	“Today, I'm playing the best course I think in the world, Turnberry,” he said. “Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world. And I look over the horizon and I see nine windmills at the end of the 18th [hole]. I say, isn't that a shame?”

Trump: "Today, I'm playing the best course I think in the world. Turnberry. Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world. And I look over the horizon and I see 9 windmills at the end of the 18th. I say, isn't that a shame?" pic.twitter.com/5nkTxT4YDD


	Trump also resurfaced one of his false claims: that windmills cause whales to go crazy and die.


	“You have a certain place in the Massachusetts area that over the last 20 years had one or two whales wash ashore,” Trump said. “And over the last short period of time they had 18. OK? Because it's driving them loco. No, windmills will not happen in the United States.”

	











	“The other thing I say to Europe: We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They are killing us,” he said.


	In April 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy dispelled that misinformation. “As of now, there is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys,” the  agency wrote.

	Trump, who launched his political career on the unfounded conspiracy theory that former president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., also accused the Democrats of promoting “conspiracy theories and nonsense.”


	“One year ago, our country was dead… because of an incompetent president and incompetent Democrats,” he said, “All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense. If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer, so much easier — be very successful.”

	Trump at first tried to avoid the topic of Gaza. When asked, “What do the images of starving kids in Gaza make you feel?” he responded, “Well, it's terrible. People are stealing the food. I think Iran is acting up. Venezuela is acting up in a different way. They continue to send people that we rebuff to our border.”


	Asked again about food for Gaza and whether Israel should allow more food across the border, Trump whined that the U.S. has not been thanked for sending aid. 


	“You really want to at least have somebody say ‘Thank you!'” Trump said. “We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food to Gaza. And nobody acknowledged it. Nobody talks about it. And it makes you feel a little bad when you do that… Nobody gave but us, and nobody said, ‘Gee, thank you very much.' It'd be nice to at least have a thank you.”

	Israel has recently begun allowing food parcels to be air dropped into Gaza, but a recent drop injured at least 11 Palestinians when those aid pallets fell on top of tents where displaced people are living. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned last week that “conditions on the ground in Gaza are already catastrophic and deteriorating fast — with death, displacement and destruction continuing to be reported as a result of ongoing Israeli military operations. The starvation crisis is deepening across the Strip. Hunger and malnutrition increase the risk of illnesses that weaken the immune system, especially among women, children, older people, and those with disabilities or chronic diseases. The consequences can turn deadly fast.”

	











	But Trump appeared more worried about who hasn't thanked him for millions in food aid than starving Gazans.

	Trump claimed the U.S. sent $60 million in food aid a couple weeks ago, although the details are not clear. According to The Guardian, the U.S. sent a $30 million grant to the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has been associated with food distribution sites where the Israeli military has shot and killed hundreds of people seeking aid.


	“It was pushed through over the technical and ethical objections of career staff,” a source told the publication. Sources told The Guardian that GHF may be receiving $30 million per month from the U.S. to fund its operations in Gaza.


	When asked about the topic he is in Europe to address — tariffs — he said he would not budge on the proposed rate of 15 percent.

	“Can you do better than a 15% tariff rate for the EU?” a reporter asked.


	“Better meaning lower? No,” the president responded.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps has come in with an estimated $218M global opening. While this is lower than where we saw it yesterday, it remains above the pre-weekend projection, both worldwide and in terms of international box office. The latter landed at $100M, the top end of our pre-opening projection.


	The overseas debut is 13% ahead of Thunderbolts*, 11% ahead of Superman and 4% above Captain America: Brave New World in like-for-like markets at current rates. The Fantastic Four folks also scored the biggest superhero opening of 2025 in Mexico, the UK, France, Italy, Spain and the European and Latin American regions, as well as several smaller markets.

	The offshore take of $100M is about 46% of the global total. Normally, in this genre, we see overseas numbers much higher than domestic, but that's not been the case recently (see Superman‘s bow at 43% from overseas). Is it a sign of the times, or the properties, or other vagaries? Likely a mix of those, but Hollywood is also facing challenges in Asia.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We've known for a long while now that China is not the slam-dunk it once was, and that's factored into consideration. What's more worrying is that studio films are not always clicking amid local productions in other Asian markets. This weekend is perhaps an anomaly because there is a huge movie (Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle) in Japan and also a new local title in Korea (Omniscient Reader), but there's a rethink needed for audiences in the region.


	This is food for thought that we'll revisit, but speaking of a movie that's doing better domestically than overseas, Warner Bros' Superman has topped the half-billion milestone, now at $502.7M worldwide, including $213.2M from international.


	On the flipside, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth has topped $700M global ($718.4M), with a heftier overseas haul ($416.8M), while Apple Original Films's F1, via Warner Bros, has sped to $509.7M worldwide amid great holds, and with $344.1M coming from the international box office.

	











	Also of note, Sony and Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later has topped $150M worldwide, with $80M from international and $70M from domestic.


	MORE…


PREVIOUS, SATURDAY UPDATE: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps is on its way towards a global opening of $220M-$230M, which would place it ahead of the pre-weekend projection. Through Friday, the Matt Shakman-directed F4:FS has grossed an estimated $106.2M worldwide. 


Domestic is at $57M through Friday and is eyeing a full weekend bow of $120M-$125M. The international box office through Friday is $49.2M with the whole opening frame looking at $100M-$105M. 


	Friday openers overseas included Spain, China and Japan. As previously noted, China is just not playing ball – nor was it expected to. Japan and Korea have local movies on the high end.


	Latin America and Europe are leaning into the family.


	The Top 5 markets for The Fantastic Four: First Steps through Friday are as follows: Mexico ($6.2M), UK ($5.7M), France ($3.5M), Brazil ($2.6M) and Italy ($2.4M). 


	We'll have a full update on Sunday.


PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps kicked off overseas rollout on Wednesday, and through Thursday is in 44 material offshore markets. The international box office cume through Thursday is an estimated $27M. That includes No. 1 opening days across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.


	At this early stage in the proceedings, First Steps is estimated to be running 57% ahead of Captain America: Brave New World, 32% over Superman and 9% above Thunderbolts* in like-for-like markets and at current exchange rates. 


	As we noted in our global preview, the international box office launch projection for the Matt Shakman-directed Fantastic Four is $90M-$100M, with room for upside.


	The movie — starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner — has also helped propel The Walt Disney Studios past the $3B mark globally. When The Fantastic Four's domestic previews are factored in today, Dis will cross the milestone; the first studio to get there in 2025.


	The Top 5 overseas markets on First Steps through Thursday are Mexico ($4.1M), UK ($2.8M), France ($2.7M), Italy ($1.7M) and Brazil ($1.7M).


	On Wednesday, France logged the 3rd highest opening day of 2025, up 84% on Thunderbolts*, 80% ahead of Superman (+13% including previews), 57% over Captain America: Brave New World and 16% over Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.


Italy also had the 3rd best opening day of 2025, ahead of Superman (+111%), Captain America: Brave New World (+81%), Thunderbolts* (+63%) and Quantumania (+47%).


Netherlands gave the family the 2nd highest opening day of 2025, well above Superman (+122%), Captain America: Brave New World (+67%), and Thunderbolts* (+37%), as well as 5% ahead of Quantumania.


	Asia-Pacific saw strong market shares in Wednesday launches (89% Indonesia, 76% Philippines, 53% Hong Kong) and positive social reactions.


	On Thursday, majors joining the family included Mexico, UK, Brazil, Australia, Germany and Korea.


	As noted above, the Latin America bows were all No. 1s while the regional debut saw the 3rd highest opening day of the year. 


Mexico, which leads all overseas play after just one day, came in 97% ahead of Brave New World, 51% ahead of Superman and 3% ahead of Thunderbolts*. First Steps took 68% market share on Thursday. 

	











	Also on Thursday, the UK greeted F4:FS with the 2nd biggest opening day of summer 2025. While the movie came in below Superman (-23%), that film opened on a Friday. Germany's opening Thursday was 136% ahead of Superman. 


	In Australia on Thursday F4:FS had 60% market share and scored the biggest Marvel opening day of the year, landing 57% ahead of Thunderbolts* and 45% ahead of Captain America: Brave New World. Versus Superman, it was -2%/-46% (including/excluding previews), the latter having launched during school holidays. 


	In Korea, where F4:FS opened on Thursday to sidestep a new local title, the debut was, as expected, somewhat muted, but still a No. 1 start on the day. The cume there through Friday (Friday is not reflected in the international total above) is $1.04M.


	Markets that open today include China, Japan and Spain. China, as previously noted, is soft on superheroes (and soft overall) and Japan has some mega local titles in the mix – but we should see some good numbers out of Spain.


	We'll have more throughout the weekend.

Not that earth moving of a box office to be honest. Superhero movies in general are still coming too frequently.

Superhero fatigue is real.

Demon Slayer will be #1 in Japan for the next month or two. Worth saying its name specifically since it'll do a solid $500-600m or so globally with ease!

So, basically the same as Superman. Overperforming domestically, underperforming globally.

Fantastic movie.  Very good writing and characters.  It's a complete story with no flaws.

	As Beyoncé ended her latest tour, she returned to her Destiny's Child roots for a reunion with two of her ride-or-dies.


	During Saturday's final stop on her Cowboy Carter Tour in Las Vegas, the 35x Grammy winner brought out Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland for a performance of Bey's 2022 hit ‘Energy' and the tour's buzzy mute challenge.


	The trio entered to their 2000 single ‘Independent Women', strutting the stage to 2004's ‘Lose My Breath'. They also treated the audience to a medley of their songs that concluded with their 2001 pop culture anthem ‘Bootylicious'.

	“Give it up for Destiny's Child!” Beyoncé told the audience as Williams and Rowland exited the stage.

	











	Although Bey and Rowland previously reunited to support Williams during her Broadway run in the Death Becomes Her musical in November, this weekend marked their first time performing together since their surprise reunion at Coachella in 2018.

Last week on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Steve Buscemi — from… well, everything — revealed that long before he was famous, he often found himself in rooms with casting agents and directors unable to connect at all.

“I was always hot and cold,” Buscemi explained. “I never knew if I should wing it, cause sometimes I'd be good if I went in the room and I didn't really prepare. And then, the next time I'd do it, I would fail.”

And Buscemi has auditioned for the best of the best — including “Rain Man” filmmaker Barry Levinson when he was working on the 1987 movie “Tin Men.” He decided he had to “really prepare” for the meeting. “And I studied the sides, the script, and went in there and did my reading… did my audition, and he looked at me and went, ‘That was really good. That's really good, Steve. Alright. Let's do it again, but this time try it…' and he gave me a very specific note.”

Buscemi listen and took the note. He was ready for another try. “And then I read it again the exact same way I just did,” he chuckled. “There was this silence and we both just looked at each other. I think I even said, ‘That was the same, wasn't it?' And he said, ‘Yeah, it's OK, it's OK.' Needless to say, I did not get that part.”

 










Another time he auditioned for EGOT-winner Mike Nichols and casting director Juliet Taylor, even though he knew he had a conflict. “My agent at the time said, ‘No, no, no. Just go. When are you gonna have an opportunity to meet these people?” So off Bescemi went, and he killed it… but when he revealed he couldn't make the shooting dates, Taylor stared at him and said, “What is wrong with you?”

Of course, Buscemi has proven himself several times over — enough to impress the Emmys (he has one on eight nominations) — in such diverse projects as “Fargo,” “30 Rock,” “Reservoir Dogs,” and “Boardwalk Empire.” It's a resume that doesn't need regurgitating. He's become such a recognizable face, in fact, he can play himself on “The Studio” in a season that also had cameos from legends like Martin Scorsese and Charlize Theron, also playing themselves.

Buscemi is far from the only famous actor to struggle with an audition — even a now-A-lister like Hugh Jackman, who has since gone from Wolverine to “The Music Man,” bungled what might've been his big break: the Benjamin Bratt role in “Miss Congeniality” — an experienced he described as “humiliating.”

“No one knew X-Men yet. I was a nobody,” Jackson once told Variety, though in spite of his unknown status he had the opportunity to shoot his audition with Sandra Bullock. He recalled thinking, “‘Holy shit! She's amazing! And so quick and fast. I'm not even vaguely up to speed here.' I was pedaling as fast as I could, but I didn't know the script well enough.”

 










Years before her own series “Girls” made her a household name, Lena Dunham auditioned for Penny Marshall's 2001 film “Riding in Cars With Boys,” and it did not go well… though not in a traumatic way.

“When I was 12, I met Penny Marshall in a failed audition for a film, ‘Riding in Cars With Boys.' And that was really big for me,” Dunham related on “The Jess Cagle Show.” “I was treated actually really well. There was no cruelty. The only thing I'll say is I understand why I didn't get the role.

Dunham explained that Marshall asked each of the young performers to tell her their names, heights, where they were from, and… then… to smile. “And I said, I'm Lena, I'm from New York, and I don't smile on command.' And Penny Marshall said, ‘It's called acting, honey.'”

Dunham, now an experienced director (whose “Good Sex” is filming now with Natalie Portman, Meg Ryan, and Mark Ruffalo), now sees things Marshall's way. “The thing is, she was right,” Dunham said. “Would you hire an actor who is like I'm sorry, I can't smile on command?' The thing is, I'm with Penny on this one.”

You win some. You lose some. You learn some.

The superstar singer wrapped up her latest tour at Allegiant Stadium on July 26.

	Mitchell Peters



Destiny's Child returned for one unforgettable night.


	During the final stop of her Cowboy Carter Tour at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on Saturday (July 26), Beyoncé surprised fans by reuniting onstage with former group members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, marking their first performance together in seven years.


	“Destiny's Child, b—t!” Bey shouted to a roaring crowd after briefly disappearing from the stage, then returning with Rowland and Williams as their hit “Independent Women” began to play.

	











	The surprise reunion arrived during the Renaissance segment of the show, as the trio kicked off a medley of iconic hits with their 2004 hit “Lose My Breath,” a song they hadn't performed together since Beyoncé's Coachella headlining sets in 2018. They followed with Bey's 2022 Renaissance track “Energy” before closing with Destiny Child's 2001 anthem “Bootylicious,” marking the first time the three-piece had performed the hit live since their appearance at Beyoncé's Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2013.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After the show, Beyoncé took to Instagram to share a photo of herself smiling onstage with Rowland and Williams by her side. Rowland and Williams also posted snapshots from the iconic moment on their respective IG accounts. 


	Since their debut in 1997, Destiny's Child has cemented its status as one of the most successful and influential girl groups in music history. Although the trio officially disbanded in 2006, they reunited for high-profile performances at the 2013 Super Bowl and Beyoncé's Coachella headlining set in 2018. The group also reunited offstage in 2023, when former members LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett shared backstage snapshots from Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour.

	











	Throughout their chart-topping career, Destiny's Child has earned 10 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including four No. 1 singles: “Say My Name” (three weeks), “Independent Women, Part I” (11 weeks), “Bills, Bills, Bills” (one week), and “Bootylicious” (two weeks). On the Billboard 200, the group landed four top 10 albums, including the No. 1s Survivor (two weeks) and #1's (one week).


	In addition to Destiny's Child, Beyoncé's final Cowboy Carter Tour show on Saturday featured surprise appearances from Shaboozey — who joined her for a medley of “Sweet Honey Buckiin',” “Pure/Honey,” and “Summer Renaissance” — and her husband, Jay-Z, who performed “N—s in Paris” solo and teamed up with Beyoncé for “Crazy in Love.”


	“Don't ever ask permission for something that already belongs to you,” Beyoncé told the audience near the end of Saturday's show, according to Rolling Stone. “God bless you, drive home safe, thank you for tonight! Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this a reality. I'm so deeply grateful.”


	Attendees in the VIP section at the Las Vegas finale included Kris Jenner, Khloé Kardashian, Tyler Perry, and Oprah Winfrey, TMZ reports. 


	Bey's tour concluded after a series of high-profile stops in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, London, Paris, Houston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Las Vegas.

	While many in the late-night community are standing by Stephen Colbert, one veteran host has a different perspective.


Jay Leno recently commented on the political comedy of today's late-night hosts after The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was unceremoniously canceled at CBS, amid the network's dealings with Donald Trump.


	“I like to think that people come to a comedy show to kind of get away from the things, you know, the pressures of life, whatever it might be,” he told David Trulio, president and CEO of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. “I love political humor, don't get me wrong, but it's just what happens when people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Noting that he “never discussed” politics with close friend and frequent guest Rodney Dangerfield, Leno said, “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture. When I was with Rodney, it was always in the economy of words — get to the joke as quickly as possible.”


	Leno added, “Well, why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole [audience]? I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group, you know, or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support or whatever, but just do what's funny.”


	Meanwhile, Paramount is under fire for canceling The Late Show on the heels of the company's $16M settlement with Trump, which has been scrutinized as potential bribery by some lawmakers. Following Colbert's ongoing jokes at the president's expense, Trump has celebrated the talk show's demise.


	Leno hosted NBC's The Tonight Show from 1992 to 2014, with the exception of when he left to film his short-lived primetime talk show The Jay Leno Show from 2009 to 2010.

That explains why he was never funny. I watched a handful of episodes of his Tonight Show and couldn't stand it. Every time he asked a question of his guests, you could see it on his face, he had the joke written and was just waiting for them to stop talking so he could say some unfunny, obvious, banal quip to get a cheap laugh. Watch clips, you'll see. 

And yes, he made plenty of Clinton jokes but call out HIS president and, “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture…” Hypocrite. He was a magat mouthpiece before maga was a thing. Now he's just a tired old hack.

is he kidding? the dude ONLY mocked democrats. EVER. and he did it every night.

“…it was in the economy of words…getnto the joken as soon as possible.” (cue the dancing Judge Itos)

Nobody asked him. He's irrelevant.

	Sen. Markwayne Mullin tried to blame former President Barack Obama for Jeffrey Epstein‘s 2008 plea deal, despite Obama not being president at the time.


	Mullin made the comments while being interviewed by Jake Tapper on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. First, Tapper and Mullin debated over whether the attorney general has the ability to release documents related to the Epstein investigation, with Mullin insisting that only judges have the ability to make that information public and Tapper arguing that there is additional information that Attorney General Pam Bondi could — and has promised to — release, yet she has not done so.


	Then Mullin made a bizarre claim that Epstein struck a deal in Florida in 2009, under President Obama. But that is factually incorrect, as Tapper pointed out.


	“Remember there was a plea deal that was struck in 2009, way before I was in office, way before Trump was even considering it to be in office, way before Pam Bondi was office, way before Kash Patel was director,” Mullin said. “2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made underneath the Obama administration with Epstein, and that sweetheart has not been exposed.”

	











	“No, that's not right,” Tapper said. 

MULLIN: There was a sweetheart plea deal that was struck in 2009 under ObamaTAPPER: No. It was 2008. The US attorney was Alex Acosta. He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become Trump's secretary of laborM: Who was in office at the time?T: BushM: No. Obama was in officeTAPPER: Not true


	“It's not? Well, when was the case heard?” Mullin asked.


	“It was 2008… The U.S. attorney at the time was a guy named Alex Acosta,” Tapper said. “He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become President Trump's secretary of labor. It all took place in 2008.”

	











	“Who was in office at the time?” Mullin asked.


	“2008, George W. Bush,” Tapper said, reciting a well-known fact.


	But Mullin continued to insist on incorrect information.


	“No, 2009 is when the case came out, and it was — and Obama was in office at the time,” Mullin said.


	“It's not true. It's not true,” Tapper said.


	Mullin doubled down later in the interview.

Holy shit — Markwayne Mullin insists later in the interview again that Obama oversaw actually oversaw the sweetheart deal with Epstein, even after Tapper (accurately) fact-checked him. Yikes.


	“I will go back to what you're saying about it wasn't true,” Mullin said. “The case was sealed in 2009. That's absolutely true. It was heard in 2008. It was sealed in 2009.”

	Tapper is correct, and Mullin is wrong. An executive summary report of the Epstein case by the Justice Department states that in the summer of 2008, then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in which the billionaire pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. Because of the deal, instead of serving a possible life sentence, he was sentenced to 18 months in a work-release program followed by 12 months of house arrest. Epstein was then allowed to leave the minimum-security facility for 12 hours a day to work at a foundation he had incorporated. Epstein was released after serving less than 13 months. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender and make payments to his victims. According to the Justice Department, Epstein began serving his sentence in Oct. 2008, and a judge unsealed the non-prosecution agreement in Sept. 2009.

	A lead prosecutor in the investigation, Marie Villafana, said in 2020 that Epstein's sweetheart deal was an “injustice.”


	“That injustice, I believe, was the result of deep, implicit institutional biases that prevented me and the FBI agents who worked diligently on this case from holding Mr. Epstein accountable for his crimes,” Villafana said.

	“Superman is the best friend you could have,” Iggy Pop recently said, responding to the prominent use of “Punkrocker,” his 2006 collaboration with Teddybears, in the final scene of Superman — and he proved he meant it Saturday night by playing the formerly obscure track live for the first time ever. 


	The song, which has exploded on streaming services and gone viral on TikTok since the movie‘s release, concluded Pop's performance at Portland, Oregon's Project Pabst Festival. Pop dedicated the performance to Superman, according to a crowd member who posted video.


	The song's use in Superman ties in with a moment earlier in the movie when David Corenswet's Kal-El suggests, in a conversation with Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane, that kindness is “the real punk rock” — a line that writer/director James Gunn recently told Rolling Stone is “the point of the movie.” In the same interview, Gunn said that he had first encountered “Punkrocker” when it popped up via Spotify's algorithm, and that the song stuck with him.

	“And so when I wrote that line, I think I thought back to that song and knew that would really work well,” Gunn told Rolling Stone. “And I just liked how the ending juggled all these different pieces of the movie in a way where we showed that the real punk rock was him, his dad, all the way to the shot of the dad making the baby fly. He flies because of his parents.”

	The end credits of Superman also feature another punk moment, via a song by the Mighty Crabjoys, a fictional pop-punk band said to be among Clark Kent's childhood favorites. Gunn, a former rock musician, wrote “The Mighty Crabjoys Theme” with Foxy Shazam's Eric Nally. “I literally wrote that song and sang it into my phone the first thing in the morning,” says GUnn. “It took five minutes, and then Eric turned it into the fun song that it is.”

The writers and executives producers of “And Just Like That…” Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky were not exactly expecting the audience reaction when Lisa Todd Wexley's (Nicole Ari Parker) father died… for seemingly the second time. After all in the first season, Lisa literally said, “I was exactly the same when my father died last year.” In the current season, years later, her father (Billy Dee Williams) died again, and she attended the funeral. HBO quickly explained this time her real father died and before it was her stepfather, and Rottenberg and Zuritsky told THR that it was a sign of just how lower the viewers are.

“That was surprising to me,” Zuritsky said. “It's the close viewing, but that comes back to the relationship that people have with the show.”

“You want close viewers,” Rottenberg added. “We know our viewers are smart and paying attention, and you want that. Then sometimes, the thing that you wish people would pay attention to, they don't. You just never know. It's sort of like being a parent. You bring these children into the world and then you hope for the best. And then you're lucky enough, as we are, to have a big audience, a very passionate and expressive audience who is not afraid to express their feelings.”

 










It's funny to think that a couple decades ago, before social media drove a flutter of easily accessible and highly public discourse around any given series, that a slip-up (or an assumed slip-up) might not have even been noticed. Or, if it was noticed, few fans would've bothered to write a letter to the network.

As any true binge-watcher of classic television knows — and I guess TV‘s classical period is now just simply defined as pre-streaming — inconsistencies once happened the regular. Continuity, particular in episodic television, wasn't that important —especially it retconning helped facilitate a good guest spot or a new regular when a show goes south.

“The Golden Girls” is probably one of the worst offenders of the top tier of TV. Consider this: Dorothy and Stan had to get married right out of high school because Dorothy got pregnant with their daughter Kate, who appears to be 30-ish when we meet her in a 1985 episode. But Dorothy and Stan have been divorced for several years and were married for 38 years. Make that math work.

And how many kids did Blanche have? She lists five at one point, we do meet a couple (including one who gets recast on her second appearance). But how did she raise all those kids to then be an empty nester by the time the show started in 1985… and still have caused a supposed ruckus as a single woman at the 1964 Democratic Convention only 21 years prior?

 










But we can't just pick on our favorite Miami ladies. There's also “Family Matters,” who stole a page from the “Happy Days” playbook and deleted a child from the family after multiple seasons (Judy and Chuck, respectively). It's also extremely unclear as to when Tom and Lynette moved to Wisteria Lane in “Desperate Housewives.” Why did Topanga's parents keep getting recast on “Boy Meets World?” The “That 70's Show” timeline makes no sense. And on the dad subject, Dr. Frasier Crane's father was dead on “Cheers,” and very clearly alive on “Frasier.”

“Sex and the City” itself was inconsistent — I mean, why doesn't Carrie break the fourth wall like she did in the beginning?

The point is, if it matters, that even if “And Just Like That” really intended a retcon, there is plenty of precedent to rewrite a story point mid-series. We just didn't have the vast resources to notice in the olden days.

And what's a continuity error between friends? Or even on “Friends” (don't get me started on their shifting birthdays or the number of times Rachel met Chandler in flashback episodes).

	How much will it cost to renovate the Boeing 747-8 gifted by Qatar into the next Air Force One? That's classified information. But a recent $934 million transfer of funds to a Pentagon budget may hold a clue.


	The New York Times reported that this “transfer” to an unnamed classified project described in a Pentagon document sent to Capitol Hill likely includes the cost of renovating the gifted plane into a lavish gold-accented flying palace for President Trump. The funds were moved to a budget dedicated to updating America's ground-based nuclear missiles, and Air Force officials told the paper that at least some of the funds for the renovations will come from the nuclear modernization project.


	Making the project even more absurd, because the renovations will take one or two years to complete, Trump will only fly in the plane as president for a short time until he leaves office and the plane is ostensibly transferred to his presidential library in 2029 — at least that is what Trump has said will happen. (Unless, that is, Trump finds a way to extend his time in office beyond this four year term, as he has often hinted at, though that would be extremely unconstitutional.)

	











	Among the improvements to the plane are upgrades to its communications systems and engines as well as the addition of antimissile systems. Plus, U.S. intelligence will need to identify and remove any covert listening devices that Qatar may have embedded in the plane's walls. Finally, the plane will be treated to similar internal decor to the Oval Office, which Trump has outfitted with tacky gold accents.

	Trump pursued the gift from Qatar, he said, because Boeing is years behind schedule to deliver two new planes to serve as Air Force Ones, a project that has already cost $4 billion.


	Air Force Secretary Troy E. Meink testified to Congress in June about the cost to renovate the Qatar plane.


	“I think there has been a number thrown around on the order of $1 billion,” he said. “But a lot of those costs associated with that are costs that we'd have experienced anyway, we will just experience them early,” ahead of Boeing's scheduled delivery of its new Air Force Ones. “So it wouldn't be anywhere near that.”

	He added, “We believe the actual retrofit of that aircraft is probably less than $400 million.”


	But engineers and Air Force experts familiar with this kind of work shed doubt on that price tag, and members of Congress have voiced worries that Trump will want to use the plane quickly, and he will push the Air Force to complete the work before installing proper safety mechanisms.


	While the Pentagon will reveal the price to modernize America's ground-base nuclear missiles, it declined to share with the Times just how much the plane upgrades will cost.

	“The more we learn about this deal, the more disturbing it becomes,” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told the paper. “The security implications of accepting a private plane from a foreign nation as Air Force One and the resulting ethical concerns a gift of that sizes creates were already significant.”


	She also expressed concern that “this administration is diverting funds from the nuclear modernization budget to finance costly renovations to this plane,” which means the U.S. is “weakening our credibility to fund a vanity project for President Trump.”

The former 'Tonight Show' host took aim at partisan late-night shows in a recent interview: "Why shoot for just half an audience?"


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Jay Leno took aim at late-night hosts whose political humor appeals to only “half their audience” by making jokes targeting only one side of the ideological spectrum.


	The 75-year-old former Tonight Show host made the comments during a recent interview with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. While the interview was taped at least two weeks ago — likely before CBS made its shock announcement that it was canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on July 17 — the portion of the interview containing the late-night criticism was posted on YouTube last week and has been making the rounds this weekend due to recent headlines.

	David Trulio, the president and CEO of the foundation, kicked things off by noting to Leno that his jokes were equally balanced between mocking Democrats and Republicans. 


	“I got hate letters saying, ‘You and your Republican friends,' and another saying, ‘I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,” Leno says. “That's how you get a whole audience. Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.”


	Continued Leno: “Rodney Dangerfield and I were friends. I knew Rodney 40 years and I have no idea if he was a Democrat or Republican. We never discussed politics, we just discussed jokes. I like to think that people come to a comedy show to get away from the pressures of life. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.”

	











	Leno concluded by saying: “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group — or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what's funny.”


	Leno hosted The Tonight Show for 17 years across two separate stints, starting in 1999 and concluding in 2014. During that time, the NBC series was often the top-rated late-night show.


	CBS abruptly announced The Late Show would conclude in May 2026, and called the move a “financial decision.” But it came days after Colbert criticized the network for paying “a big fat bribe” to President Donald Trump in the form of a $16 million settlement over a 60 Minutes interview. Newsbusters, a right-wing media watchdog, claimed The Late Show has hosted 176 outwardly left-leaning guests since 2022 and only one Republican, and booked 43 left-leaning guests since the start of 2025.


	Other late-night hosts — including current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon — have rallied behind Colbert since the decision, with fellow talents working under parent company Paramount Global having been especially scathing. “What made you that money are shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid…” Stewart said. “If you believe — as corporations or as networks — that you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar … Why would anyone watch you?”

	The Supreme Court's right-wing supermajority helped put President Donald Trump back in office. Now it's letting him run rampant, often without even bothering to give us an explanation.


	In 17 straight cases — “an unprecedented number compared to every prior presidency,” according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck — the Supreme Court granted the Trump Justice Department's emergency requests, halting orders from lower courts that had temporarily blocked the administration's overreach. In doing so, the court has allowed the key planks of Trump's Project 2025 agenda to take effect.


	Some of the Trump 2.0 policies the high court has greenlit include:


	It would, however, be too simple to say the Supreme Court has rolled over because it's gone full MAGA — though that is quite true for at least a couple members of the Republican majority. The Roberts Court's capitulation is also an act of appeasement designed to preserve its power by avoiding confrontation with a would-be autocrat. 


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Chief Justice John Roberts has spent his two decades on the bench building up his court as the country's main policymaking and -breaking body of government. Yet the Roberts Court's landmark antidemocratic rulings unleashing money in politics, gutting the Voting Rights Act, and granting Trump sweeping criminal immunity for trying to overturn the 2020 election, all led directly to Trump 2.0.

	











	And within weeks of regaining power, Trump began attacking — and defying — judges who stood in the way of what he regarded as his electoral mandate to do whatever he wanted, Constitution be damned.

	At first, Roberts spoke out against Trump's calls to impeach lower court judges for daring to rule against him. In a statement, the chief justice wrote, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”


	But what seemed at the time like a rebuke now reads more like friendly advice, given how Trump has fared before the chief. 


	The appellate review process of Trump's authoritarian agenda has so far been anything but normal. Virtually all of Trump's wins have come on the Supreme Court's emergency — or “shadow” — docket, where the justices make decisions without the benefit of full briefing or oral argument and, often, provide no reasoning for their votes.


	Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's solicitude towards Trump on the shadow docket suggests Trump's attacks against lower court judges have influenced the votes of the members of the high court's right-wing supermajority that have not gone totally MAGA. To those justices — Roberts chief among them — Trump's ever-present threat of defiance has presented the Supreme Court with a choice: be a rubber stamp to appease Trump and preserve the prospect that he will obey future adverse rulings, or refuse to be a rubber stamp even just once and reveal just how illusory the court's power has always been.

	Chief Justice Roberts has chosen appeasement, and without any guarantee that Trump will honor the court's credit should the chief ever lead his colleagues in declaring Trump has gone too far.


	Indeed, the justices have already shied away from such a confrontation in the one Trump case the Supreme Court did move to the merits docket. Rather than resolve whether Trump's executive order attacking birthright citizenship is constitutional, the Roberts majority instead accepted the Trump DOJ's argument that the lower courts had no power to issue a universal injunction against the policy. The ruling only indefinitely delays the Supreme Court from ruling on the merits of the citizenship-stripping order while the lower courts wrestle with ancillary questions over the proper scope of potential relief. For all intents and purposes, the damage has been done.


	While the Roberts majority cowers from Trump to preserve its own relevance, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is calling her colleagues to account over the real-world effects of their capitulation. She's also showing us a path forward. 

	











	In a series of dissents at the end of this term, Justice Jackson all but accused the Roberts majority of being in the pocket of “moneyed interests” on the merits docket (i.e. in fully briefed and argued cases), and in Trump's pocket on the shadow docket, pointing to the “court's demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this president's legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.”


	In a series of posts on BlueSky, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) applauded Jackson for dispensing with the “collegiality” befitting “ordinary times.”


	“What if we are in a time when a billionaire-funded scheme has spent decades trying to pack the court with billionaire-agreeable justices, so as to “capture” the court in the sense of ‘regulatory capture' or ‘agency capture' — and what if the billionaires have finally succeeded,” Sen. Whitehouse asked in a series of rhetorical questions.


	And speaking to the Indianapolis Bar Association recently, Jackson said her separate opinions this term reflect her concerns about the state of our democracy. 


	“I'm really very interested in getting people to focus and to invest and to pay attention to what is happening in our country and in our government,” Jackson told the audience, according to a report from The New York Times.


	But Justice Jackson is doing more than calling out her colleagues. In separate opinion after separate opinion, she is also articulating a pro-democracy vision for a court that defers to the people, facilitates a truly representative and multiracial republic, and polices clear constitutional limits. 


	“[W]hen Congress speaks, courts should listen,” she wrote in an April concurrence. But, she's chronicled her colleagues' “aggrandizement of judicial power” while insisting on the courts' role to stop the executive branch's lawlessness. “The court has cleared a path for the executive to choose law-free action at this perilous moment for our Constitution,” she wrote in her dissent to June's birthright citizenship decision, “right when the judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints.”


	In other words, the Roberts majority makes stuff up to get in the way of the people's will and ignores clear constitutional and statutory commands to let Trump run rampant.


	That is exactly backwards. 

	











	We need a Supreme Court that — absent clear constitutional or statutory commands — gets out of the way of the people's will.

	While our current court charts a path of quiet appeasement, Justice Jackson is reminding us how to fight, boldly and unapologetically.

Suri Cruise, the only child of former couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, was spotted looking stunning as she strolled the streets of New York City on July 9, 2025. The 19-year-old wore a flowy low-rise skirt and cropped white tank top. She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag.

In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. The story says Suri's masterful use of interesting accessories elevates her basics to a level of street coolness. 

According to Hello! magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. “Of course, I will miss the close proximity, but I'm really proud of her and I'm happy,” the outlet says mom Katie Holmes told Town & Country about Suri's new chapter.

Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season.

“I can't wait to get back into a tank top. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. She also named “nice, simple slip dresses” as an essential. 

But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. “Wearing a glamorous dress to the ballet or opera makes me feel like I am the New York woman I dreamt of being when I was a little girl,” she told the “Fashion Bible.”

Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.”

The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans.

“JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters.

“You know you triggered an entire generation with this post,” teased another, before adding, “Cannot wait to see the project.”

A third fan quoted the show's famous line, “I remember everything,” and punctuated it with a crying emoji.

Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.

The team behind the all-star benefit concert addresses providing donors with a "transparent view into how FireAid is putting their dollars to work."

	Ashley Iasimone



FireAid, the all-star benefit concert event put on in January, raised $100 million for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts. On Saturday (July 26), the team behind the dual shows at L.A.'s Intuit Dome and Kia Forum released a statement in response to “misinformation being shared online” regarding funds distribution.


	The long list of performers at FireAid — which was livestreamed, and drew in more than 50 million viewers — included Green Day with Billie Eilish, Jelly Roll, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Olivia Rodrigo, Peso Pluma, Stevie Wonder, Lil Baby, Tate McRae, Sting, Alanis Morissette, Anderson .Paak with Dr. Dre and Sheila E, Dawes, John Mayer, a Nirvana reunion, Joni Mitchell, a reunited No Doubt, P!nk and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many others. Funds were raised from ticket and merchandise sales, sponsorships, donations from the public and private gifts.

	In February FireAid reported its first disbursement of funds in the amount of approximately $50 million, and in June the distribution of a second round of grants in the amount of $25 million. It's expected that the remaining $25 million will be distributed by the end of 2025.

	











	In a statement shared Saturday morning, organizers said, “There has been an increasing amount of misinformation being shared online about the distribution of FireAid funds. We want to address concerns and be certain that Angelenos and the thousands of donors who generously contributed have a transparent view into how FireAid is putting their dollars to work.”


	FireAid said the Los Angeles Times has reached out to more than 100 organizations that received funds to review the grants received and how the money was used, noting the publication “determined ‘FireAid was an urgent lifeline in the worst of the disaster and beyond.'”


	The $100 million raised helped survivors of the L.A. wildfires recover and rebuild, said FireAid, who reported partnering with area nonprofits that have the ability to directly reach people who found themselves in need of food stability, housing and more.


	“Each recipient is required to report on fund usage to ensure full transparency and impact,” said Saturday's statement. “The year-end results, which are due in December 2025, will be audited by FireAid's auditor, KPMG.”


	The FireAid website has a list of partners who've received grants — which is available at fireaidla.org/grants — and will continue to publish documentation of how funds are reaching people affected by wildfires in the L.A. region.


	“While there is much more work to do, the money raised through FireAid is delivering much needed assistance to as many people as possible,” said the note released on Saturday.

“I was about 200 meters from the incident, at Playa Grande, spending the day on vacation with my partner,” he recalled. “There were very few people on the beach, and the sea was rough.”

According to the outlet, the doctor heard people calling for help. “I ran to the area and entered the sea with my surfboard, heading into the rip current toward the person being pointed at by some beachgoers,” the doctor shared. 

He continued, “After a few minutes, I saw a shadow, dove down and pulled the person out.”

The doctor got back to the beach and found another man lying on the sand who was struggling to breathe. “[He was] just someone who tried to help during the emergency, without any rescue equipment,” the doctor noted.

He went on to describe the emergency personnel who arrived on scene. “Immediately, [first responders] began providing first aid to Malcolm, but he had no vital signs,” the doctor recalled. 

He added, “Two tourists ran over to help. They identified themselves as doctors, making a total of three physicians at the scene.”

Red Cross personnel arrived and used specialized equipment, including a defibrillator, but Warner did not respond. He was pronounced dead at the scene at age 54.

The other man was transported to a local medical clinic and was later released.

“The people who take part in this kind of rescue are always deeply affected,” the doctor shared. “You have to understand it's not easy, and it also takes time to heal.”

Elberth León, head of the Tourist Police for Costa Rica's Atlantic region, initially said Warner's 8-year-old daughter was in the water with him and was rescued, but new reports say otherwise.

Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) confirmed she was on the shore at the time of the incident, People reports.

“Mr. Warner was playing with his daughter at the seashore at one point. He then left her out of the water, and he and a friend of his entered the sea,” the statement read.

“It was at that moment that they were swept away by the current, and the friend managed to get out,” the statement noted. “However, Mr. Warner was unable to get out and was pulled out by several people on the beach. He received care from Red Cross officials, but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

The actor's cause of death was ruled “asphyxiation by submersion.”

Sky Hogan is mourning the loss of her husband, wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, after his death on Thursday, July 24. The 71-year-old WWE legend died of cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater Beach, Florida. In a heartfelt message posted to Instagram on Friday, Sky shared her devastation, writing, “My heart is in pieces.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Sky, who married the Hulkster in 2023, revealed that Hogan had been dealing with health issues, though she believed he would recover. “I had so much faith in his strength,” she wrote. “I thought we still had more time.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Reflecting on his unwavering commitment to his supporters, Sky described how much Hogan cherished his fans, even as his health declined.

“You meant everything to him,” she said. “He would have done anything for you.”

While fans around the world knew him as Hulk Hogan, Sky remembered him simply as Terry, the man she loved. “This loss is sudden and impossible to process. To the world, he was a legend… but to me, he was my Terry. My partner. My heart.”

In the months leading up to his passing, Hulk Hogan had undergone an intensive spinal procedure known as a four-level Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Fusion (ACDF). The May surgery, which impacted his spine, vocal cords, and breathing, left him in a fragile state, requiring frequent hospital visits as part of a long recovery.

His wife, Sky Daily, had previously addressed concerns about his health earlier this month, shutting down speculation about his condition. “His heart is strong, and there was never any lack of oxygen or brain damage,” she said at the time. “None of those rumors are true. He's been recovering from a major surgery with a long and layered healing process.”

Hulk Hogan, born Terry Bollea, died on Thursday, July 24, at 71. According to TMZ, the WWE Hall of Famer went into cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida.

Nintendo has always been weirdly cagey about the personal details of its most iconic characters—to the point that you have to catch one of the company's executives on a very good day if you want them to confirm something as simple as whether Mario is Italian, a plumber, or has the last name “Mario.” When it comes to actual romantic connections between its characters, the Japanese firm is even more uptight, something it displayed aggressively this week, when it reminded fans that its iconic turtle-killing problem solver and his favorite unelected head of state, Princess Peach, are just friends—all but daring the wider internet to go “Oh, yeah?”

Nintendo made the announcement through the normal public relations outlets, which is to say that it came as a daily tooltip on the company's weird Nintendo Today! digital calendar app that it launched back in March. Users were informed recently that “Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can,” which, when received in a normal brain, probably feels like a fairly anodyne statement. But we're talking about a fanbase that has done anatomical analyses on things like Mario's briefly glimpsed nipples, so suffice it to say historians were quick to comb through the evidence to try to refute this “good friends” slander. (Nintendo put out a Valentine's Day tweet a scant 15 years ago featuring the pair together, for instance, and referred to them as “Cutest Couple” in Mario Party 5. Also, Peach kisses Mario on the cheek or nose quite a lot, usually as a transactional reward for having rescued her—although it's worth noting that Super Mario Odyssey ends with her rejecting a marriage proposal from him and stranding him on the moon. So, y'know, mixed signals.)

Honestly, we get it: The folks in the Mario group of characters are, by design, pretty blank slates, designed to have little in the way of history or personality traits that would stop them from being dropped into new games and scenarios sans baggage. Establishing a canonical romance, even for its most obvious pairing, would get in the way of the characters' mix-and-match nature, and maybe screw with some of Nintendo's cherished “identify as the character” mentality. That being said, the only Nintendo fans who seem especially happy about the no-hook-ups ruling are the ones who were already ‘shipping these characters with someone else—the Peach/Daisy people have been eating well this weekend, from what we've seen on Bluesky—at least partly because it seems kind of disingenuous, given how much the pair have been depicted in such close proximity for so long. (It also feels weirdly timed, at a moment when video game marketplaces Steam and itch.io both announced that they were clamping down on games with sexual content or themes in order to appease credit card companies; Nintendo's never been at the forefront of sexuality in gaming, but there's still a mild vibe of “Hold our beer, our characters have never even kissed on the mouth” to the whole thing.)

We did, in our capacity as journalists, run a quick tags search on internet fan-fiction archive A03—kind of the “checking the dipstick” of gauging internet horniness for character pairings—this evening, and will note that Mario/Peach massively outranks any other duo we could think of. (And some we wish we hadn't; shout out to the 129 Luigi/Mario fics in the pile, and their let's say controversial definitions of brotherly love.) So there is at least some clear indication that a lot of people naturally slot the pair into coupledom. Anyway: Here's your regular reminder that Nintendo can never touch the erotic mindscapes inside your own head; if you want Mario and Peach to have been long-term monogamous for the last 40 years, drive yourself wild, friend.

Kelly Osbourne shared a touching moment with her late father Ozzy Osbourne in a clip she shared to social media on Saturday, July 26.

She took to her Instagram Stories to re-share a clip from his A&E show “Jack & Ozzy's World Detour.” The words, “One of the best Ozzy moments ever!” was written on top of the video. 

A post shared by Lily Kelsey (@weeniedogadventures)

The heartwarming clip showed Ozzy getting into a motorhome that his daughter was driving. She proceeded to tell him, “Morning, I got this song in my head I have to play it for you.”

Kelly Osbourne began to play the song “Paradise” by George Ezra. She started to sing along to it, and the two ended up having a brief jam session as it played. Both danced in unison as the song continued.

“I love you,” Kelly told her iconic father. He responded with, “I love you more.”

The 40-year-old previously took to her Instagram Story after Ozzy passed to express her sadness. 

Kelly posted the lyrics to the classic Black Sabbath song “Changes.” She previously recorded the song with her dad as a duet in 2003.

“I feel unhappy I am so sad. I lost the best friend I ever had,” Kelly wrote. She added a broken heart emoji.

The family released a statement about Ozzy Osbourne's passing on Tuesday, July 22. 

“It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the statement read. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”

It continued, “We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” The statement had the names of his wife Sharon Osbourne as well as four of his children, Jack, Kelly, Aimee and Louis.

Friends and fans have taken to social media to express their sadness over the tragic news.

Icon Jon Bon Jovi expressed his sadness for the Osbourne family on social media. “Much luv to Sharon and the beautiful Osbourne Family,” he wrote. “So sorry to hear of your loss. Rest easy Ozzy.”

Singer Elton John added how he lost a friend. “He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods — a true legend,” he shared on social media. “He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met.”

The rocker was 76 at the time of his death. Over the years, he was very open about his health struggles as he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Romijn is set to reprise her role as Mystique, a character she originated in 2000's ‘X-Men.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Rebecca Romijn is sharing an update on her return as Mystique in the highly-anticipated Avengers: Doomsday. 


	At The Hollywood Reporter's San Diego Comic-Con suite, the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds star admitted that she wasn't sure if she's finished filming for the forthcoming Marvel film because the script isn't fully complete.  




	“[I'm] not quite sure,” she said when asked if she was done shooting her scenes. “The script hasn't — they haven't finished writing it. It's been very, very fun, and we don't know yet. They keep everything very close to the vest themselves in an effort to keep everything under wraps.”

At THR's suite at #SDCC, #StarTrek: Strange New Worlds' Rebecca Romijn talks about what it was like returning to the role of 'Mystique' for #AvengersDoomsday pic.twitter.com/BTCNKcUmwS


	Romijn kept her lips sealed when asked if she's read the entire script, noting, “I cannot confirm nor deny that I have read the entire script.” She also admitted she “can't say” who she's filmed scenes alongside, but it was a “surreal” experience shooting with some of her original X-Men co-stars with a new, blended cast. 


	“It was very surreal to be with my old cast as well as a new cast. I had crazy dreams while I was there for a large chunk of shooting. Like, really kind of regressive dreams,” she shared. “It was very strange, my brain was really trying to organize. Like, wow, this is a character I played 25 years ago, 20 years ago. Yeah, [it was] very surreal.”


	The actress also shared what it was like revisiting the role of Mystique after nearly 20 years since she last portrayed the character in 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand. (Romijn made a brief cameo in 2011's X-Men: First Class.)

	











	“Oh, I know her very well. I went back in with full ownership of her. It was very nice to go back and play that character, ‘cause I had imposter syndrome in the very beginning,” she said. “I thought, maybe at the very beginning, I was just cast because I happened to be the model who was available to play Mystique at that moment. I mean, I auditioned and I got the role, because when you're very young, you're like, Do I deserve to be here? And I did not have that going back this time. It was a very different experience.” 


	Marvel revealed the Avengers: Doomsday cast in late March, which notably includes a string of actors from 20th Century Fox's X-Men universe. Joining Romijn from the inaugural 2000 film include Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto and James Marsden as Cyclops. The Traitors host Alan Cumming also returns as Nightcrawler, whom he played in X2: X-Men United, and Kelsey Grammer as Beast, from X-Men: The Last Stand.

	A civilian ship carrying aid to Palestinians in Gaza was intercepted by the Israeli military in international waters on Saturday, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirmed. 


	The Handala flotilla was carrying baby formula, diapers, food, and medicine. The passengers were detained and the cargo was seized. The coalition said the boat was intercepted “in international waters outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international maritime law.” 


	“Israel has no legal authority to detain international civilians aboard the Handala,” Ann Wright, a member of the Freedom Flotilla's steering committee, said in a statement. “This is not a matter of internal Israeli jurisdiction. These are foreign nationals operating under international law in international waters. Their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end.”


	This week, the United Nations' World Food Program said the famine in Gaza has reached “new and astonishing levels of desperation, with a third of the population not eating for multiple days in a row.” According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, there have been 40 hunger-related deaths this month. 

	











	More than 100 aid agencies and rights groups have warned of a “mass starvation” across Gaza. 


	“There is no one in Gaza now outside the scope of famine, not even myself,” Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, who leads the pediatric ward at Nasser Hospital in Gaza, told The New York Times. “I am speaking to you as a health official, but I, too, am searching for flour to feed my family.”

	











	There were 21 civilians from 12 countries on the flotilla, including Christian Smalls, the former president of the Amazon Labor Union; European Union Parliament member Emma Fourreau; human rights attorney Huwaida Arraf; and two Al Jazeera journalists. The crew members said they would go on hunger strike if they were to be abducted. 


	“Israeli officials have ignored the International Court of Justice's binding orders that require the facilitation of humanitarian access to Gaza,” the Freedom Flotilla Coalition said in a statement. “The continued attacks on peaceful civilian missions represent a grave violation of international law.”

	Arraf was among a group of activists who sought to travel on an aid flotilla to Gaza last spring, when the population was already considered to be at imminent risk of famine.


	“We can't sit by and let it happen,” Arraf told Rolling Stone at the time. “People have been marching in the millions around the world, and still our governments are not listening to the people. And so we're taking that protest to the sea and we're directly challenging Israel's closure policy — the siege, the blockade, which are unlawful.” 


	During that attempt, Turkish port authorities blocked the ships from leaving.


	Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has led a brutal siege on Gaza and a near-total blockade. 


	Israel has tightly restricted the flow of humanitarian aid, arguing that Hamas had been stealing aid provided through the U.N. According to a Times report on Saturday, military officials admitted that Israel had no proof for such claims. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the foreign aid bureau shuttered by President Donald Trump's administration, similarly found no evidence that Hamas was regularly stealing assistance to Gaza, according to ABC News. 


	In recent months, Israel has been accused, in several instances, of indiscriminately firing on Gazans attempting to get food at operations run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a recently created aid group backed by Israel and the Trump administration.

	Israel's military said Saturday it would begin airdropping aid into Gaza and implementing humanitarian pauses for the delivery of aid this weekend. However, the Israeli military has killed more than 1,000 people trying to get food since May, mainly near aid sites, according to the United Nations. 


	“This is a deliberate and human-made disaster,” Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, a charity working in Gaza, told NPR. “Those children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them.”

	In June, the Israeli military intercepted another humanitarian aid ship from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Among those captured were climate activist Greta Thunberg and European Parliament member Rima Hassan. Thunberg was deported the next day. Hassan spent three days in Israeli custody, including time in solitary confinement. 


	“Over the years, Israel has tried various methods to stop us,” Arraf, the human rights attorney, told Democracy Now on Friday. “It has been very violent, from attacking, beating, abducting, arresting, jailing and even killing our volunteers. In 2010, a flotilla that… I was on, Israel killed 10 of our volunteers. But that did not stop us. And it's not going to stop us now.”

The series finale of Supernatural was divisive for many reasons, ranging from Dean's anticlimactic death via rebar to a shortage of familiar faces in the very last episode ever. Even as the 2025 TV schedule continues with Jensen Ackles starring in Prime Video's Countdown and Jared Padalecki set to appear in the upcoming season of The Boys, fans of their CW show surely still want to know: who was the blurry woman who Sam married and had a son with in the finale flash-forward? Showrunner Andrew Dabb shared his thoughts, nearly five years later, and they don't quite match what Padalecki has said.

Short of Supernatural getting a Buffy-esque revival, we may never have a canonical answer, but I was among the viewers back in late 2020 who just wanted to know if the woman who was Sam's wife was supposed to be Eileen, played by Shoshannah Stern. Was she a random brunette who we'd never met before but Sam met and married after Dean's death? Or was she supposed to be Eileen, but the show just couldn't get her back to film the finale under 2020 COVID-19 guidelines? Well, showrunner Andrew Dabb weighed in, with Swooon reporting his comments:

We wanted someone there, so it wasn't like there was no female presence at all. But at the same time, do you cast someone totally brand new that the audience will have not seen before? Or do you keep it a little vague and people can imply whatever they want to imply?

While that initial answer was just about as vague as the face of Sam's blurry wife in the Season 15 finale, Dabb went on to note that the “logistical challenge of bringing a lot of people in, being the first show up during COVID, was just not feasible on our end.” Considering that Supernatural didn't even bring in Misha Collins – arguably the third lead of the series – for the finale, I can understand why even some of the most important guest stars couldn't make the cut. I don't love it, but I get it!

Dabb had even shared the original vision for Sam and Dean's endings that would have featured a lot of familiar faces. Still, he has a take of his own, even if the episode will never deliver the answers fans want about Eileen as Sam's wife (or not). He said:

People can fill in whatever they want, and they're free to. But certainly in my mind, that's what we were building toward.

Andrew Dabb's take? That blurry woman who married Sam and became the mother to young Dean was Eileen, as a natural extension of where Season 15 had been leading with them. Jared Padalecki just had a different take when asked about his character's wife.

The Supernatural co-lead was asked about the identity of Sam's spouse a few months after the finale aired, so the mystery was a lot fresher to the episode than Andrew Dabb weighing in circa 2025. Padalecki told Variety that no version of the script included an identity of who Sam ended up with after Dean's death, so he had no more details than what we saw: a brunette woman blurred out from a distance. He said:

I think it was very, very purposely ambiguous and strangely I agreed with that. I feel like a lot of what Sam did after Dean died was almost in honor of what Dean would have wanted, and Dean would not have wanted his little brother to marry Eileen, Ruby, someone in the life.

I feel comfortable saying that Dean definitely wouldn't have wanted Sam to marry Ruby even if she was still around, but it's a little harder to swallow the idea of him objecting to Eileen just because she was still in “the life.” Sam's feelings for her in Season 15 were very real and apparent, and Dean would have wanted his brother to be happy.

Still, Padalecki is the man who played Sam Winchester for more than 300 episodes over fifteen seasons, so he obviously knows his character. Plus, his speculation is no more canonical than Andrew Dabb saying that he believed in an endgame for Sam and Eileen. Besides, who's to say whether or not Padalecki still feels the same way these days?

I'd say that the gist is that fans can believe what they want to believe. And really, is that anything new for the Supernatural fandom? Surely I'm not the only one who just overlooks certain episodes for the sake of enjoying the whole!

The cancellation of The Winchesters after only one season highlights the one big mistake Supernatural season 16 must avoid. Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons on the CW, following the cross-country adventures of monster-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester.

Finally coming to a conclusion in 2020, Supernatural's devastating finale that left fans divided. Not long after the show ended, fans began speculating about how the story of the Winchester brothers could continue. Before long, news broke about a prequel spin-off titled The Winchesters, executive produced by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danneel.

The Winchesters was set to tell the story of John (Drake Rodger) and Mary (Meg Donnelly) Winchester, chronicling how they met and fell in love. Based on the trailers, the show initially appeared to contradict what Supernatural had already revealed about the Winchester parents, which didn't exactly set the show up for success.

 The Winchesters season 1 finale revealed that the entire season had taken place in an alternate universe, but many viewers had already given up on the series. Without Sam and Dean, The Winchesters simply didn't click with audiences, and a future continuation or spin-off of Supernatural must avoid this mistake.

Fans have been hoping that Supernatural season 16 will happen for a long time, and this unexpected plot twist in a spinoff series could be the key.

While I enjoyed The Winchesters for what it was, the show never captured the same magic that kept Supernatural on the air for 15 seasons. The Winchesters' failure to connect with audiences proves that a Supernatural spin-off or reboot won't work without Sam and Dean Winchester.

Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki became so great at portraying the Winchester brothers that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the roles. Thankfully, both actors have expressed an interest in returning, as has Misha Collins as Castiel.

Whether Sam and Dean were hunting ghosts or taking on the Devil himself, they almost always did it together. Their dynamic made even the weakest episodes of Supernatural worth watching, and that absence was sorely felt on The Winchesters. While many of the spin-off's characters were interesting, they did not have the same presence as Sam and Dean.

The failure of The Winchesters (as well as the earlier attempted Supernatural spin-off, Bloodlines) proves that a future Supernatural reboot cannot focus on new characters. If Supernatural ever continues, and I sincerely hope that it does, it simply must have Sam and Dean at its center.

With its killer soundtrack of classic rock hits, Supernatural provided the perfect background music for the epic saga of Sam and Dean Winchester.

Supernatural developed a complex and compelling mythology throughout its fifteen seasons, but it always kept the focus on the Winchester brothers. While a Supernatural reboot would certainly introduce some new characters, the series must, at its heart, be about Sam and Dean.

The few Supernatural episodes that focus on other, previously unknown characters, like "Bitten" and "Bloodlines," are often regarded as some of the series' worst (or at least most polarizing) episodes.

Jared Padalecki as Sam, Jensen Ackles as Dean, and Misha Collins as Castiel are the main reasons Supernatural developed such a passionate fan base throughout its 15 seasons. Even if a future series managed to capture Supernatural's unique blend of horror, humor, and heart, I cannot help thinking it would all feel empty without Sam and Dean Winchester.

Complaint comes as Trump administration faces pressure over Epstein files scandal

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Donald Trump, who has regularly indulged in conspiracy theories alongside his supporters during his rise to power, complained on Sunday that it's Democrats that are too focused on conspiracy theories.

Trump, whose administration is under scrutiny over its handling of Jeffrey Epstein investigations, claimed that “all they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense.”

“If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer,” the president said during a meeting in Scotland on Sunday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump himself has long employed conspiracies as a candidate and then president, from becoming one of the leading proponents of the Obama birther conspiracy to playing into his supporters' fixation with the QAnon movement. 

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump continued this trend, latching onto a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets.

Now, after years of courting conspiracy theories about his opponents, the spotlight has turned on Trump over Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a federal trial on sex trafficking charges 

The administration's handling of materials related to Epstein investigations — disclosing an initial tranche of information that was mostly already public earlier this year, then suggesting it would not provide further releases, even as recent reporting further highlighted Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier — has driven a rare wedge between Trump and his base.

The Epstein scandal has also provided ammunition to Democrats to scrutinize the president.

Pressure reached such a fever pitch that House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress off to its summer recess early, temporarily averting a bipartisan push to release more Epstein files.

Despite Trump's protests, the issue doesn't look set to settle anytime soon, after Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, was subpoenaed to testify in Congress and gave an interview to the Department of Justice.

Amid continued furor over the Epstein case, the Trump administration has asked a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the alleged trafficker while opposing Maxwell's bid at the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. 

The Epstein saga appears set to continue, as does Trump and his allies' insistence that conspiracies are at work to thwart the MAGA movement.

The president has taken to describing the 2016 investigations into whether Russia collaborated with this presidential campaign as a “coup” orchestrated by Barack Obama, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the former president to face criminal charges for the “treasonous conspiracy.”

Obama's office has called the claims a “ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”

Complaint comes as Trump administration faces pressure over Epstein files scandal

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Donald Trump, who has regularly indulged in conspiracy theories alongside his supporters during his rise to power, complained on Sunday that Democrats are too focused on conspiracy theories, as fallout for the administration continues over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

“All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense,” Trump said during a meeting in Scotland with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer."

Trump himself has long employed conspiracies as a candidate and then president, from becoming one of the leading proponents of the Obama birther conspiracy, to playing into his supporters' fixation with the QAnon movement. 

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump continued this trend, latching onto a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets.

Now, after years of courting conspiracies about his opponents, the spotlight has turned on Trump over Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a federal trial on sex trafficking charges. 

The administration's handling of materials related to Epstein investigations — disclosing an initial tranche of information that was mostly already public earlier this year, then suggesting it would not provide further releases, even as recent reporting further highlighted Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier — has driven a rare wedge between Trump and his base.

The Epstein scandal has also provided ammunition to Democrats to scrutinize the president.

Pressure reached such a fever pitch that House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress off to its summer recess early, temporarily averting a bipartisan push to release more Epstein files.

Despite Trump's protests, the issue doesn't look set to settle anytime soon, after Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, was subpoenaed to testify in Congress and gave an interview to the Justice Department.

Amid continued furor over the Epstein case, the Trump administration has asked a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the alleged trafficker, while opposing Maxwell's bid at the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. 

The Epstein saga appears set to continue, as does Trump and his allies' insistence that conspiracies are at work to thwart the MAGA movement.

The president has taken to describing the 2016 investigations into whether Russia collaborated with this presidential campaign as a “coup” orchestrated by Barack Obama, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the former president to face criminal charges for the “treasonous conspiracy.”

(Obama's office has said the claims are a “ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”)

A decade ago, actor/director Matt Cohen and his filmmaking partner Sean Flanagan had an idea to make an animated comedy series about a group of over-the-hill legendary characters hanging out in a Cheers-like bar called Public Domain. “The regulars at this Hollywood watering hole were all once famous characters that have fallen into the public domain,” says Cohen, who played young John Winchester on Supernatural and directed the final-season episode “Give Me Shelter.”

“They drink together and wait for the opportunity to be rediscovered, and rebooted by Tinseltown,” Cohen explains. “We've never asked the question, when life gets hard, where do they go and how do they deal with it? It's essentially the look at every actor in Hollywood told by a favorite animated character. We'll see what they're doing in their 40s-60s, post their Hollywood careers.”

According to Cohen, there are about “200 public domain characters that audiences will recognize. It's going to feel a lot like an animated Cheers, but with characters you know and love from your favorite shows and the shows that you share with your children.”

Nathan Milburn

To voice the characters, Cohen reached out “to the circle of talent that I know and love like siblings,” he says, “the Supernatural family.” Nearly every role is played by a former cast member. Among them: Jake Abel (voicing Hercules), Jim Beaver (Sidney Sam), Rob Benedict (Kaulu), Briana Buckmaster (Dorothy Gale), Ruth Connell (Peter Pan's Wendy Darling), Adam Fergus (Sherlock Holmes), Gil McKinney (The Mad Hatter), and Richard Speight Jr. (Quasimodo). “Working together and offering feedback is how the Supernatural family always shined.”

“This is a funny comedy and it's really a good time,” Cohen notes. (It's also an adult comedy with risqué lines and scenarios.) “When you get up from the couch after finishing the pilot and Louden Swain band's front man Rob Benedict's song is heard over the credits, you're going to feel wrapped in a warm hug and you'll want to go smile at one of your friends and tell them about it.”

Fans helped finance the pilot, which will be available free on YouTube in August. (A cut arrived on YouTube in July.) Hoping the show will get picked up by a streamer, the creators have 100-plus episodes ready to go — including ones in which Quasimodo and the Little Mermaid (voiced by Cohen's wife, Mandy Musgrave) fall in love, and the Phantom of the Opera and Hercules “figure out to how to jump rope.”

Cohen voices the series' only original character, Shep Salazar, “a washed-up child actor trying to run the bar and control all these hooligans,” he says. Bottoms up!

Since the Pokémon world's debut in the late '90s, there have always been several Pokémon that are considered to be adorable. In the meantime, there are many Pokémon who have had shockingly somber storylines in the games, manga or anime. Some of these Pokémon who have had tragic stories have also fallen into the roster of Pokémon considered to be cute, such as Chimchar and Charmander.

Another Pokémon that is often considered to be adorable among fans, and which has also been part of several tragic stories in the Pokémon media, is the Psychic-type Pokémon Espurr. According to the Pokédex, this feline Pokémon already has quite a lot on its plate, as it is always trying to control its immense powers. However, in not one, but two different stories in the Pokémon world, the Restraint Pokémon is shown to deal with even more obstacles, ones that continue to haunt fans.

Although the Pokémon franchise is great for fans of any age, many of the storylines present in the anime can be rather gruesome.

Espurr, the Restraint Pokémon, was introduced in Generation VI, as one of the brand-new Pokémon created for the Kalos region. A pure Psychic-type Pokémon, Espurr is usually a shade of pale violet, with lavender eyes and white paws, alongside folded ears that are white at the ends. Espurr's Shiny form, in the meantime, has the same small details, though its fur is a shade of light pink instead of violet.

The small Psychic-type Pokémon is usually seen with an expressionless face, as it is desperately trying to restrain its psychic powers, which are too powerful for it to handle. If Espurr did not work so hard to control its powers, then a great blast of psychic energy would strike everything around three hundred feet of the Restraint Pokémon, according to its Pokédex entry in Pokémon Alpha Sapphire.

The intelligent Psychic-type showcases some of the most distinctive designs in the franchise, with different demeanors to match.

When Espurr evolves at level 25, it will evolve into Meowstic, the Constraint Pokémon. Just like its prior evolution, Meowstic also must work hard to keep its powers at bay, lest a great amount of psychic energy cause unexpected chaos. However, compared to Espurr, Meowstic appears to have a better grasp on how to deal with its powers, though they are certainly still immense. A Meowstic's appearance upon evolving depends on its gender, though both work with a similar color palette.

For instance, a male Meowstic is mainly a shade of dark blue, with white accents and teal eyes. Meanwhile, a female Meowstic has white fur, with blue accents and bright yellow eyes. In battle, a male Meowstic mainly depends on defensive moves, trying its best to also help its allies during battle. However, a female Meowstic is known to be more aggressive, and is not afraid to use most of its power to use intense offensive moves.

The Psychic-type feline Pokémon debuted in Pokémon the Series: XY, in the episode "Seeking Shelter from the Storm!", where the story takes place in a seemingly abandoned mansion. During a sudden storm, Ash and his friends enter the mansion, not aware that Team Rocket has also decided to remain there until the rain stops.

As such, each group believes that the other is a horde of ghosts, constantly making the others scream in surprise. In the meantime, a lone Espurr is revealed to be responsible for the odd happenings at the mansion, and it wishes for the newcomers to leave its home. Thanks to Meowth, everyone is able to figure out why Espurr wants to protect its home so much.

The world of Pokémon has many wonderful creatures based on real-life animals, and the roster of feline Pokémon is undoubtedly cute and cool.

In the past, Espurr was taken in by a kind older woman named Lacy, who also let Espurr hold onto a pendant that she once received from her husband. However, when Espurr went to visit Lacy in order to return her pendant, the mansion's owner was nowhere to be found. As such, Espurr vowed to protect its dear friend's home, as it awaited the day Lacy would return. Sadly, the group would later learn from Lacy's granddaughter, Elise, that Lacy had passed away.

Elise promised that she would stay at the mansion and renovate it, and that the Restraint Pokémon was welcome to visit anytime it wanted. The new owner also said she would take Espurr to Lacy's grave, where it could truly say goodbye. The Pokémon world is no stranger to dealing with complex subjects such as death, yet this episode is certainly one of the most somber and bittersweet ones on the roster.

Though its debut episode in the Pokémon the Series: XY anime arc was certainly impactful, the storyline that truly made Espurr one of the most haunting Pokémon in the Kalos Pokédex was its role in the original Generation VI games. During the post-game in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, the player character crosses paths with Looker, a detective investigating the many villainous teams in the Pokémon world. In Generation VI, he sets up the Looker Bureau in order to look into Team Flare and their whereabouts in the Kalos region.

In one such case, Looker and the player discover a young orphan named Emma, who is often shown alongside her Espurr friend, nicknamed "Mimi". Looker thus invites Emma to live at the Looker Bureau, where she can work as his assistant. While she is learning from Looker, Emma begins to worry that she is a financial burden on him and the Looker Bureau. Though Looker tells her she is absolutely not, Emma still decides to find some part-time work in order to help him.

However, the café that Emma decides to work at turns out to be the Lysandre Café, where she is met by Xerosic, a lead scientist for Team Flare. Xerosic has created a new invention called the Expansion Suit, which grants the wearer the ability to change their appearance alongside superhuman strength and combat abilities. Xerosic tricks Emma into becoming a test subject for the Expansion Suit, using a remote to control her actions while she is unconscious. While she is in this state, Xerosic has Emma, working under the codename "Essentia", steal the Pokémon from unsuspecting Trainers.

In its 28+ year history, Pokémon has brought players many unique and interesting female characters, including Officer Jenny.

Upon waking up, Emma has no memory of the actions she committed as Essentia. Looker soon learns about this new figure in Kalos, and starts to investigate alongside the player and Mimi. It is Mimi who discovers that Essentia is truly Emma, though as she is being controlled by Xerosic, she has no memory of her friends and is programmed only to fight. Essentia thus tries to attack Mimi, but ultimately injures Looker instead, all while the suit begins to malfunction. In the Pokémon Generations episode "The Investigation", Essentia actually kicks Mimi away, a shocking moment that continues to haunt fans today.

In the end, Looker is able to confront Xerosic, and Emma is freed from Team Flare's control. However, she also becomes the owner of the Pokémon left behind by Xerosic, who bonded with her during her time working for Xerosic. Emma is also given the Essentia suit to control, now without a mind-controlling remote. After Looker leaves the region and makes Emma the new head of the detective agency, the player can battle against Emma on certain days, matches where she will wear the Expansion Suit and use the Pokémon given to her by Xerosic.

Emma and Mimi will return to the franchise in the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which appears to take place some time after the events of Pokémon X and Pokémon Y. In the game, Emma is still acting as the head of the Looker Bureau, with Mimi and their other Pokémon friends alongside her. However, Emma now has a Key Stone, allowing her to Mega Evolve Pokémon from her roster. Although Emma and Mimi appear to have happier lives in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, one cannot help but reflect on their story in Generation VI, and how it nearly ended in tragedy.

Expanding across a multitude of media, including TCGs, video games, manga, live-action movies and anime, the Pokémon franchise is set in a shared world of humans and creatures with a wide variety of special abilities.

Pokémon Y does not often get the praise it deserves. With Pokémon Y, the franchise was embarked on a new journey that would take place on the 3DS. The 3DS offered new avenues of graphic improvement and boy were fans in for a treat. The sixth generation takes place in the Kalos region, which is inspired by France. In terms of plot, Y does not do much to change the Pokémon formula. However, Y does offer new gameplay experiences.With this installment, we are introduced to the concept of Mega Evolutions. This is a perfect example of Game Freak shaking up the system without deviating from its tradition. Mega Evolutions were a huge hit. Pokémon who could access Mega Evolution would transform in appearance mid battle. They would also be on the receiving end of a drastic boost in the stats department. Not only was the move executed brilliantly from an artistic standpoint but it also seamlessly impacted the game's strategy. In addition, for the first time in history it seemed like nobody had an issue with the game's graphics. Much of this had to do with the long awaited debut of 3D animations on the 3DS. Pokémon games had a history of being underdeveloped in the graphics department. Pokémon Y finally harnessed all the raw power of the handheld device that operated the game. Towns, gyms and battles all oozed personality by displaying vibrant colors and animations. It's a shame that in terms of plot and story progression of Y sees the Pokémon franchise revert to old habits. This is extremely upsetting considering its predecessor in Black and White provided the best narrative to transpire in a Pokémon game.

Decades after the Dragon Pokemon's debut in Generation I, Dragonite is set to receive a new Mega Evolution in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.

These surprising facts will make you question what you thought you knew about the iconic Big Three anime: Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach.

Although Takopi's Original Sin isn't quite as popular as Solo Leveling or One Piece, it's already proven to be even more entertaining.

Solo Leveling's Sung Jinwoo has reached yet another new level of strength by way of Ragnarok's final chapters, and it makes Goku look like a joke.

While Dragon Ball is beloved, it isn't without problems.

There are many debates as to what anime should have won Anime of the Year, but the answer is clear.

The Strange Phenomena Investigations will use the CE5 method to contact unidentified aerial phenomena using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month.

A team of UFO researchers has planned to use a technique to invite extraterrestrial spacecraft to Dechmont Woods in Scotland's West Lothian later this month. The controversial technique known as Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) will be led by the paranormal researcher Malcolm Robinson.

The Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) method involves group meditation, telepathic intention, and sound recordings designed to encourage peaceful contact with unidentified aerial phenomena. The site where the technique will be involved had already witnessed extraterrestrial spacecraft in 1979, which marks one of the UK's most famous close encounter incidents.

The UFO experience was first reported by forestry worker Bob Taylor, who encountered a dome-shaped craft and was physically dragged by spiked objects, leaving him with torn clothing and minor injuries. However, the incident remained unexplained, as the official investigation by the police labelled the attack as a potential assault.

Meanwhile, Malcolm Robinson expects that the plan could work, as participants witnessed “flashing lights” during a trial run. “We are trying to bring any off-world craft into our airspace. There is a desire to bring forward these objects, which people claim to be UFOs or UAPs. The meditation will send out a desire for open contact," Robinson said, The Scottish Sun reported.

“In the background, we play these special sound effects, which help to enhance the mood but also the meditative process. It all sounds very airy-fairy, I get that, but this has been tried successfully all over the world," he added.

This method is known as the Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind protocol, which was developed by Dr. Steven Greer, founder of the Centre for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

Through this process, the Strange Phenomena Investigations will try to communicate using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month.
