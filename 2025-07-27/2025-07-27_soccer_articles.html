The player union FIFPRO, working with 72 players unions worldwide, and the worldwide governing body FIFA are now in an open fight, hurling insults in competing interviews and news releases. ‚óè On Wednesday, FIFPRO head Sergio Marchi (ARG) told The Athletic in a striking interview: [Gianni] Infantino lives in his own world, the only thing that matters to him are these grand spectacles.‚Äù Marchi has been campaigning for better defined player rest periods between club play, national team matches and exhibitions and most recently, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. ‚ÄúIt's perverse to schedule matches at noon in that kind of heat. ‚ÄúWe're in the 21st century and thousands of players still go unpaid. ‚ÄúIt was announced that tickets for the World Cup are now going on sale, millions will surely be sold, according to the [FIFA] president, who says it will generate over three billion dollars in revenue. Yet I'll say it again: There are still footballers who haven't been paid their salaries for two, three, even four years. ‚ÄúMost of the time players are afraid speaking up could hurt their careers. ‚ÄúFIFPRO expressed its deepening concern over the way FIFA is currently managing global football. ‚ÄúAt the same time, FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players ‚Äì rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance. FIFA was hardly silent, responding with an exceedingly blunt statement, that included: ‚óè ‚ÄúFIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPRO leadership as this approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles ‚Äì which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests.‚Äù ‚óè ‚ÄúOn Saturday, 12 July 2025, following a protracted period of unsuccessful efforts to bring FIFPRO to the table in an environment of non-hostility and respectful, progressive dialogue, FIFA convened with multiple player unions in New York, United States, to announce and reaffirm concrete, progressive measures designed specifically to protect the physical and mental wellbeing of players worldwide.‚Äù ‚óè ‚ÄúThese concrete measures go beyond what FIFPRO has been pretending to be asking for, and FIFA is extremely surprised by their leadership's reaction. That filing, based on the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, is still pending and there might not be any movement until that case moves forward or is stopped. ‚òÖ Sign up a friend to receive the TSX Recap by clicking here. ‚òÖ Please consider a donation here to keep this site going.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monste Tom√©, the head coach of Spain's women's national team, has continued where predecessor Jorge Vilda left off in her two years in the job, leading La Roja to the final of Euro 2025 less than two years after their 2023 FIFA World Cup victory. Vilda was relieved of his duties amid an unsavory episode involving former Spanish Soccer Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales, who kissed striker Jenni Hermoso on the lips following Spain's World Cup final victory over England. Tom√©, who had been Vilda's assistant coach since earning her UEFA Pro licence in 2018, had been the clear candidate to take the reins. A former player with Oviedo Moderno, Barcelona and Levante, she was a Spanish league champion on two occasions and was capped four times by Spain. However, she could not resist the lure of her lifelong passion and, after securing her coaching badges, she returned to soccer as Vilda's Spain assistant. The demands of job sharing proved too great, though, and she later made way for Kenio Gonzalo as Under-17s boss, allowing her to focus on the top team. ‚Ä¢ Pride in becoming Spain manager‚Ä¢ Challenges naming an international squad‚Ä¢ Importance of analysts having a panoramic view‚Ä¢ Winning the Nations League in SevilleSpain women's national-team manager Montse Tom√©'s long read‚Ä¶ üá™üá∏üìú As Vilda's chief assistant, Tom√©'s analytical abilities made her a key part of his coaching staff. What's more, despite her connection to the highly unpopular former head coach, she has an excellent relationship with the players. After the World Cup victory, a number of Spanish players said in a joint statement that they would no longer play for La Roja unless structural changes were made. Tom√© took charge of the Spanish women's national team for the first time in September 2023 and has managed 36 games, winning on 28 occasions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The stage is set for an epic 2025 UEFA Women's Euro final on Sunday between reigning champs England and reignign World Cup winners Spain. A championship game two years in the making will pair two of Europe's giants for the continent's biggest crown. The match at St. Jakob-Park in Switzerland will serve as both a rematch and standard-bearer for the current state of women's football in Europe as Spain and England square off just two years following the FIFA 2023 Women's World Cup final. The margins for error between the two sides are slim but just enough for each squad to feel confident about their chances. Both sides have been the top attacking teams this tournament, scoring 32 goals, with 17 for Spain and 15 for England, and 21 different goal scorers between the two nations, with England (11) edging out Spain (10) by one player. On the defensive end, Spain have three shutouts with two clean sheets in the knockout rounds and have only allowed three goals. England enter the final after two extra-time knockout matches -- a quarterfinal penalty kick shootout against Sweden, and an extra-time victory against Italy in the semifinal, with sparks off the bench in Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. Spain look to win their first-ever Euro title, while England eye history with a potential repeat, which would be the first in over a decade. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more: England was considered the heavy favorites following their 2022 Euro win, and Spain was seen as a team motivated to prove its federation and coaching staff for better conditions. The match played out to a narrow scoreline, with Spain the victors, 1-0, with a goal by defender Olga Carmona. They split two games earlier this year, more one-goal victories, during the 2025 UEFA Nations League. England got the better of Spain, 1-0, with a goal by Jess Park back in February, while Spain returned the favor in June. Spain's 2-1 win kicked off their sizzling summer, as Claudia Pina scored two goals off the bench and eliminated England from the competition. England's 2022 Euro championship immediately launched the Lionesses into conversations around global elite programs and further set expectations for them at the 2023 World Cup. Still, there are 14 players on England's Euro roster who were on the 2023 World Cup squad, eight of whom were starters during the World Cup final. Former Lionesses striker Ellen White, midfielder Fran Kirby, defender Rachel Daly, and goalkeeper Mary Earps were key players during England's magical Euro run but absences for this year's tournament -- with Earps announcing her departure in May, just two months ahead of the competition. Forward Lauren James is nursing an ankle injury from the semifinal, and her status is in flux, while Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze are playing through leg injuries as well. Head coach Sarina Wiegman has faced some criticism about stale tactics and a lack of rotations and late-game substitutions, but as nerve-rattling as the late-game heroics from Agyemang and Kelly have been, the coaching methodology has worked. This squad has emerged as the tournament lionhearts for their efforts. England are chasing a bit of history of their own, not only as title holders looking to repeat, but also as the first team to ever win a Euro after losing their opening match. Former RFEF president Luis Rubiales initiated a non-consensual kiss with player Jenni Hermoso on the medal podium, and his close ties to former manager Jorge Vilda -- who players revolted against ahead of and after the World Cup due to his coaching style and leadership methods -- led to his firing and also the coach's eventual dismissal. The former player turned coach faced criticisms for her lineup choices and somewhat predictable tactics during the competition, but making it this far is no small feat. With plenty of holdovers from the World Cup final, Claudia Pina emerged as a bench player to a sure starter, and she has shown off her relentless efforts in attacking play and as a set-piece service threat. If they win, they will join Germany as the only nations to immediately follow a World Cup win with a Euro title. England: Hannah Hampton; Lucy Bronze, Leah Williamson, Esme Morgan, Alex Greenwood; Georgia Stanway, Kiera Walsh, Ella Toone; Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo Spain: Cata Coll; Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Laia Aleixandri, Olga Carmona; Aitana Bonmati, Patri Guijarro, Alexia Putellas; Mariona Caldentey, Claudia Pina, Esther Gonzalez Could this be the game that England finally runs out of gas and personnel? Probably not, but it might make stretches of the game difficult for them to chase if they can't figure out how to play over Spain's midfield. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United's 2‚Äì1 victory over West Ham United at MetLife Stadium on Saturday wasn't just a showcase of pre-season Premier League football‚Äîit was a historic night for U.S. soccer attendance. A staggering crowd of 82,566 fans packed the stadium, setting a new record for the largest attendance at a football match in the United States in 2025. The match, part of United's U.S. pre-season tour, saw The MetLife Stadium, home to the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, transform into a sea of red and claret as supporters turned out in full force. The 30-year-old Portuguese midfielder was clinical and composed, reminding fans why he was named United's Player of the Year last season. The quality of play, combined with the electric crowd atmosphere, created a memorable experience for all in attendance. Growing Popularity of European Football in the U.S. Saturday's attendance milestone underscores the surging interest in European football among American audiences. With elite clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich regularly including the U.S. on their pre-season itineraries, fan engagement has soared. MetLife Stadium, which will host matches during the 2026 World Cup, continues to prove itself as a prime venue for the sport's biggest occasions. Following the record-breaking night, Manchester United will continue their U.S. tour with upcoming fixtures on the West Coast.</p>

Between June 11 and July 19, they will play 104 matches, most of them in the U.S. With millions of fans expected to cross borders to attend the games, U.S. President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies ‚Äî which include travel bans on some countries, immigration raids and mass deportations ‚Äî are generating anxiety. ‚ÄúThis is all being driven by the United States. And we're entirely the guilty party here,‚Äù said Victor Matheson, a professor at College of Holy Cross in Massachusetts who specializes in sports economics. ‚ÄúYou could have significant immigration problems with fans and players going across borders.‚Äù The U.S. has travel bans in place for 12 countries and restrictions in place for seven, and is considering banning travellers from another 36 countries. Though there are exemptions for athletes, staff and families, the unpredictability of Trump's administration means no one knows for certain what kind of rules might be in place by the time the tournament starts. Economist Andrew Zimbalist, who wrote a book on the economics of hosting the World Cup, said Trump has the ability to make it difficult for people to travel, but it's not clear whether he will actually do so. ‚ÄúI think probably Trump himself might not have the answers because ‚Ä¶ he responds very impetuously to changes in his environment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would be very concerned about planning a vacation that has you travelling from Mexico or from Canada into the United States and back. I don't think that you can guarantee that vacation of a lifetime is actually going to be there for you to actually take,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTariffs make that type of inventory management pretty challenging,‚Äù he said. Tim Elcombe is a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University whose areas of expertise include sports, politics and international affairs. Canada is co-hosting one of world's biggest sporting events with a country whose president has instigated a trade war and threatened annexation. Canadians have cut travel to the U.S. and stopped buying American products ‚Äî and it's not clear what all of that might mean for the World Cup. While Vancouver and Toronto will host some games, ‚Äúreally this is an American-centric competition,‚Äù Elcombe said. ‚ÄúCanada is going to have to be prepared for a very critical eye in terms of focus on some of the issues in Canada from a human rights perspective, because I think they will be exposed,‚Äù he said, citing Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples as one example. MacIntosh Ross, a fellow at the Scott McCain and Leslie McLean Centre for Sport, Business and Health at Saint Mary's University, said Canada should put pressure on the U.S. government ‚Äúto make sure that things happen in a safe or as safe a manner as possible.‚Äù Elcombe noted Infantino, who has ‚Äúvery much established himself as a friend and supporter of President Trump,‚Äù could be a key player in determining how the coming months unfold. It's difficult to predict what Trump might do, Zimbalist said. If there are political issues in the United States that he wants to distract people from, ‚Äúyou can see him doing crazier and crazier things internationally to get people's minds off of what's actually happening.‚Äù But Trump also has shown that he cares about the World Cup and looking good as he hosts the tournament. ‚ÄúI think he does care about image and he does care about being on the world stage,‚Äù Zimbalist said. ‚ÄúSo I can see that being a significant deterrent, actually.‚Äù</p>

But for the players, the tournament was an additional burden after an already rigorous season. A feud even broke out with Javier Tebas over the same issue. And according to Marca, the club paid a bonus of 280,000 euros to each player for participating in the tournament. According to the report, Real Madrid bagged more than 80 million euros from the tournament. The amount is significant, especially considering how few matches Madrid had to play and the fact that they did not even reach the final. Given that the earnings came from the players' hard work, it was only fair to reward them. The massive earnings from such a short tournament could be one of the key reasons Real Madrid support holding the Club World Cup every two years instead of the current four-year cycle. They will have to perform better, deliver stronger results than last season, and win more trophies to make up for last season's drought.
