                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. The series finale of Supernatural was divisive for many reasons, ranging from Dean's anticlimactic death via rebar to a shortage of familiar faces in the very last episode ever. Showrunner Andrew Dabb shared his thoughts, nearly five years later, and they don't quite match what Padalecki has said. Short of Supernatural getting a Buffy-esque revival, we may never have a canonical answer, but I was among the viewers back in late 2020 who just wanted to know if the woman who was Sam's wife was supposed to be Eileen, played by Shoshannah Stern. Or was she supposed to be Eileen, but the show just couldn't get her back to film the finale under 2020 COVID-19 guidelines? Well, showrunner Andrew Dabb weighed in, with Swooon reporting his comments: But at the same time, do you cast someone totally brand new that the audience will have not seen before? Dabb had even shared the original vision for Sam and Dean's endings that would have featured a lot of familiar faces. Still, he has a take of his own, even if the episode will never deliver the answers fans want about Eileen as Sam's wife (or not). But certainly in my mind, that's what we were building toward. That blurry woman who married Sam and became the mother to young Dean was Eileen, as a natural extension of where Season 15 had been leading with them. Jared Padalecki just had a different take when asked about his character's wife. Padalecki told Variety that no version of the script included an identity of who Sam ended up with after Dean's death, so he had no more details than what we saw: a brunette woman blurred out from a distance. I feel like a lot of what Sam did after Dean died was almost in honor of what Dean would have wanted, and Dean would not have wanted his little brother to marry Eileen, Ruby, someone in the life. I feel comfortable saying that Dean definitely wouldn't have wanted Sam to marry Ruby even if she was still around, but it's a little harder to swallow the idea of him objecting to Eileen just because she was still in “the life.” Sam's feelings for her in Season 15 were very real and apparent, and Dean would have wanted his brother to be happy. Still, Padalecki is the man who played Sam Winchester for more than 300 episodes over fifteen seasons, so he obviously knows his character. Plus, his speculation is no more canonical than Andrew Dabb saying that he believed in an endgame for Sam and Eileen. Besides, who's to say whether or not Padalecki still feels the same way these days? And really, is that anything new for the Supernatural fandom?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons on the CW, following the cross-country adventures of monster-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester. Finally coming to a conclusion in 2020, Supernatural's devastating finale that left fans divided. Before long, news broke about a prequel spin-off titled The Winchesters, executive produced by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danneel. The Winchesters was set to tell the story of John (Drake Rodger) and Mary (Meg Donnelly) Winchester, chronicling how they met and fell in love. Without Sam and Dean, The Winchesters simply didn't click with audiences, and a future continuation or spin-off of Supernatural must avoid this mistake. Fans have been hoping that Supernatural season 16 will happen for a long time, and this unexpected plot twist in a spinoff series could be the key. The Winchesters' failure to connect with audiences proves that a Supernatural spin-off or reboot won't work without Sam and Dean Winchester. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki became so great at portraying the Winchester brothers that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the roles. Whether Sam and Dean were hunting ghosts or taking on the Devil himself, they almost always did it together. With its killer soundtrack of classic rock hits, Supernatural provided the perfect background music for the epic saga of Sam and Dean Winchester. While a Supernatural reboot would certainly introduce some new characters, the series must, at its heart, be about Sam and Dean. The few Supernatural episodes that focus on other, previously unknown characters, like "Bitten" and "Bloodlines," are often regarded as some of the series' worst (or at least most polarizing) episodes. Even if a future series managed to capture Supernatural's unique blend of horror, humor, and heart, I cannot help thinking it would all feel empty without Sam and Dean Winchester. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. The Winchesters is a prequel series to Supernatural created by Eric Kripke. It follows monster hunters John Winchester (Drake Rodger) and Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) as they search for their missing parents in the years before the birth of their sons Sam and Dean. The Winchesters is narrated by Jensen Ackles, who serves as the show's executive producer, and also stars Tom Welling as Samuel Campbell. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Breaking Bad has had three spinoffs ever since the original show ended in 2013, and thankfully, one of the most different ones isn't actually canon. ScreenRant interviews Jess Bush and Martin Quinn about what's next for Nurse Chapel and Scotty in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers pulls off all the essentials of a tough genre, crafting an experience closer to the real FromSoft deal than most imitators. Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps breaks yet another MCU review record with the highest CinemaScore rating for an FF movie. With Netflix removing some shows from its catalog, time is running out to watch the perfect four-season replacement for fans of Supernatural.</p>

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Donald Trump, who has regularly indulged in conspiracy theories alongside his supporters during his rise to power, complained on Sunday that it's Democrats that are too focused on conspiracy theories. Trump, whose administration is under scrutiny over its handling of Jeffrey Epstein investigations, claimed that “all they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense.” “If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer,” the president said during a meeting in Scotland on Sunday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump continued this trend, latching onto a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets. Now, after years of courting conspiracy theories about his opponents, the spotlight has turned on Trump over Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a federal trial on sex trafficking charges The administration's handling of materials related to Epstein investigations — disclosing an initial tranche of information that was mostly already public earlier this year, then suggesting it would not provide further releases, even as recent reporting further highlighted Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier — has driven a rare wedge between Trump and his base. Pressure reached such a fever pitch that House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress off to its summer recess early, temporarily averting a bipartisan push to release more Epstein files.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's essentially the look at every actor in Hollywood told by a favorite animated character. According to Cohen, there are about “200 public domain characters that audiences will recognize. It's going to feel a lot like an animated Cheers, but with characters you know and love from your favorite shows and the shows that you share with your children.” Among them: Jake Abel (voicing Hercules), Jim Beaver (Sidney Sam), Rob Benedict (Kaulu), Briana Buckmaster (Dorothy Gale), Ruth Connell (Peter Pan's Wendy Darling), Adam Fergus (Sherlock Holmes), Gil McKinney (The Mad Hatter), and Richard Speight Jr. (Quasimodo). “Working together and offering feedback is how the Supernatural family always shined.” (It's also an adult comedy with risqué lines and scenarios.) “When you get up from the couch after finishing the pilot and Louden Swain band's front man Rob Benedict's song is heard over the credits, you're going to feel wrapped in a warm hug and you'll want to go smile at one of your friends and tell them about it.” Fans helped finance the pilot, which will be available free on YouTube in August. Cohen voices the series' only original character, Shep Salazar, “a washed-up child actor trying to run the bar and control all these hooligans,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the Pokémon world's debut in the late '90s, there have always been several Pokémon that are considered to be adorable. In the meantime, there are many Pokémon who have had shockingly somber storylines in the games, manga or anime. Some of these Pokémon who have had tragic stories have also fallen into the roster of Pokémon considered to be cute, such as Chimchar and Charmander. Another Pokémon that is often considered to be adorable among fans, and which has also been part of several tragic stories in the Pokémon media, is the Psychic-type Pokémon Espurr. According to the Pokédex, this feline Pokémon already has quite a lot on its plate, as it is always trying to control its immense powers. However, in not one, but two different stories in the Pokémon world, the Restraint Pokémon is shown to deal with even more obstacles, ones that continue to haunt fans. A pure Psychic-type Pokémon, Espurr is usually a shade of pale violet, with lavender eyes and white paws, alongside folded ears that are white at the ends. Espurr's Shiny form, in the meantime, has the same small details, though its fur is a shade of light pink instead of violet. The small Psychic-type Pokémon is usually seen with an expressionless face, as it is desperately trying to restrain its psychic powers, which are too powerful for it to handle. If Espurr did not work so hard to control its powers, then a great blast of psychic energy would strike everything around three hundred feet of the Restraint Pokémon, according to its Pokédex entry in Pokémon Alpha Sapphire. When Espurr evolves at level 25, it will evolve into Meowstic, the Constraint Pokémon. Just like its prior evolution, Meowstic also must work hard to keep its powers at bay, lest a great amount of psychic energy cause unexpected chaos. Meanwhile, a female Meowstic has white fur, with blue accents and bright yellow eyes. In battle, a male Meowstic mainly depends on defensive moves, trying its best to also help its allies during battle. ", where the story takes place in a seemingly abandoned mansion. During a sudden storm, Ash and his friends enter the mansion, not aware that Team Rocket has also decided to remain there until the rain stops. As such, each group believes that the other is a horde of ghosts, constantly making the others scream in surprise. The world of Pokémon has many wonderful creatures based on real-life animals, and the roster of feline Pokémon is undoubtedly cute and cool. In the past, Espurr was taken in by a kind older woman named Lacy, who also let Espurr hold onto a pendant that she once received from her husband. Elise promised that she would stay at the mansion and renovate it, and that the Restraint Pokémon was welcome to visit anytime it wanted. The new owner also said she would take Espurr to Lacy's grave, where it could truly say goodbye. The Pokémon world is no stranger to dealing with complex subjects such as death, yet this episode is certainly one of the most somber and bittersweet ones on the roster. In one such case, Looker and the player discover a young orphan named Emma, who is often shown alongside her Espurr friend, nicknamed "Mimi". While she is learning from Looker, Emma begins to worry that she is a financial burden on him and the Looker Bureau. Though Looker tells her she is absolutely not, Emma still decides to find some part-time work in order to help him. However, the café that Emma decides to work at turns out to be the Lysandre Café, where she is met by Xerosic, a lead scientist for Team Flare. Xerosic tricks Emma into becoming a test subject for the Expansion Suit, using a remote to control her actions while she is unconscious. While she is in this state, Xerosic has Emma, working under the codename "Essentia", steal the Pokémon from unsuspecting Trainers. In its 28+ year history, Pokémon has brought players many unique and interesting female characters, including Officer Jenny. Upon waking up, Emma has no memory of the actions she committed as Essentia. Looker soon learns about this new figure in Kalos, and starts to investigate alongside the player and Mimi. Essentia thus tries to attack Mimi, but ultimately injures Looker instead, all while the suit begins to malfunction. In the Pokémon Generations episode "The Investigation", Essentia actually kicks Mimi away, a shocking moment that continues to haunt fans today. However, she also becomes the owner of the Pokémon left behind by Xerosic, who bonded with her during her time working for Xerosic. Emma is also given the Essentia suit to control, now without a mind-controlling remote. Emma and Mimi will return to the franchise in the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which appears to take place some time after the events of Pokémon X and Pokémon Y. Although Emma and Mimi appear to have happier lives in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, one cannot help but reflect on their story in Generation VI, and how it nearly ended in tragedy. Expanding across a multitude of media, including TCGs, video games, manga, live-action movies and anime, the Pokémon franchise is set in a shared world of humans and creatures with a wide variety of special abilities. Pokémon Y does not often get the praise it deserves. The 3DS offered new avenues of graphic improvement and boy were fans in for a treat. In terms of plot, Y does not do much to change the Pokémon formula. However, Y does offer new gameplay experiences.With this installment, we are introduced to the concept of Mega Evolutions. This is a perfect example of Game Freak shaking up the system without deviating from its tradition. Pokémon who could access Mega Evolution would transform in appearance mid battle. Not only was the move executed brilliantly from an artistic standpoint but it also seamlessly impacted the game's strategy. In addition, for the first time in history it seemed like nobody had an issue with the game's graphics. Pokémon games had a history of being underdeveloped in the graphics department. It's a shame that in terms of plot and story progression of Y sees the Pokémon franchise revert to old habits. This is extremely upsetting considering its predecessor in Black and White provided the best narrative to transpire in a Pokémon game. Pokémon Y does not often get the praise it deserves.

Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Decades after the Dragon Pokemon's debut in Generation I, Dragonite is set to receive a new Mega Evolution in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Although Takopi's Original Sin isn't quite as popular as Solo Leveling or One Piece, it's already proven to be even more entertaining. Solo Leveling's Sung Jinwoo has reached yet another new level of strength by way of Ragnarok's final chapters, and it makes Goku look like a joke. There are many debates as to what anime should have won Anime of the Year, but the answer is clear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Strange Phenomena Investigations will use the CE5 method to contact unidentified aerial phenomena using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month. A team of UFO researchers has planned to use a technique to invite extraterrestrial spacecraft to Dechmont Woods in Scotland's West Lothian later this month. The Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) method involves group meditation, telepathic intention, and sound recordings designed to encourage peaceful contact with unidentified aerial phenomena. The UFO experience was first reported by forestry worker Bob Taylor, who encountered a dome-shaped craft and was physically dragged by spiked objects, leaving him with torn clothing and minor injuries. Meanwhile, Malcolm Robinson expects that the plan could work, as participants witnessed “flashing lights” during a trial run. “We are trying to bring any off-world craft into our airspace. There is a desire to bring forward these objects, which people claim to be UFOs or UAPs. The meditation will send out a desire for open contact," Robinson said, The Scottish Sun reported. It all sounds very airy-fairy, I get that, but this has been tried successfully all over the world," he added. Through this process, the Strange Phenomena Investigations will try to communicate using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month.</p>
