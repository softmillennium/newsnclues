                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having a championship point at Roland Garros without winning the title is something that Jannik Sinner experienced earlier this year. Sinner had three championship points against Carlos Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final that he lost in five sets. This defeat was crushing for the Italian, with Sinner needing time to get over his heartbreaking defeat in Paris. Sinner is now a four-time Grand Slam champion after winning Wimbledon, but another ATP player who experienced something similar was never able to recover. Coria continued this form into Roland Garros, where he reached his first Grand Slam final by dropping just one set. Gaudio had never reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal before Roland Garros in 2004, leaving Coria as the big favourite to win the title. This was especially prevalent, as Coria had won three of his four previous matches against Gaudio, all of which were on clay. The expected outcome of the match appeared to be playing out, as Coria dropped just three games to take a two-set-to-love lead. Coria would regain authority in this fifth set, taking a 4-2 lead, and looked to be on his way to an elusive Grand Slam title. After hitting the ball wide on those two championship points, Gaudio would fight back to beat Coria, 0-6 3-6 6-4 6-1 8-6. Coria was the first man to lose a Grand Slam singles final in the Open Era after having championship points, with there now three players who have lost a major final from match point up. The other two players who lost Grand Slam finals after having a championship point are Roger Federer and Sinner. However, both Federer and Sinner have won multiple major titles, while Coria took a big decline after this heartbreaking loss. While Coria would still enjoy some positive results after Roland Garros in 2004, he would never reach a Grand Slam semifinal ever again. The Argentinian only won one more title in his career at the Croatia Open in 2005, and only made two more appearances at Roland Garros. After struggling with injury, Coria only played at Roland Garros again in 2005 and 2008, losing in the fourth round and first round, respectively. Coria suffered a dramatic fall down the rankings after playing just two matches in 2007, and was never able to return to form in his comeback from a shoulder injury. At just 27 years old, Coria would retire from tennis in April, 2009, and would never win a Grand Slam title despite having two championship points to do so. Although Guillermo Coria no longer plays on the ATP Tour, his younger brother Federico Coria has been an active player since 2010 and has a career-high ranking of world number 49.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scattered thunderstorms early, then partly cloudy after midnight. Scattered thunderstorms early, then partly cloudy after midnight. Naomi Osaka of Japan leaves the court after losing to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova during a third round women's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday, July 4, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Naomi Osaka and coach Patrick Mouratoglou are done working together after less than a year, the four-time Grand Slam champion announced Sunday on social media. “Merci Patrick,” Osaka began her post, with a photo of her hitting a practice serve while he stands nearby. “It was such a great experience learning from you. Wishing you nothing but the best. The news comes three days after Osaka lost her second match at the D.C. Open and just before she begins competing in Toronto. The U.S. Open, the year's last major tournament and an event Osaka won twice, begins in New York on Aug. 24. Osaka hired Mouratoglou — who was the longtime coach of Serena Williams — when she fired Wim Fissette shortly after her second-round exit at last year's U.S. Open. 1, is currently ranked 51st and has a 21-11 record this season. She hasn't been past the third round at a Grand Slam tournament since winning the 2021 Australian Open. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>18 first-round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP National Bank Open in Toronto, and fans will get exciting action all day long. This article features Fabian Marozsan and Arthur Rinderknech alongside some other solid players. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. These two players are very close in their current rankings, but there is a significant difference in their level on hard courts. Vit Kopriva is a clay court specialist and has won just two tour-level matches in hard. Kopriva will retrieve a lot of balls, but I expect the Chinese to come out on top. Since reaching the semifinals in Marrakech, Roberto Carballes Baena has won just one tour-level match, and this form won't help him on hard courts, which is not his favourite surface. However, he has shown some promise on this surface earlier in the season and will look to imitate that level. With just two tour-level wins on this surface, Carabelli could be vulnerable here, and the Spaniard should take advantage. He has notched some impressive wins in the last couple of months and will be looking to start his North American hard-court swing on a high. He will face local wildcard Alexis Galarneau, who has never won an ATP Tour match. Galarneau is making his third appearance at the Canada Masters. Rinderknech's big serve and aggressive playstyle should help him dominate this match. Fabian Marozsan is going through a rough patch in the last couple of months, but his first-round record has been good. His record at the Masters is also impressive, and Hugo Dellien, who is primarily a clay courter, shouldn't present a lot of difficulties for Marozsan here. Marozsan has the clear advantage here due to his comfort on this surface. Since then he has been hooked and spends countless hours watching tennis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal‘s best Grand Slam streak began at the 2010 French Open, where he steamrolled Gianna Mina, Horacio Zeballos, Lleyton Hewitt, Thomaz Bellucci, Nicolas Almagro, Jurgen Melzer and Robin Soderling without losing a set to secure the trophy. At Wimbledon, Nadal completed the Channel Slam by defeating Kei Nishikori, Robin Haase, Philipp Petzschner, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Soderling, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych. Nadal then achieved the Career Grand Slam at the 2010 US Open as he saw off Teymuraz Gabashvili, Denis Istomin, Gilles Simon, Feliciano Lopez, Fernando Verdasco, Mikhail Youzhny and Novak Djokovic. Pete Sampras won the 1993 Wimbledon Championships to start his best-ever Grand Slam run, earning wins over Neil Borwick, Jamie Morgan, Byron Black, Andrew Foster, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker and Jim Courier. The American then overcame Fabrice Santoro, Daniel Vacek, Arnaud Boetsch, Tomas Enqvist, Michael Chang, Alexander Volkov and Cedric Pioline to win the 1993 US Open. At the 1994 Australian Open, Sampras triumphed against Joshua Eagle, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Stephane Simian, Ivan Lendl, Magnus Gustafsson, Jim Courier and Todd Martin to win a third straight Slam. Sampras added four more wins at the 1994 French Open — against Albert Costa, Marcelo Rios, Paul Haarhuis and Mikael Tillstrom — before falling to Courier in the quarter-finals. Jimmy Connors started his 25-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1974 Australian Open, where he defeated Jean-Louis Haillet, Graeme Thomson, Syd Ball, Vladimir Zednik, John Alexander and Phil Dent for the trophy. Connors then claimed the 1974 US Open crown by beating Jeff Borowiak, Ove Bengtson, Alexander, Kodes, Alex Metreveli, Roscoe Tanner and Rosewall. Roger Federer‘s best major streak started with his triumph at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships, where he overcame Paul-Henri Mathieu, Ivo Minar, Nicholas Kiefer, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Fernando Gonzalez, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick. At the 2006 Australian Open, Federer extended his run with a third straight Grand Slam title as he saw off Istomin, Florian Mayer, Max Mirnyi, Tommy Haas, Nikolay Davydenko, Kiefer and Marcos Baghdatis. Federer took his run to 27 straight wins at majors with victories over Diego Hartfield, Alejandro Falla, Nicolas Massu, Berdych, Mario Ancic and David Nalbandian at the 2006 French Open. Rod Laver began his 29-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1969 Australian Open, where he downed Massimo Di Domenico, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, Tony Roche and Andres Gimeno for the title. The Australian continued his run with victory at the 1969 French Open as he defeated Koji Watanabe, Richard Crealy, Pietro Marzano, Stan Smith, Gimeno, Tom Okker and Ken Rosewall. Laver then added the 1969 Wimbledon title as he claimed wins against Nicola Pietrangeli, Premjit Lall, Jan Leschly, Smith, Cliff Drysdale, Arthur Ashe and John Newcombe. At the 1969 US Open, Laver overcame Luis-Augusto Garcia, Jaime Pinto Bravo, Jaime Fillol, Dennis Ralston, Emerson, Ashe and Roche to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam. Laver's next major appearance came at Wimbledon in 1970, where he beat Butch Seewagen, John Alexander and Frew McMillan before his streak was snapped by a fourth round defeat to Roger Taylor. He then lifted his maiden French Open title as he beat Lu Yen-hsun, Steve Darcis, Aljaz Bedene, Bautista Agut, Berdych, Dominic Thiem and Murray. Djokovic took his Grand Slam win streak to 30 by defeating James Ward and Adrian Mannarino at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, before his run ended with a shock third round loss to Sam Querrey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alejandro Davidovich Fokina stunned Ben Shelton last night, beating the American in straight sets to reach the Washington Open final. Davidovich Fokina, seeded 12th, defeated Shelton 6-2 7-5 under the DC lights, setting up a match against Alex de Minaur in the final. His achievements in Washington – a tournament he did not compete at in 2024 – have seen him enter a new conversation that few would have expected heading into the 2025 ATP Tour campaign. The top eight players qualify for November competition each year. The Spaniard has gained 350 points so far this week. This has seen him rise seven places in the race, above the likes of Alexander Bublik, Tommy Paul and Holger Rune. Davidovich Fokina, who is in 11th place, sits behind only Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud and Ben Shelton, who sits in eighth place. The world number 26 will contest a particularly important match against Alex de Minaur on Sunday. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Alex de Minaur have a long history on the ATP Tour. The Spaniard and Australian next met in 2021, with Davidovich Fokina winning in straight sets at the ATP Masters 1000 Monte-Carlo. Remarkably, Davidovich Fokina has never won an ATP Tour title. He will have a chance to change that against de Minaur on Sunday evening.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu turned heads when she teamed up with Elena Rybakina for doubles at the Citi Open. The 2021 U.S. Open champion and the 2022 Wimbledon victor, both having faced their share of ups and downs post-titles, joined forces in Washington. They were forced to play in blistering heat in the United States, with Raducanu making her feelings clear on the playing conditions. The pair, nicknamed ER-squared, cruised into the semifinals after securing two victories, first against Olivia Nicholls and Tereza Mihalikova, followed by a win over Giuliana Olmos and Aldila Sutjiadi, without dropping a set. However, their streak came to an abrupt halt in the final four when they faced Taylor Townsend and Zhang Shuai, as Raducanu fell ill and they had to retire early in the first set. It was a lot of fun," Rybakina commented on Raducanu during her press conference. So it was fun, and yeah, hopefully we can play a bit more in the future too." This dynamic duo was a long time in the making, as Raducanu disclosed that they had been planning to join forces right after Rybakina clinched the Wimbledon title by defeating Ons Jabeur in the 2022 showdown. "How it came about, so in 2022 in Cincinnati, me and Elena were going to play doubles together, and that fell through," the world No. "Then here, when I was in D.C., I thought it would be a good idea to play doubles, get some extra matches in these conditions. And also the fact we were able to play before singles, I think that really helped. I wasn't really bothered if she said no. I asked her, and she was, like, Yeah, sure. The duo has also made impressive strides in their respective singles tournaments, with Raducanu choosing to double down on both fronts in the 2025 editions to boost her physical game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elena Rybakina has had a couple of concerning collapses this year and the latest came this past on Saturday, when the Kazakh blew a big lead and suffered a shock Washington semifinal loss. After sealing a tight first set versus world No. 3 seed also went 3-1 up in the second set and had three consecutive break points to open a double-break second-set lead. To make it all worse, she completely disappeared in the second-set tie-break and won only three points there. But then, the tie-break quickly turned into a one-sided battle as Fernandez took the opening four points before completing a 6-7 (2) 7-6 (3) 7-6 (3) comeback win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After career-high rise, 20-year-old returns to tour with a tricky draw before US Open Eala, 20, has slipped from a career-best No 56 to world No 69 in the latest Women's Tennis Association (WTA) rankings following a three-week break from competition. Earlier this season in Miami, she stunned the tennis world with a sensational run to the semi-finals, knocking out three Grand Slam champions — Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and then-world No 1 Iga Swiatek — before losing to Jessica Pegula. Since then, the former US Open junior champion has continued to make steady progress. In Eastbourne, she reached her first WTA final before narrowly losing in a three-set battle to Australian teenager Maya Joint. At Wimbledon, she faced a brutal first-round test against eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova and went down fighting in straight sets. Montreal will be the first of several tune-ups for Eala, who is expected to feature in Cincinnati before a final stop in Monterrey, Mexico before heading to New York. She's expected to face top-tier opponents in all three tournaments, including world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Grand Slam champions Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff. Her goal: secure direct entry into the US Open main draw, scheduled from August 24 to September 7 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and prove that Miami was no fluke. But for Eala, the coming weeks are about more than just results. “There's still so much for me to achieve,” she told the media in Manila recently. “Of course, I want my first Grand Slam main draw win. But right now, I just want to enjoy playing on this stage.” If she finds her rhythm early, another memorable run could be just around the corner.

After 28 minutes, a one-set lead was his. After 28 minutes, a one-set lead was his. Having twice saved a break point in the second set, a double fault and undercut forehand drop shot from Shelton enabled his opponent to move ahead 4-3. Davidovich Fokina wasn't able to consolidate though, as his forehand fell apart in handing the break right back.Energized and with the crowd fully behind him, Shelton dialed up his serve with a confident hold. This year's Australian Open semifinalist came within two points of forcing a decider in the 10th game, but that's as close as he would get.At 5-5, 15-15, Shelton pushed an overhead wide after letting a defensive lob bounce. A backhand error then set up Davidovich Fokina with two break points—and he pounced by passing Shelton at the net with a forehand up the line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One game away from defeat, Leylah Fernandez battled all the way back to win a 3-hour and 12-minute, three-tiebreak epic over Elena Rybakina in the Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals. Leylah Fernandez was a single game away from defeat in Saturday's Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals, but she battled all the way back to pull off a grueling, three-tiebreak victory and reach her first final in over a year. On another toasty day in the American capital city of Washington, D.C., Canada's Fernandez overcame No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-6(3) in a 3-hour and 12-minute marathon. There was nearly a rematch of the memorable 2021 US Open final on Sunday, but it was not to be. Instead, Fernandez will face Anna Kalinskaya, who eased past 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu 6-4, 6-3 in the day's second semifinal. Sunday is a huge chance for World No. 48 Kalinskaya, both of whom have previously been ranked inside the Top 20. This WTA 500 trophy would be the biggest career title for either of them -- in fact, Kalinskaya has yet to win a WTA singles title at all. Fernandez narrowly defeated Kalinskaya in their only previous meeting, which was over four years ago. On the hard courts of Guadalajara in 2021, Fernandez squeaked past Kalinskaya 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. The final is at 2:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon local time (7:30 p.m. BST). In Saturday's first semifinal, Elena Rybakina had not lost serve through 7-6(2), 5-4, where she served for the match. "When I first started playing tennis, there was like a mini camp and they were doing a physical test, kind of a straight-line sprint," Fernandez said after her quarterfinal win on Friday. "The coaches were concerned, like 'She's not very good physically.' They talked to my parents, and my parents said, 'Yeah, but if you put a tennis ball in front of her and you ask her to run for every ball, she's gonna do it. Her heart and her belief in herself is much bigger than most of the girls in that camp.'" That came to pass in her epic win over Rybakina. All of her three career WTA singles titles have come on hard court. "We're doing things right," Fernandez said on Saturday. [I'll] keep enjoying it, and to not focus too much on results but focus on how my game is improving." However, Washington is starting to feel like a home-field event for the former World No. The Mubadala Citi DC Open is arguably Anna Kalinskaya's best stop on tour. After narrow losses in both of those finals, she has another opportunity to join the club of WTA singles titlists. These hard courts suit Kalinskaya's unfussy groundstrokes and placid demeanor. Dominating with her forehand, Kalinskaya had 19 winners to Raducanu's 13 in their opening set. Proving she is lethal from both wings, Kalinskaya fired consecutive backhand winners to break Raducanu in the opening game of the second set, and she was off to the races from there. "I always like to be aggressive," Kalinskaya said on Saturday night. Yeah, I guess the fast court fits me very well, but you need to be fast at making decisions.
