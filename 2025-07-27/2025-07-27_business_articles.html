                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery had a bountiful weekend at the global box office. The studio had two films cross the $500 million mark worldwide — "Superman" soared to $502 million and Apple's "F1," which Warner Bros. distributed, topped $509 million in ticket sales. The benchmark is a boon for Warner Bros.' DC Studios, as "Superman" is the first theatrical debut of James Gunn and Peter Safran since they became co-heads of the film and TV unit in late 2022. The pair has developed a 10-year plan to reinvigorate the studio's franchises across TV and film, including fresh spins on Superman and Batman. Zack Snyder's 2016 "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" is the highest with $874 million in global ticket sales, while 2013's "Man of Steel" is second-highest with $669 million and 2017's "Justice League" with $661 million, according to data from Comscore. "Superman" debuted in theaters just two weeks ago and continues to drive weekend moviegoing as well as weekday trips. Earlier this month, the film became Apple's best film release ever, surpassing Ridley Scott's "Napoleon," which generated $221 million during its 2023 run, to become Apple's then-highest-grossing theatrical release. The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. "Killers of the Flower Moon" tallied $158 million worldwide, "Fly Me to the Moon" took in just $42 million and "Argylle" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally. "F1" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX. Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology but also a three-week release in its theaters. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twice in one month, a comic book film has rocketed to the top of the box office, debuting with more than $100 million in ticket sales. Two weeks ago, it was "Superman," the first theatrical release from James Gunn and Peter Safran as co-heads of DC Studios at Warner Bros. This weekend, Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" fueled an estimated $118 million in ticket sales during its first three days in theaters. "The lesson is that if you build great movies, audiences will head to the multiplex," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. Internationally, "Fantastic Four: First Steps" snared an estimated $100 million, bringing its global weekend haul to $218 million. "Marvel bet big releasing their long-awaited introduction of the Fantastic Four as the last MCU film to hit theaters for at least another year, and it's paying off," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. "The franchise has had its share of hiccups in recent years, but Marvel's First Family is winning over fans and spurring the kind of enthusiasm that could bring back casual viewers who sat out some post-'Endgame' chapters." While films like "Deadpool & Wolverine" and "Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3" enticed moviegoers to theaters, others like "Captain America: Brave New World," "The Marvels" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" failed to drum up the same enthusiasm. Marvel films have experienced significant fluctuations since the release of 2019's "Endgame." Previously, no MCU film had a Rotten Tomatoes score below 67%, meaning each had earned the title of "Fresh," indicating that critics had a generally positive view of the film. Since then, five films from the franchise have been below that metric and three of those were considered "Rotten," earning less than 50% positive reviews. This year, "Captain America: Brave New World" tallied $413 million globally and earned a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But "Thunderbolts*" generated just $382 million globally — one of only five titles under the Marvel Cinematic Universe banner to tally less than $400 million worldwide — it secured an 88% "Fresh" rating. Its newest theatrical entry, "Fantastic Four: First Steps," also has an 88% "Fresh" rating from the site. "For Disney, this has truly been a magical summer and for Marvel a reaffirmation that their strategy to revamp the brand is certainly working," Dergarabedian said. "With 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' following in the footsteps of 'Thunderbolts*' Marvel is showing that a focus on quality rather than quantity is a recipe for success."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the European Union should agree to open its markets for U.S. exports to convince President Donald Trump to lower "reciprocal" tariffs on the 27-member bloc. Lutnick's comments suggest that Trump is open to a deal with the EU, but reiterated that the president still believes there's roughly a 50-50 chance that one can ultimately be reached. "The question is, do they offer President Trump a good enough deal that is worth it for him to step off of the 30% tariffs that he set," Lutnick said on Fox News. The commerce secretary's comments still raise questions about what a "good enough" deal with the United States' largest trading partner would look like at a pivotal time for trade negotiations. Trump is set to hold trade talks with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, days before the Aug. 1 deadline for Trump's tariffs to take effect. Ahead of the pivotal trade deadline, Trump on Friday said that "we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU." He said that sticking points remained "with maybe 20 different things," raising questions about whether the two leaders could move closer to a framework for a deal on Sunday. As Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on the EU, the bloc has weighed countermeasures, such as using its "Anti-Coercion Instrument," a move that has been seen as the trading bloc's "trade bazooka." Such a move could hinder U.S. vendors' participation in the EU market. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The market may be trading around record highs, but the Verdence Capital Advisors CIO is worried trouble is lurking. Megan Horneman, who oversees $4.1 billion in assets under management, thinks there's too much complacency around the Aug. 1 U.S. trade deadline. "This market is pricing in the perfect situation," she told CNBC's "Fast Money" on Monday. In addition to tariff concerns, she lists uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy and overbought conditions from a technical perspective as potential issues. "Once we see that [rate cuts] might be priced off the table, coinciding with the fact that we're not quite sure what's going to happen with the tariff perspective, I think you can see a bit of a valuation correction," said Horneman, who's a former Deutsche Bank senior investment strategist. Horneman is particularly concerned that technical levels are signaling overbought conditions in growth stocks — including Big Tech. "These are things that we think might upset the rally that we're seeing here," she said. Despite her short-term caution, Horneman considers herself a long-term bull and views pullbacks as opportunities. She lists international stocks among her top plays on market weakness. "I'd warn that right now, they're expensive from a valuation perspective [but] cheap compared to the U.S.," she said. "They've been underloved for way too long, and I think you're seeing some of that rotation just begin. "Fast Money" trader Guy Adami also sees concerns, citing the number of retail investors driving recent market gains. "Just in terms of valuation, things have gotten a tad frothy here," he said on Monday's show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After spiraling from crisis to crisis over much of the past seven years, Boeing is stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg's leadership. Ortberg, a longtime aerospace executive and an engineer whom the manufacturer plucked from retirement to fix the problem-addled company last year, is set this week to outline significant progress since he took the helm a year ago. Boeing reports quarterly results and gives its outlook on Tuesday. So far, investors are liking what they've been seeing. Shares of the company are up more than 30% so far this year. Wall Street analysts expect the aircraft manufacturer to halve its second-quarter losses from a year ago when it reports. Boeing's aircraft production has increased, and its airplane deliveries just hit the highest level in 18 months. It's a shift for Boeing, whose successive leaders missed targets on aircraft delivery schedules, certifications, financial goals and culture changes that frustrated investors and customers alike, while rival Airbus pulled ahead. "The general agreement is that the culture is changing after decades of self-inflicted knife wounds," said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm. Analysts expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Ortberg's work was already cut out for him, but the challenges multiplied when he arrived. Ortberg also oversaw a more than $20 billion capital raise last fall, replaced the head of the defense unit and sold off its Jeppesen navigation business. Ortberg bought a house in the Seattle area, where Boeing makes most of its planes, shortly after taking the job last August, and his presence has been positive, aerospace analysts have said. Boeing declined to make Ortberg available for an interview. Boeing's leaders hoped for a turnaround year in 2024. But five days in, a door-plug blew out of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Portland. The almost-catastrophe brought Boeing a production slowdown, renewed Federal Aviation Administration scrutiny and billions in cash burn. Key bolts were left off the plane before it was delivered to Alaska Airlines. It was the latest in a series of quality problems at Boeing, where other defects have required time-consuming reworking. Boeing had already been reeling from two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that sullied the reputation of America's largest exporter. Victims' family members slammed the deal when it was announced. For years, executives at top Boeing airline customers complained publicly about the manufacturer and its leadership as they grappled with delays. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told investors in May 2022 that management needed a "reboot or boot up the arse." "I continue to believe Kelly Ortberg, [and Boeing Commercial Airplane unit CEO] Stephanie Pope are doing a great job," he said on an earnings call. The plane is still not certified, but Kirby has said Boeing has been more predictability on airplane deliveries. The consistency of deliveries is much better," Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said in an interview last month. Boeing under Ortberg still has much to fix. Manufacturers get paid when aircraft are delivered, so higher production is key. "It's 47 [a month] that I think is the challenging break." He added that Boeing has a lot of inventory on hand to help increase production. The defense unit encompasses programs like the KC-46 tanker program and Air Force One, which has drawn public ire from President Donald Trump. Trump, frustrated with delays on the two new jets meant to serve the president, turned to a used Qatari Boeing 747 to potentially use as a presidential aircraft, though insiders say that used plane could require months of reoutfitting. Ortberg replaced the head of that unit last fall. "They're not totally out of the woods," Harned said. Boeing and Ortberg also need to start thinking about a new jet, some industry members said. Its best-selling 737 first debuted in 1967, and the company was looking at a midsize jetliner before the two crashes sent its attention elsewhere. "Already there's been a reversal from 'read my lips, no new jet.' I would like to see that accelerate," Aboulafia said. "He is the guy to make that happen."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the stock market focuses on major earnings and negotiations on the tariff front, investors seeking a regular income stream continue to look for attractive dividend stocks amid ongoing volatility. To this end, the analysis of top Wall Street analysts can provide useful insights that can help investors pick companies with solid fundamentals and the ability to pay dividends consistently. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Oil and gas exploration and production company EOG Resources (EOG) is first on this week's list. In May, the company announced a deal to acquire Encino Acquisition Partners (EAP) for $5.6 billion. EOG stated that the deal's accretion to its free cash flow supports a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend, to $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. Ahead of EOG Resources' second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 8, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on EOG stock with a price forecast of $155. In comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $138 on EOG stock with an "outperform" rating. Meanwhile, Sorbara stated that he expects EOG to report strong quarterly results on both the operational and financial fronts. "All in all, we are positive EOG into the print, especially since EOG should be more defensive in the current price environment," said Sorbara. The analyst is also bullish on EOG due to its peer-leading shareholder returns, supported by its solid free cash flow generation, best-in-class balance sheet, and the Utica shale expansion. Overall, Sorbara estimates $976.6 million of capital returns, representing 107.7% of free cash flow and a 6.0% capital returns yield. 178 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See EOG Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB) is the next dividend-paying stock in focus. Heading into WMB's Q2 results scheduled for early August, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $63. Meanwhile, Scotto lowered the Q2 projections to reflect insights from the conversations with the WMB team, seasonal adjustments to marketing estimates, and RBC's updated commodity price deck. Scotto expects sequential decline in commodity prices to be a modest headwind in the second quarter, particularly for WMB's upstream operations. The analyst expects Q2 results to be impacted by lower quarter-over-quarter marketing contributions due to normal seasonality and higher storage fees, partially offset by contributions from the recent investment in Cogentrix. On the positive side, Scotto is confident about WMB's long-term growth, backed by its robust backlog of projects with low build multiples (less than five-times capex to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), with planned in-services dates through 2030. "Despite its recent selloff, we still view WMB as one of the best positioned companies within our coverage universe to benefit from growing natural gas demand," said Scotto. 72 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Williams Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ). Verizon raised the lower end of its annual profit guidance, reflecting robust demand for its premium plans and its reaction to the new tax law under the Trump administration. The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, payable on Aug. 1. In reaction to the Q2 print, Citi analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on Verizon stock with a price forecast of $48. Also, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on VZ stock with a price target of $49. He added that key performance indicators (KPIs) were mixed and continue to reflect a more promotional competitive backdrop. Notably, Rollins trimmed his postpaid phone subscriber outlook to reflect a year-over-year rise in churn, which is expected to persist in the second half of the year. "Verizon indicated a more disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition, which is encouraging for competitive dynamics and its financials, albeit likely dilutive to its near-term volume KPIs," said Rollins. Despite additional promotional costs and lighter volume, Rollins believes that Verizon is well-positioned to deliver its full-year guidance. Overall, Rollins remains bullish on VZ stock, given its relative value and opportunities for the company to sustain annual financial growth. 276 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thailand and Cambodia on Sunday signaled their readiness to negotiate an end to a deadly border dispute following mediation efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump. The fighting, now in its fourth day, has killed at least 34 people and displaced more than 168,000. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday that he spoke to the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia and suggested he would not move forward with trade agreements with either country if the hostilities continued. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said Sunday his country agreed to pursue an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire." He said Trump told him that Thailand had also agreed to halt attacks following Trump's conversation with Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai. "This is positive news for the soldiers and people of both countries," Hun Manet said in a statement. He said he tasked his deputy, Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, to coordinate next steps with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and to engage directly with Thailand's foreign minister to implement the ceasefire. Phumtham thanked Trump and said that Thailand agreed in principle to a ceasefire but stressed the need for "sincere intention" from Cambodia, the Thai Foreign Ministry said. Phumtam called for swift bilateral talks to discuss concrete steps toward a peaceful resolution, it said. Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand closed its border crossings with Cambodia. Despite the diplomatic efforts, fighting continued Sunday along parts of the contested border, with both sides refusing to budge and trading blame over renewed shelling and troop movements. Col. Richa Suksowanont, a Thai army deputy spokesperson, said Cambodian forces fired heavy artillery into Surin province, including at civilian homes early Sunday. He said Cambodia also launched rocket attacks targeting the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple claimed by both countries, and other areas in a bid to reclaim territory secured by Thai troops. Richa said Trump's efforts to mediate was a "separate matter." The battlefield operations will continue and a ceasefire can only happen if Cambodia formally initiates negotiations, he added. "Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law," Thailand's Foreign Ministry said separately. Cambodian Defense Ministry spokesperson Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata accused Thai forces of escalating the violence with bombardment of Cambodian territory early Sunday, followed by a "large-scale incursion" involving tanks and ground troops in multiple areas. "Such actions undermine all efforts toward peaceful resolution and expose Thailand's clear intent to escalate rather than de-escalate the conflict," she said. Thailand on Sunday reported a new death of a soldier, bringing the total number of fatalities to 21, mostly civilians. Pichayut Surasit, an air-conditioning technician in Thailand, said the sudden outbreak of fighting meant leaving his work in Bangkok to return home to protect his family. I wanted to come back as soon as possible but I had to wait until the evening," he said. Now at a shelter in Surin housing some 6,000 evacuees, Pichayut worries for his wife and twin daughters, hoping the conflict will end soon so they can return to their home in Kap Choeng district, one of the hardest hit by shelling. Bualee Chanduang, a local vendor who moved to the same shelter Thursday with her family and pet rabbit, is counting on swift negotiations to end the violence. Human Rights Watch has condemned the reported use of cluster munitions, weapons banned by International law, in populated areas, and urged both governments to protect civilians. The 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But it has also invested heavily over the last several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media. Salary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech. That number is up substantially from about 1,100 for the same period two years before. Still, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in certain roles, and where the company is looking to grow. Walmart boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases. More than two-thirds of the company's 45,000 open positions worldwide as of July 23 are for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 550 openings are tech and analyst roles. The company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new EVP of AI acceleration, product and design who reports directly into the CEO and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms. Other employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant. Here's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CEO and cofounder of the startup fileAI describes himself as an introvert who's been able to push himself to go beyond what he finds comfortable. "We have to adapt," Schneider, whose company helps companies use their unstructured data, told Business Insider. Some of his fellow introverts could soon have to embrace Schneider's can-do approach or risk being sidelined by their more outgoing peers. That's because as AI takes over more tasks, much of the work that remains could involve human interactions, workplace observers told BI. "The extraverted personality has potentially an advantage here," Schneider said, because certain tasks can't be offloaded as easily to computers. For instance, a sales team might use AI to help with data entry or analyze call transcripts, but ChatGPT can't wine and dine a potential client — at least for now. A greater emphasis on these human tasks could be worrisome news for introverts and, of course, a win for the glad-handers. Even when they're good at what they do, some extroverts are able to propel their careers with a frenzy of fist bumps and finger guns. They can be charming," Elizabeth Lotardo, a leadership consultant, told BI. At least for now, she said, people who can easily build relationships in the workplace and draw insights from colleagues could have an edge. Schneider, from fileAI, said he expects that interpersonal skills will become "super important" as AI absorbs even more of the tasks that are currently keeping workers busy. "You're going to need a lot less people doing these things that keep them on their laptops eight hours a day," he said. Some labor market observers warn that roles comprised of routine tasks face the greatest risk of automation, though some companies hope to have AI take on far more. She said one worry she has is that when people use AI to interact less often with others and to create "nice, clean, empathetic emails or texts," the part of the brain that handles those responsibilities could begin to atrophy. While Druskat sees risks in introverts losing some ability to communicate with others at work if they rely too much on AI, there can be a tangible boost for more reserved employees. Brian Smith is an organizational psychologist who runs a leadership advisory firm. He's seen AI supercharge the abilities of some of the quieter people on his team, who he said sometimes found it difficult to engage with others. Smith said team members have been able to query AI models to better understand the feedback they're getting from clients. That, in turn, he said, has enabled introverted team members to become more confident and "start to have better human conversations with the people that they were originally having difficulty with." Yet for all the help AI can give workers of all personality types, it can't do everything, said Schneider, from fileAI. For now, a bot won't be a big help, he said, if he has to talk to an investor in person. "It can upskill me, and it can sort of give me the playbook, but at the end of the day, I'm going to be standing there, and I'm going to have to deliver," Schneider said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"For people that are wanting to pivot, I would pivot with information," the senior director and founder of the Envisioning Studio at Google told Business Insider. Lane, who started her career as a software developer and went on to create an AI prototyping lab that explores the impact of tech innovation on society, said that many people switch careers multiple times because they're uncertain. She said job seekers should gather as much information as possible to make sure that the career pivot they're making is the right move. That includes talking to people in the industry, watching YouTube videos about jobs that interest you, and trying out internships, Lane said. If you're earlier in your career, you should also try to choose a college that provides opportunities to gain work experience. The idea is to "constantly get some feedback," Lane said. Whether you're just starting out in the workforce or looking to make a shift mid-career, changing careers is common. However, Lane's advice comes amid an ongoing workforce transformation driven by AI advancements. A 2025 World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally expect to reduce staff in the next five years because of the new tech, meaning more people may be forced to adjust. "All the jobs are kind of evolving in this moment," Lane said. That's how Lane navigated multiple career pivots. After starting her career as a software developer, Lane moved to program management and then later on transitioned to leading AI ethics and society at Microsoft. After nearly two decades at Microsoft, Lane saw an opportunity for companies to engage more directly in conversations about the tools they were developing. That inspired her to build a team of creative strategists, philosophers, and researchers focused on discussing technology at Google. "I don't like when technology is built, and then people have to deal with decisions that were made that weren't really intentional," Lane, who is also a visual artist, told BI. Lane said when she was at Microsoft and was "poking around" for a new role, she met the person who would eventually become her boss at Google. Even though she had an idea of her interests at the time, Lane said it was important to pause and think about what she really wanted. "I wasn't prepared to just answer that on the fly," Lane said. After some thought, Lane prepared a one-page pitch about the lab she wanted to create, which ended up becoming a reality. If you find yourself following a path that doesn't make you excited, maybe it's not the right one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I think most would agree that the news cycle has been relentless for most of 2025, but certain stories do seem a little "Groundhog Day" at the moment. Earlier this month, I wrote about the conundrum facing the newsroom over how to approach President Donald Trump's then-trade talk deadline of July 9. Now, at the end of the month, we find ourselves in a similar position, but this time the date we are all watching is August 1. Once again, it's another deadline for countries across the globe to try and agree a trade truce with the United States, with the European Union in particular focus this time round. The week has become even trickier to predict, with talks between the U.S. and China now taking center stage in Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday — potentially further complicating the picture for Europe. A U.S. trade agreement with the European Union has seemed tantalizingly close, with CNBC's Silvia Amaro reporting that a 15% baseline tariff rate is the base-case scenario, according to an EU diplomat. These reports drove stock markets across Europe and the U.S. higher last week. As CNBC's Holly Ellyatt explains, the EU is keeping its so-called "trade bazooka" — or Anti Coercion Instrument — warm in case an agreement is not reached by the August deadline. The corporate world is crying out for an agreement, piling pressure on the European Union to put an end to the uncertainty. Puma, VW, Michelin and other corporates across Europe have downgraded their outlooks citing the impact of tariffs and the ongoing pressure the restrictions are putting on these businesses. This week, all eyes will be on another raft of earnings from Europe, including banking giants UBS, Santander and Standard Chartered, drinks firm Heineken, pharma giant AstraZeneca and energy major Shell to name a few. On the data front, GDP growth rates for France, Spain, Germany and Italy will be released on Wednesday, providing insight into the wider impact of the market uncertainty. Last week, the tricky economic conditions saw the European Central Bank opt for a hawkish hold of the benchmark rate at 2%, with President Christine Lagarde saying the ECB is "in a good place to hold and watch how risks develop over the next few months."
