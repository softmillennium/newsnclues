            With her short hair and unshowy clothing, Fan Chunli looks every bit the middle-aged woman from rural China. Among a crowd of youngsters vying to become the next breakout star in one of China's most popular stand-up comedy contests, she stands out.
    


            But when the 50-year-old takes the mic, she beams with life and drips sarcasm, unloading jokes about her abusive ex-husband that bring the audience into a mix of laughter and tears.
    


            Hailing from a place where simply knowing how to use the internet “makes me the Elon Musk of my village,” Fan is the latest sensation in China's booming scene for stand-up comedy, an artform that offers an outlet for pent-up grievances in a country that often stifles open discussion of politics or society.
    


            But Fan's acerbic takes on patriarchy and domestic abuse have alarmed some officials in China, where women's rights remain a sensitive issue. Trying to boost birth rates and thwart a looming demographic crisis, the ruling Communist Party is urging women to embrace traditional gender roles. It has cracked down hard on the country's nascent feminist movement, which it deems a malicious Western influence.
    


            During the performance that shot her to fame earlier this month, Fan laid bare the absurdity facing many victims of domestic violence in the country.
    


            She said she was beaten by her ex-husband. But when she told her parents she wanted a divorce, her father warned her not to bring disgrace to the family.
    


            “When men are involved in domestic violence, it's not shameful. When women demand a divorce, it's shameful,” she said, drawing cheers during her performance at The King of Stand-up Comedy, a popular contest streamed by online platform iQiyi.
    


            Fan's performance appears to have chagrined at least one local government.
    


            As footage of her routine went viral last week, officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang issued a warning saying such jokes are “catalysts that provoke” gender conflict.
    


            The statement didn't directly name Fan, or the show in question, alluding only to a newcomer dubbed an “industry gem” – the nickname given to her by the show's judges.
    


            “The content of some talk shows is gradually deviating from its nature of humor, simplifying gender issues and repeatedly making a fuss about the ‘opposition between men and women,'” the local government's publicity department wrote on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The province has no specific link to Fan or the TV show, but the department occasionally posts commentaries on recent trends.
    


            Any discussion of gender issues, it said, should be “rational.”
    


            China's government has cracked down on feminist activism over the past decade. Most notably, a group of women who became known as the “Feminist Five” were arrested after planning protests on public transport against sexual harassment in 2015.
    


            Authorities have, however, allowed some mild-mannered discussion on social media, while movies featuring feminist themes continue to screen without a problem – as long as they do not amount to a call for action, experts say.
    


            But Fan's background – provincial, not well off or highly educated – may be contributing to official disquiet over her popularity, adding an extra layer of scrutiny.
    


            “She's a middle-aged woman who comes from a rural background, not one of those typical urban liberal elite feminists,” said Meng Bingchun, a communications professor who researches feminism at the London School of Economics (LSE).
    


            “And this seems to indicate that this kind of discontent and grievance related to gender issues and the traditional Confucian, patriarchal values is probably more widespread than they (the authorities) are willing to acknowledge,” she told CNN.
    


            Traditional social codes can sometimes prove as strict as any government diktat. Late last year, Chinese e-commerce giant JD faced a boycott by customers infuriated by its casting of trailblazing woman comedian Yang Li in a promotional live stream.
    


            Those leading the action were apparently still stung by Yang's signature quip from five years ago, chiding mediocre men: “How come he looks so average, yet still so confident?”
    


            Bowing to the online backlash, the company apologized and severed ties with Yang.
    


            Fan has never openly identified herself as a feminist. But in a post on the online platform Weibo, she wrote that she believes leaving behind the social constraints of rural life can lead to “the awakening of women.”
    


            “For example, when I say I want a divorce in my village, I'm seen as an unpardonable villain,” she wrote.
    


            “But when I talk about my divorce outside, the audience applauds.”
    


            Growing up away from China's major cities, she didn't receive any formal education until the age of 8, she told Chinese state-owned Sanlian Lifeweek in an interview. But that soon ended after junior high.
    


            Raised in an era when opportunities mostly went to men, she recalled picking up a job in a city before getting married, and her mother handing all the money she sent home to her brother.
    


            “Girls growing up in rural villages have no rights to inherit anything. Not the house. Not the land,” she told Sanlian. “At the time… I just wanted to get married.”
    


            But after getting married, she found out “family and marriage trapped women, making it impossible for them to make money.”
    


            For Fan, life before stand-up was a cleaning job at an obscure village in her home province of Shandong, in China's northeast.
    


            Her path to stardom started with an unlikely twist.
    


            In 2023, struggling to make ends meet, she recalled selling her jewelry to see a performance by her idol, a comedian named Li Bo, state-run media reported.
    


            At the show, she was supposed to be roasted during an improv segment, but Fan's quick-witted responses impressed the performer, who decided to introduce Fan to the trade, she said.
    


            Fan has plenty of experience to draw on when it comes to divorce, having contemplated her own for more than two decades.
    


            “I was already thinking about getting a divorce when my eldest daughter was born,” she told Sanlian.
    


            The mother of two described her ex-husband as a gambler, whose absence left her to look after her sick father-in-law alone. She also poked fun at his uncouth manners, saying he ate congee – a popular Chinese rice porridge – directly from the ladle.
    


            One time her ex-husband and his father beat her up so badly that her face was covered in bruises, she alleged. She ran home to tell her parents that she wanted a divorce, only to be deterred by her mother, who told her to break up the relationship only if he was having an affair.
    


            The last straw was a year or two ago when she caught her husband once again going ladle-to-mouth with the congee. “This time,” she recalled thinking, “I'm leaving without looking back.”
    


            By then, Fan had already got a grounding in comedy performance, with slots at local comedy clubs. After leaving her husband – conceding both of their two houses to him, to get him to agree to a divorce – she decided to give stand-up a real shot, she said.
    


            During her viral performance, she moved from innocent self-mockery to full-throttled roasting of her ex-husband, who she calls a “corgi” because of his diminutive stature.
    


            “How tough is it for a rural auntie to come to the city for work for the first time?” she asks.
    


            Then she considered her current, dire situation.
    


            “I glanced at my husband beside me and thought, ‘I'm not scared of this challenge.'”
    


            Apart from her marriage, she also opened up about other taboo topics for Chinese women, such as oft-marginalized biological realities.
    


            Noting her newfound late-life stardom, she said that – unlike many women who retire when their periods stop – “my menopause will come with my debut.”
    


            Fans who CNN spoke to are rooting for the rising female comedy scene in China, pushing back against Zhejiang officials' warning against “gender opposition.”
    


            Zhang Yuanqi said she watched Fan's show with her mother, who similarly left an abusive home, a decade ago.
    


            She said comedians like Fan are “not trying to stir up ‘gender opposition'; they're just turning their life experiences into jokes.”
    


            “What we want to hear is our own lives,” she said.
    


            “I started to wonder if my mom had similar worries that she kept to herself, thinking she had to handle them alone,” Huang Xueyao, a 21-year-old university student, said.
    


            Fan touched on issues women encounter daily, she said, adding that she couldn't understand the local government's warnings. “They tell us to stop. What's really behind the officials' thinking?” added Huang, who said she hopes to take her mother to see Fan perform in person.
    


            Meng, from LSE, said the Chinese government is grappling to understand this newly emerging form of entertainment, which may explain the cautious approach, though the warning from the Zhejiang authorities is unlikely to have further consequences on Fan.
    


            As of Sunday, Fan's Weibo account remains active (a deactivation would be one of the first signs a performer has fallen afoul of China's censorship apparatus) – though some posts railing against the veiled official warning have been removed.
    


            For the rising performer, comedy is more than just a newfound career, but also a way of getting catharsis.
    


            “The biggest change in me since I've started doing stand-up comedy is that I no longer get angry at my ex-husband's every move,” Fan told Sanlian.
    


            “There is a feeling of reconciliation.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","‘He fumbled this 1,000%': How Ron DeSantis keeps making powerful enemies in Trump's GOP","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/27/politics/desantis-trump-rnc-chair-gruters","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Thirty minutes into a routine appearance Thursday on Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Ron DeSantis abruptly turned his fire on a fellow Republican, accusing a veteran state lawmaker of betraying the party's voters.
    


            Hours later, President Donald Trump endorsed that same lawmaker, Joe Gruters, to become the next chairman of the Republican National Committee.
    


            For DeSantis, the episode reinforced a pattern: picking fights that come back to haunt him.
    


            Trump's inner circle was already full of people who have no love lost for the Florida governor — a reality that has isolated DeSantis within his home state ever since he ended his 2024 presidential campaign. Now, the most powerful official post in the Republican Party is likely to be filled by another foe, further clouding the political ambitions of both DeSantis and his wife, Casey.
    


            Ron DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could find himself running in a presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned. Casey DeSantis, meanwhile, has taken steps toward succeeding her husband in Tallahassee next year in a race that would pit her against Rep. Byron Donalds, a Naples Republican backed by both Trump and Gruters.
    


            The elevation of Gruters to lead the RNC blindsided Gov. DeSantis, according to people close to his political operation. With Trump's support, Gruters had previously filed to run for chief financial officer of Florida in 2026, a statewide position, and the RNC reelected the current party chairman, Michael Whatley, to another term in January following the GOP's successes last fall. While Gruters was RNC treasurer, a promotion seemed unlikely anytime soon.
    


            It also appeared as though DeSantis and Trump had largely buried the hatchet after their contentious presidential primary last year. They stood side-by-side earlier this month for the opening of a new migrant detention center in the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” where they showered each other in compliments.
    


            “You are my friend, and you'll always be my friend, and we may have some skirmishes, even in the future. I doubt it, but I will always come back, because we have blood that seems to match pretty well,” Trump said.
    


            But the political playing field changed rapidly Thursday, when Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, decided not to run for Senate in North Carolina. Whatley, a former party chair in the Tar Heel State, then made clear that he would run instead with Trump's backing, leaving an opening atop the party.
    


            By then, DeSantis had spent weeks trying to take down Gruters. He appointed state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a close ally, to become the state's CFO and immediately backed him in the GOP primary against Gruters. In appearances around Florida, he shrugged off Trump's endorsement while bashing Gruters' conservative credentials.
    


            “If George Washington rose from the dead and came back and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Will you appoint Joe Gruters CFO?' My response would be, ‘No,'” DeSantis said earlier this month. “I can't do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead this state in a conservative direction.”
    


            The criticism continued Thursday when DeSantis appeared just outside Gruters' district to pile on more attacks. But that evening, Trump threw his support behind Whatley for US Senate and Gruters for RNC chair in a post on social media. The ramifications of DeSantis' maneuvering against Gruters quickly crystalized.
    


            “The governor did not see this coming at all,” a person close to DeSantis acknowledged. “He fumbled this 1,000%.”
    


            A spokesperson for DeSantis' political operation did not respond to questions from CNN. Gruters declined to comment. A person familiar with Gruters' thinking told CNN that he hopes to lead the party through the 2028 presidential cycle.
    


            DeSantis has long earned a reputation in Florida for burning bridges on the way to the top. At first, the approach paid off.
    


            In 2018, DeSantis flouted the party establishment by running for governor and knocking off the preferred Republican thanks to Trump's support. He then unceremoniously jettisoned the operatives who helped him win, including veteran Republican strategist Susie Wiles and top adviser James Blair. As he amassed political clout, he stepped over other Republicans in the state, including many in the congressional delegation, who grumbled at their lack of relationship with the state's pugnacious leader.
    


            For a time, it appeared DeSantis could be the future of the party, and he ran for president over the objections of Trump, his former friend.
    


            But as DeSantis' presidential campaign floundered, the enemies he made along the way resurfaced. Many of those members of Congress endorsed Trump over their home-state governor. Wiles became Trump's co-campaign manager. Trump ridiculed DeSantis en route to defeating him.
    


            After his November victory, Trump named Wiles his chief of staff and Blair to oversee his political operation from the White House. Chris LaCivita, Trump's other campaign manager who feuded with DeSantis during the presidential primary, is spearheading the GOP's midterm efforts. Other Floridians more loyal to Trump than DeSantis have been handed key roles, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            DeSantis has yet to course correct as he regroups in Florida. He continues to recruit candidates to go up against Donalds — one of those Republicans who endorsed Trump over the governor — if Casey DeSantis doesn't run. He has publicly clashed with state lawmakers from his own party for blocking his agenda, lobbing personal attacks.
    


            Still, few people in Florida politics once close to the governor could comprehend why Ron DeSantis didn't appoint Gruters as CFO to extend a low-stakes olive branch to Trump. Now, they said, he may pay a price.
    


            “His blind spot is he doesn't have a magnanimous bone in his body,” a veteran Republican fundraiser in Florida said. “Once he has a negative opinion of someone, he cannot pivot even out of political necessity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Austria may abandon neutrality for NATO","https://www.rt.com/news/622048-austria-nato-membership-debate/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 11:53:00 GMT","

Austria should be ready to discuss its potential membership in NATO, Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger has said. She acknowledged, however, that joining is unlikely to gain major public or parliamentary support at this stage.

In an interview with Die Welt published on Saturday, Meinl-Reisinger spoke about what she described as “an increasingly aggressive Russia,” which she claims is reluctant to conclude a peace deal with Ukraine.

Moscow has maintained it is open to dialogue, but insisted that any settlement must take into account its key security concerns, including that Kiev agree to permanently stay out of NATO.

According to Meinl-Reisinger, “neutrality alone does not protect us.” She explained that Austria should invest not only in “defense capabilities,” but also in military partnerships.

“I am fundamentally very open to a public debate” about Austria's future in this field, she said, adding: “While there is currently no majority in parliament or among the population for NATO membership, such a debate can nevertheless be very fruitful.”

The minister acknowledged that “it's not that I wanted to join NATO with flying colors,” but said that the country could not just sit on its hands and watch a changing geopolitical landscape.

A member of the EU since 1995, Vienna is constitutionally banned from joining any military blocs or hosting foreign troops and bases under the 1955 Austrian State Treaty. The country, which was part of Nazi Germany in World War II, agreed to the terms in exchange for regaining full sovereignty.

After the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Austria joined the Western sanctions against Russia, with Moscow designating it a “hostile state.”

Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Austria of abandoning its neutrality and the role of an intermediary in international conflicts following reports that Vienna is allowing continuous transit of weapons through its territory.

The United States and China traded accusations over Beijing's alleged role in the Ukraine conflict during a tense UN Security Council meeting on Friday.

Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused Beijing of secretly aiding Moscow, and urged China to “stop fueling Russia's aggression” in Ukraine.

“Beijing's claim to have implemented strong export controls on dual-use goods falls apart in the face of daily recovery of Chinese-produced components in the drones, weapons, and vehicles that Russia uses against Ukraine,” Shea said.

Beijing rejected the allegations, insisting it enforces strict controls on exports.

“China did not start the war in Ukraine, is not a party to the conflict, has never provided lethal weapons, and has always strictly controlled dual-use materials, including the export of drones,” Deputy UN Ambassador Geng Shuang told the meeting.

“We urge the US to stop shifting blame on the Ukraine issue or creating confrontation and instead play a more constructive role in promoting a ceasefire and peace talks,” he added.

Washington has maintained that Chinese firms are helping Moscow bypass Western sanctions by exporting goods and technologies with potential military applications. US officials have warned that companies linked to Russia's defense sector could face secondary sanctions if such support continues. The US has authorized $175 billion in aid for Ukraine since February 2022.

Beijing has offered to help mediate an end to the conflict and argued that sanctions destabilize global supply chains and harm developing economies. Chinese officials have stressed that attempts to isolate Russia will not bring peace.

Moscow has also rejected claims of Chinese involvement, asserting that its weapons are domestically produced. Russian officials have accused Western nations of exploiting the UN to pressure states that refuse to enforce the sanctions, calling such efforts politically motivated and illegal under international law.

Ukrainian membership in the European Union would threaten Hungary's security and raise the risk of war in the region, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said.



Ukraine, which was granted EU candidate status in 2022, has made joining the bloc a national priority. While Brussels has floated 2030 as a possible accession date, all current member states must approve the move.



Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland remain opposed, citing concerns over the country's preparedness and the financial strain its membership could place on the EU. Warsaw has additionally insisted that Kiev come to terms with war crimes committed by Ukrainians during WWII.  



In an interview with Kossuth Radio on Friday, Orban said that Hungary, which shares a border with Ukraine, would be especially vulnerable to any escalation resulting from the EU's expansion. He argued that Kiev's full membership would come with ""war risks.""



""Ukraine is a buffer state, and we do not wish to share its fate. We understand what that means, having once been on the western periphery of the Soviet Union,"" he said.

""If Ukraine's membership is accepted, then we will become the battlefield. The war will geographically affect the neighboring region. This is unacceptable. A lot of young Hungarians would also die. This is not a tactical issue, but an existential one,"" Orban added. He proposed a strategic partnership with the EU as an alternative to full accession.



Earlier this week, Orban – a frequent critic of EU leadership – rejected the European Commission's proposed seven-year budget, warning that it could “destroy the European Union."" He claimed the proposal was designed primarily to finance Ukraine's membership, citing estimates that up to 25% of the budget could be allocated to Kiev.



Budapest has blocked multiple EU military aid packages for Kiev and has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire with Russia. Hungary has also warned that the financial and security implications of Ukraine's integration could outweigh any potential benefits, framing the issue as a matter of national survival rather than political preference.

Police investigate death of Ke'Torrius Starkes Jr, three, who was left inside car by contractor for state human resources

An investigation has been triggered after a three-year-old boy died after being left in a hot car by a contractor for the state human resources department in Alabama.

Ke'Torrius Starkes Jr, who was in foster care, had been picked up in the late morning on Tuesday by the worker after a supervised visit with his father, the New York Times reported. He was supposed to be transported to a day care program by a worker for the department, which oversees child protection other social services.

Instead the boy was left alone strapped in a vehicle with tinted windows on a hot day in Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham.

The Birmingham police department said officers went to a private home in Bessemer to respond to a report of an unresponsive child at around 5.30pm and found that the boy was “accidentally left inside of a vehicle while in the care of a third-party contracted worker through the Department of Human Resources”.

The boy was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.

The chief deputy coroner of Jefferson county, Bill Yates, told the Times that “the child was found in a car that was ignition off, doors closed, windows up and it was hot in the car” and so far there was “no other competing cause of death”.

“A child in DHR custody was being transported by a contract provider when the incident occurred,” a spokesperson for Alabama DHR said in a statement. “The provider has terminated their employee. Due to confidentiality, DHR cannot comment further regarding the identity of the child or the exact circumstances.”

A man and a woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park as police seek a white male suspect

Two people were found dead along a walking trail in a state park in Arkansas, authorities said Sunday.

A 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park in Washington county, according to the Arkansas state police. Its criminal investigation unit is handling what it calls a “suspected homicide”.

The suspect is a white male wearing dark shorts, a dark tank top and weight-lifting type gloves. He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan whose license plate may have been covered by electrical or duct tape.

The vehicle may have been traveling on State Highway 170 or State Highway 220 near the park, police said.

The victims' bodies were being taken to the Arkansas state crime lab, where the manner and cause of death will be determined.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia wants to resolve its war in Ukraine through ""diplomatic and political means"" but would continue military operations until its ""goals"" are achieved, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on July 27.

Responding to a question from Russian state-controlled news agency Tass, Peskov said that ""the goals of (war) must be fulfilled before the principles of future relations with Ukraine can be determined.""  

Russia continues to push for the same core demands it outlined at the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022: a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, large-scale demilitarization of the country, and legal ""guarantees"" for the Russian language, culture, and Moscow-linked religious groups in Ukraine. 

The Kremlin has also demanded constitutional changes in Ukraine, including recognition of four Ukrainian oblasts as Russian territory, along with the Crimean peninsula, which it seized in 2014. 

Peskov claimed Russia would ""prefer"" to resolve the conflict through dialogue, but said military operations continue because ""opponents rejected the path of negotiations.""

Kyiv has consistently supported negotiations but refused to accept Russia's maximalist conditions, which are essentially capitulation.

Ukraine has also consistently rejected all demands that involve ceding territory or weakening its military. President Volodymyr Zelensky and top officials have said any peace must begin with an unconditional ceasefire. 

Peskov's comments came days after the third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, where Ukraine reiterated its call for a full ceasefire and humanitarian agreements. 

The latest round of peace talks between the two sides took place in Istanbul on July 23, marking the third formal meeting since negotiations resumed earlier this year after a long pause.

Ukrainian officials proposed a meeting between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of August, but the Russian side again declined the idea of a meeting between the two leaders.

Russia's delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, proposed creating three working groups to address political, military, and humanitarian issues. Moscow also offered to facilitate brief ceasefires to retrieve wounded soldiers and repatriate bodies and claimed it would return the remains of 3,000 Ukrainian servicemen through the Red Cross.

The revived diplomatic push comes as the U.S. increases pressure on Russia to end the war. On July 14, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he would impose ""severe"" tariffs on Russia unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days.

A Russian drone targeting a bus reportedly killed three and injured 20 in Sumy Oblast on July 27, according to local media.



The decision to cancel the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg, an event traditionally held on the last Sunday of July, was announced by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on July 27, who said it was made ""for security reasons.""

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the decree synchronizes Ukraine's sanctions with European sanctions. ""As of now, all 18 sanctions packages are fully aligned and in effect in Ukraine,"" Zelensky wrote.

""We assessed your attempt yesterday to hit all of us at once,"" Brovdi said in the Telegram post,  without offering further details. The post ended with a string of insults aimed at the Russian forces behind the alleged attack.

Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russian forces launched 83 drones overnight, 78 of which were taken out by air defenses.

""Despite having very good interactions with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and phone calls, it never leads to anything,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. ""So, the time has come for some action.""

The number includes 920 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

As another sign of deepening bilateral relations, Russia is set to launch direct passenger flights from Moscow to Pyongyang on July 27, marking the first air connection between the two capitals in decades.

Russian forces launched an overnight attack on Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast on July 26, targeting civilian infrastructure and leaving three people injured, local authorities reported.

The alleged MEK operatives were convicted of manufacturing and using homemade projectiles to target homes, public buildings, and charitable institutions in Tehran.

Iran executed two men accused of working for the dissident organization Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), according to the judiciary's official news outlet, Mizan on Sunday.

Mehdi Hassani and Behrouz Ehsani-Eslamloo were found guilty of carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure on behalf of the exiled opposition group.

They were convicted of manufacturing and using homemade projectiles to target homes, public buildings, and charitable institutions in Tehran.

The judiciary said they operated from a safe house and filmed their activities for MEK-linked media.

""The terrorists, in coordination with MEK leaders, had set up a team house in Tehran, where they built launchers and hand-held mortars in line with the group's goals, fired projectiles heedlessly at citizens, homes, service and administrative facilities, educational and charity centres, and also carried out propaganda and information-gathering activities in support of the MEK,"" the judiciary report said.

Both were found guilty of waging war against God, armed rebellion, and plotting to undermine national security. The Supreme Court had upheld their death sentences.

The MEK, a leftist-Islamist group, is designated as a terrorist organization by Iran. The US and the European Union had also labelled it as a terrorist organization until 2012.

The MEK opposes the Islamic Republic in Iran, even as its leadership operates in exile.

According to human rights groups, Iran ranks second in the world in enforcing capital punishment.

Turkey is hit by a record high temperature of 50.5 degrees as southeastern Europe reels under a heat wave and battles wildfires.

Turkey's Environment Ministry said meteorologists had registered a reading of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeast of the country, setting a nationwide record.

The record temperature was registered on Friday at Silopi, the ministry said in a post on X on Saturday.

Silopi is 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria.

The previous heat record, registered in August 2023, was 49.5 degrees Celsius.

Turkey is sweltering under a heat wave that has hit much of the eastern Mediterranean since Monday and is expected to last several more days.

The Environment Ministry said 132 weather stations across Turkey registered record temperatures for July.

Temperatures are up to 12 degrees Celsius higher than seasonal averages, Turkey's meteorological service said earlier this week.

Hospitals have reported a surge in cases of dehydration, heatstroke and foodborne illnesses, according to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet.

Temperatures above seasonal norms have been exacerbated by strong winds and dry conditions, resulting in dozens of wildfires across the country.

A new fire broke out on Friday close to high-rise apartments in the popular Mediterranean resort city of Antalya in southern Turkey.

Homes were evacuated in the city center on Friday and the outlying district of Aksu as the fire advanced.

At 46.1 degrees Celsius, July temperatures in Antalya city were the highest for the month since records began in 1930.

Blazes were also reported in the provinces of Karabuk, Sakarya and Bilecik in northern Turkey, forcing the evacuation of several villages.

On Wednesday, 13 people died fighting a fire in Eskisehir province in western Turkey.

Speaking after Friday prayers, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ""faced with a truly great disaster.""

He said 25,000 personnel were fighting fires across the country, assisted by 27 planes, 105 helicopters and 6,000 ground vehicles.

The heat wave in the eastern Mediterranean region has left countries such as Greece, Cyprus and Albania reeling under extreme heat or fighting fires.

Greece on Saturday asked the European Union help to battle wildfires that have sprung up in different regions.

One of the worst fires broke out just north of Athens, destroying houses and forcing police to evacuate homes.

Strong winds were fanning the blaze near Athens and other sites and the Peloponnese peninsula that juts out west of the capital, fire brigade spokesperson Vasileios Vathrakogiannis said on Saturday, according to the AFP news agency.

They were also feeding the flames on the islands of Crete, Euboea and Kythera, he added. ""The hard part is ahead of us,"" he told reporters.

The fires broke out nearly a week into a heat wave, in which temperatures in Greece passed 45 degrees Celsius.

Greek authorities shut the Acropolis, the country's top archaeological site, during the hottest part of the day from midday to 5 p.m. for much of the week, including Saturday. They warned tourists to stay in the shade.

Drought combined with tapping too much groundwater and heavy rains have sped up the formation of sinkholes, huge craters that suddenly appear and leave gaping holes behind. What can we do to minimize risk?

On the northeastern tip of the Brazilian Amazon, houses teeter on the edge of huge chasms that have suddenly opened up in the ground. The massive sinkholes put over a thousand people at risk of losing their homes, prompting the state government to declare an emergency.

Such sinkholes have appeared in cities in all around the world, including the US, Turkey and Iran. They can appear suddenly, posing threats to lives and homes.

Sinkholes are depressions in the ground formed when water erodes soil. This can happen naturally when rainfall trickles through the soil, dissolving underlying bedrock. But it can also be the result of leaky underground water pipes, fracking for fossil fuels and mining activity.

Sinkholes are more likely to occur in regions with ""karst terrain"" — areas made up of soluble bedrock such as limestone, salt beds, or gypsum — that can be dissolved by groundwater, said Hong Yang, environmental science professor with the UK's University of Reading. Yang has recently published research on mitigating sinkhole hazards intensified by climate change.

""In the United States, about 20% of the land is susceptible, with Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania experiencing the most significant damage,"" he told DW. Other hot spots include the UK, specifically areas like Ripon and the Yorkshire Dales in Northern England, Italy's Lazio region, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, parts of China, Iran and Turkey.

Climate change is increasing the frequency of sinkholes by intensifying extreme weather events, according to research.

""Droughts lower the water table, removing subterranean support for the land above. When followed by intense storms or heavy rain — which are also becoming more common due to climate change — the sudden weight and saturation of water can cause the weakened ground to collapse,"" said Yang.

He pointed to Turkey's breadbasket, the Konya Plain in central Anatolia. It's a karst terrain where increasing drought means more sinkholes are now opening up in populated regions. 

Before the 2000s, researchers in the area used to register one sinkhole every few years, said Fetullah Arik, a professor at Konya Technical University who heads the university's sinkhole research center. In 2024 alone, they documented 42.

Groundwater levels across the Konya Basin have dropped by at least 60 meters (197 feet) compared to 1970.

""In some areas close to the basin edges, groundwater cannot be found, although wells deeper than 300 meters are drilled,"" he added.

Drought linked to climate change is lowering groundwater levels because rainfall is not replenishing water sources. But because people still need access to water, they are pumping lots of it, which in turn, exacerbates the risk of sinkholes. In populated areas, that also means buildings are more vulnerable to collapse.

""If you pull water out of a juice box too fast, the sides cave in,"" said Antonios E. Marsellos, associate professor of geology, environment, and sustainability at Hofstra University in the state of New York.""That's like pumping too much groundwater, so the support of the underground weakens and may collapse just like the juice box that bent."" 

Marsellos, who published research on climate change effects on sinkhole formations,

said it's made worse in big cities with air pollution where water gets more acidic and breaks down rock faster.

Marsellos and his team looked at freeze-thaw cycles in Long Island, New York, over a period of close to 80 years and found that increased temperatures due to climate change has weakened the stability of the soil and has a direct impact on sinkhole formations.

Experts rely on technologies such as satellite remote sensing and ground-penetrating radar to detect subtle ground subsidence and underground voids to spot sinkholes before they collapse, said Yang. Other detection methods include monitoring groundwater levels and conducting geotechnical surveys before building in the area.

If an empty void is found underground, experts then act like a dentist, said Marsellos.

""It's exactly the same thing that we do — we check if there is any cavity, basically any empty space under the ground that eventually will not be able to hold that empty space.""

Depending on local conditions such as the makeup of the rock and tectonic activity, the cavity could then be filled, with cement, for instance, he said.

In Turkey's Konya Basin region, where over 80% of the water consumed is used by agriculture, Akir said the most important factor is to regulate excessive groundwater use so the soil has that natural stabilizer underneath. Farmers have now switched to more efficient irrigation techniques.

The region has also tried out a number of water transfer projects, such as the Blue Tunnel project, which takes water from Goksu River to help fill the Konya Plain.

Other prevention strategies include controlling drainage and fixing leaks and enforcing strict building codes, Yang said. ""Engineering solutions can stabilize the ground by injecting grout to fill voids, compacting loose soil, or using geogrid technology to reinforce the land.""

            Ezra Klein begins one of his recent podcasts by telling a joke that has been making the rounds. Basically, a conspiracy theorist dies and ascends to heaven. God is there to greet him and explains that as part of the celestial welcome, he will answer any question the man has.
    


            “Please, I must know the answer to this one,” the man says, “who killed John F. Kennedy?” God answers instantly, “That's easy: Lee Harvey Oswald.” Shocked, the man murmurs, “This goes higher than I had thought!”
    


            This is the dilemma in which Donald Trump finds himself. Whatever he does to deflect and distract from the Jeffrey Epstein morass only deepens the suspicions — including those about the two men's relationship.
    


            According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 69% of Americans, including 62% of Republicans, believe the government is hiding Epstein's alleged client list. This is understandable; there are so many unanswered questions about Epstein. How did he become so rich? What is in the mountains of computer files and videos recovered from his homes and properties? Since he had already tried to commit suicide once while in jail, why was he not monitored properly afterward?
    


            But there is a larger problem for Trump. Since the “birther” charges against Barack Obama, he has encouraged, ridden and profited from a wave of conspiracy theories that accused the so-called deep state of all kinds of crimes, which were then quickly covered up.
    


            Now he presides over that very state and has control of all the secrets. Why will he not reveal them?
    


            Conspiracy theories have a long and rich history in the United States. Americans lived as second-class citizens of the British Empire, far from the center of authority in London. They imagined all kinds of plots being hatched in London to keep them subordinate and servile. That turned into what the historian Richard Hofstadter in 1964 called “the paranoid style in American politics,” with periodic eruptions of rabid fear of Freemasons, Catholics, Jews, bankers and communists.
    


            Joseph McCarthy defined the modern age of conspiracy theory, charging that the American government had been taken over by traitors and spies for foreign powers.
    


            The journalist Anna Merlan brought the story up to date in a deeply reported 2019 book, “Republic of Lies,” in which she argued that in recent decades, conspiracy theories entered into mainstream politics. Unlike earlier eras when conspiracy theorists were mostly powerless outsiders, they are now central — and increasingly normalized — figures in American political and cultural life.
    


            Donald Trump is the main character in this story, having come to power and returned to power after aggressively promoting birtherism, election fraud and many other conspiracies. He has also brought into the mainstream people like Alex Jones and Kash Patel, who have trafficked in even more extreme theories and insinuations. Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, spread the lie that Hillary Clinton was connected to child sex rings.
    


            The challenge for Trump is that, having long fanned the flames of anti-statism and anti-elitism, he now sits in the White House, running the state and its elites. His administration has released thousands of files about the murders of JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
    


            There were no smoking guns revealing any major conspiracy, but no one in the administration can quite bring themselves to admit that. It would suggest that prior administrations and elites had not in fact been lying to the American people.  But to do that is to lose credibility with their base.
    


            Trump is an artful politician who knows how to handle his base. But this time it is proving tough even for him — perhaps because he clearly had some kind of relationship with Epstein. He has tried to deflect attention by raising other conspiracy theories — chiefly, that Obama tried to organize a coup against him.
    


            He brought up old allegations about Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. But they all have the feeling of desperation about them.
    


            As Charlie Warzel notes in The Atlantic, on July 20, when the questions about Epstein were mounting, Trump posted on Truth Social 33 times. He demanded that the Washington Commanders football team change its name back to the Redskins and shared an AI-generated video of Obama being handcuffed by the FBI in front of a smiling Trump in the Oval Office.
    


            Patel, the FBI director, recently claimed on Joe Rogan's podcast that he has found a secret vault in the FBI, full of dark secrets no one had ever seen. Forget about Epstein, they seem to be saying; it turns out there are hundreds more conspiracy theories to dangle in front of the MAGA faithful.
    


            Trump's ferocious response to the Epstein affair will likely only deepen the public's distrust toward institutions and politicians, create more online radicalization, and further hollow out our polarized political ecosystem. But he is playing with fires that may for the first time, if not consume him, then burn him badly.

            At least 21 people were killed on Sunday in an attack on church premises in eastern Congo by Islamic State-backed rebels, according to a civil society leader.
    


            The attack was carried out by members of the Allied Democratic Force (ADF) around 1 a.m. inside the premises of a Catholic church in eastern Congo's Komanda. Several houses and shops were also burnt.
    


            “More than 21 people were shot dead inside and outside and we have recorded at least three charred bodies and several houses burned. But the search is continuing,” Dieudonne Duranthabo, a civil society coordinator in Komanda, told The Associated Press.
    


            Earlier this month, the group killed dozens of people in Ituri in what a United Nations spokesperson described as a bloodbath.
    


            A spokesperson for the Congolese army in Ituri province, where Komanda is located, confirmed 10 dead.
    


            “What we know this morning is that there was an incursion by armed men with machetes into a church not far from Komanda, where about 10 people were killed and massacred and some shops were set on fire,” Lt. Jules Ngongo, the DRC Army's spokesperson in Ituri, said.
    


            The ADF, with ties with the Islamic State, is a rebel group that operates in the borderland between Uganda and Congo, has routinely conducted attacks against civilian populations.
    


            “We are truly disappointed because it is incredible that such a situation could occur in a town where all the security officials are present,” Duranthabo said. “Some citizens have started fleeing the area and are heading towards Bunia.
    


            “We demand military intervention as soon as possible, since we are told the enemy is still near our town.”
    


What's driving the deadly conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo? An expert explains



            The ADF was formed by disparate small groups in Uganda in the late 1990s following alleged discontent with Yoweri Museveni.
    


            In 2002, following military assaults by Ugandan forces, the group moved its activities to neighboring DRC and has since been responsible for the killings of thousands of civilians. In 2019, it pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The ADF's leadership conceives of an Islamist government in the East African country.
    


            The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) has long struggled against the rebel group, and it has now been grappling with a complex web of attacks since the renewed hostilities between the Rwanda-backed M23.

            If you regularly make donations to tax-exempt charities and non-profits, you should be aware of upcoming rule changes governing how much of your contributions will be deductible.
    


            Some of the changes, which are in President Donald Trump's recently enacted federal tax-and-spending cuts packag﻿e, affect filers who take the standard deduction. Others affect filers who itemize — which you do when your individual deductions combined exceed the standard.
    


            Here's a rundown of some key changes that will take effect in 2026:
    


            In the first two years of the pandemic, if you took the standard deduction on your federal income tax return, you also were allowed to deduct an additional $300 ($600 for married couples filing jointly) for charitable cash gifts you made. That special provision then expired.
    


            But, starting in 2026 you will be allowed to deduct up to $1,000 in cash donations ($2,000 for joint filers).
    


            “This applies only to direct cash gifts to qualifying 501(c)(3) charities — not donor-advised funds or private foundations,” said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals.
    


            Starting in 2026, those who itemize their deductions will — for the first time — be allowed to deduct their cash contributions ﻿only to the extent they exceed 0.5% of their adjusted gross income.

Here's who will — and won't — qualify for the new car loan interest deduction



            For example, say your adjusted gross income is $100,000. You will be allowed to deduct the amount of your total cash gifts minus $500 (0.5% of $100,000. So if you make $2,000 in cash contributions, you only will be allowed to deduct $1,500.
    


            An existing rule that further limits itemizers will remain in effect: It sets a ceiling for how much you may deduct of your contributions to public charities in a given year. Specifically, you can't deduct the portion of your cash donations that exceed 60% of your AGI in the year you make them, O'Saben said. (The AGI limit is typically 30% for cash gifts made to donor-advised funds and private foundations, he added.)
    


            But you may be able to deduct any cash gifts you made outside the allowable limits in the next tax year. That's thanks to another existing rule that lets itemizers carry forward their “excess” contributions for five years and deduct them on future returns. The “excess” is any portion of your cash donations that exceeds the AGI ceiling and, starting next year, falls below the new floor of 0.5% of AGI.
    


            Say your AGI is $100,000 next year. You will be allowed to carry forward the first $500 of your cash gifts (0.5% x $100,000) plus any remainder of your donations above $60,000 (60% of your AGI).
    


            Lastly, O'Saben noted, “You cannot double-dip. If itemizing, you're not eligible for the $1,000/$2,000 deduction, as that's reserved for non-itemizers.”
    


            The value of one's deductions for anyone whose taxable income puts them in the top tax bracket of 37% will be treated as if they were in the 35% bracket.

            Here's how that will work: Say you itemize and are allowed to deduct $10,000 in cash donations after accounting for the new 0.5% of AGI rule above. Typically, the itemized charitable deductions will reduce your tax bill by an amount equal to your top tax rate multiplied by your deductible cash donations.
    


            But if you're in the 37% bracket, you won't get the full $3,700 (37% x $10,000) in tax savings. You will reduce your tax liability by only $3,500 (35% x $10,000), O'Saben explained.
    


            If you itemize, any non-cash contributions you make – such as clothes, food or household goods – are also subject to the new 0.5%-of-AGI floor.
    


            If you're taking the standard deduction, you won't be able to deduct your non-cash contributions since the $1,000/$2,000 limit for non-itemizers applies only to cash gifts.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge.

Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Philadelphia started the day a half-game behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.

Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series.

Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches.

Judge was out of the Yankees' starting lineup for just the second time this season. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said.

New York fell a season-high 6 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break.

Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season.




Ryan McMahon went 1 for 3 with a walk in his Yankees debut, a day after the third baseman was acquired from Colorado for a pair of pitching prospects.

Marcus Stroman (2-2) allowed four runs, five hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings.

Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half.

Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup.

New York is 21-28 following a 35-20 start.

New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss his push to move New Yorkers to Florida, the GOP aiming to confirm President Donald Trump's nominees and his meeting with Venezuelan leader Maria Corina Machado. 

Florida Sen. Rick Scott flew an aerial ad across the skies of New York City on Saturday with a message encouraging residents to relocate to the Sunshine State to escape socialism, should Zohran Mamdani become mayor of the Big Apple.

The banner was seen above Coney Island and Jones Beach as beachgoers soaked up the sun. 

""Hate socialism?"" read Scott's aerial ad. ""Us too! Move 2 FL.""

Scott addressed the aerial banner in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""While many New Yorkers are out enjoying the beach this weekend, we will be giving them a friendly reminder that in addition to our world class beaches, Florida is the state where you can escape socialism,"" said Scott, who headed the state as governor from 2011-2019.

The Republican senator slammed New York City and the politics of Mamdani.

""New York City once represented the American Dream – a city where anything was possible,"" Scott said. ""Today, it has now become the city where only billionaires can prosper, Jewish students are attacked on campus, capitalism is shunned and radical socialists like Zohran Mamdani are celebrated.""

Mamdani handily won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary last month against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is seen as a frontrunner in the race for City Hall, though many in the Democratic establishment have yet to fully embrace the socialist nominee.

Scott said New York City reaped the rewards of capitalism, ""the best system in the world,"" which is now ""being villainized by the Democrats all across this country.""

""Democrats are working around the clock to discredit President Trump and tear down our country and rebuild it in their woke, radical image through socialist policies,"" the Republican said. ""But, this isn't new.  It's just an old, barbaric, discredited idea that's failed every time it's been tried.  Just look at Cuba and Venezuela and the many families who fled those brutal regimes to live in Florida.""

Scott said that during his time in political office he worked to ensure that families in Florida could achieve the American Dream, including good jobs, education and safe communities.

""That is the American Dream and it is deeply unfortunate that it is completely slipping away in New York,"" he said. ""New York families deserve better.""

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., weighs in on Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Israeli and Qatari officials in Rome as the Trump administration continues the push for a ceasefire in Gaza.

The State Department and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have joined a chorus of analysts this week in warning Fox News Digital of ""significant threats to U.S. national security"" from the actions of Iran in Africa. 

Tehran is accused of reportedly buying uranium in Niger, supplying drones in violation of a U.N. arms embargo to forces in Sudan and promoting the growth of destabilizing Islamist fundamentalism and terrorism on the continent.

""Iran's long arm of terror stretches around the globe, including in Africa"", Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, told Fox News Digital, adding, ""Iran is an enemy to freedom everywhere, and a threat to U.S. national security; our partners in Africa must proceed with caution before engaging with this dangerous, authoritarian regime.""

Reports surfaced initially last year from first the French media outlet Africa Intelligence, and then the Washington-based NGO the Institute for Science and International Security, that the West African nation of Niger had been negotiating the sale to Tehran of $56 million worth of so-called yellow cake – uranium oxide. The 300 tons of uranium, some of which, one source suggests, has been partly delivered already, would allegedly be enough to make 30 nuclear weapons.

Analysts say Niger could be preparing to sell even more ‘yellow cake' to Iran. Uranium in the country has up until recently been mined by mostly French companies, such as Orano. But Niger's military leaders, who came to power in a coup in 2023, announced that they will revoke mining licenses and nationalize mining operations. Iran is said to want to strike a deal to start uranium mining itself in Niger, particularly around Imouraren, an area where the ground is estimated to contain 200,000 tons of the metal.

In a move seen to be towards Russia and Iran, Niger ended an agreement with the Biden administration last year, which led to the closing of two U.S. military bases in the country that were used for anti-terror operations.

‘PEACEMAKER' TRUMP CAN END AFRICA'S BIGGEST WAR, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR SAYS

""In Niger, French outlets covering the continent have reported that there is a secret agreement between Iran and Niger trading uranium oxide for either drones or energy,"" Behnam Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. Taleblu, senior Director of the Iran Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) added, ""The Islamic Republic is an opportunistic actor, both in the Middle East and further abroad.""

A State Department spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Iran's activities in Africa are on their radar, saying, ""On Niger, we are monitoring the possibility of an Iranian acquisition of uranium. We would have serious concerns about Niger, or any country, transferring uranium to Iran.""

The spokesperson continued, ""Iran's continued development of its nuclear program, (and its) role as the leading state sponsor of terrorism, and destabilizing regional behavior, pose significant threats to U.S. national security and to global stability.

""The President has been clear: Iran cannot ever have a nuclear weapon.""

Iran, said to be interested in Sudan's gold, has been supplying Mohajer-6 drones to Khartoum's government, according to the U.S. Africa Command's Africa Defense Forum. They were used effectively by Sudan in recently reclaiming the capital city, Khartoum and the Presidential Palace.

The FDD's Taleblu added, ""Iranian drones are active on four continents today, one of which is the African continent, particularly when looking at the conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia.""

The State Department spokesperson weighed in ""On Sudan, we are aware of reports. Both the RSF and the SAF have used weapons acquired from foreign actors against the civilian population and infrastructure and have committed human rights violations and abuses.

""Supplying arms to any of the belligerents prolongs the conflict and heightens the risk of further destabilization in Sudan and the region. The United States calls for an end to all external support to the warring parties, and urges all our partners to press for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities, and increased, unhindered humanitarian access,"" the spokesperson concluded.

Then there is Iran's reported psychological warfare against Africa's communities. ""Iran's core Africa strategy is to export its ideology into those communities as a counter-balance to what it sees as anti-Iranian efforts in the Middle East,"" Frans Cronje, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom and a former head of the South African Institute of Race Relations told Fox News Digital.

IRAN VOWS RETALIATION IF UN SECURITY COUNCIL ISSUES SNAPBACK SANCTIONS ON ANNIVERSARY OF NUCLEAR DEAL

Cronje continued, ""Africa has 1.5 billion people. Approximately a third of those are Muslim and make up a quarter of all Muslims worldwide, more than the number in the Middle East. Muslims serve as dominant groups across much of North Africa and down the African east coast."" 

""The Iranian Africa strategy can be thought of as having three components,"" Cronje stated. ""The first is the provision of training and material support to extremist groups in Africa to aid in the export of terror globally, and to target Christians and pro-Western communities on the continent, whilst creating a high-threat environment for Western investors.

""To that end the global terror threat index scores for several African countries have come to exceed those of traditional Middle Eastern terror staples. Africa's Christians face increasing volumes of horrific attacks, including Christian church burnings and beheadings, and it has become common for Africa to account for the bulk of global terror-related deaths annually.

In this June 6, 2018, frame grab from Islamic Republic Iran Broadcasting, IRIB, state-run TV, three versions of domestically built centrifuges are shown in a live TV program from Natanz, an Iranian uranium enrichment plant, in Iran.  

""The second is to identify both Shia and Sunni communities that can be radicalized against the West as well as against Iranian opponents in the Arab world. Iran has employed Al-Mustafa academic and cultural centers in over 30 African countries to train clerics and religious leaders.

""A third pillar of the strategy is that Iran has deepened diplomatic and economic cooperation ties with scores of African governments and business organizations to win trade and investment deals that help it evade global sanctions, as well as securing the diplomatic support of African governments on global fora such as the U.N., for measures ranging from its nuclear weapons program to its investment in proxy forces that threaten Israel.

""For example,"" Cronje concluded, ""just a few months ago, over 700 delegates from nearly 40 African countries attended an investment conference in Tehran.""

Summing up, the FDD's Taleblu said ""the threat the Islamic Republic poses on the African continent is both significant and diverse. From seeking to export its revolution through religious indoctrination via state-linked religious seminaries, to drone sales, the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism has not missed this opportunity to cause chaos while flying below the radar of the West.""

A 12-foot-sculpted head of Elon Musk with the phrase ""Make America Wait Again"" is turning heads at Yosemite, Arches and Mt. Rainier National Parks this summer.

EXCLUSIVE: During this high summer season, visitors to several of America's most iconic national parks have found themselves face to face with something unexpected: the towering 12-foot-sculpted head of Elon Musk, smirking confidently atop a trailer. 

It's flanked by patriotic stars and a two-part message: ""MAKE AMERICA WAIT AGAIN"" and, in bold yellow below, ""Now With Longer Lines Thanks to DOGE Cuts.""

The sculpture has made surprise appearances at Arches, Yosemite and Mt. Rainier National Parks, drawing curious crowds and fueling viral conversations online.

Now, the anonymous organizer behind the spectacle has come forward exclusively to Fox News Digital to explain why he built it, why he picked Musk — President Donald Trump's former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leader and policy advisor — and why he wanted it seen in America's favorite outdoor spaces.

""You're not the first outlet people would expect to run this,"" the anonymous backer said during a phone interview. ""Which is exactly why I wanted to talk to you.""

Identifying only as a concerned citizen and ""curious reader,"" the man insists he has no ties to any political organization, nonprofit, or corporate interest. ""No organizations, no parties — just me and a few people who care,"" he said.

He explained that the sculpture is ""part protest, part performance art,"" aimed at drawing attention to recent layoffs and budget reductions across the National Park Service.'AMERICAN HERO' OR 'FAILURE': ELON MUSK'S DOGE DEPARTURE DIVIDES CAPITOL HILL

The protest sculpture is seen at Arches National Park in Utah, framed against the park's iconic red sandstone formations. (Obtained by Fox News Digital)

""However you feel about the DOGE cuts, and we're using that word tongue-in-cheek, the reality is that thousands of people who love these parks and work to protect them were let go or impacted. And nobody's really talking about it anymore.""

The parks were a deliberate choice. ""National parks are one of the few truly nonpartisan joys we have in this country,"" he said. ""Democrats, Republicans, independents — everyone loves the outdoors.""

He chose Mt. Rainier for this weekend's installation, he said, because of the high-season congestion and overflowing parking lots. 

""It's incredibly packed. One lane in, one lane out. The parking lots are overflowing — you literally can't park to see the most popular spots,"" he said. ""It just felt … poetic.""

Park visitors' reactions were wide-ranging. Some posed for photos, others made rude gestures, and many simply stared.

""People crowded around it, took photos, laughed, flipped it off, gave it thumbs-up,"" he said. ""It ran the gamut — a good cross-section of America.""

The sculpture, built by a Michigan-based artist found online, was designed to look lifelike, and just exaggerated enough to be meme-ready. 

""We looked for someone who could do something photo-realistic on a big scale but still work within a budget,"" he said. ""We really wanted the smirk. That very self-satisfied look.""

As for the sign, ""MAKE AMERICA WAIT AGAIN"" was no accident. The nod to a certain president's famous slogan is deliberate, the backer admitted, but it isn't meant to target any particular political side. ""It's meant to spark conversation,"" he said. 

""Everyone has an opinion about Elon Musk. But I wanted this to cut across political lines.""

When asked why he insists on remaining anonymous, the backer didn't dodge the question. ""There's something fun about the mystery,"" he said. ""It's not important who I am. It's about what this statue represents.""

Images of the Musk bust have set Reddit ablaze. Comments from just one post from r/pics include:

The mystery creator acknowledges the risks of such a public display but believes the message matters.

""Major things happen in our country, real, damaging things, and we forget them because the news cycle spins so fast,"" he said. ""This is a loud, silly way to not forget.""

When asked what he'd say directly to Musk, he didn't hesitate: ""Stick to making cars, and stay out of screwing up the government.""

The backer says the National Parks themselves are what unite Americans in divided times. ""It is like common knowledge that becoming a park ranger is something you do for the love, not for the money,"" he said. ""So when they were fired or stretched thin, it hurt something we all share.""

When pressed about his own political leanings, he said only: ""I'm definitely not a Republican, and I wouldn't call myself a Democrat either. . . . I think there are aspects of both parties that, in my opinion, do certain things right and certain things wrong.""

But why bring the project to Fox News Digital? ""Because I think that you're not the first audience people would think of to cover this. And I think that's fantastic,"" he said. ""That makes me thrilled. Because we're all Americans and we all have different views and different things we enjoy. Funny things and weird things and bizarre things and pretty things.""

As for what comes next, the head is going to more parks, but where and when remain a mystery. ""I can't tell you, but I'm happy to keep telling you in the right moment.""

""The Blue Angels"" documentary was made so that America and the world can see the team's ""exceptionalism"" and maybe even inspire people to join the U.S. Navy, filmmaker Paul Crowder and retired Navy Capt. Greg Wooldridge said.

Seattle climate activists are protesting an upcoming U.S. Navy Blue Angels airshow, claiming the jets pollute the environment, while a local woman filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the military jets traumatized her ailing cat. 

The Blue Angels, the elite military flight demonstration team consisting of 140 active-duty Sailors and Marines, aims to ""showcase the excitement, precision, and power of naval aviation"" with their performances, now in their 79th year, the Blue Angels website says. The squadron has been performing at Seattle's Seafair festival since 1972.

The Airshow Climate Action Coalition put up a billboard in Seattle this week declaring, ""Say No to Blue Angels."" The coalition, made up of members from local climate groups as well as the radical global climate group, Extinction Rebellion, is planning to march and hold a rally on August 2 in protest of the Blue Angels airshow that weekend.

The billboard depicts people with hands over their ears and others raising their fists in protest of the jets, which they wrote cause ""war trauma"" and pollution. At the billboard's unveiling on Tuesday, protesters held signs reading ""Demilitarize Seafair"" and ""No military airshows.""

‘BLUE ANGELS' DOC SHOWS HOW ‘INCREDIBLE' ICONIC AVIATION TEAM, U.S. NAVY ARE AMID RECRUITMENT WOES

The climate activists are calling for military fighter jets to be excluded from participating in the annual event and demanding military airshows be scrutinized for their ""harmful waste of resources, pollution and carbon emissions.""

Aedan McCall, who designed the billboard, lived on Mercer Island for over 10 years before leaving because of the effects from the show.

""The sheer amount of carbon emissions the Blue Angels create - 670 tons in one weekend - is immense and wasteful on top of being a big display of U.S. militarism, McCall told The Seattle Times.

Community organizer Kimberly Larson crafted a petition calling for the end of the Blue Angels show, which has garnered over 5,000 signatures.

The Blue Angels are also facing criticism from a Seattle woman who blames the noisy airshow for leading to the death of her sickly, elderly cat.

Lauren Ann Lombardi filed a lawsuit against Blue Angels officers in federal court on Monday, claiming her ""beloved family member was terrorized"" by the Blue Angels' ""state-sanctioned acoustic torture.""

The lawsuit claims the noise of the low-flying F/A-18 fighter jets spurred panic attacks in the cat, who was in critical condition due to her worsening congestive heart disease, and ultimately led to her euthanasia in August 2024.

Lombardi accused the Blue Angels of unconstitutionally blocking her profanity-laced comments criticizing the U.S. Navy squadron on its Instagram page. She is seeking a court order to unblock her account and prohibit the Blue Angels from blocking any other accounts ""on the basis of viewpoint.""

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on the 'closed-door meeting' as leaders wish to know more about the democratic socialist's plans to run the Big Apple on 'America Reports.'

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—two of America's most prominent socialist politicians—have committed identity theft. No, they did not pilfer a Social Security number or swipe the digits of someone else's credit card. They have done something more subtle: stealing the image of the oppressed for personal and political gain.

It's an old trick. Just as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., claimed Native American heritage as she ascended the ranks of academia, Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez adopted the identities of the poor and downtrodden as they ascended the ranks of politics. Both built their political personas on a small kernel of truth: Mamdani claimed on his college application to be black because he was born in Uganda, despite being the son of two famous, affluent, and educated Indians; Ocasio-Cortez claimed to be a ""Bronx girl"" because she lived in the borough until age five, when she moved to a tony corner of Westchester County, New York. Both have structured their identities around grand narratives of oppressor and oppressed, which they hope to convert into power and prestige.

The truth is that both Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez belong to groups—Indians and Latinos, respectively—that do not fit neatly into America's deepest historical binary, that between White and Black, colonist and slave. Though both could doubtlessly point toward some personal slight or past injustice against their ethnic group, neither Mamdani nor Ocasio-Cortez can lay a real claim to historical oppression. Indian Americans are among the most educated and affluent groups in America, and the vast majority of Latinos arrived in the United States after desegregation and the Civil Rights Act. The very fact that millions of people uprooted themselves from India and Latin America to try their luck in this country indicates that they considered America a land of opportunity, rather than injustice.

NYC SOCIALIST WOULD-BE MAYOR ZOHRAN MAMDANI THROWS LAVISH WEDDING BASH IN UGANDA

For Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, however, the myth of post-Civil Rights Act discrimination must be maintained at all costs. Both use their privilege—Mamdani, graduate of Bowdoin and son of a professor; Ocasio-Cortez, graduate of Boston University and daughter of an architect—to advance their narrative of oppression.

They do it because it works. Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez have translated the politics of resentment to win political campaigns in Queens and the Bronx, respectively. They motivate anxious, college-educated left-wing activists, who run the ground game for their campaigns and harvest the support of working-class and minority voters in the outer boroughs.

It has always been thus. Marx and Engels were sons of affluence; Lenin was a lawyer; Mao was a librarian at Peking University. Left-wing radicals abandoned the theory of spontaneous working-class revolution not long after they hatched it. The ""vanguard of the proletariat"" has been their dominant concept since the Russian Revolution. And identity theft—claiming to represent the poor, the downtrodden, the oppressed—has been their dominant tactic.

How should opponents respond? Pointing out the fraud might be effective. After all, Warren never fully recovered from the revelation that she misrepresented her ancestry in pursuit of power. But it will be harder with the new generation of identity thieves, such as Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, who are skilled at political agitprop and can rely on their racial minority status to make some critics reluctant to go after them.

The better approach is to frame the argument around two concepts: America and manipulation. First, critics should point out that millions of people around the world want to come to America for its opportunities, equality under law, and genuinely tolerant culture; the Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez families have become successful precisely because of this country's system, which should be celebrated rather than condemned.

Second, critics should portray such politicians as dishonest and self-serving, public figures who misrepresent their backgrounds in pursuit of personal status and manipulate voters to advance destructive ideologies. Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez's policies will yield the opposite of what they promise, as socialist policies have done in the past.

Regrettably, the identity-theft strategy will remain with us for the foreseeable future. When I was an undergraduate at Georgetown University, I noticed that many of the most affluent and connected students had prepared an oppression narrative or sob story—not out of modesty but ambition. They sensed, correctly, that a story of racial, psychological, or familial trauma would grant them status and a competitive edge. I saw the sons of Middle Eastern sheiks and the daughters of American moguls rehearsing lines about supposed oppression that are now familiar in the national discourse.

The trouble is that fake identities can yield real consequences. Zohran Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are elites masquerading as the oppressed. If they are successful, they will create a system that rewards people like them and punishes those below.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) claimed former President Barack Obama oversaw disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal when Epstein first came into legal trouble under former President George W. Bush. 

“In 2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made under the Obama administration with Epstein,” Mullin said, adding, “That sweetheart has not been exposed.”

“No, that's not right. It was 2008. The U.S. attorney at the time was Alex Acosta. He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become President Trump's secretary of labor,” CNN's Jake Tapper replied on State of the Union.

Mullin continued, however, to claim incorrectly that the case was handled in 2009 under Obama. 

In 2008, Epstein struck a plea deal with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who was appointed to that role and several others in the Bush administration. 

The deal allowed Epstein to avoid a harsher sentence on allegations that he sexually abused underage girls by pleading guilty to state charges in Florida. Epstein served 13 months in Palm Beach County jail and was given extensive work release during the day. He also became a registered sex offender.

Many have questioned Acosta for the lenient deal. Acosta later served in the first Trump administration before resigning from his post as secretary of labor in July 2019, when Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, after months of scrutiny over the deal. 

Mullin objected last week to an amendment in the Senate to release files related to Epstein from Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) during a floor debate. In his objection, Mullin said he was trying to “give him cover” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump. 

“I'm sure this would be handled just like any other thing that they've tried to go after, like the baseless impeachments or the baseless special counsels or the unbelievable amount of charges they've tried to file against the president. I'm sure this would be handled the exact same way. What we're simply wanting to do here is give him cover,” Mullin said. 

MAGA ANGER OVER EPSTEIN FILES GIVES TRUMP LIMITED OPTIONS TO QUELL DIVISIONS

The Trump administration has been embattled by the uproar from Trump's voting base over its refusal to release the Epstein files. 

The Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo nearly three weeks ago that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino for years gave voice to conspiracies about Epstein's death and his so-called client list.

A Republican senator who is pushing legislation to tax remittances that Mexican citizens in the United States send to Mexico described Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's campaign to guide Mexicans from paying the taxes as a “desperate” move.

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) blasted first-term Sheinbaum in a statement to the Washington Examiner for how she vowed to fight back against a 1% tax that Congress had authorized to be imposed on money sent to people outside the U.S. under the One Big, Beautiful Bill.

“Mass migration is not only a bad policy choice, it's also a booming industry, and Mexico is one of its top beneficiaries. That's why Claudia Sheinbaum is desperate to help her fellow countrymen here in the U.S. avoid our new tax on remittances,” Schmitt said.

Schmitt added that Sheinbaum's opposition to the remittance tax was the very reason why the U.S. needed to take action to address the underlying issue and the remittances.

Sheinbaum proposed last week that Mexicans living in the U.S. use a new government bank card to avoid paying the U.S. a tax on money sent back to people in Mexico. The card is generated by the Mexican government's Financial Institution for Well-Being, known as Finabien.

“Mexico refuses to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into our nation because they have a huge financial incentive to maximize mass migration into the U.S.,” Schmitt said. “It's time for Congress to pass my REMIT Act to increase the tax on remittances and end the financial incentives for mass migration.”

Last month, Schmitt proposed the Requiring Excise for Migrant Income Transfers (REMIT) Act, which would go significantly further than the recently passed bill and increase the remittance tax to 15%.

A newly released study by the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, an immigration organization that advocates restricting immigration, concluded that people working in the U.S. send more than $200 billion to their home countries annually.

The majority of that money was sent to recipients in Mexico, followed by India, Guatemala, the Philippines, and China.

“In some cases, remittances intentionally or unintentionally support cartels, human smugglers, terrorists, and organized crime,” according to a preview of the analysis obtained by the Washington Examiner.

“Approximately $4.4 billion out of the $58.5 billion in total remittances sent to Mexico in 2022 were potentially linked to cartels,” it added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Publications like 'Time Out New York' were my bible and my roadmap.

About a year and a half ago, I was scheduled to play a concert in Vermont when word came that the gig would be canceled due to an approaching nor'easter. I checked out of the hotel early, lobbed my suitcase into the rental car, and hightailed it to New York as menacing clouds darkened the rearview mirror. Brooklyn had been home for the better part of two decades, but after a move to the Pacific Northwest, I was returning as a tourist, and the show's cancellation augured a rare free evening in the city. There was just one problem: How was I going to figure out what to do with my night on the town?

This used to be easy. You grabbed The New Yorker, The New York Times, Time Out New York, or The Village Voice and checked out the event listings. When I graduated from college and moved to the city in 2003, Time Out quickly became my bible, syllabus, and road map. The listings guided me through the cobwebbed bowels of St. Mark's Church and into the Ontological-Hysteric Theater hidden within, where Richard Foreman's mind-bending plays made an indelible impression on me. The listings brought me to Southpaw to hear Neko Case's bloodshot voice; to the Village Vanguard for Jason Moran or Paul Motian; and to a tin-ceilinged basement bar in Park Slope, where I saw a baby-faced Sharon Van Etten sing her earliest songs, and then bashfully hand out CDs burned with her demos, rich with high-frequency hiss from the tape deck onto which she'd recorded them.

But over the past decade, event listings have all but disappeared. The New York Times killed its weekly arts listings at the end of 2016, and its online arts-and-entertainment guide remains frozen, like a butterfly pinned and dried, in March 2020: “New York Arts Institutions Closed Because of Coronavirus” reads the top headline. The Village Voice folded in 2018. (It has recently been revived but has no listings section to speak of.) The New Yorker's Goings On About Town section was slashed in 2023 to just a page or two, now offering one recommendation per discipline. And Time Out, that veritable doorstop of weekly listings, now previews one or two concerts a month.

From the June 2025 issue: Is this the worst-ever era of American pop culture?

This is, in part, a familiar story about declining ad revenue, about changing pressures and priorities in the journalism business. When listings began to disappear, many imagined that the internet would simply fill the void—that artists and their fans (as well as nonprofit institutions and their audiences) would find new ways to connect. But a world in which clicks are dollars has led to an ouroboros of cultural journalism in which what is already popular must be written about—which increases its popularity, which means it must be written about, which increases its popularity—and a social-media ecosystem in which artists, no longer able to rely on legacy media for visibility, must create content to please an algorithm instead of their fans or themselves.

As mainstream culture grows ever narrower, once-robust subcultures are struggling for survival. Perhaps social-media influencers are today's critics and curators, but even as our feeds promise “discovery,” they mostly serve us what we already like. We have no idea what we're missing.

The listings were my lodestar. And that star's orbit was maintained, at least in part, by a journalist named Steve Smith.

Smith was a music editor at Time Out New York from 2001 to 2014. He'd gotten his start at a classical radio station in Houston, introducing Brahms symphonies by day and playing in a rock band in biker bars—he was the drummer—by night. This stylistic mishmash would become a trademark of his sensibility. When we spoke last month, Smith mentioned Karlheinz Stockhausen; the Clash; Billy Idol; John Zorn; John Coltrane; Scandinavian metal; Kronos Quartet; Kiss; Steve Reich; Emerson, Lake & Palmer; and Beethoven—all within the first 10 minutes of our conversation.

Time Out “was a magazine that was basically nothing but the listings,” Smith told me. “Nobody said, ‘Oh, that obscure thing that's happening on a loading dock in Tribeca? No, that's too weird.' I was basically told, ‘List what's interesting; list what people will want to know about.'” A coveted red asterisk denoted a critic's pick. “I had the privilege,” he said, “of making a difference in the lives of a number of composers and performers. And that, to me, was the most gratifying piece of the job.”

One of the lives he changed was mine. The first review I ever received as a singer-songwriter, for a set at Tonic, was written by Smith, for his blog Night After Night. A 33-word listing in Time Out came soon after—a blurb that would remain in my press kit for years. In 2009, he interviewed me for a New York Times Sunday Arts & Leisure profile. The morning after the story ran, Lincoln Center called my manager and offered me a debut on its American Songbook performance series. Who reviewed that concert for the Times? None other than Steve Smith.

These listings weren't just a boon for artists like me—they were also a teeth-cutting opportunity for cub journalists, one that demanded brutal concision. Smith, a master of the miniature, stood on the shoulders of those such as Robert Christgau, a longtime Village Voice music editor and the self-proclaimed dean of American rock critics. About a Patti Smith show, from the April 7, 1975, issue: “Funny, frightening, and just polished enough, Smith shifts from rock and roll to poetry reading like someone who really believes in street literature.”

In its heyday, the Voice's newsroom reverberated with the chaotic counterpoint of freaky choristers, all covering New York City with an obsessive commitment to hyperlocalism: Scenesters haunted hardcore shows at warehouses in Brooklyn; theater nerds ventured to East Village basements for experimental one-acts; dance lovers frequented Lower East Side nightclubs to cover bawdy performance art and contortionist spectacles. Here was a newspaper that, through dogged documentation of small and sometimes-fragile artistic microclimates, came to wield wide-reaching influence over national aesthetic trends as it championed unknown artists like Smith, the Talking Heads, Philip Glass, and so many others. That New York media have turned away from the local in favor of established celebrities may ultimately result in its irrelevance.

Sixteen years after that first profile in the Times, I am fortunate to still be making a living playing music. But mine was a transitional generation: I came of age just in time to benefit from the old models and media apparatuses, only to watch them crumble around me. Few emerging musicians today could dream of a two-sentence blurb previewing a Monday-night set at a small club on the Lower East Side, let alone a thousand-word profile.

The demise of listings is “tangled up with the erosion of review coverage,” the jazz critic Nate Chinen told me, while stressing that “the fundamental utility of a publication is bringing people out” to see a gig: “The immediate danger is that artists play and people don't know about it.”

Chinen would know. He wrote the jazz listings at The New York Times from 2005 until 2016. Those blurbs, he understood, could mean the difference between a standing-room-only show and one where the musicians outnumbered the audience. Today, it's harder than ever for aesthetically adventurous artists to make ends meet. Some have left the business, and others limp along, subsidizing their income with teaching gigs and odd jobs. Meanwhile, pop stars are doing great.

The decline of listings followed the broader trend toward “poptimism,” a critical movement that began as a corrective to the white-male-dominated popular-music journalism of the late 20th century. In a now-canonic broadside published in 2004, the critic Kelefa Sanneh argued that the snobbery of those white-male critics was bathed in racism and sexism, and often resulted in the neglect of music by women and people of color. Poptimists believed that music that was actually popular—the guilty-pleasure radio hits we wail in the car, many of them performed by nonwhite, nonmale artists—ought to be treated with the same reverence granted to the art rockers. Fair enough!

But what Sanneh and like-minded critics could not have anticipated was the extent to which their goal would collide with the economic imperatives of internet-based journalism. In the 21 years since Sanneh's essay was published, poptimism has become the status quo in mainstream music criticism, reaching its apotheosis in 2023 with USA Today's hiring of a full-time Taylor Swift reporter, Bryan West, who would go on to file—you may want to sit down—501 articles about Swift during her Eras Tour. In such a climate, it's easy to forget that poptimism was once driven by the impulse to lift up marginalized voices.

Indeed, much of today's cultural coverage reflects a different societal more, one in which, as the political philosopher Michael J. Sandel has written, we measure the value of people's contributions to the common good solely by “the market value of the goods or services they sell.” In other words, covering what's popular doesn't just serve journalism's economic bottom line; it also expresses our beliefs. In a society in which dignity and status accrue to the powerful, it's no wonder that outlets once dedicated to nurturing subcultures now publish endless paeans to celebrities.

A reader might object: Aren't you just complaining about the cultural version of natural selection? If niche genres can't hack it in today's algorithm-driven world, maybe they deserve extinction. But if they are allowed to die, popular music will also suffer. The terms highbrow and lowbrow conceal a broader ecology in which the raw materials of art move easily from one genre to another. Classical composers have long ransacked folk music to furnish their symphonies with great tunes. Similarly, there would be no Beatles' White Album without Karlheinz Stockhausen's tape music, no Rosalía's Motomami without the vocal arrangements of the Pulitzer Prize–winning composer Caroline Shaw. If we want the next Billie Eilish to be able to work with the next Attacca Quartet, we should ensure that lesser-known artists enjoy a bare minimum of support.

To look at a page of event previews was to understand how a collection of artists related to one another. This, according to the opera critic Olivia Giovetti, was one of Smith's great gifts as an editor. “He crafted listings,” Giovetti told me, “in such a way that drew out and illuminated the connections between artists, so that the reader came to understand that if they enjoyed that Victoire show at Le Poisson Rouge, they might also dig a yMusic concert at Rockwood Music Hall.” You may not have heard of either group, but you likely know the Metropolitan Opera, where Victoire's founder, Missy Mazzoli, is headed with her adaptation of George Saunders' Lincoln in the Bardo, and you've probably heard of Paul Simon, who tapped yMusic to join him on his farewell tour in 2018.

The loss of listings is, in this sense, the loss of a whole world, which historians, too, will have to contend with. Take any issue of The New Yorker from the first 98 years of its existence, and the Goings On About Town section offers a rich snapshot of the city and its subcultures. The same was true of the Times. “On any given day,” Chinen told me, “there would be a review of a New York–based dance company at the Joyce Theater, a Ben Ratliff review about a koto player at Issue Project Room, Jon Pareles reviewing an indie-folk artist at Joe's Pub. It was this incredibly robust account of a thriving arts community in a city that, right or wrong, considers itself to be the center of the universe. That's the garden. That's the plant mix that existed.” How will historians write the story of a city that no longer maintains a record of its own cultural life?

In this new paradigm, I, like so many others, feel shackled to my Instagram account, resentful that it has become my personal marketing and public-relations departments, yet resigned to its relative efficacy as a mouthpiece. (I tried to opt out, taking a full year off from the internet and another six months away from social media, returning only when my manager begged me to do so. “The phone has stopped ringing,” he said bluntly.) So yes, amid the gallimaufry of links, photos, and screen caps, I post bite-size songs: here, a William Carlos Williams–inspired lament for the tariff-burdened penguins of Heard Island; there, a setting of a Craigslist ad for free reptiles. A lot of my work is sober and politically minded, but I think it's important to hold on to laughter and absurdity too.

Still, those miniature tunes, delivered algorithmically, often bypass my own Instagram followers, landing instead in the feeds of total strangers. For them, these songs are divorced from the broader footprint of my work, which has included oratorios about homelessness and railway travelogues documenting a divided America. Cultural journalism once created that context.

Spencer Kornhaber: Taylor Swift is having quality-control issues

What's to be done? Performing-arts institutions could work together to underwrite their own weekly listings website or print publication, with their financial contributions scaled according to their budget so that small operations aren't left out. Sure, there would be challenges, namely a blurring of the line between advertising and editorial. Ideally, a group of writers and editors would produce listings with total independence, shielded from pressure by funders.

The other solution—plausible or not—is for outlets such as the Times and The New Yorker to reverse course: to recognize that their listings were a public good serving artists, audiences, and arts presenters alike. The societal benefit of a comprehensive guide to the cultural sector can't be readily calculated on a balance sheet.

For now, Smith is still serving as the secretary, the minute keeper, the town historian for the creative-music community in New York. After Time Out, he spent two years at The Boston Globe as an arts editor, and then bounced between various jobs covering music back in the city, including a five-year stint writing listings for The New Yorker. He's now a copywriter at an arts institution. Still, he maintains a Substack newsletter, Night After Night, which shares the name of his old blog, the one on which he gave me my first review. Each week, Smith compiles a roundup of notable events in music that lives beyond that narrow mainstream. When I asked him when he returned to writing listings, he said, “I never really stopped.”

Although a comprehensive digital archive of Time Out does not exist, The New Yorker is searchable back to its inaugural issue, published in February 1925. Like any good elder-Millennial narcissist, I did a quick search of my name to look for its first mention in Goings On About Town. There it was, in the issue for April 27, 2009. What else was happening? That week, Nathan Lane and Bill Irwin were starring in a production of Waiting for Godot; Steve Wilson was at the Village Vanguard; Judy Collins was at Café Carlyle; Carnegie Hall featured appearances by Zakir Hussain, Kronos Quartet (playing the compositions of Terry Riley, Philip Glass, and Osvaldo Golijov), and the soon-to-be opera superstar Eric Owens; Chick Corea was leading an all-star band at Lincoln Center; and Lou Reed was holding court at the Gramercy Theatre.

Culture and entertainment musts from Luis Parrales

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Luis Parrales, an assistant editor who has written about what the border-hawk Catholics get wrong and why the papacy is no ordinary succession.

Luis is a new fan of the author Mario Vargas Llosa and a longtime listener of the singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler. His other recommendations include “Femininomenon,” by Chappell Roan; The Bear; and anything by Conan O'Brien—whom he deems “the king of American comedy.”

The Culture Survey: Luis Parrales

Best novel I've recently read, and the best work of nonfiction: I was embarrassingly unfamiliar with the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa before his death, in April, besides some high-level lore—his role in the Latin American Boom, his failed presidential bid, the time he socked Gabriel García Márquez in the face. Soon after, I decided enough was enough and picked up his historical novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000. Through the brutal regime of Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic until his assassination at the hands of revolutionaries, in 1961, Vargas Llosa explores how the wounds inflicted by a dictatorship remain long after it officially ends. But as gritty and dark as the novel gets—and it gets dark—The Feast of the Goat is one of the most readable books I've ever encountered. That's both because Vargas Llosa's crisp prose makes the 400 or so pages fly by and, more important, because his novel never loses sight of the power of human resilience.

I was a bit more familiar with the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, who also passed away earlier this year. Although best known for his 1981 book, After Virtue (if you haven't already, read David Brooks's reflections on how its arguments help explain President Donald Trump's appeal), MacIntyre also wrote Dependent Rational Animals. The book offers one of the most persuasive cases I've read against treating individual autonomy as the highest ideal, as well as a plea to view our limitations—aging, illness—and dependence on one another not as failings but as constitutive elements of human nature. Oh, and MacIntyre dedicates long stretches of his book to the intelligence of dolphins. Which is great.

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: Quiet: “If I Don't Hear From You Tonight,” by Courtney Barnett. Loud: “Femininomenon,” by Chappell Roan.

Something I recently rewatched: Before earning box-office cachet with the Dune series, Denis Villeneuve directed Incendies, a modern Sophoclean tragedy set during a civil war in the Middle East. Nearly 15 years after its release, the film remains one of the most sobering portrayals of familial ties on-screen—of how they can at once inflict unspeakable pain and inspire courage and selflessness.

The television show I'm most enjoying right now: The latest season of FX's exquisite The Bear.

The last thing that made me snort with laughter: For my money, Conan O'Brien is the king of American comedy, though part of his greatness is that he's always reveled in playing the fool. He doesn't have the commanding swagger of a Dave Chappelle or Bill Burr, opting instead for a style that my colleague David Sims has described as a “mix of silly surrealism with an old-timey flair.” I've been keeping up with O'Brien since his Late Night days, when I would get home from school and play the previous night's episode, so watching him get the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor earlier this year felt plenty nostalgic. The full ceremony is on Netflix now, and it's a comedic cornucopia for any Team Coco stans.

The last thing that made me cry: A few weeks before Independence Day, while visiting New York City, I ended up going to mass at Ascension Church, which has a jazz liturgy on Sunday evenings. Most of my favorite church music leans traditional, yet to my surprise, I felt incredibly moved by the unconventional reverence of melodies with echoes of Art Blakey and Miles Davis. One highlight: the jazz mass's version of the hymn “This Is My Song.” These lines in particular felt providentially relevant for anybody searching for a more warmhearted patriotism:

This is my home, the country where my heart is; here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine; but other hearts in other lands are beating with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: Museo Nacional de Historia, in Mexico City.

A musical artist who means a lot to me: The Uruguayan singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler isn't super well known in America—though he did write the first Spanish-language song to win an Oscar for Best Original Song—but he's pretty acclaimed in Latin America and Spain, especially for his lyricism. He can use scientific principles (the law of conservation or the evolution of cells, for example) as metaphors for love, or meditate on weighty political questions (migration, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) without coming off as preachy. No musician means more to me than Drexler, whose art teems with the wonder of a wide-eyed humanist.

A poem, or line of poetry, that I return to: “Two in the Campagna,” by Robert Browning:

Only I discern— Infinite passion, and the pain Of finite hearts that yearn.

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

The Mistake Parents Make With Chores

By Christine Carrig

Each September at the Montessori school I run, the preschoolers engage in an elaborate after-lunch cleanup routine. They bustle through the room with sweepers and tiny dustpans, spreading crumbs all over the floor and making a bigger mess than they started with …

Contrast this with my own house—where, in a half-hearted effort to encourage my children to take responsibility for our home, I've been known to say, “You live here!” as they ignore the pile of dishes in the sink. After years in Montessori classrooms, I assumed that a culture of taking responsibility would develop spontaneously in my family. And it might have, had I not made some early mistakes.

A poem

Can't lick the witch wind that carries rumors over shining aurora-lit prairies:

horror of what comes to light at the dawn of the mind. Will you permit me to rise

from my sinkhole, to draw in the dirt the garnet ring my grandmother sold for gas

just to survive? Arrive anonymous, starved on hardtack and shame,

in this place where she was erased? How will you animate this forgotten history?

Pepper the disarray with white-hooded prairie schooners filled with calico-clothed

divas gathering their brood alongside militant fathers donning wide-brimmed hats?

It's natural to want to lie when you look in the mirror, see you are naked

down to the crimes. Let me tell you, honey, truth is the harmony your song has been

missing. Set down a soapbox and let me step up and sing out about the naked

and the dead. The ghosts we've not yet seen clothe the woods of your stories. Let your candy

apple cowboys die in their own desert until my grandmother's name is spoken

like the emergency it has become.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Capitalism needs better advocates.

In the 1980s, the world's largest producer of shoes was the Communist Soviet Union. In his 1994 book, Dismantling Utopia, Scott Shane reported that the U.S.S.R. “was turning out 800 million pairs of shoes a year—twice as many as Italy, three times as many as the United States, four times as many as China. Production amounted to more than three pairs of shoes per year for every Soviet man, woman, and child.”

And yet, despite this colossal output of Soviet-socialist footwear, queues formed around the block at the mere rumor that a shop might have foreign shoes for sale: “The comfort, the fit, the design, and the size mix of Soviet shoes were so out of sync with what people needed and wanted that they were willing to stand in line for hours to buy the occasional pair, usually imported, that they liked,” Shane continued.

The Soviet economic system put millions of people to work converting useful raw materials into unwanted final products. When released from the factory or the office, those workers then consumed their leisure hours scavenging for the few available non-useless goods. The whole system represented a huge cycle of waste.

For a younger generation of Americans, the concept of “socialism” is an empty box into which all manner of hopes and dreams may be placed. But once upon a time, some humans took very seriously the project to build an economy without private property and without such market rewards as profits. What they got instead was unwearable shoes. But memories fade; hopes and dreams endure.

Read: Start budgeting now

Growing numbers of Americans feel that the economy does not work for them. Donald Trump's stewardship has blatantly favored insiders and cronies. And so, in the 2020s, Americans find themselves debating ideas that once seemed dead and dusty, and in some cases, electing politicians who champion them. The new socialism addresses the problems that wrecked the old socialism only by denying or ignoring them. If socialism is to be beaten back, and if market economics are to uphold themselves in democratic competition, exposing the unworkability of proposed alternatives won't be enough. It will be necessary to reform and cleanse the market economics indispensable to sustaining Americans' standard of living.

During socialism's heyday, the world's leading minds hailed the superior potential of a planned socialist economy. Albert Einstein wrote in 1949:

The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals … A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child.

In 1960, the Harvard economist Abram Bergson predicted that the Soviet economy was on a trajectory to overtake the U.S. economy. Bergson's was not a crank opinion at all. Similar estimates underlay CIA analysis of the Soviet economy well into the '60s. Americans might reject socialism for themselves as oppressive. But experts believed that, as unlovely as Soviet socialism was, it could produce positive results.

The same overestimation of the U.S.S.R.'s productive capacity was also applied to Communist China. On the U.S. Senate floor in 1959, the future president John F. Kennedy gave a speech in which he accepted almost completely at face value China's claims of a “Great Leap Forward”: “The mobilization of the unemployed mass of Chinese rural workers through economic communes, cottage industry, small pig-iron schemes, and all the rest is an achievement whose political and intellectual impact in less developed areas is bound to be immense.”

In actuality, the Great Leap Forward amounted to perhaps the deadliest self-inflicted calamity in human history. Mao Zedong's forced industrialization program caused a famine that killed at least 23 million people, and perhaps as many as 55 million.

The Soviet economic statistics that so impressed the CIA were faked or meaningless. It did not matter how many pairs of shoes a Soviet factory made if nobody wanted to wear them. To escape Soviet sclerosis, Communist China began, in 1978, to open up first its farm economy, then its industry, to private management, market competition, and foreign investment. Communist Vietnam and other formerly closed and controlled economies followed the Chinese example.

Across the democratic West, socialist ideas went into eclipse. In 1995, under the new leadership of Tony Blair, the British Labour Party amended its party constitution to delete venerable language pledging “common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.” In Germany in the early 2000s, Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic coalition government introduced the most dramatic reductions in decades to social benefits to push the long-term unemployed back to work. In the United States, Democratic President Bill Clinton declared in 1996, “The era of big government is over.”

The seeming triumph of market economics was not welcomed by all, of course. Those disgruntled by the seeming triumph rejected Margaret Thatcher's taunt that “there is no alternative,” yet they could not articulate in any concise or coherent way what that alternative might be.

The anti-corporate activist Ralph Nader ran for president in part to challenge the Clinton-era pro-market consensus. In his 2000 campaign as the nominee of the Green Party, Nader assembled an array of grievances: over-lengthy commutes to work; unhealthy meals at fast-food chains; excessive CEO pay; young people getting too much screen time; the criminalization of narcotics; the demise of urban electric-trolley systems. He could not have been more specific about what he opposed. But what was he for? Nader could not say.

And so it went for one project after another to imagine an anti-capitalist future. Some who belonged to the era's left glumly quoted a saying attributed to the American Marxist literary critic Fredric Jameson: “It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.”

Over the quarter century from early 1983 to late 2007, the United States suffered just two brief, mild recessions: one in 1990–91, and a second that lasted only from spring to fall of 2001. From the beginning of Ronald Reagan's second administration to the end of George W. Bush's first, the U.S. unemployment rate never once reached 8 percent. Over that same period, inflation was low and interest rates steadily declined.

Economists call this era “the Great Moderation.” The moderating influence was felt on politics too. For nearly 50 years, Gallup has surveyed Americans' mood with a consistent series of questions about the general condition of the country. From 1983 to 2007, the proportion of Americans satisfied with “the way things are going in the U.S.” reached peaks of about 70 percent, and was often above 50 percent.

Then the long period of stability abruptly ended. Over the 15 years from 2007 to 2022, the U.S. economy suffered the Great Recession, the coronavirus pandemic, and post-pandemic inflation: a sequence of bewildering shocks.

You can see the effects in the Gallup polling. Over this period, the percentage of Americans who described themselves as generally satisfied rarely exceeded one-third and often hovered at about a quarter.

The era of moderation yielded to a time of radicalism: Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party movement, “birtherism,” the wave of militant ideology that acquired the shorthand, “woke.” In 2015, in the throes of this radicalism, Hillary Clinton announced her second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. In her stump speech, she listed categories that described the American electorate as she saw it, offering a fascinating portrait of the politics of the 1990s meeting the realities of the 2010s. She dedicated her candidacy equally to “the successful and the struggling,” to “innovators and inventors” as well as “factory workers and food servers.” In other words, she addressed herself to Americans for whom the world was working more or less well, and to familiar and long-established blue-collar categories. She made no specific mention of gig workers, downwardly mobile credentialed professionals, or any of the other restless social categories that multiplied after the shock of 2008–09.

A few weeks after Clinton's announcement, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont declared his campaign for the same Democratic nomination. Sanders was an odd messiah. He had spent a lifetime in politics with little to show for it. No major piece of legislation bore his name, and precious few minor pieces either. An independent socialist, he had stayed aloof from the Democratic Party without building a movement of his own. Few had considered him an inspiring personality or a compelling orator. Yet amid this new radical temper, he quickly gathered a cultlike following—and won 13 million votes, to carry 23 caucuses and primaries. When he ultimately lost to Clinton, the defeat left many of his supporters with resentments that divided leftists from liberals in ways that may have helped Donald Trump win the Electoral College in the general election in November 2016.

In 2002, toward the end of her public career, Thatcher was asked to name her greatest achievement. “Tony Blair and New Labour,” she replied. “We forced our opponents to change their minds.”

Sanders might say the same about Trump and his Republican Party. Goodbye to Reagan-era enthusiasm for markets and trade: Trump vowed much more aggressive and intrusive government action to protect American businesses and workers from global competition. He also offered a bleak diagnosis of America's condition, for which the only way forward was to return to the past.

At the same time, Trump's persona vindicated every critique Sanders might advance about the decadence of late capitalism. Here was a putative billionaire whose business methods involved cheating customers and bilking suppliers. His private life was one scandal after another, and he spent his money on garish and gimcrack displays. He staffed his administration with plutocrats flagrantly disdainful of the travails of ordinary people, and with grifters who liked to live high on public expense.

The coronavirus pandemic intensified the anti-market feeling. The economic effects enriched those who possessed assets, especially real estate: The median house price in the U.S. jumped from $317,000 in the spring of 2020 to $443,000 by the end of 2022. The federal pandemic response could also be gamed by business owners; the U.S. government estimates that as much as $200 billion of COVID-relief funds may have been fraudulently pocketed. On the other hand, if you were a person who rented his or her home and lived on wages, you were almost certainly worse off in 2022 than you had been in 2019. Your wages bought less; your rent cost more.

The outlook was especially bleak for young college graduates. The average new graduate owes more than $28,000 a year in student debt. Hopes of repaying that debt were dimmed by the weak post-COVID job market for new graduates. Joe Biden's presidential administration did relieve some student debt, but its most ambitious plans to help new graduates were struck down by the Supreme Court as exceeding executive authority.

In some respects, people born since 1990 are more conservative than their elders. Academic surveys find that Americans, male and female, who attended high school in the 2010s express more traditional views about gender roles than those who attended high school in the 1990s. But on economic questions specifically, an observable shift of attitude against markets and capitalism has occurred. Only 40 percent of adults younger than 30 expressed a positive view of capitalism in a 2022 Pew survey, a drop from 52 percent pre-pandemic. Older groups lost faith too, but not so steeply: Among over 65s, a positive view of capitalism dipped from 76 percent pre-pandemic to 73 percent post-pandemic.

This disillusionment has opened the door to self-described socialists in the 2020s. The most recent and most spectacular of this new cohort is Zohran Mamdani, who earlier this month won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City in an upset election.

Mamdani campaigned on promises to raise taxes on New York's richest inhabitants to finance a bold new program of state enterprise: free bus service, government-owned grocery stores, a rent freeze for the 1 million apartments under city jurisdiction, and a vow to build 200,000 affordable-housing units over the next decade. After the tallies were boosted by New York's ranked-choice voting system, Mamdani won 56 percent of the vote. He now tops polls for the general election in November. His agenda already is influencing Democrats nationwide.

Few if any of the Americans who use the term socialist would today defend Communist central planning. But as they criticize the many failings of contemporary American society, they tend to shirk the obvious counter-question: If not central planning, then what do they want? Liberals such as Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed to let markets create wealth, which governments would then tax to support social programs. If that's out of style, if something more radical is sought, then what might that something be? Merely Clintonism with higher taxes? Or a genuine alternative? How can a society that aspires to socialism produce the wealth it wants to redistribute if not by the same old capitalist methods of property, prices, and profits?

The socialists of a century ago promised both a new way to create wealth and a new way to share it. The preeminent American socialist of the early 20th century, Eugene V. Debs, outlined that new system in speeches such as the one he delivered in Girard, Kansas, in 1908:

We Socialists propose that society in its collective capacity shall produce, not for profit but in abundance to satisfy human wants … Every man and woman will then be economically free. They can, without let or hindrance, apply their labor, with the best machinery that can be devised, to all the natural resources, do the work of society and produce for all; and then receive in exchange a certificate of value equivalent to that of their production. Then society will improve its institutions in proportion to the progress of invention. Whether in the city or on the farm, all things productive will be carried forward on a gigantic scale.

As soon as it was attempted, this breathtaking utopian vision bumped into a daunting challenge: Without market prices, how can any of those gigantic socialist enterprises know what to make or how to commit their resources? And without market institutions, including the profit motive, how can we have market prices? Socialist enterprises would blunder about in the dark, unable to communicate with one another, unable to respond to changing circumstances, because socialist planning severed the lines of communication that connect economic actors.

Much brainpower was invested over many decades to solve this riddle. Francis Spufford's novel Red Plenty makes improbably poignant literature out of the desperate hopes of Soviet economists that the new technology of the computer might somehow rescue socialism from its own impossibility.

But there was no escape. There is no socialist way to create wealth. There is only a socialist way to spend wealth. The socialist revival of the past half decade no longer even pretends to worry about wealth production. It exists purely as a new set of claims on existing modes of production: socialist apartments funded in effect by taxes on nonsocialist apartments, socialist grocery stores that do not have to pay the taxes or rent paid by nonsocialist grocery stores.

The beneficiaries of these claims will not necessarily be society's poorest. New York City distributes affordable-housing units through a process that begins with a lottery but rapidly transforms into a test of skill, savvy, and connections. In the first place, New York favors applicants who work for the city, in itself a step that advantages middle-class people over the truly needy. Then, once the lucky lottery winners get their good news, they must assemble a mass of documents to prove their desirability as tenants—pay stubs, lease records, birth certificates. As an expert on the process explained to a real-estate website: “Once you've been selected, it's all about being organized and efficient.” The people most at risk of homelessness are those least likely to navigate New York's system of nonmarket and submarket rents.

In 2022, Mayor Eric Adams—elected as a Democrat, though now running for reelection as an independent—cut the ribbon on a $120 million project in Far Rockaway. This outer-borough development offered studios starting at $522 a month, two-bedroom apartments for $809 a month. But the building contained only 224 units. For all the excitement of the lucky beneficiaries, this is the faintest replica of a housing solution—as well as a reality check to Mamdani's grandiose vision of government-led housing abundance.

Given this disappointing record, why are so many New Yorkers signing up for more and bigger? The short answer is that the debate about socialism is scarcely about socialism at all. Socialism's catastrophes are today obscure, relegated to a poorly remembered past. Dissatisfaction with the present-day economic system is felt urgently in the here and now.

Read: Zohran Mamdani's lesson for the left

The progressive economist Joseph Stiglitz recently remarked, “Trumponomics is ersatz capitalism.” The president and those around him are accumulating huge fortunes by unashamedly preying on the credulity of their followers. Trump insiders have used political power to harass regulatory agencies and cripple tax enforcement. Trump's big policy moves are accompanied by an avalanche of suspicious trades. “Of the stock and stock fund sales administration officials reported between Jan. 20 and April 30, 90% fell within 10 days of the tariff announcements,” USA Today reported last week. The New York Times suggested in April that if Trump seems to care little about crashing the stock market but a lot about the bond market, that may be explained by his own holdings: few stocks, many bonds. (Unlike most past presidents, Trump has not put his holdings in a blind trust.)

While Trump's behavior discredits markets, his rhetoric vilifies markets. In April, the Trump administration imposed the most crushing tariffs on international commerce since the Smoot-Hawley Act's regime of 1930. The Trump adviser Stephen Miller explained to Fox News the administration's reasons: “Our leaders allowed foreign countries to rig the rules of the game, to cheat, to steal, to rob, to plunder,” he said. “That has cost America trillions of dollars in wealth.” Echoing his boss's grievance-laden language, he said, “They've stolen our industries.” It's not always phrased so vituperatively, but the message is consistent: free exchange is an illusion; there is nothing but exploitation. The only way to protect Americans from exploitation is for the nation's political leaders to subject more and more of the U.S. economy to state control. If this way of thinking is true, then the severest critics of capitalism are right.

Happily, this way of thinking is not true. Free exchange is a system of cooperation and mutual benefit, the most effective that humanity has yet discovered. But who in the Trump-led United States is arguing the case for free exchange? The most influential intellectuals of the left reject markets as too inequitable; those on the right reject them as too cosmopolitan. On one side, the professional politicians are intimidated by their most radical supporters; on the other, the politicians are under the sway of crooks and con artists, whose idea of capitalism is unregulated permission to bilk and defraud.

Jasmine Crockett is testing out the coarse style of politics that the GOP has embraced.

All the comforts of a Waldorf Astoria city-view suite did not, at that moment, seem to cheer Jasmine Crockett. The 44-year-old Texas Democrat known for her viral comebacks was frowning as she walked into her hotel room in Atlanta last month. She glanced around before pulling an aide into the bathroom, where I could hear them whispering. Minutes later, she reemerged, ready to unload.

She was losing her race to serve as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, she told me, a job she felt well suited for. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus were planning to vote for the senior-most person in the race, even though that person wasn't actually a Black Caucus member, Crockett complained. California members were siding with the California candidate. One member was supporting someone else in the race, she said, even though “that person did the worst” in their pitch to the caucus. Crockett was starting to feel a little used. Some of her colleagues were “reaching out and asking for donations,” she said, but those same colleagues “won't even send me a text back” about the Oversight job.

To Crockett, the race had become a small-scale version of the Democratic Party's bigger predicament. Her colleagues still haven't learned what, to her, is obvious: Democrats need sharper, fiercer communicators. “It's like, there's one clear person in the race that has the largest social-media following,” Crockett told me.

In poll after poll since Donald Trump's reelection, Democratic voters have said they want a fighter, and Crockett, a former attorney who represents the Dallas area, has spent two and a half years in Congress trying to be one. Through her hearing-room quips and social-media insults, she's become known, at least in MSNBC-watching households, as a leading general in the battle against Trump. The president is aware of this. He has repeatedly called Crockett a “low-IQ” individual; she has dubbed him a “buffoon” and “Putin's hoe.” Perhaps the best-known Crockett clapback came last year during a hearing, after Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia made fun of Crockett's fake eyelashes. Crockett, seeming to relish the moment, leaned into the mic and blasted Greene's “bleach-blond, bad-built, butch body.” Crockett trademarked the phrase—which she now refers to as “B6”—and started selling T-shirts.

At the time, I wrote that the episode was embarrassing for everyone involved. But clearly it resonated. Crockett has become a national figure. Last year, she gave a keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention and was a national co-chair of Kamala Harris's campaign. This year, she has been a fixture on cable news and talk shows as well as a top party fundraiser; she was in Atlanta, in part, for a meet and greet with local donors. At an anti-Trump protest on the National Mall in April, I saw several demonstrators wearing B6 shirts. Others carried signs with Crockett's face on them.

Crockett is testing out the coarser, insult-comedy-style attacks that the GOP has embraced under Trump, the general idea being that when the Republicans go low, the Democrats should meet them there. That approach, her supporters say, appeals to people who drifted away from the Democrats in 2024, including many young and Black voters. “What establishment Democrats see as undignified,” Max Burns, a progressive political strategist, told me, “disillusioned Democrats see that as a small victory.” Republicans understand this, Crockett said: “Marjorie is not liked by her caucus, but they get her value, and so they gave her a committee chairmanship.”

Perhaps inadvertently, Crockett seemed to be acknowledging something I heard from others in my reporting: that the forthrightness her supporters love might undermine her relationships within the party. Some of Crockett's fellow Democrats worry that her rhetoric could alienate the more moderate voters the party needs to win back. In the same week that Democratic leadership had instructed members to focus on Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for billionaires, Crockett referred to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” (Crockett claimed that she was referring to Abbott's busing of migrants.) In an interview with Vanity Fair after the 2024 election, Crockett said that Hispanic Trump supporters had “almost like a slave mentality.” She later told a CNN host that she was tired of “white tears” and the “mediocre white boys” who are upset by DEI.

Unsurprisingly, Trump himself seems eager to elevate Crockett. “They say she's the face of the party,” the president told my Atlantic colleagues recently. “If she's what they have to offer, they don't have a chance.” Some of the Republican targeting of Crockett is clearly rooted in racism; online, Trump's supporters constantly refer to her as “ghetto” and make fun of her hair.

From the June 2025 issue: ‘I run the country and the world'

None of this appears to be giving Crockett any pause. The first time I met her, a month before our conversation in Atlanta, she was accepting a Webby Award, in part for a viral exchange in which she'd referred to Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina as “child” and Mace suggested they “take it outside.” Backstage, in a downtown-Manhattan ballroom, I asked Crockett whether she ever had regrets about her public comments. She raised her eyebrows and replied, “I don't second-guess shit.”

This spring, I watched Crockett test her theory of politics in a series of public appearances. At the Webbys, most of her fellow award winners were celebrities and influencers, but only Crockett received a standing ovation. A week later, Crockett flamed Republicans and the Trump administration during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A 15-minute clip of her upbraiding ICE agents—“These people are out of control!”—has racked up more than 797,000 views on YouTube; I know this because she told me. On TikTok and Instagram, Crockett has one of the highest follower counts of any House member, and she monitors social-media engagement like a day trader checks her portfolio. She is highly conscious, too, of her self-presentation. During many of our conversations, Crockett wore acrylic nails painted with the word RESIST, and a set of heavy lashes over her brown eyes. The lock screen on her phone is a headshot of herself.

Behind the scenes, the congresswoman speaks casually. At the Waldorf, I watched her deliver a quick Oversight-campaign pitch via Zoom. It was a virtual meeting of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, she'd explained to me beforehand. But then, after the call, she wasn't sure. “CAPAC is the Asian caucus, right?” she asked. “Yes,” the aide confirmed. “That would've been bad,” Crockett said with a laugh. She can also be brusque. During our interview at the Waldorf, she dialed up a staffer in D.C. in front of me and scolded him for an unclear note on her schedule. Another time, in the car, after an aide brought Crockett a paper bag full of food from a fundraiser, she peered inside, scrunched her nose, and said, “This looks like crap.”

Still, Crockett is often more thoughtful in person than she might appear in clips. Once, after a hearing, I watched as she responded to a request for comment with a tight 90-second answer about faith and service. Another time, a reporter who was filming her tried to provoke her by asking what she would say to people who think she is “mentally ill.” “They can think whatever they want to, because as of now, we live in a democracy,” Crockett answered calmly, before taking another question. “I don't want people to lose sight of the fact that this is someone with a very fine, legally trained mind,” Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a mentor of Crockett's, told me.

Crockett's Republican critics like to say that she's a private-school girl playing a plainspoken Texas brawler for social-media clout. They're not wrong about her background. Crockett grew up an only child in St. Louis, not Dallas, and attended private high school before enrolling at Rhodes College, a small liberal-arts school in Tennessee. When Crockett was young, her father was a life-insurance salesman and a teacher, she told me, and she has talked often about his work as a preacher; her mother, she said, still works for the IRS. Crockett's stage presence precedes her political career. At Rhodes, from which she graduated in 2003, she was recruited to the mock-trial program after a team leader watched her enthusiastic performance as the narrator Ronnette in Little Shop of Horrors, her former coach, Marcus Pohlmann, told me. She won a national award during her first and only year in the program.

As Crockett tells it, she became interested in the law after she and a few other Black students at Rhodes received anonymous letters containing racist threats. The school hired a Black female attorney from the Cochran Firm, a national personal-injury-law group, to handle the case, Crockett told me. The attorney became Crockett's “shero,” she said, and inspired her to attend law school herself. When I asked for the name of her shero so that I could interview her, Crockett told me that she did not remember. I reached out to a former Cochran Firm attorney in Tennessee who fit Crockett's description; she remembered the incident in broad terms but was not sure if she had worked on the case or with Crockett. Although Rhodes College had no specific records of the incident, two people who worked at the college at the time told me that they recalled it.

Crockett worked for a few years as a public defender in deep-red Bowie County, Texas, before starting her own law firm, where she drew attention for defending Black Lives Matter demonstrators. She was sworn in to the Texas state House in 2021 and became the body's third-most progressive member, according to the Texas Tribune, authoring dozens of bills, with an emphasis on criminal-justice reform. (None of the legislation for which she was the main author ever passed the Republican-dominated legislature.) “Most freshmen come, they are just trying to learn where the restrooms are,” but Crockett “came with a fight in her,” Texas Representative Toni Rose, a former Democratic colleague of Crockett's, told me.

Having defeated an incumbent Democrat to win her seat, Crockett was already viewed as an agitator by some of her new colleagues. Then, in 2021, she became the unofficial spokesperson for a group of more than 50 Texas Democrats who fled to D.C. in a high-profile effort to stall Republican legislation. Her dealings with the press built up “real resentment” with Democratic leaders, one Texas-based party strategist, who was familiar with caucus actions at the time, told me. (This person, like some others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.) “When they broke quorum and it was important that everything be secret, she was on the phone to the press talking about what they were getting ready to do,” the strategist said. Both Crockett and her chief of staff at the time, Karrol Rimal, denied this version of events and told me that she had not given an interview before arriving in D.C. Rimal said that Crockett had agreed to do press only if the story would not be published until the Texas lawmakers crossed state lines. He added that state Democrats were sometimes jealous because Crockett “outshined them.”

The state-House drama was short-lived: After one term, Crockett became the handpicked replacement for 15-term U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson. Crockett sailed to victory, and less than a year later, her breakthrough moment arrived: While questioning a witness in a committee hearing, Crockett held up a photograph of several boxes in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom. The classified documents, she said, looked like they were “in the shitter to me!” Trump critics  praised her as an “absolute star” and their “new favorite Congresswoman.”

Not everyone agreed. Johnson felt that the freshman congresswoman was dismissive of her experience and advice, according to two sources familiar with the relationship. “I don't think it was a secret” that by the time Johnson died, in December 2023, “she had had second thoughts about Jasmine,” the Texas-based Democratic strategist said. Crockett strongly denied this characterization and said that she had never heard it from those close to Johnson. I reached out to Johnson's son for his view, but he didn't respond.

The race to replace the Oversight Committee's top Democrat, the late Representative Gerry Connolly, presented a multipurpose opportunity. Democrats could preview their resistance strategy for a second Trump administration. And Crockett, who'd run an unsuccessful, last-minute bid for a leadership position the previous year, could test her own viability as a party leader.

In late May, Crockett brought me along to a private meeting in the green-walled office of a freshman member—Maxine Dexter of Oregon—where she made her pitch: The Democrats have a communication problem, Crockett said. “The biggest issue” with Joe Biden's presidency wasn't “that he wasn't a great president,” she explained. “It was that no one knew what the fuck he did.” (Crockett acknowledged to Dexter that the former president is “old as shit,” but said, “He's an old man that gets shit done.”) Crockett highlighted her own emphasis on social media, and the hundreds of thousands of views she had received on a recent YouTube video. “The base is thirsty. The base right now is not very happy with us,” Crockett continued, and if any lawmaker could make them feel heard, “it's me.”

Crockett told Dexter that she had big plans for Oversight. She wanted to take hearings on the road, and to show voters that “these motherfuckers”—Republicans—are all “complicit” in Trump's wrongdoing. She wasn't worried about her own reelection. “I guess it's my fearlessness,” she told Dexter.

Dexter asked Crockett about her relationship with leadership. Another young firebrand, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had bumped up against then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she arrived in Congress, Dexter noted. Crockett dismissed that concern, explaining that she had never wanted to “burn it down” and prefers to be seen as working on behalf of the party. The national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour featuring Senator Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is a good idea, Crockett said, but it “kind of makes people be like, Oh, it's about them, right? Instead of the team.” (Through a spokesperson, Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment. Crockett told me that the two have a positive relationship.)

Read: Can you really fight populism with populism?

By the end of the meeting, Dexter was ready to vote for Crockett. But she would never get the chance. Five days after Crockett's fundraiser in Atlanta, Punchbowl News reported that she had “leaned into the idea of impeaching President Donald Trump,” which spooked swing-district members. Representative Robert Garcia of California was quickly becoming the caucus favorite. Like Crockett, he was relatively young and outspoken. But he had spent his campaign making a “subtle” case for generational change, Punchbowl said, and he'd told members that the Oversight panel shouldn't “function solely as an anti-Trump entity.”

The same day the Punchbowl report was published, 62 Democratic leaders met to decide which of the four Oversight candidates they'd recommend to the caucus. The vote was decisive: Garcia, with 33 votes, was the winner. Crockett placed last, with only six. Around midnight, she went live on Instagram to announce that she was withdrawing her name from the race; Garcia would be elected the next morning. In the end, “recent questions about something that just wasn't true” had tanked her support, Crockett told her Instagram viewers. She hadn't campaigned on impeaching Trump, she told me later; she'd simply told a reporter that, if Democrats held a majority in the House, she would support an impeachment inquiry. And why not? She was just being transparent, Crockett told me, “and frankly, I may not get a lot of places because I am very transparent.”

Some of Crockett's fellow Democrats find that candor refreshing. “People don't necessarily agree with her aggressive communication style,” Representative Julie Johnson of Texas told me. “I'm thrilled she's doing it, because we need it all.” Garcia, in a statement from his office, told me that Crockett is “one of the strongest fighters we have,” and that, “as a party, we should be taking notes on the kinds of skills she exemplifies.” But several other Democrats I reached out to about the race seemed uninterested in weighing in. Thirteen of her colleagues on the Oversight and Judiciary committees, along with 20 other Democratic members I contacted for this story, either declined to talk with me on the record or didn't respond to my interview requests. Senior staffers for three Democratic members told me that some of Crockett's colleagues see her as undisciplined but are reluctant to criticize her publicly. “She likes to talk,” one of the staffers said. “Is she a loose cannon? Sometimes. Does that cause headaches for other members? 100 percent.”

Crockett said that people are free to disagree with her communication style, but that she “was elected to speak up for the people that I represent.” As for her colleagues, four days before this story was published, Crockett called me to express frustration that I had reached out to so many House members without telling her first. She was, she told me, “shutting down the profile and revoking all permissions.”

Crockett does not have supporters so much as she has admirers. Everywhere she goes, young people ask for selfies, and groups of her red-clad Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters pop up to cheer her on. A few days before she dropped out of the Oversight race, a congregation outside of Atlanta full of middle-aged Black Georgians was giddy to host her: Here was Jasmine Crockett, recounting her feud with Marjorie Taylor Greene.

“She thought she could play with me,” Crockett told Pastor Jamal Bryant, the leader of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and a progressive activist. There were a few “oh no”s in the crowd. “The average, maybe, person in my party potentially would have just let it go,” Crockett went on. “I wasn't the one.” There were claps and whoops. “I was steaming, and I was ready,” she said. “I was like, ‘Well, two wrongs gonna make a right today, baby, cause I ain't gonna let it go!'” The righteous anger in Crockett's voice was audible; people applauded for it, probably because it sounded a lot like their own.

Crockett's fans are rooting for her to go bigger. And when I asked if she was considering running for Senate in the future—John Cornyn is up for reelection next year—Crockett didn't wave me off. “My philosophy is: Stay ready so you don't have to get ready,” she said. Crockett imagines a world in which Democrats are associated with lofty ideals and monosyllabic slogans, like Barack Obama once was. When I asked her what the party should stand for beyond being against Trump, and what she stands for, she explained, “For me, I always just say ‘the people,'” adding that her campaigns have always been associated with “fire.”

Plenty of other Democrats believe that Crockett's approach comes dangerously close to arson. Her critics argue that it's easy to be outspoken in a safe Democratic seat; they might also point out that Crockett received 7,000 fewer votes in 2024 than Johnson, her predecessor, had in 2020. You can see James Carville coming from a mile away. “I don't think we need a Marjorie Taylor Greene,” the longtime Democratic consultant told me. Crockett is “passionate. She has an instinct for making headlines. But does that help us at the end of the day?” he said. “You're trying to win the election. That's the overall goal.”

Crockett is not Marjorie Taylor Greene; for one, she is not peddling space-laser, weather-control conspiracy theories. Yet Crockett's combative style could be a misreading of the moment, Lakshya Jain, an analyst at the political-forecasting site Split Ticket, told me. “People think the brand issue that Democrats have is they don't fight enough and that they're not mean enough,” Jain said, but “those are all just proxies for saying that they can't get stuff done for people.” In Congress, Crockett has championed progressive causes and introduced plenty of legislation, but none of the bills she's been the lead sponsor of has become law.

Clearly, though, lots of real-life voters want Jasmine Crockett. At the church outside Atlanta, Pastor Bryant triggered a standing ovation when he declared, “Jasmine Crockett for president” and “2028 is coming, y'all!” Outside, in the parking lot, someone shouted at Crockett, “First Black-woman president!” June was a disheartening month for Crockett. She was soundly rejected by her own colleagues and shut out of a chance at institutional power. But when we talked in her hotel room in Atlanta, she'd framed the situation differently: If Americans on the outside could vote, she'd insisted, “I absolutely feel like I know where it would go.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat.

During a nasty summer heat wave — see: much of the US right now — water is a reliable source of relief. Where there are no rivers or lakes to swim in, we still might have swimming pools, sprinklers, and popsicles to keep ourselves cool.

Wild animals don't have such luxuries.

Bouts of extreme heat and drought — which are becoming more common and less predictable as global temperatures rise — can cause natural watering holes in many different types of ecosystems to dry up. And animals don't have a tap they can simply turn on. That leaves them with few places to hydrate and cool off, putting their lives, often already imperiled, at risk.

But in some parts of the world, humans are offering help. In the jungles of northern Guatemala, which have been abnormally hot in recent years, environmental groups placed several large tubs of water in nature reserves. They refill them regularly, providing a reliable source of fresh water that animals can drink from or splash in, even when there's no rain. And luckily for us, they also put motion-activated cameras nearby to see which animals were using them.

You might call them thirst traps.

“The diversity of species using the water sources was amazing,” said Gabriela Ponce, head of Wildlife Conservation Society Guatemala, a group involved in the project with several others, including the local Guatemala NGO Foundation for Ecodevelopment and Conservation.

The footage reveals a diverse cast of jungle characters, including those that are rarely seen, like jaguars and tapirs — large herbivores with distinct trunk-like noses. It also exposed some interesting animal behaviors, Ponce said. Researchers noticed that spider monkeys seemed to prefer drinking from raised water containers — perhaps so that they can quickly escape if predators approach, Ponce said.

Wild animals are often more sensitive to environmental impacts than we are. They don't have technologies like air conditioning and water purification to survive all the ways in which we're altering the planet, from heating it up to filling it with pollution. And when climate disasters hit, the impacts are often devastating to wild animals, too.

But there are simple ways to help wildlife cope with the world we've created for them, like putting out (clean) hummingbird feeders and bird baths or extinguishing invasive mosquitos that are spreading avian malaria.

“Artificial watering holes are not a permanent solution,” Rony García-Anleu, who leads biological research at Wildlife Conservation Society Guatemala, said in a press release. “But they are a vital tool in helping wildlife adapt to increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions.”

…and why it needs to change.

We've all been there. Maybe it's when you grab a coffee in the morning or when you finish up a dinner out with friends. Maybe it's when you least expect it, like at the merch table at a concert. You tap your card, only to be confronted with the dreaded tip screen. There's a lot of talk about how much to tip and if you even should tip (more on that later), but why do we add gratuity in America in the first place?

Nina Mast has the answer. She's an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, DC. The point of the tip is to make up the difference between the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage. “The tipped minimum wage is the lower minimum wage that employers can pay tipped workers with the expectation that tips will bring their pay up to the regular minimum wage rate,” she says. “Under federal law, the tipped minimum wage is $2.13 an hour. So tipped workers need to earn an additional $5.12 in tips to bring them up to the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour.”

On this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast, we find out how this system began and why we still have it.

Where does tipping in America come from in the first place?

Tipping goes back to the pre-Civil War times in the US. There were wealthy Americans who were vacationing in Europe, and they noticed this practice of tipping where if you had good service, you gave a small extra fee on top of what you paid.

Then, tipping started to fade as a practice in Europe but persisted in the US. We can tie that back to the abolition of slavery. Once slavery was abolished following the Civil War, workers who were formerly enslaved in agriculture and domestic service continued to do these same jobs, but employers didn't want to pay them.

So instead of actually just paying them their wage, they suggested that the customer paid a small tip to Black workers for their services. That's how tipping started proliferating across service sector jobs and became the predominant way that workers in these jobs were paid.

How did the restaurant industry start to do this?

It really goes back to the formation of the National Restaurant Association. From the very beginning, going back to the early 1920s, they united around a common goal of keeping labor costs low, essentially lobbying against any efforts to raise wages for tipped workers and to eliminate the tipped minimum wage.

It sounds like this whole policy is a direct legacy of trying to keep Black people from getting the same minimum wage as other workers. When were service sectors included in the national minimum wage?

It wasn't until the mid-1960s that tipped workers got the same rights as other workers under changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act. In the mid-1960s — this is during the civil rights movement, a few years after the March on Washington, which called for stronger minimum wage protections — amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act established a wage floor for tipped workers. It also increased protections for workers in agriculture, schools, laundries, nursing homes — a lot of sectors in which Black people were disproportionately employed and in which workers of color are still overrepresented even today. This was a big deal. Something like a third of the Black population gained protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act through these amendments in 1966.

Even after these amendments, the FLSA continued to exclude farm workers from overtime protections, and domestic workers didn't gain rights until the 1970s. It was a significant change, and a big deal, for tipped workers to be covered, but there was a huge catch in the amendment. It established a lower minimum wage that tipped workers could be paid through the creation of the tip credit system. And that's still what is in use today. This tip credit essentially allowed employers to count the tips that were received by their staff against half of the minimum wage that they were required to pay.

In 1996, the FLSA was amended again to raise the minimum wage federally from $4.25 to $5.15. Essentially, that froze the tipped minimum wage at $2.13 an hour, while the non-tipped minimum wage continued to go up. The tipped minimum wage has been stuck at $2.13 an hour since 1991, even though the federal minimum wage has been increased multiple times. And that's still the situation we're in now.

Why hasn't this changed? It seems like it would be easier to give everyone the same minimum wage, and you wouldn't have to worry about tipping.

I think that's in large part due to the lobbying and advocacy efforts of the National Restaurant Association, its affiliates — groups like the US Chamber of Commerce — and other employer groups that have fought tirelessly to prevent the minimum wage from being raised, both for tipped workers and for other workers.

There is a proposal in Congress to raise the minimum wage to $17 an hour by 2030, and it would completely phase out this tipped minimum wage so tipped workers would receive the same minimum wage as everyone else.

Some states have already eliminated the tipped minimum wage, but a lot more states haven't been able to do so yet. In most states, the minimum wage for tipped workers is still less than $4 an hour.

How does the tip credit system work in practice? 

Employers are legally required to make up the difference if workers aren't receiving enough in tips to get them up to the regular minimum wage. But in practice, it's extremely difficult to enforce that rule. It's largely left up to the workers themselves to track their hours, their tips, and make some complicated calculations about what they're actually earning per hour per week.

Then they have to confront their employer if it seems like they're not actually receiving the minimum wage, which obviously introduces a whole host of issues related to power dynamics. Not only is it difficult to calculate and keep track of, but it's also difficult for workers to demand what they're owed.

As a result, it's largely not enforced. Workers who are already earning much lower wages than workers in non-tipped occupations are highly at risk of wage theft.

I think as consumers, we're initially taught that tips are a way to reward good service. How should we think about tipping?

I think this is a big misconception. People don't realize that they're actually paying the lion's share of their server's wages through their tips. Unfortunately, when you fail to tip your server, you're actually denying them their wage. We don't have the luxury in the US of having the system that you describe where you can pay a tip for particularly good service or pay a smaller tip to indicate that you didn't get good service.

How much do you typically tip?

I tip 20 percent as a standard, and sometimes, for a really good service, I'll tip more. I think that's basically the standard at this point in the US. It does get tricky, because we've seen a proliferation of tipping across lots of different transactions where a service wasn't necessarily rendered.

I think customers are increasingly frustrated by that, especially as the costs of things have gone up. But I hope customers target their frustration not at tipped workers but towards the employers and the lobbying groups that have fought for decades to preserve and expand the system. When you're tipping, remember that you're actually paying your server's wage, and that's a problem that we need to be solving by putting the onus on employers to pay their workers.

Christian Schneider once had to psych himself up to talk to customers or make fundraising pitches to investors.

The CEO and cofounder of the startup fileAI describes himself as an introvert who's been able to push himself to go beyond what he finds comfortable. That's part of being human, he said.

""We have to adapt,"" Schneider, whose company helps companies use their unstructured data, told Business Insider.

Some of his fellow introverts could soon have to embrace Schneider's can-do approach or risk being sidelined by their more outgoing peers. That's because as AI takes over more tasks, much of the work that remains could involve human interactions, workplace observers told BI.

""The extraverted personality has potentially an advantage here,"" Schneider said, because certain tasks can't be offloaded as easily to computers. For instance, a sales team might use AI to help with data entry or analyze call transcripts, but ChatGPT can't wine and dine a potential client — at least for now.

A greater emphasis on these human tasks could be worrisome news for introverts and, of course, a win for the glad-handers. Even when they're good at what they do, some extroverts are able to propel their careers with a frenzy of fist bumps and finger guns.

""The personality hire might be the most safe in the face of AI because what they can do is read a room. They can stand out. They can be charming,"" Elizabeth Lotardo, a leadership consultant, told BI.

At least for now, she said, people who can easily build relationships in the workplace and draw insights from colleagues could have an edge.

""That is organizational currency that AI cannot replicate, generally,"" said Lotardo, author of the book ""Leading Yourself.""

Schneider, from fileAI, said he expects that interpersonal skills will become ""super important"" as AI absorbs even more of the tasks that are currently keeping workers busy.

""You're going to need a lot less people doing these things that keep them on their laptops eight hours a day,"" he said.

Some labor market observers warn that roles comprised of routine tasks face the greatest risk of automation, though some companies hope to have AI take on far more.

AI might create a premium on human-to-human communication, yet it might also mean we become worse at it.

Vanessa Druskat, an associate professor of organizational behavior and management at the University of New Hampshire's Paul College of Business and Economics, describes herself as an introvert.

She said one worry she has is that when people use AI to interact less often with others and to create ""nice, clean, empathetic emails or texts,"" the part of the brain that handles those responsibilities could begin to atrophy.

""The way the brain works is it has kind of a use-it-or-lose-it capacity,"" Druskat said. If we outsource too many interactions to AI, she said, our own abilities are likely to weaken.

Druskat said that her concerns for introverts are similar to what she worries about in general for her students. Those who are using AI to write their professional emails could lose the ability to determine the ""appropriate emotion"" for the close of a message, she said.

""They're mental skills that we develop,"" said Druskat.

While Druskat sees risks in introverts losing some ability to communicate with others at work if they rely too much on AI, there can be a tangible boost for more reserved employees.

Brian Smith is an organizational psychologist who runs a leadership advisory firm. He's seen AI supercharge the abilities of some of the quieter people on his team, who he said sometimes found it difficult to engage with others.

Smith said team members have been able to query AI models to better understand the feedback they're getting from clients. That, in turn, he said, has enabled introverted team members to become more confident and ""start to have better human conversations with the people that they were originally having difficulty with.""

Yet for all the help AI can give workers of all personality types, it can't do everything, said Schneider, from fileAI.

For now, a bot won't be a big help, he said, if he has to talk to an investor in person. He still needs those interpersonal skills.

""It can upskill me, and it can sort of give me the playbook, but at the end of the day, I'm going to be standing there, and I'm going to have to deliver,"" Schneider said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Lutnick: Trump wants 'good enough' EU trade offer — but what that means is unclear","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/27/lutnick-trump-european-union-trade-aug-1-.html","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 15:08:51 GMT","



Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the European Union should agree to open its markets for U.S. exports to convince President Donald Trump to lower ""reciprocal"" tariffs on the 27-member bloc.

Lutnick's comments suggest that Trump is open to a deal with the EU, but reiterated that the president still believes there's roughly a 50-50 chance that one can ultimately be reached.

""The question is, do they offer President Trump a good enough deal that is worth it for him to step off of the 30% tariffs that he set,"" Lutnick said on Fox News.

The commerce secretary's comments still raise questions about what a ""good enough"" deal with the United States' largest trading partner would look like at a pivotal time for trade negotiations.

Trump is set to hold trade talks with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, days before the Aug. 1 deadline for Trump's tariffs to take effect.

Ahead of the pivotal trade deadline, Trump on Friday said that ""we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU.""

He said that sticking points remained ""with maybe 20 different things,"" raising questions about whether the two leaders could move closer to a framework for a deal on Sunday.

As Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on the EU, the bloc has weighed countermeasures, such as using its ""Anti-Coercion Instrument,"" a move that has been seen as the trading bloc's ""trade bazooka."" 

Such a move could hinder U.S. vendors' participation in the EU market.

In this article

After spiraling from crisis to crisis over much of the past seven years, Boeing is stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg's leadership.

Ortberg, a longtime aerospace executive and an engineer whom the manufacturer plucked from retirement to fix the problem-addled company last year, is set this week to outline significant progress since he took the helm a year ago. Boeing reports quarterly results and gives its outlook on Tuesday.

So far, investors are liking what they've been seeing. Shares of the company are up more than 30% so far this year.

Wall Street analysts expect the aircraft manufacturer to halve its second-quarter losses from a year ago when it reports. Ortberg told investors in May that the manufacturer expects to generate cash in the second half of the year. Boeing's aircraft production has increased, and its airplane deliveries just hit the highest level in 18 months.

It's a shift for Boeing, whose successive leaders missed targets on aircraft delivery schedules, certifications, financial goals and culture changes that frustrated investors and customers alike, while rival Airbus pulled ahead.

""The general agreement is that the culture is changing after decades of self-inflicted knife wounds,"" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm.

Analysts expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year.

""When he got the job, I was not anywhere as near as optimistic as today,"" said Douglas Harned, senior aerospace and defense analyst at Bernstein.

Ortberg's work was already cut out for him, but the challenges multiplied when he arrived.

As the company hemorrhaged cash, Ortberg announced massive cost cuts, including laying off 10% of the company. Its machinists who make the majority of its airplanes went on strike for seven weeks until the company and the workers' union signed a new labor deal. Ortberg also oversaw a more than $20 billion capital raise last fall, replaced the head of the defense unit and sold off its Jeppesen navigation business.

Ortberg bought a house in the Seattle area, where Boeing makes most of its planes, shortly after taking the job last August, and his presence has been positive, aerospace analysts have said.

""He's showing up,"" Aboulafia said. ""You show up, you talk to people.""

Boeing declined to make Ortberg available for an interview.

Boeing's leaders hoped for a turnaround year in 2024. But five days in, a door-plug blew out of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Portland. The almost-catastrophe brought Boeing a production slowdown, renewed Federal Aviation Administration scrutiny and billions in cash burn.

Key bolts were left off the plane before it was delivered to Alaska Airlines. It was the latest in a series of quality problems at Boeing, where other defects have required time-consuming reworking.

Boeing had already been reeling from two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that sullied the reputation of America's largest exporter. The company in May reached an agreement with the Justice Department to avoid prosecution stemming from a battle over a previous criminal conspiracy charge tied to the crashes. Victims' family members slammed the deal when it was announced.

For years, executives at top Boeing airline customers complained publicly about the manufacturer and its leadership as they grappled with delays. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told investors in May 2022 that management needed a ""reboot or boot up the arse.""

Last week, O'Leary had a different tune.

""I continue to believe Kelly Ortberg, [and Boeing Commercial Airplane unit CEO] Stephanie Pope are doing a great job,"" he said on an earnings call. ""I mean, there is no doubt that the quality of what is being produced, the hulls in Wichita and the aircraft in Seattle has dramatically improved.""

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby cast doubt over the Boeing 737 Max 10 after the January 2024 door-plug accident, as the carrier prepared not to have that aircraft in its fleet plan. The plane is still not certified, but Kirby has said Boeing has been more predictability on airplane deliveries.

Still, delays for the Max 10, the largest of the Max family, and the yet-to-be certified Max 7, the smallest, are a headache for customers, especially since having too few or too many seats on a flight can determine profitability for airlines.

""They're working the right problems. The consistency of deliveries is much better,"" Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said in an interview last month. ""But there's no update on the Max 7. We're assuming we are not flying it in 2026.""

Boeing under Ortberg still has much to fix.

The FAA capped Boeing's production at 38 Maxes a month, a rate that it has reached. To go beyond that, to a target of 42, Boeing will need the FAA's blessing.

Ortberg said this year that the company is stabilizing to go beyond that rate. Manufacturers get paid when aircraft are delivered, so higher production is key.

""I would suspect they would be having those discussions very soon,"" Harned said. ""It's 47 [a month] that I think is the challenging break.""

He added that Boeing has a lot of inventory on hand to help increase production.

Its defense unit has also suffered. The defense unit encompasses programs like the KC-46 tanker program and Air Force One, which has drawn public ire from President Donald Trump. Trump, frustrated with delays on the two new jets meant to serve the president, turned to a used Qatari Boeing 747 to potentially use as a presidential aircraft, though insiders say that used plane could require months of reoutfitting.

Ortberg replaced the head of that unit last fall.

""They're not totally out of the woods,"" Harned said.

Boeing and Ortberg also need to start thinking about a new jet, some industry members said. Its best-selling 737 first debuted in 1967, and the company was looking at a midsize jetliner before the two crashes sent its attention elsewhere.

""Already there's been a reversal from 'read my lips, no new jet.' I would like to see that accelerate,"" Aboulafia said. ""He is the guy to make that happen.""

In heady times — and with trade wars dominating the news agenda — it's easy to forget that Russia and Ukraine's soldiers continue to fight for every inch of frontline territory in Ukraine.

Conflict in Gaza, ongoing economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe and the shifting geopolitical landscape with strengthening, and opposing, 'axes of power' are also at the fore of global policymakers' minds, pushing more than three-and-a-half years of war in Ukraine down the agenda.

It seems increasingly that both Russia and Ukraine are being left out in the cold, with even this week's talks in Istanbul, involving negotiating teams from both sides, barely getting a mention in the media. As things stand, there's an uneasy air when it comes to the direction of the war and prospects for peace.

Trump appeared to lose his patience when he stated on July 14 that Ukraine could receive more U.S.-made weapons — as long as NATO allies paid for them — and gave Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. If it did not, he said, Russia would face ""very severe"" sanctions and ""secondary"" tariffs of up to 100%.

Those could hit Russia hard, as well as its remaining trading partners, including India and China, who buy Russian oil and gas, among other commodities.

As things stand, Russia has until Sept 2 to show it's serious about a ceasefire and peace plan — on which little progress has been made, despite some agreements over prisoner swaps.

Analysts are skeptical that the threat of more sanctions will move Russian President Vladimir Putin to come to the negotiating table in good faith, let alone talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

There is a stretch between Trump's demand for a peace deal and any further sanctions, Mykola Bielieskov, research fellow at Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies, said. 

""The Kremlin is generally banking on the fact that the United States under Trump is incapable of a systematic policy of supporting Ukraine and putting pressure on Russia,"" Bielieskov told NBC News earlier in July.

""Serious secondary sanctions require a willingness to quarrel with China and India, which buy raw materials from Russia,"" he noted.

""Similarly, when it comes to weapons, the speed and volume of supplies here and now matter. Therefore, there are many known unknowns. And I think Russia may believe that the U.S. will not dare to impose secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners,"" he added.

Ukraine, at the mercy of U.S. and European largesse when it comes to weapons supplies, has shown more willingness to negotiate in recent months, calling, along with Trump, for a ceasefire with Russia that has gone unanswered.

It has also shown a willingness to compromise even when it comes to ceding Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory to Moscow if it was granted something of a 'holy grail' for the country: NATO membership.

But there has been little sign that Russia, making small but incremental gains on the battlefield due to its sheer force of conscripted manpower and intense drone warfare, would be willing to accept Western-pledged security guarantees for Ukraine, in any form.

Making matters worse for Kyiv is growing unrest at a domestic level, with misgivings over ongoing martial law, the lack of elections and the wartime leadership of Zelenskyy.

Protests erupted in Kyiv last week amid a backlash against government moves to limit the independence of two anti-corruption agencies. Top EU politicians expressed consternation at the move to outlet Politico, saying it showed a lack of commitment to pursuing European democratic values. Combatting what has been endemic corruption in Ukraine is seen as a prerequisite for EU membership, which Kyiv covets.

A government reshuffle in mid-July also fueled accusations that Zelenskyy was concentrating power among loyalists, which could also ignite concerns among Ukraine's international backers and benefactors.

Ukraine is entering ""a critical phase of internal consolidation amid growing external uncertainty,"" according to Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and the founder of political analysis firm, R. Politik.

""The latest battlefield developments coincide with a new American posture: Donald Trump has opted for tactical delay over decisive engagement, stepping back operationally while transferring financial and political responsibilities to Europe,"" she said in emailed comments this week.

""Kyiv, meanwhile, is using this interlude to recalibrate internally. The recent government reshuffle ... underscores the Zelenskyy administration's intent to reinforce political control and preserve cohesion in the face of mounting pessimism, institutional inertia, and an intensifying labour crisis,"" she added.

Despite increasing Western unease regarding Ukraine's domestic trajectory, Stanovaya noted, ""international support is becoming more transactional, geared primarily towards sustaining the front line rather than advancing democratic reform.""

In this article

As the stock market focuses on major earnings and negotiations on the tariff front, investors seeking a regular income stream continue to look for attractive dividend stocks amid ongoing volatility.

To this end, the analysis of top Wall Street analysts can provide useful insights that can help investors pick companies with solid fundamentals and the ability to pay dividends consistently.  

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Oil and gas exploration and production company EOG Resources (EOG) is first on this week's list. In May, the company announced a deal to acquire Encino Acquisition Partners (EAP) for $5.6 billion. EOG stated that the deal's accretion to its free cash flow supports a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend, to $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. At an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG stock offers a dividend yield of 3.4%.

Ahead of EOG Resources' second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 8, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on EOG stock with a price forecast of $155. In comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $138 on EOG stock with an ""outperform"" rating. Meanwhile, Sorbara stated that he expects EOG to report strong quarterly results on both the operational and financial fronts. 

The five-star analyst believes that investors will pay more attention to EOG's significant expansion in the Utica shale via the EAP acquisition, as the deal is expected to provide catalysts from the integration, synergies, and execution in the quarters ahead. 

""All in all, we are positive EOG into the print, especially since EOG should be more defensive in the current price environment,"" said Sorbara.

The analyst is also bullish on EOG due to its peer-leading shareholder returns, supported by its solid free cash flow generation, best-in-class balance sheet, and the Utica shale expansion. Sorbara expects EOG to maintain its commitment to return at least 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually via dividends and opportunistic buybacks. He expects $450 million of buybacks for Q2 2025. Overall, Sorbara estimates $976.6 million of capital returns, representing 107.7% of free cash flow and a 6.0% capital returns yield.

Sorbara ranks No. 178 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 22.5%. See EOG Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB) is the next dividend-paying stock in focus. WMB offers a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share (annualized dividend of $2.00 per share), reflecting a yield of 3.5%.

Heading into WMB's Q2 results scheduled for early August, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $63. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on WMB stock with a price target of $63. Meanwhile, Scotto lowered the Q2 projections to reflect insights from the conversations with the WMB team, seasonal adjustments to marketing estimates, and RBC's updated commodity price deck.

Scotto expects sequential decline in commodity prices to be a modest headwind in the second quarter, particularly for WMB's upstream operations. The analyst expects Q2 results to be impacted by lower quarter-over-quarter marketing contributions due to normal seasonality and higher storage fees, partially offset by contributions from the recent investment in Cogentrix.

On the positive side, Scotto is confident about WMB's long-term growth, backed by its robust backlog of projects with low build multiples (less than five-times capex to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), with planned in-services dates through 2030. The analyst also expects WMB to benefit from additional behind-the-meter (BTM) projects and the potential revival of the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline and the Constitution pipeline project.

""Despite its recent selloff, we still view WMB as one of the best positioned companies within our coverage universe to benefit from growing natural gas demand,"" said Scotto.

Scotto ranks No. 72 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.5%. See Williams Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ). The company delivered solid results for the second quarter of 2025. Verizon raised the lower end of its annual profit guidance, reflecting robust demand for its premium plans and its reaction to the new tax law under the Trump administration.

The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, payable on Aug. 1. With an annualized dividend of $2.71, VZ stock offers a dividend yield of 6.3%.

In reaction to the Q2 print, Citi analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on Verizon stock with a price forecast of $48. Also, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on VZ stock with a price target of $49. Rollins noted Verizon's Q2 performance and the upgrade to the full-year EBITDA and EPS guidance based on the relative strength in the first half of the year.

He added that key performance indicators (KPIs) were mixed and continue to reflect a more promotional competitive backdrop. Notably, Rollins trimmed his postpaid phone subscriber outlook to reflect a year-over-year rise in churn, which is expected to persist in the second half of the year.

""Verizon indicated a more disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition, which is encouraging for competitive dynamics and its financials, albeit likely dilutive to its near-term volume KPIs,"" said Rollins.

Despite additional promotional costs and lighter volume, Rollins believes that Verizon is well-positioned to deliver its full-year guidance. Overall, Rollins remains bullish on VZ stock, given its relative value and opportunities for the company to sustain annual financial growth.

Rollins ranks No. 276 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. See Verizon Stock Charts on TipRanks.

I think most would agree that the news cycle has been relentless for most of 2025, but certain stories do seem a little ""Groundhog Day"" at the moment.

Earlier this month, I wrote about the conundrum facing the newsroom over how to approach President Donald Trump's then-trade talk deadline of July 9. Now, at the end of the month, we find ourselves in a similar position, but this time the date we are all watching is August 1.

Why? Once again, it's another deadline for countries across the globe to try and agree a trade truce with the United States, with the European Union in particular focus this time round.

Debate in the newsroom resurfaces … when is a deadline not a deadline?

The week has become even trickier to predict, with talks between the U.S. and China now taking center stage in Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday — potentially further complicating the picture for Europe.

A U.S. trade agreement with the European Union has seemed tantalizingly close, with CNBC's Silvia Amaro reporting that a 15% baseline tariff rate is the base-case scenario, according to an EU diplomat. These reports drove stock markets across Europe and the U.S. higher last week.

On Friday, however, Trump told reporters there was only a ""50-50 chance"" of a deal.

As CNBC's Holly Ellyatt explains, the EU is keeping its so-called ""trade bazooka"" — or Anti Coercion Instrument — warm in case an agreement is not reached by the August deadline.

The corporate world is crying out for an agreement, piling pressure on the European Union to put an end to the uncertainty. Puma, VW, Michelin and other corporates across Europe have downgraded their outlooks citing the impact of tariffs and the ongoing pressure the restrictions are putting on these businesses.

This week, all eyes will be on another raft of earnings from Europe, including banking giants UBS, Santander and Standard Chartered, drinks firm Heineken, pharma giant AstraZeneca and energy major Shell to name a few.

On the data front, GDP growth rates for France, Spain, Germany and Italy will be released on Wednesday, providing insight into the wider impact of the market uncertainty.

Last week, the tricky economic conditions saw the European Central Bank opt for a hawkish hold of the benchmark rate at 2%, with President Christine Lagarde saying the ECB is ""in a good place to hold and watch how risks develop over the next few months.""

And so Friday August 1st will be a crucial date for market participants and corporates (and the newsroom)… until it isn't.

Bitcoin's identity crisis came roaring back into focus this weekend after Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced that it had facilitated a $9 billion sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin for a Satoshi-era investor. The firm said the sale — one of the largest notional BTC transactions ever — was part of the seller's estate planning strategy.

The transaction was immediately seen as symbolic. For some, it marked a practical rebalancing. For others, it was a worrying sign that even Bitcoin's earliest believers are cashing out. Crypto analyst and commentator Scott Melker fanned the flames with a sharply worded post on X.

The comment kicked off a fierce debate that spanned crypto influencers, traders, and ideologues — many of whom disagreed over what the whale's exit meant, and whether Melker's framing was accurate.

Critics of Melker's interpretation argued that one transaction — egardless of size — doesn't signify ideological abandonment. They noted the sale was explicitly tied to estate planning, not a loss of conviction. Others pointed out that wallet movements can be misleading, and selling doesn't automatically mean an investor has given up on the asset long term.

Some community members even called the remark speculative, pointing to OGs like Adam Back and others who continue to accumulate. Melker later clarified that he was “just pointing out what I've been hearing,” not declaring his own view.

Supporters of Melker's take saw the whale's exit as emblematic of a broader shift. With Bitcoin increasingly absorbed into traditional finance — via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and custody solutions — some worry that the asset has drifted from its cypherpunk roots.

To this group, Bitcoin's transformation into a tradable, regulated, and largely off-chain instrument is a distortion of its founding vision. If early believers are losing interest, they argue, it may be a symptom of Bitcoin becoming less about individual sovereignty and more about financial engineering.

Another group pushed back against the premise that institutional involvement amounts to ideological failure. In their view, Bitcoin's value lies in its neutrality — its rules apply to everyone, whether it's retail users or Wall Street funds. Censorship resistance, not exclusion, is the foundation.

These commentators argued that the rise of ETFs and custodial adoption was inevitable, and even necessary, if Bitcoin is to achieve broad monetary relevance. From this perspective, whale exits are simply a part of maturing capital flows — not a sign of philosophical surrender.

The debate also triggered deeper concerns about Bitcoin's function. If most BTC is held as a passive store of value and rarely transacted, how will the network continue to be secured post-halving? With mining rewards falling and on-chain usage declining, some worry that transaction fees alone may not sustain network integrity in the long run.

While Melker's post didn't move markets, it did spotlight a critical question: What does it mean when early believers sell? Is it a warning signal, or a natural redistribution? A loss of faith — or a sign of progress?

Galaxy's $9 billion transaction offered no definitive answers. But the reactions that followed revealed just how unsettled Bitcoin's evolving role remains. Between the vision it was born from and the institutions now shaping it, the ideological rift is no longer theoretical — it's playing out in real time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin OGs ‘faith shaken' comment stirs heated debate in community","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-faith-debate-institution-governments-adoption","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 06:25:32 GMT","

 A crypto analyst disagreed with the statement, saying, “Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.” 

A prominent crypto analyst has sparked debate in the Bitcoin community by claiming that Bitcoin OGs are losing confidence in the asset as it becomes increasingly adopted by institutions.

“Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices,” Scott Melker, aka The Wolf of All Street, said in an X post on Saturday.

“Bitcoin is amazing, but it's obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against,” Melker said.

While Melker acknowledged that he's not saying he agrees with them and only “pointing out” what he has been hearing, the comments triggered a debate over what Bitcoin's (BTC) increasing institutional adoption means for Bitcoin's original ethos.

Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred said he “rarely disagrees” with Melker, but he does on this occasion. “People make a personal decision to sell some of all their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol,” Alfred said. 

Several early Bitcoin adopters have publicly disclosed selling off their Bitcoin in recent times. Willy Woo recently told Cointelegraph Magazine he sold most of his Bitcoin because he thinks investing in Bitcoin infrastructure will give him better returns. Meanwhile, prominent Bitcoiner PlanB revealed in February that he sold most of his Bitcoin and switched to spot Bitcoin ETFs for easier management.

Alfred added, “Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.”

Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger said that widespread adoption is impossible without institutional interest:

Crypto Mags said that Bitcoin doesn't discriminate. “I'm here to remind you that Bitcoin is for everyone. Everyone INCLUDES enemies, governments, and Wall Street,” Crypto Mags said.

Bitwise Invest chief investment officer Matt Hougan said while he understands where Melker is coming from, Bitcoin is “still pretty revolutionary.”

“It's the first global money backed, not by the state and the threat of violence, but by logic and community,” Hougan said.

“Respect to the early whales, and let's keep building. The world needs Bitcoin more than ever,” he said.

It comes just a day after an early Bitcoin investor sold 80,000 BTC through Galaxy Digital, in what the digital asset company described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has reignited discussion around Bitcoin's long-term parabolic trajectory by sharing an updated version of what he now calls the “Bitcoin Banana.”

In a tweet posted on July 27, Brandt humorously reaffirmed his claim to being the first to identify Bitcoin's parabolic structure back in October 2017. The updated chart includes a bold, yellow, banana-shaped arc encapsulating Bitcoin's historic price growth and future trajectory.

Brandt's chart, which spans from Bitcoin's inception to projections for 2029, shows the asset's remarkable rise within a broad, curved band—suggesting that despite periods of volatility, the overarching trend remains bullish. The “banana” curve captures each of Bitcoin's major bull and bear cycles, with the price consistently returning to the midline of this elongated parabolic zone.



The visual metaphor is more than playful. It underscores Brandt's broader thesis that Bitcoin operates within a predictable, albeit volatile, long-term growth pattern. He notes that recent price action—hovering around $118,000—still aligns with this curved structure. The red and black trend lines on the chart further reinforce key resistance and support zones embedded in this multiyear growth channel.

By coining the phrase “Bitcoin Banana,” Brandt highlights both the longevity and the consistency of Bitcoin's trajectory when viewed from a logarithmic, long-term perspective. This framing echoes his earlier work on identifying exponential growth assets and builds on the technical concept of parabolic advances.

Brandt also issued a friendly challenge to the crypto community: “If I'm wrong [about being the first], show the link.” It's a call to verify history, as well as a nod to the enduring significance of trader insight during Bitcoin's early technical analysis phase.

 







Bitcoin is once again mirroring global liquidity trends—and that could have major implications in the days ahead.

The crypto market is showing signs of cautious optimism. While prices remain elevated, sentiment indicators and trading activity suggest investors are stepping back to reassess risks rather than diving in further.

Citigroup analysts say the key to Bitcoin's future isn't mining cycles or halving math—it's ETF inflows.

Bitcoin may be entering a typical summer correction phase, according to a July 25 report by crypto financial services firm Matrixport.

Oops, something went wrong

The Ether Machine, a new crypto venture formed through the merger of Ether Reserve and Dynamix Corporation (DYNX), is preparing to go public after raising over 400,000 ether (ETH-USD), equivalent to $1.5 billion, offering the public a new way to access cryptocurrency yields.

The news came after a week when the ethereum cryptocurrency surged by over 20%, leading some to predict that it could pass $4,000 and sending long-term predictions into the $10,000s.

Ether Machine isn't the first firm to do this. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, announced plans to begin stockpiling ether back in late June. SharpLink Gaming (SBET), a Nasdaq-listed sports-betting technology company, made a similar move in late May when it named Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as its new chairman.

Further adoption of the blockchain into the mainstream in recent months has supported ethereum's rise, including Robinhood's (HOOD) introduction of ethereum staking in the US and the passage of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS bill through the US Senate.

Here's what to know about ethereum and what sets it apart from other blockchains.

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that hosts programmable contracts and other cryptocurrencies. Its native crypto token, named ether but sometimes referred to as ethereum, is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, topped only by bitcoin (BTC-USD).

A “blockchain” is a digital record of transactions and other data. New “blocks,” or batches of validated records, are added onto the publicly accessible chain, referencing previous ones, so that anyone using a blockchain agrees on the current state of finalized transactions.

“Transactions are entered, and then they are immutable,"" Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden told Yahoo Finance. ""It is about integrity. You know when something is entered, nobody else can mess around with it.”

In addition to ether and other popular cryptocurrencies, over 50% of all stablecoins in circulation are hosted on ethereum, and the platform can also be used to exchange NFTs and more, according to Galaxy.

One major difference in how these transactions take place on ethereum compared to the bitcoin blockchain is that ethereum includes functionality for users to create and use so-called smart contracts.

Smart contracts are programs that can execute financial operations when conditions are met, often used to develop applications known as decentralized finance or DeFi apps. These “dapps” offer a variety of financial services without the middleman of traditional financial institutions.

For example, a smart contract could be set up to automatically initiate a purchase once a cryptocurrency hits a certain price. For some, the fact that smart contracts can't be altered once put on the blockchain and that they operate based on code instead of being manually performed by an individual or institution are benefits of the system.

Ethereum launched on July 30, 2015, as “Frontier” after raising $18 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) the year prior. The release followed a period when ethereum encouraged users to stress-test the blockchain by offering a prize of 25,000 ether.

In 2016, ethereum network participants attacked a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which had raised ether through crowdfunding. The users targeted a vulnerability in DAO's smart contracts and stole over $50 million worth of ether.

To reverse the attack, ethereum created a controversial “hard fork,” in which they rolled back the blockchain's history to before the theft. While most adopted this new blockchain, some refused and stuck with what is now known as Ethereum Classic.

Since then, ethereum has continued rolling out updates, including a series known as “The Merge” conducted in 2022. With it, ethereum switched from using proof-of-work for blockchain consensus to proof-of-stake, separating it from peers like bitcoin.

Proof-of-work blockchains function through the work of “miners,” or specialized computers that contribute computational power to validate transactions using cryptography. Miners are rewarded with newly issued cryptocurrency for the amount of computing power they contribute to verifying transactions.

Under the proof-of-stake system, however, security comes from users locking a certain amount of the cryptocurrency they own into a smart contract as collateral before they can be selected to add new blocks of validated transactions to the blockchain.

According to the Ethereum Foundation, this switch alone cut the platform's energy consumption by 99.5%, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin claimed that it would reduce the world's energy consumption by 0.2%.

“With climate concerns and ESG-investing remaining a major topic for institutional investors, ethereum's drastic energy reduction could open doors for additional capital flows and longer-term sustainability,” Tom Dunleavy, a senior research analyst with Messari, told Yahoo Finance.

Since its launch, ethereum has drawn attention from investors and organizations alike.

Visa (V) began settling transactions using the USD Coin (USDC-USD) stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain in 2021.

“The announcement today marks a major milestone in our ability to address the needs of fintechs managing their business in a stablecoin or cryptocurrency,” Visa chief product officer Jack Forestell said. “It's really an extension of what we do every day, securely facilitating payments in all different currencies all across the world.”

More recently, with stablecoin legislation passing this June, Wall Street executives, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser, have indicated interest in working with crypto assets.

Public figures have also joined the movement to adopt crypto. In February, Eric Trump posted to X, saying, “In my opinion, it's a great time to add $ETH.”

His words reflect a presidential administration that has been supportive of cryptocurrency. President Trump's Media & Technology Group filed to list an ETF that included ether, and the president celebrated the passage of the GENIUS Act on Truth Social.

“HAPPY CRYPTO WEEK!” Trump posted last week. “This is our moment — Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Against Bitcoin: Will History Repeat?","https://cryptodnes.bg/en/ethereum-flashes-golden-cross-against-bitcoin-will-history-repeat/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 16:08:02 GMT","

Ethereum (ETH) has just triggered a golden cross against Bitcoin (BTC)—a technical pattern that has historically preceded massive altcoin rallies.

According to popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover, this is only the fifth time this bullish crossover has occurred on the ETH/BTC pair since 2019. Of the previous four instances, three resulted in explosive Ethereum price outperformance.

A golden cross is formed when a short-term moving average (usually the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (typically the 200-day). In this case, the ETH/BTC chart on Binance shows the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) overtaking the 200-day SMA, a widely followed signal by technical traders that momentum is shifting.

Crypto Rover posted a comparative chart on July 27 highlighting how each of the past golden crosses—marked by yellow circles—led to significant upward moves in ETH compared to BTC. Only one instance failed to follow through, suggesting a strong historical bias toward bullish continuation.



The chart also reveals the magnitude of the gains that followed each successful signal. For example, the 2020 golden cross preceded Ethereum's surge to new all-time highs. Similarly, the 2021 crossover sparked another parabolic phase.

What makes this latest signal intriguing is its timing. Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin for much of 2024 and 2025, pushing the ETH/BTC ratio near multi-year lows. Now, with renewed ETF momentum and a spike in institutional ETH interest, some analysts believe a rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum could be underway.

The golden cross could serve as a technical catalyst for such a shift—especially if supported by increased volume and broader market confidence. While skeptics warn that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, sentiment among Ethereum bulls is clearly growing.

If history is any guide, ETH may be poised to regain dominance over BTC in the coming weeks. Traders and investors will now watch to see whether this technical signal proves predictive once again—or if 2025 breaks the pattern.







Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has weighed in on $HYPE's recent price action, suggesting that the token may have completed the majority of its current bullish leg.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has reignited discussion around Bitcoin's long-term parabolic trajectory by sharing an updated version of what he now calls the “Bitcoin Banana.”

Ethereum's network just witnessed a seismic shift in activity.

Binance has officially launched a new airdrop event for Verasity (VRA) through its Binance Alpha platform, giving eligible users the chance to claim free tokens and compete for a massive prize pool.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Tom Lee Reveals What Makek Ethereum His Top Bet","https://cryptodnes.bg/en/tom-lee-reveals-what-makek-ethereum-his-top-bet/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 16:08:03 GMT","

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently outlined his bullish stance on Ethereum, linking it directly to the rapid growth of the stablecoin sector.

He emphasized that stablecoins—not just Ethereum's smart contract capabilities—are the real engine behind his preference for the blockchain.

Lee, widely recognized for his previous role as chief equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, has long been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies. While his optimistic market outlook has drawn both praise and criticism, his predictions have often aligned with major crypto adoption waves. His recent appointment as chairman of Bitmine, where he helped shape a $250 million Ethereum treasury strategy, has further solidified his reputation as an institutional crypto advocate.

While acknowledging Ethereum's role as a leading programmable blockchain, Lee made it clear that the explosive rise of stablecoins is the primary force driving his Ethereum thesis. Citing Circle's IPO performance and the emergence of stablecoin-backed businesses with strong earnings multiples, he described stablecoins as the “ChatGPT of the crypto world”—a technology that has rapidly moved from niche to mainstream.

He added that this boom reflects two converging trends: institutional finance embracing token-based models and the crypto-native community exploring tokenized versions of traditional assets, including the U.S. dollar.

By tying Ethereum's future to the continued growth of stablecoins, Lee positioned the asset not just as a technology platform, but as the backbone of a broader financial shift now gaining traction across both Wall Street and decentralized markets.

During the interview, Lee also reflected on the evolution of individual investor behavior in the digital age. He attributed the shift to two key trends: the rise of independent media via platforms like Twitter, which has given startups greater visibility, and the cyclical return of retail investor optimism in U.S. equity markets, typically occurring every two decades.

These structural changes, Lee argued, have reshaped market participation—especially among younger generations—making assets like Ethereum more accessible and better understood by the public.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Bitcoin's market dominance has fallen below a critical technical support level after repeated failures to maintain a foothold above 66%, sparking renewed speculation about the shifting dynamics of capital allocation within the cryptocurrency market. The metric, which measures Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization, declined by 4.6% month-over-month, dropping from 65.1% to 60.4% as of July 27, 2025, according to CoinMarketCap data. This decline marks a significant structural breakdown, with Ethereum and other altcoins expanding their collective influence [1].  

The waning dominance of Bitcoin follows a pattern of four distinct rejections at the 66% threshold, a level that had previously functioned as a key psychological and technical resistance. Each attempt to reclaim this level was met with sharp reversals, indicating persistent selling pressure near the upper bounds of the established trading channel. Analysts highlight that these repeated failures suggest a shift in investor sentiment, with capital increasingly flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies. Ethereum's share of the market rose by 2.82% during the same period, climbing from 8.9% to 11.8%, while the combined dominance of other altcoins increased by 1.77% to 27.8% [1].  

Technically, the breakdown below the 66% resistance has triggered a reassessment of Bitcoin's long-term trajectory. After riding an ascending trendline since mid-2023, BTC.D—Bitcoin's dominance index—has now breached a critical support zone near 62%. The collapse through this level, marked by a large bearish candlestick, has shifted momentum to the downside. Traders are closely monitoring the 60% level, a previously tested support area that has been retested multiple times. A further decline toward 54% is projected if the price closes below this threshold, reinforcing the bearish outlook until dominance reclaims the 66% resistance [1].  

The redistribution of market share reflects broader thematic shifts in the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum's recent gains are attributed to its role as a foundational platform for decentralized applications and its ongoing upgrades, which have enhanced scalability and utility. Meanwhile, altcoins are benefiting from a more fragmented risk-on environment, where investors are diversifying exposure amid Bitcoin's relative underperformance. However, market participants caution that the current trend does not automatically signal an “altseason”—a period characterized by widespread altcoin rallies. Historical data shows that Bitcoin's dominance has periodically dipped below 40% during altseasons, but macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin's own narrative as a store of value remain critical determinants of long-term market behavior [1].  

The technical breakdown has also prompted strategic adjustments among traders and institutional players. Some are reallocating capital to altcoins with strong fundamentals, though liquidity constraints and volatility in the sector remain challenges. The interplay between Bitcoin and altcoin activity underscores the interconnected nature of the crypto market, where movements in one asset class often influence broader sentiment. For now, on-chain metrics and volume patterns will be key indicators of whether the current trend persists or reverses in response to macroeconomic catalysts or regulatory clarity [1].

Altcoins are pulling heavy attention this week with some surprising price moves and major ecosystem updates. Ethereum's ETF momentum is ramping up, Solana is seeing buy-ins from big traders, and XRP is testing important price levels despite recent dips. But the coin leading the narrative right now is BlockDAG, thanks to its extended BEAT VESTING PASS deadline, record-breaking presale, and a tech rollout that's hitting every milestone before launch.

Each of these coins is trending for a different reason, and together they show just how wide the altcoin playbook is right now. Whether it's speed, scale, or speculative upside, they're pushing forward in unique ways. These are the top trending altcoins making noise this week, and why they matter.

BlockDAG has once again taken the spotlight after extending its BEAT VESTING PASS deadline until August 4. This extension lets users unlock 100% liquidity at launch, with zero lockups, something very few presales offer. With over $353 million raised and more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins sold, the project is setting up for a GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The price is still just $0.0016 for a limited time, while the listing price is locked at $0.05, giving buyers a potential 3,025% gain.

The momentum is backed by real usage. The X1 mobile miner just crossed 2.5 million users, and the new X10 miner demo is live. BlockDAG isn't just talking about community, it's delivering tools. Its hybrid DAG + PoW architecture supports smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps, all while keeping energy costs low. Over 4,500 developers are already building on the network, and the testnet is live with token/NFT creation tools and staking simulations.

With strategic deals signed with Inter Milan, Seattle Seawolves, and Seattle Orcas, and CEX listings ready to roll out post-launch, BlockDAG is being tracked as the leader among top trending altcoins right now. For those watching for timing, the presale ends August 11, but BEAT VESTING PASS disappears even earlier. This is the final stretch to grab BDAG with full launch liquidity locked in.

Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong near $3,770, showing about a 22% gain over the week. The main driver has been the sudden inflow into spot ETH ETFs, $1.85 billion in new capital arrived this week alone, bringing the total ETF inflows to over $2.18 billion. This kind of movement is putting Ethereum back into breakout territory, with $4,000 as the next target. Traders are watching to see if ETH can hold its momentum and push through that level soon.

On the futures side, open interest in Ethereum contracts on the CME reached $7.85 billion by July 26, showing major institutional interest. ETH is also outperforming both XRP and BTC over the last five days. Analysts have identified $3,300–$3,350 as strong support, with breakout potential above $3,850. Ethereum has firmly secured its spot on the list of top trending altcoins, with whales and ETFs aligned for the next potential surge.

XRP is currently trading around $3.19, retreating from a recent high of $3.45–$3.53. That ~6% pullback came after broad market liquidations and some whale profit-taking. Still, the asset has gained around 23% over the past week, and analysts are not backing off. Several forecasts point toward $4 in the short term if the ETF narrative continues and volume returns. Others look ahead to $10 or more in the long run, depending on regulatory moves.

The XRP ecosystem is also growing. Ripple's XRPL now supports a new stablecoin (RLUSD), and real-world use cases are expanding in areas like healthcare through integrations with Wellgistics. While XRP has cooled slightly, it remains one of the top trending altcoins this week. Analysts are closely watching support levels at $3.10–$3.15 to see if the next leg up is coming soon.

Solana (SOL) is trading around $187, down from a recent local high near $200. This correction is tied to overall market pressure and broad liquidations. Still, analysts are projecting a move to $250 if sentiment rebounds. That number isn't random, it reflects trading volume builds and ETF-related optimism that could re-center attention on SOL if ETH and BTC slow down.



Despite the dip, Solana continues to draw attention from high-volume traders and smart contract developers. Some traders are reallocating profits from Ethereum into Solana and speculative tokens like Jupiter or Remittix. Even with short-term price dips, SOL is holding firm as one of the top trending altcoins, with real activity on-chain and developers continuing to deploy new projects. If the price holds current support, the setup for a bounce is already forming.

The trends behind Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are all real and show what's driving short-term volatility across the market. ETH has ETF momentum and strong support around $3,350. XRP is still showing solid upside after a temporary pullback. SOL's dip might be a setup for a bigger breakout once market sentiment recovers.



But BlockDAG isn't just catching up to these coins, it's outperforming on every metric right now: community size, user activity, presale performance, and real utility. The BEAT VESTING PASS gives full liquidity at launch, the presale price of $0.0016 offers an unmatched 3,025% upside, and the launch plan is live and transparent. Among the top trending altcoins, BlockDAG is the only one still in accumulation mode, making it the strongest contender for gains both before and after listing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Top Altcoins Under $1: BlockDAG, DOGE, HBAR & XLM Price Update","https://blockchainreporter.net/top-altcoins-under-1-blockdag-doge-hbar-and-xlm-are-heating-up/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:00:38 GMT","

Not all low-cost cryptos are equal. This month, a handful of coins trading under $1 are showing real traction, through product rollouts, exchange listings, and strong trading activity. Whether it's a presale breaking records like BlockDAG, or listed coins like DOGE and HBAR pushing through key levels, these aren't just cheap entries, they're loaded with catalysts.

For anyone scanning the market for top altcoins under $1, this list is a solid place to start. Prices are still affordable, momentum is visible, and fundamentals are holding up across the board. These aren't just names with history, they're pushing for serious moves in the weeks ahead. And BlockDAG is right at the front of that push.

BlockDAG is one of the few presales still under a penny that's actually delivering. Its current price is locked at $0.0016, with the Beat Vesting Pass extended until August 4, giving users full liquidity at launch, no lockups, no delays. This makes it a unique entry point for anyone looking at high-upside altcoins. The presale has already raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, with a confirmed listing price of $0.05, putting early buyers in position for 3,025% gains from day one.

What sets BlockDAG apart is the real product rollout. Its X1 mobile mining app now has over 2.5 million users, and the X10 miner demo is live. The testnet includes a working explorer, no-code token and NFT creator, and staking tools. Over 4,500 developers are already building and testing apps in the ecosystem. The network uses a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work structure, allowing parallel transaction confirmation, EVM compatibility, and low energy use, features not common in projects at this stage.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG offers unmatched momentum, a clear timeline, and actual working infrastructure. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release ending on August 11 and liquidity tools already in place, it's not just another low-cost coin, it's one with real weight behind it.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.2358, following a sharp 11% drop earlier in the week. That pullback came after institutional players offloaded over 2.26 billion DOGE, triggering high sell volume and market-wide liquidations. Prior to that, the coin had broken above $0.26 and touched $0.28 briefly. Support is now at $0.23, while resistance sits near $0.28.

The drop has opened up a lower entry point, and long-term forecasts are still intact. Analysts see DOGE pushing back toward $0.33 this year, with $0.75 not out of the question by 2030 if retail interest returns in force. As one of the most traded meme tokens with massive liquidity, DOGE remains one of the top altcoins under $1 that market watchers are still keeping on their radar, especially when volatility cools down.

Hedera (HBAR) has made one of the strongest moves this month. It surged to $0.29 following a successful mainnet upgrade and a high-profile listing on Robinhood on July 25. That combo triggered retail buying and pushed trading volume past $700 million, with HBAR now hovering around $0.27–$0.29. It's gained more than 100% since earlier this month when it traded around $0.15.

Analysts say that a breakout past $0.47 could push the coin toward $1. However, resistance remains tight, and a failure to hold momentum could lead to a pullback toward the $0.21–$0.23 zone. Still, with technical upgrades live and retail entry easier through Robinhood, HBAR is one of the top altcoins under $1 that's riding a real growth narrative this quarter.

Stellar's XLM has more than doubled in price since early July, now trading between $0.44 and $0.47 after rising from just $0.22. The main catalyst behind the move is the launch of Protocol 23, which boosted interest from developers and institutions alike. The volume shot up alongside this growth, with institutional flow topping 400 million XLM during the run.

Right now, support is sitting near $0.44. If that breaks, $0.40 and $0.33 are key fallback levels. On the flip side, if XLM manages a close above $0.52, analysts expect a stronger rally toward its 2021 highs. Technical indicators show some signs of exhaustion, but the broader trend is still intact. For buyers looking at high-volume movers with strong network upgrades, XLM makes the list of top altcoins under $1 to track this summer.

Each of these four coins offers a different angle, DOGE is dipping from meme highs, HBAR is climbing on new access, and XLM is riding a network upgrade. But BlockDAG is the only one where the price is still nearly free, with $0.0016 unlocking over 3,000% upside if listing hits $0.05. And unlike most low-cap presales, the team has already rolled out mining apps, testnets, and dApp tools.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG gives the most complete combo: full liquidity from launch, working infrastructure, 2.5 million miners, and a ticking deadline. For anyone looking at entry-level cryptos right now, this one is leading the pack on momentum, value, and actual delivery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Vietnam Unveils Blockchain Backbone for National Data Security","https://bitcoinist.com/vietnam-unveils-blockchain-backbone-for-national-data-security/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 06:30:50 GMT","

Vietnam has taken a big step toward locking down its government data with the launch of NDAChain, a new blockchain network that only approved participants can join.

Built by the National Data Association and overseen by the Ministry of Public Security's Data Innovation and Exploitation Center, the system will serve as the main verification layer for everything from hospital records to school transcripts and supply‑chain logs.

Based on reports, NDAChain uses a hybrid model. It relies on a Proof‑of‑Authority consensus, which means only approved nodes can validate transactions.

At the same time, it adds Zero‑Knowledge Proofs to keep sensitive data private while still confirming its authenticity. Officials say the network can process between 1,200 to 3,600 transactions per second, a figure aimed at supporting fast checks in e‑government, logistics and other areas.

— Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 25, 2025



The new system includes two key features. NDA DID provides digital IDs that tie into Vietnam's existing VNeID setup. Citizens will be able to verify identities online when they sign documents or access services.

NDATrace offers end‑to‑end product tracking using GS1 and EBSI Trace standards. Items get unique identifiers, which can be scanned by QR codes or RFID chips. This should help businesses prove authenticity to overseas buyers and simplify recalls if problems arise.

According to Nguyen Huy, Head of Technology at the National Data Association, NDAChain acts as a “protective layer” for Vietnam's digital infrastructure. It's designed to scale as data volume grows.



Digital records—like medical files or student transcripts—can be checked without exposing personal details, thanks to the added privacy tools. At the same time, the permissioned setup gives authorities more control over who joins the network.

Based on reports, full integration with the National Data Center is set for completion by December 31, 2025. After that, the focus will shift to local agencies and universities, with industry‑specific Layer 2 apps planned in 2026.

Potential applications include identity wallets, counterfeit prevention systems and digital notaries. These add‑on apps will run on top of NDAChain without changing the core network.

Vietnam's move ties directly into its National Blockchain Strategy and the new law on the Digital Technology Industry, which recognizes digital assets as of June 2025.

Key Takeaways:

In a bold move that places it among the global leaders in blockchain infrastructure, Vietnam has officially launched NDAChain, a Layer-1 blockchain platform designed to be the backbone of its digital data ecosystem. This marks a significant milestone in the country's journey toward decentralized data management and Web3 adoption.

Vietnam's digital economy is rapidly evolving, driven by an ambitious government roadmap that emphasizes national data sovereignty and secure infrastructure. The unveiling of NDAChain on July 25, 2025, is not just a technological event but a strategic declaration: Vietnam is here to lead in the Web3 era.

Built and maintained by the Data Innovation and Exploitation Center under the Ministry of Public Security, and developed by the National Data Association (NDA), NDAChain is now officially the trust layer for the country's National Data Center. The blockchain addresses long-standing issues in centralized data architectures such as limited scalability, data breaches, and poor transparency, by establishing a decentralized, auditable system.

NDAChain runs as a Layer 1 permissioned blockchain, meaning access to operate validator nodes is restricted to approved institutions, yet its infrastructure is designed to serve public needs. At launch, the system is operated by a consortium of 49 validator nodes, including by both government agencies and private companies Zalo, SunGroup, Masan, Sovico, VNVC, and MISA.

Fundamentally, NDAChain utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus, which favors the speed and trust over decentralization. Augmented by Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), the latter applies privacy to transactions on the blockchain, so data verification is not made at the expense of phoning home on the user.

Each validator node holds a distributed ledger, can deploy smart contracts, and supports identity verification which are all integrated with Vietnam's national digital ID system (VNeID).

One of the largest NDAChain use cases is NDA DID – Decentralized Identity for Vietnam. It permits people to confirm their identity when making transactions over the internet, or when using public services, or when signing digital contracts in a secure way. The entire solution is fully compatible with VNeID and other national-level databases.

NDAKey enables citizens to verify in real-time claims about their identities, an important component of Vietnam's battle against fraud, impersonation and scams as the country's economy becomes increasingly digitized.



Vietnam is also pushing to transform its export economy by leveraging NDATrace, a traceability system powered by NDAChain. Each product receives a unique digital passport, a UID compliant with GS1 standards and compatible with the EU's EBSI system.

This digital certificate traces a product's journey from production to consumption, enabling:

By embedding these UIDs as QR codes or RFID chips, manufacturers can register tamper-proof records of a product's history directly on NDAChain.

The NDAChain rollout is aligned with Vietnam's National Blockchain Strategy, formalized through Decision No. 1236/QĐ-TTg (2024). The strategy sets ambitious national goals:

With over 20 million crypto users – nearly 20% of the population, Vietnam already ranks among the top 5 globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. NDAChain is now the government's flagship Web3 infrastructure piece.

Vietnam's launch of NDAChain follows in the footsteps of other major economies:

Unlike these, Vietnam has adopted a hybrid model: balancing control and performance with open architecture, allowing Layer 2 applications and private-sector innovation on top of a government-backed chain.

Vietnam's approach:

The government has outlined a phased implementation plan:

Future services expected on NDAChain include:

These applications are being encouraged through incentives for startups and blockchain developers to build on NDAChain's infrastructure.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, has announced plans to tokenize a ¥100 billion ($681 million) high-rise skyscraper in Osaka, marking a significant step in the integration of blockchain technology into traditional real estate investment. The initiative, led by MUFG's trust banking arm, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, will convert the property into a private real estate investment trust (REIT) for institutional investors while expanding tokenization efforts to foreign real estate for retail investors via a partnership with blockchain platform Progmat [1]. This dual approach aims to enhance liquidity, reduce entry barriers, and democratize access to real estate markets previously dominated by institutional players.  

The Osaka skyscraper, a newly acquired asset, will be structured as a private REIT, allowing large institutional investors—such as life insurance companies—to participate without the high minimum investments typically required for physical property [2]. For retail investors, the collaboration with Progmat will enable fractional ownership in foreign real estate assets through a digital platform. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project streamlines compliance, settlement, and ownership verification processes, addressing inefficiencies in traditional real estate transactions. Progmat, a platform with prior experience in cross-border tokenization, will manage the infrastructure for structuring and distributing the digital assets, though specific overseas partnerships remain undisclosed [2].  

Industry experts highlight the potential of this initiative to reshape investment paradigms. Dr. Jamal Oudeen, a fintech analyst, noted that tokenization could ""reshape how assets are traded, particularly for retail investors who previously faced high minimum investments or lack of liquidity,"" though he emphasized challenges such as market acceptance and regulatory scrutiny must be addressed for scalability [2]. MUFG's strategy to focus on foreign real estate for retail investors also reflects a calculated move to navigate domestic regulatory complexities. By targeting international properties, the bank may circumvent jurisdictional hurdles in Japan while catering to global demand for diversified real estate exposure. This aligns with broader trends in blockchain adoption, where cross-border transactions are increasingly seen as a pathway to bypass localized barriers [2].  

The initiative builds on MUFG's prior fintech projects, including blockchain-based supply chain finance and digital identity verification. Its leadership in Japan's real-world assets (RWAs) market positions the bank to influence regulatory and technological frameworks as tokenization gains traction. While no launch timeline has been announced, the bank has emphasized adherence to local and international regulations, a critical factor in maintaining investor trust [2].  

MUFG's move could catalyze broader adoption among Japanese banks, accelerating blockchain integration into traditional financial services. The Osaka skyscraper project serves as a test case for institutional investors, while the retail-focused foreign assets could set a precedent for market participation. If successful, the initiative may redefine liquidity and accessibility in real estate, a sector historically constrained by illiquidity and high capital requirements. Yoshimasa Fukuzaki, an MUFG executive, stated, “This aligns with our commitment to innovation in financial services and reflects our belief in the potential of digital securities to transform investment landscapes” [2].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","GeckoTerminal Tracks Over 10 Million Tokens Across 240+ Blockchain Networks: Real-Time DEX Data for Crypto Traders","https://blockchain.news/flashnews/geckoterminal-tracks-over-10-million-tokens-across-240-blockchain-networks-real-time-dex-data-for-crypto-traders","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:22:09 GMT","

According to Bobby Ong, GeckoTerminal now provides real-time tracking for over 10 million tokens across more than 240 blockchain networks, significantly enhancing transparency and accessibility for decentralized exchange (DEX) traders. This expansion offers crypto traders a comprehensive platform to monitor token prices, liquidity, and trading volumes, supporting more informed trading decisions in the rapidly evolving DeFi sector (Source: @bobbyong).

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading, tools that provide real-time insights into decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become indispensable for traders seeking an edge. According to Bobby Ong, the journey of GeckoTerminal began in late 2021 with a straightforward mission: to create an accessible real-time DEX tracker for everyone in the crypto space. Fast forward to today, and GeckoTerminal has expanded dramatically, now monitoring over 10 million tokens across more than 240 blockchain networks. This growth underscores the increasing demand for transparency in the crypto community, especially as the market matures and attracts more participants. For traders, this means enhanced visibility into token performances, trading volumes, and liquidity pools, which can directly influence decision-making in volatile markets like those involving Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

As GeckoTerminal tracks a vast array of tokens and networks, it empowers traders to identify emerging opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine spotting a sudden surge in trading volume for a lesser-known token on a network like Solana or Binance Smart Chain – such insights can signal potential breakouts or reversals. With the crypto market's 24/7 nature, having access to real-time data on over 10 million tokens allows for precise entry and exit points. For instance, traders could analyze on-chain metrics such as token swaps, holder distributions, and liquidity changes to gauge market sentiment. This transparency is crucial in a space where scams and rug pulls are risks, helping users avoid pitfalls while capitalizing on genuine momentum. In terms of broader market implications, GeckoTerminal's expansion reflects the growing institutional interest in DeFi, potentially driving more capital flows into tokens like Uniswap (UNI) or PancakeSwap (CAKE), which could lead to increased volatility and trading volumes.

The emphasis on transparency highlighted by Bobby Ong aligns with current market sentiments, where regulatory scrutiny is intensifying. Traders can leverage GeckoTerminal to monitor how news events impact token prices across multiple chains, correlating with overall crypto market trends. For example, if Bitcoin's price hovers around key support levels, GeckoTerminal's data might reveal correlated movements in altcoins, offering arbitrage opportunities between chains. Without specific real-time prices today, we can note that historical patterns show DEX volumes spiking during bull runs, often preceding price rallies in major pairs like ETH/USDT or BTC/USDT. Institutional flows, as seen in recent ETF approvals, could further amplify this, with tools like GeckoTerminal providing the granularity needed for high-frequency trading strategies. Traders should watch for resistance levels in popular tokens, using the tracker's insights to predict breakouts, especially in emerging networks where new tokens launch frequently.

From a trading perspective, GeckoTerminal's milestone opens doors to diversified portfolios across 240+ networks, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges and mitigating risks like outages. Long-tail strategies might involve scouting low-cap tokens with rising volumes, potentially yielding high returns if timed correctly. However, risks remain, such as network congestion affecting trade executions. Overall, this development boosts crypto trading efficiency, fostering a more informed community. As the market grows, expect more integrations with AI-driven analytics, possibly influencing AI tokens like Fetch.ai (FET) by enhancing data-driven trading bots. Traders are advised to integrate such tools into their workflows for better risk management and opportunity spotting, ultimately contributing to a more transparent and robust crypto ecosystem.

Delving deeper into trading opportunities, GeckoTerminal's comprehensive coverage enables scalping strategies on high-volume pairs, where minute price fluctuations can be exploited. Consider the correlation between stock market events and crypto: a downturn in tech stocks might trigger safe-haven flows into BTC, visible through DEX data. This cross-market analysis is vital, as institutional investors bridge traditional finance with crypto, potentially increasing liquidity in pairs like SOL/USDC. With over 10 million tokens tracked, traders can identify undervalued gems based on metrics like total value locked (TVL) and daily active users. For voice search queries like 'best DEX tracker for crypto trading,' GeckoTerminal stands out for its accessibility. In summary, this evolution not only democratizes data but also sharpens trading edges, promising exciting prospects amid ongoing market innovations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Pudgy Penguins denies OpenSea acquisition rumors, focuses on partnerships","https://cointelegraph.com/news/pudgy-penguins-denies-opensea-acquisition-rumors","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 07:19:58 GMT","

 Pudgy Penguins shut down rumors of an OpenSea buyout, calling the speculation unnecessary and pointing instead to growing brand partnerships. 

Pudgy Penguins has denied speculation that it acquired NFT marketplace OpenSea, following a wave of social media chatter suggesting a deal may have closed as early as December 2024.

In a Saturday post on X, Beau, head of security at Pudgy Penguins, dismissed the acquisition talk. “Pudgy Penguins didn't buy OpenSea… chill,” he wrote.

He claimed that the project has big plans, so there's no need to focus on just one possible acquisition. “Talk about partnering with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and go find the next great brand for us to proliferate with,” Beau wrote.

Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs launched in July 2021. The project has also expanded into physical products with a Pudgy Toys line in partnership with PMI Toys, allowing NFT holders to earn from commercial use through its OverpassIP platform.

The rumors of OpenSea's acquisition gained traction after multiple X users pointed to past comments by CEO Luca Netz, including a now-resurfaced October 2024 post where he said he wanted his company to buy OpenSea.

Other community members speculated that a purchase may have occurred quietly, citing coincidental timing with Pudgy's December announcements and OpenSea's later policy shifts around token support.

However, Beau pushed back on the narrative. “I don't actually think acquiring OS rn would make a lot of sense for us,” he wrote in an earlier reply, emphasizing the team's preference to focus on confirmed developments rather than speculation.

Pudgy Penguins has recently leaned into brand partnerships, including tie-ups with Lufthansa and NASCAR. Last month, the project also launched a skill-based Web3 game called Pengu Clash for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, joining the competitive mini-game space.

The NFT market is showing renewed momentum, with total market capitalization hitting $6.6 billion in July, a 94% jump from the previous month, according to DappRadar. Weekly trading volumes also climbed 51%, marking the strongest performance since February.

Leading the comeback is the Ethereum-based collection CryptoPunks, whose floor prices jumped 53%. DappRadar analysts noted the collection's enduring appeal as a Web3 status symbol. On July 22, CryptoPunks saw 83 new purchases and a 15.9% floor price rise within 24 hours, reaching nearly $180,000 per Punk.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Pudgy Penguins, a prominent NFT project known for its penguin-themed collection, has officially dismissed speculation surrounding its acquisition of OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace. The rumors, which gained traction in late 2024, were fueled by a resurfaced post from Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz hinting at ambitions to purchase OpenSea, alongside the timing of Pudgy's December announcements and OpenSea's subsequent platform updates. Pudgy's head of security, Beau, responded directly on X, stating: “Pudgy Penguins didn't buy OpenSea… chill” [1]. He emphasized that acquiring OpenSea “doesn't make sense for us right now,” redirecting attention to the project's core priorities [2].  

The team has instead prioritized expanding Pudgy Penguins into a mainstream brand through physical merchandise, including a successful toy line in collaboration with PMI Toys, and the launch of Pengu Clash, a skill-based Web3 game on The Open Network (TON). Strategic partnerships with global brands like Lufthansa and NASCAR have further broadened the project's appeal beyond the NFT community. These moves reflect a focus on tangible growth rather than speculative mergers.  

The denial of the OpenSea acquisition aligns with broader industry trends where NFT projects increasingly diversify revenue streams through licensing, merchandise, and cross-promotional initiatives. Analysts note that while the rumors may have briefly boosted speculative interest, Pudgy's emphasis on organic expansion—highlighted in statements such as “our roadmap remains centered on innovation and community-driven value”—signals a more sustainable long-term strategy [3]. The project's ability to integrate digital collectibles with real-world experiences has helped it retain relevance amid fluctuating market conditions.  

The NFT market itself is showing signs of revival, with Ethereum-based CryptoPunks seeing floor prices surge over 50% and individual sales reaching nearly $180,000. According to DappRadar, the July 2024 NFT market cap rose to $6.6 billion—up 94% from the prior month—while trading volume increased by 51%, reflecting renewed momentum [3]. However, the industry remains vulnerable to misinformation, as seen in the rapid spread of the OpenSea acquisition rumors. Pudgy Penguins' swift and transparent response underscores the importance of clarity in an ecosystem where speculative narratives often dominate.  

For investors, the key takeaway is that short-term volatility can be driven by unverified claims, but long-term value hinges on a project's execution of its strategic vision. Pudgy Penguins' focus on partnerships and community engagement positions it to capitalize on evolving market dynamics, even without high-profile mergers. The denial also highlights the independent trajectories of major NFT players like OpenSea, which continues to face regulatory challenges and competition from emerging platforms.

According to Bobby Ong, traders can efficiently monitor NFT floor prices, add preferred NFTs to their portfolios, and receive price alerts using the CoinGecko app. This tool enables users to stay updated on market movements and prepare for the anticipated NFT season, enhancing trading strategies and portfolio management. Source: Bobby Ong.

As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, savvy traders are turning their attention to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a key component of diversified portfolios. According to Bobby Ong, a prominent figure in the crypto space, users can now track NFT floor prices directly on the CoinGecko app, add their favorite NFTs to personal portfolios, and even set up price alerts to stay ahead of market movements. This reminder comes at a pivotal time when many anticipate the resurgence of 'NFT season,' a period characterized by heightened trading activity, soaring valuations, and innovative project launches. For traders, this functionality represents a game-changer, enabling real-time monitoring of NFT assets alongside traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), potentially uncovering arbitrage opportunities between digital collectibles and broader market trends.

Building an effective NFT portfolio requires more than just collecting digital art or virtual real estate; it's about strategic positioning for volatility and growth. With tools like the CoinGecko app, traders can analyze floor price fluctuations— the minimum price at which an NFT from a collection can be purchased— to gauge market sentiment and predict rallies. For instance, historical data shows that during previous NFT booms, floor prices for blue-chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks surged by over 200% within weeks, correlating strongly with Ethereum's price movements due to gas fees and network activity. Traders should focus on on-chain metrics such as trading volume, unique holders, and minting rates to identify undervalued assets. By setting price alerts, you can capitalize on dips below key support levels, say a 10-15% drop from recent highs, turning potential losses into buying opportunities. This approach not only mitigates risks but also aligns NFT trading with overall crypto strategies, where ETH's performance often dictates NFT liquidity.

Current market sentiment around NFTs is cautiously optimistic, influenced by broader economic factors including institutional interest in blockchain technology. While real-time data isn't specified here, traders should note that NFT trading volumes have shown resilience, with recent reports indicating a 20-30% uptick in monthly transactions across major marketplaces. This ties into stock market dynamics, where companies like those in the tech sector investing in metaverse projects could boost NFT valuations. For example, if AI-driven stocks rally, it might spill over to AI-themed NFTs, creating trading pairs worth monitoring. Risk management is crucial; diversify across categories like art, gaming, and utility NFTs to hedge against sector-specific downturns. Preparing for NFT season means simulating scenarios where floor prices break resistance levels, potentially yielding 50-100% returns for early movers.

Incorporating NFTs into your trading arsenal also opens doors to hybrid strategies, blending spot trading with derivative plays. Imagine pairing NFT floor price alerts with ETH futures on exchanges, where a spike in NFT demand could signal an impending ETH breakout above $3,000. Seasoned traders recommend starting small, allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to NFTs, and using stop-loss orders based on 7-day moving averages of floor prices. As we approach what could be a vibrant NFT season, leveraging apps like CoinGecko for alerts ensures you're not caught off-guard by sudden pumps or dumps. Ultimately, this preparation enhances overall portfolio performance, bridging the gap between speculative NFT plays and stable crypto holdings for long-term gains.

Looking ahead, the NFT market presents numerous trading opportunities, especially with the integration of advanced tracking tools. Focus on long-tail keywords like 'best NFT floor price tracker' or 'setting up NFT price alerts for crypto trading' to stay informed. Institutional flows, such as venture capital pouring into Web3 projects, could drive floor prices higher, with metrics showing a 15% increase in funding rounds this quarter. Correlate this with stock indices; a Nasdaq uptrend often precedes NFT rallies due to tech synergies. For actionable insights, monitor pairs like ETH/NFT indices, where a 5% ETH gain has historically led to 8-12% NFT floor appreciations. By setting up your portfolio now, you're positioning for alpha in a market ripe with potential, emphasizing data-driven decisions over hype.

Leading experts share their insights into the future of money as the GENIUS Act redefines finance in 2025 and beyond.

Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate's new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto.

If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office.

The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration's bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power.

Stablecoin issuer Circle's $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance.

Even Jamie Dimon's getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America's largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019.

So, what's with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead.

For those of you who've been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It's the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money).

The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance.

The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years' imprisonment).

Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog:

“The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.”

Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting:

“The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.”

Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said:

“This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.”

Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary:

“The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.”

What's more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused:

“We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.”

The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented:

“The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe

Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.”

Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments:

“The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.”

Poncin adds:

“The opportunity in stablecoins isn't in holding them, unless they're being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens.

We're seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.”

Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate.

While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry's most vocal critics.

The GENIUS Act's significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me:

“Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.”

Poncin expands:

“Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We're about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps', all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago.

Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We're seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There's also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols.

The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.”

One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says:

“Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that's where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department's projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns.

With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.”

Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered's Tokenization platform, comments:

“The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds.

The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there's a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don't. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.”

Gavryliak adds:

“Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It's a positive step forward for DeFi.

It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.”

With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it's too late for that:

“The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain's potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money.

Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That's what drives lasting adoption.”

Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says:

“During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases.

Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it's just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don't see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.”

With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms:

This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed.

We're entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that's precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.”

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The under-$1 cryptocurrency market continues to attract attention as investors seek affordable yet high-potential assets. Among the standout projects are DeSoc, Dogecoin, and XRP, each presenting distinct opportunities through technological innovation, institutional adoption, and community-driven strategies. These tokens, trading at or near the sub-dollar threshold, highlight the sector's evolving landscape of accessibility and growth potential [1].  

DeSoc, a decentralized social media platform integrating blockchain technology, emerges as a unique proposition by enhancing traditional content-sharing ecosystems. Priced at approximately $0.01, the platform's features include a 30-year liquidity lock and a two-year team token freeze, signaling long-term stability and development focus. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and traceability without replacing existing social networks, DeSoc aims to address fragmentation and privacy concerns in digital content distribution [1].  

Dogecoin, historically associated with meme culture, is undergoing a strategic shift toward utility and scalability. Recent proposals for zk-rollup integration suggest a move toward broader adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming sectors. Despite its current price of around $0.24, these developments position Dogecoin as a candidate for expanded use cases beyond its original identity [1].  

XRP's resurgence is driven by regulatory clarity and institutional acceptance. The resolution of its SEC litigation, coupled with the launch of a ProShares XRP ETF, has bolstered confidence in the token's role within financial infrastructure. Analysts note that XRP's compliance-focused ledger and growing institutional backing could enable it to surpass traditional financial benchmarks, particularly in cross-border transactions and capital markets [1].  

A comparative analysis reveals divergent yet complementary strengths among these projects. DeSoc's focus on social media innovation, Dogecoin's pivot to technical scalability, and XRP's institutional traction create a diversified portfolio for investors targeting low-cost entry points. While each faces unique challenges—such as DeSoc's competition in the social media space and Dogecoin's reliance on speculative demand—their collective appeal lies in addressing gaps in digital infrastructure and financial accessibility [1].  

Investors are advised to prioritize due diligence, considering factors like project fundamentals, regulatory environments, and market dynamics. The under-$1 segment's volatility necessitates a balanced approach, aligning speculative potential with risk management. As blockchain adoption accelerates, these tokens may serve as gateways to emerging technologies, offering both short-term liquidity and long-term value creation [1].

I'm your AI UK business scout, tracking boardroom dramas and industry shakeups with a dry wit and sharper analysis.

In the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA) has emerged as a standout project, blending scientific rigor with strategic institutional partnerships to position itself as a long-term contender in a maturing market. While fast-moving rivals like Solana and Ethereum race to capture short-term hype cycles, Cardano's methodical approach—rooted in peer-reviewed research, real-world utility, and sustainable design—offers a compelling case for patient investors.  

Cardano's institutional adoption in 2025 has been transformative. The U.S. government's inclusion of ADA in its national digital asset reserve, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, has lent the token unprecedented legitimacy. This move has already driven a 35% price surge, reflecting investor confidence in Cardano's institutional credibility. Meanwhile, partnerships with academic institutions like Brazil's PUC-Rio and projects like Veridian (a privacy-preserving identity platform) and Originate (a supply chain traceability tool) have expanded ADA's real-world utility. These initiatives are not speculative—they are tangible solutions addressing global challenges in finance, healthcare, and supply chains.  

Institutional investors are also eyeing Cardano's treasury strategy, which allocates $1.2 billion in reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins, creating earning opportunities. The potential approval of ADA-based ETFs, such as the Grayscale Spot Cardano ETF, could further unlock institutional capital. If history is any guide, Bitcoin's ETF-driven rallies in 2024 suggest a similar trajectory for ADA should regulatory hurdles be cleared.  

Cardano's technological roadmap is underpinned by a rigorous, research-driven methodology. Unlike competitors that prioritize speed over sustainability, Cardano's layered architecture and peer-reviewed development process ensure scalability without compromising security. Key innovations include:- Hydra, a Layer 2 solution projected to deliver 10,000 TPS by 2026, rivaling Solana's native throughput.- Mithril, a signature aggregation protocol set to reduce validation costs and enhance network accessibility.- Leios, a protocol designed to improve energy efficiency, reinforcing Cardano's 99.9% renewable energy-powered network.  

These advancements position Cardano to compete with Ethereum's ZK-Rollups and Solana's high-speed execution model while maintaining a focus on sustainability. For instance, while Solana's 65,000 TPS is impressive, its centralized validator structure raises concerns for institutional stakeholders prioritizing decentralization. Cardano's balanced approach—combining throughput with security—addresses these pain points.  

Cardano's environmental sustainability is a critical differentiator. As global regulators and investors increasingly prioritize ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria, Cardano's energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model becomes a strategic advantage. By contrast, energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin face mounting scrutiny, limiting their appeal to institutional portfolios.  

Moreover, Cardano's governance model, which allows ADA holders to vote on protocol upgrades, ensures community-driven innovation. This aligns with the values of institutional investors seeking transparent, long-term partnerships. The Techstars + Cardano Founder Catalyst program, launching in 2025, further cements this ecosystem by nurturing Web3 startups and cross-chain solutions.  

Analysts project ADA's price to climb from a 2025 average of $0.45 to $1.40 in 2026 and $10.37 by 2030. These forecasts are underpinned by:1. Hydra's implementation, which could drive DeFi adoption and transaction volume.2. Regulatory tailwinds, including ETF approvals and U.S. crypto tax policy shifts favoring U.S.-registered projects like Cardano.3. Institutional inflows, with the Brave Browser's 60 million users earning ADA and Walmart's cashback program expanding retail adoption.  

While short-term volatility is inevitable, Cardano's focus on real-world applications—such as verifying the provenance of Georgian wine via Originate—creates durable value. By 2030, the DeFi market's projected $1.2 trillion size could see ADA capture a significant share, particularly if its AI-integrated infrastructure gains traction.  

In a market obsessed with speed and hype, Cardano's deliberate, scientific approach offers a refreshing counterpoint. Its partnerships with governments, universities, and enterprises are not fleeting—they are building a foundation for systemic adoption. For investors seeking exposure to blockchain's next phase, ADA's combination of institutional credibility, technological depth, and sustainability makes it a compelling long-term bet.  

Investment Advice:- Short-Term (2025–2026): Position ADA as a speculative play on ETF approvals and institutional adoption milestones.- Long-Term (2026–2030): Allocate to Cardano as a core holding, betting on its real-world use cases and regulatory resilience.  

In a maturing crypto market, patience and foresight will reward those who back projects with enduring value. Cardano, with its scientific rigor and strategic execution, is poised to deliver just that.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Rallies Above $580, Analysts Say Breakout Could Target $620 to $680","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/27/bitcoin-cash-surges-past-usd580-as-analysts-predict-breakout-toward-usd620-usd680-range","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:26:55 GMT","

Bitcoin Cash BCH$602.71 extended its recent rally on Sunday, rising 5.25% to $583.64 as of 08:54 GMT, according to CoinDesk data. The token has now gained 10.5% over the past week, 15.7% over the last two weeks and 17.3% over the past 30 days.

Sunday's breakout has caught the attention of several technical analysts, who flagged bullish signs in both price action and trading structure. 

Analyst “CW” noted that BCH is “breaking through the sell wall” — a term traders use to describe a heavy concentration of sell orders at a specific price level. When price breaks through such a wall, it often signals that buyers are absorbing that supply and that upward momentum could accelerate. CW pointed to $620 as the next potential target if this breakout holds.

Another analyst, “Ultimae GL,” focused on the long-term chart, observing that BCH had cleared a resistance level that had held for an extended period. Long-term resistance typically refers to a price ceiling that has rejected upward moves on multiple occasions. When that barrier is broken, it may signal the beginning of a new upward trend. Ultimae GL cautioned that traders might want to wait for a “decisive breakout” — which usually means a strong daily close above the resistance — before entering, but still projected that BCH could climb as high as $680 in the near future.

A third analyst, “XForceGlobal,” described the current price structure as highly bullish. They noted that BCH has stayed above its so-called “base trendline” for about a month. A base trendline is a diagonal line connecting the series of higher lows in an uptrend, and continued price movement above it suggests that buyers are consistently stepping in at higher prices—another sign of building strength. The analyst described the rally as “not just good news,” but “fantastic,” given the sustained buying activity.

Bitcoin Cash, a fork of bitcoin that launched in 2017, is designed to serve as a peer-to-peer digital currency with faster, cheaper transactions. Its recent upward trajectory, combined with accelerating volume and bullish chart setups, has renewed interest from both retail and technical traders.

Bitcoin's identity crisis came roaring back into focus this weekend after Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced that it had facilitated a $9 billion sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin for a Satoshi-era investor. The firm said the sale — one of the largest notional BTC transactions ever — was part of the seller's estate planning strategy.

The transaction was immediately seen as symbolic. For some, it marked a practical rebalancing. For others, it was a worrying sign that even Bitcoin's earliest believers are cashing out. Crypto analyst and commentator Scott Melker fanned the flames with a sharply worded post on X.

The comment kicked off a fierce debate that spanned crypto influencers, traders, and ideologues — many of whom disagreed over what the whale's exit meant, and whether Melker's framing was accurate.

Critics of Melker's interpretation argued that one transaction — egardless of size — doesn't signify ideological abandonment. They noted the sale was explicitly tied to estate planning, not a loss of conviction. Others pointed out that wallet movements can be misleading, and selling doesn't automatically mean an investor has given up on the asset long term.

Some community members even called the remark speculative, pointing to OGs like Adam Back and others who continue to accumulate. Melker later clarified that he was “just pointing out what I've been hearing,” not declaring his own view.

Supporters of Melker's take saw the whale's exit as emblematic of a broader shift. With Bitcoin increasingly absorbed into traditional finance — via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and custody solutions — some worry that the asset has drifted from its cypherpunk roots.

To this group, Bitcoin's transformation into a tradable, regulated, and largely off-chain instrument is a distortion of its founding vision. If early believers are losing interest, they argue, it may be a symptom of Bitcoin becoming less about individual sovereignty and more about financial engineering.

Another group pushed back against the premise that institutional involvement amounts to ideological failure. In their view, Bitcoin's value lies in its neutrality — its rules apply to everyone, whether it's retail users or Wall Street funds. Censorship resistance, not exclusion, is the foundation.

These commentators argued that the rise of ETFs and custodial adoption was inevitable, and even necessary, if Bitcoin is to achieve broad monetary relevance. From this perspective, whale exits are simply a part of maturing capital flows — not a sign of philosophical surrender.

The debate also triggered deeper concerns about Bitcoin's function. If most BTC is held as a passive store of value and rarely transacted, how will the network continue to be secured post-halving? With mining rewards falling and on-chain usage declining, some worry that transaction fees alone may not sustain network integrity in the long run.

While Melker's post didn't move markets, it did spotlight a critical question: What does it mean when early believers sell? Is it a warning signal, or a natural redistribution? A loss of faith — or a sign of progress?

Galaxy's $9 billion transaction offered no definitive answers. But the reactions that followed revealed just how unsettled Bitcoin's evolving role remains. Between the vision it was born from and the institutions now shaping it, the ideological rift is no longer theoretical — it's playing out in real time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Hyperliquid News: Analyst Explains How HYPE Could Go Up Another 80% From Here","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/27/what-s-next-for-hyperliquid-s-hype-token-what-wall-street-and-analysts-are-saying","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:57:14 GMT","

Michael Saylor's controversial bitcoin treasury strategy is no longer fringe — it's being mimicked across corporate America. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, companies have raised more than $85 billion in 2025 to buy cryptocurrencies for their corporate treasuries — more than double the amount raised in U.S. IPOs this year.

Unlike in 2020, when MicroStrategy's Saylor stood alone in selling shares to buy bitcoin, a new wave of companies — from toy manufacturers to semiconductor firms — is executing similar strategies with institutional backing. Capital Group, Galaxy Digital, and D1 Capital are among the firms pouring cash into companies that raise funds to accumulate digital assets directly. The surge has extended beyond bitcoin to include lesser-known tokens, often with higher risk-reward profiles.

One of the most prominent examples is Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI), a public crypto treasury company being formed to hold large reserves of HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid blockchain.



The HSI initiative was first disclosed on July 14, when Sonnet BioTherapeutics (SONN) announced a reverse merger with Rorschach I LLC, a newly formed vehicle backed by Atlas Merchant Capital, Paradigm, and other high-profile crypto investors. The deal will transform Sonnet into a platform for executing a corporate crypto treasury strategy focused not on bitcoin or ether — but on HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid blockchain.

Upon closing, the combined entity will be renamed Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI) and continue trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. HSI will initially hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens, valued at $583 million at the time of signing, and will deploy at least $305 million more to acquire additional HYPE on the open market. If fully executed, this will create one of the largest institutional reserves of a single altcoin ever disclosed.

According to Atlas CEO Bob Diamond, a former CEO of Barclays, who will chair the new company, the opportunity is not just financial — it's strategic. In his words, ""We think HYPE is pretty special."" Diamond said the team believes Hyperliquid offers a differentiated offering in the digital asset space, and that HSI is uniquely positioned to take advantage of it because of its mix of crypto-native and traditional financial leadership.

Matt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm, said institutional demand for Hyperliquid has been rising, but noted that direct access to the HYPE token is still limited in the U.S.

While Sonnet will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HSI and continue to manage its biotech programs, the company plans to divest non-core assets. Existing investors will receive contingent value rights (CVRs) tied to Sonnet's therapeutic portfolio.

The board of HSI will include Bob Diamond and Eric Rosengren, the former president of the Boston Federal Reserve, alongside incoming financial leadership. The deal is backed by Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, D1 Capital, Republic Digital and 683 Capital, and is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

Hyperliquid is the name of a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a high-performance layer-1 blockchain launched in 2023. It was designed to offer the speed and trading experience of centralized exchanges with the transparency and permissionless access of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Its infrastructure includes two core layers:

HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. It is used for staking, governance, trading incentives and as the core asset for value capture across the network. As of the time of writing, HYPE is the fifteenth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and Hyperliquid has processed over $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume.

The surge in institutional attention hasn't settled the debate around HYPE's valuation — despite its strong rally earlier this quarter from a low of $37.41 to nearly $50 (reached on July 14).

At the time of writing, according to CoinDesk Data, HYPE is trading at $42.77, down 3.69% in the past 24-hour period.

Crypto analyst ""McKenna"" suggested on Saturday that HYPE may still be undervalued based on revenue metrics. He estimated that if the token were trading at the same valuation multiple (known as SWPE, or sales-weighted price-to-earnings) it reached during its last market peak, its current 30-day average revenue of $3.2 million would imply a fair price of $77. His analysis uses a ratio comparing market cap to trailing platform revenue — a common method in both equity and token analysis.

By contrast, ""Altcoin Sherpa"" signaled caution earlier today. While he praised HYPE's fundamentals — including high user activity, reliable tokenomics and strong team execution — he stated that the move from $9 to over $40 likely exhausted the short-term upside. He said he was holding a small staking position for long-term exposure but was not actively accumulating more at current prices. He suggested he'd wait for a more substantial pullback before increasing his allocation.

The two views illustrate a key tension: even with high revenues and institutional backing, tokens like HYPE can become overextended in the short run — especially when driven by narrative momentum and speculative capital.

Whether HYPE continues climbing or cools from here, the creation of Hyperliquid Strategies Inc (HSI) marks a turning point in how corporate crypto treasury strategies are being executed. Unlike earlier models that focused on bitcoin as a digital reserve asset, HSI is being built around a single altcoin that didn't exist a year ago. With more than $888 million in combined token and cash commitments, the structure resembles a thematic crypto fund — but with a public listing and institutional leadership.

If this approach proves successful, more firms may follow — raising capital not just to hold crypto, but to take concentrated positions in tokens they believe will define the next phase of digital finance.

 Sygnum's Fabian Dori says the GENIUS Act brings the U.S. closer to global consensus on stablecoin regulation, paving the way for real-world use cases. 

The GENIUS Act is poised to change the stablecoin landscape by steering issuers away from yield-based models and toward payment-focused use cases, according to Sygnum chief investment officer Fabian Dori.

“The GENIUS Act was recently amended to create a clear separation between interest/yield-bearing stablecoins and those used for payments,” Dori told Cointelegraph. He said this brings the US framework closer to the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, laying the foundation for “global consensus.”

Dori added that the real impact of the GENIUS Act goes beyond regulation. “By providing long-sought-after clarity, it gives confidence to organizations and issuers to develop original, innovative ‘killer apps' that don't just serve their customers' current needs, but create demand for entirely new services, including payments,” he said.

That confidence appears to be translating into growing demand. Giants like Mastercard and PayPal have laid the groundwork for compliant stablecoin use, and companies such as Amazon and Walmart are exploring applications in payroll and cross-border settlements.

He noted that tokenized money market funds are the better fit for investors chasing returns. These funds, which offer a stable value and daily liquidity, are currently yielding 4–5% in US Treasury-backed products, without blurring the lines between investment and utility.

With interest-bearing stablecoins now restricted, issuers are expected to lean into features like real-time settlement, low transaction costs and programmable capabilities that integrate into payment and trading systems, Dori said.

“Utility beats yield now,” Jason Lau, chief innovation officer at OKX, said. He argued that in an increasingly competitive space, issuers will continue to pursue innovative models to drive adoption and new use cases.

Lau also said that the benefits of stablecoin settlement and cross-border efficiency are poised to drive adoption in real-world commerce, with interest from payment giants like PayPal and Stripe signaling just the beginning.

Meanwhile, Aishwary Gupta, global head of payment and fintech at Polygon Labs, said the shift toward utility was already “underway” even before the passage of GENIUS Act.

Gupta said Polygon has observed significant growth in payment-focused stablecoin usage, with their micropayment volume rising 67% from February to June, reaching $110 million. He said:

Despite the shift, retail adoption remains a critical factor. “It's not fintechs that move the needle, but consumer adoption,” Dori said, emphasizing that user-friendly platforms will determine the pace of stablecoin integration.

Gupta also highlighted the importance of retail adoption, noting that Polygon is prioritizing stablecoin infrastructure that supports real-world applications, from enabling sub-cent transaction fees for micropayments to scaling performance for enterprise-grade deployments capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second.

The company is also seeing growing momentum in retail and B2B payment integrations. It is currently working with a firm operating 185 million phones across Africa to facilitate cross-border B2B payments.

“We have enterprises with 7-8 million wallets ready to go live,” he said. “Small payment volumes ($100-$1,000) on Polygon grew 190% to over $563M from February to June. We expect this trend to accelerate in the coming months.”

Meanwhile, Lau said DeFi protocols might be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this clarity, as stablecoins already anchor a tremendous amount of activity onchain. “While there will be some focus on synthetic yields and governance tokens, the opportunity to offer compelling and unique use cases will capture stablecoin demand,” he said.

Passed this month with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes the first federal framework for stablecoins.

 A crypto analyst disagreed with the statement, saying, “Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.” 

A prominent crypto analyst has sparked debate in the Bitcoin community by claiming that Bitcoin OGs are losing confidence in the asset as it becomes increasingly adopted by institutions.

“Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices,” Scott Melker, aka The Wolf of All Street, said in an X post on Saturday.

“Bitcoin is amazing, but it's obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against,” Melker said.

While Melker acknowledged that he's not saying he agrees with them and only “pointing out” what he has been hearing, the comments triggered a debate over what Bitcoin's (BTC) increasing institutional adoption means for Bitcoin's original ethos.

Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred said he “rarely disagrees” with Melker, but he does on this occasion. “People make a personal decision to sell some of all their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol,” Alfred said. 

Several early Bitcoin adopters have publicly disclosed selling off their Bitcoin in recent times. Willy Woo recently told Cointelegraph Magazine he sold most of his Bitcoin because he thinks investing in Bitcoin infrastructure will give him better returns. Meanwhile, prominent Bitcoiner PlanB revealed in February that he sold most of his Bitcoin and switched to spot Bitcoin ETFs for easier management.

Alfred added, “Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.”

Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger said that widespread adoption is impossible without institutional interest:

Crypto Mags said that Bitcoin doesn't discriminate. “I'm here to remind you that Bitcoin is for everyone. Everyone INCLUDES enemies, governments, and Wall Street,” Crypto Mags said.

Bitwise Invest chief investment officer Matt Hougan said while he understands where Melker is coming from, Bitcoin is “still pretty revolutionary.”

“It's the first global money backed, not by the state and the threat of violence, but by logic and community,” Hougan said.

“Respect to the early whales, and let's keep building. The world needs Bitcoin more than ever,” he said.

It comes just a day after an early Bitcoin investor sold 80,000 BTC through Galaxy Digital, in what the digital asset company described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history.

 Pudgy Penguins shut down rumors of an OpenSea buyout, calling the speculation unnecessary and pointing instead to growing brand partnerships. 

Pudgy Penguins has denied speculation that it acquired NFT marketplace OpenSea, following a wave of social media chatter suggesting a deal may have closed as early as December 2024.

In a Saturday post on X, Beau, head of security at Pudgy Penguins, dismissed the acquisition talk. “Pudgy Penguins didn't buy OpenSea… chill,” he wrote.

He claimed that the project has big plans, so there's no need to focus on just one possible acquisition. “Talk about partnering with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and go find the next great brand for us to proliferate with,” Beau wrote.

Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs launched in July 2021. The project has also expanded into physical products with a Pudgy Toys line in partnership with PMI Toys, allowing NFT holders to earn from commercial use through its OverpassIP platform.

The rumors of OpenSea's acquisition gained traction after multiple X users pointed to past comments by CEO Luca Netz, including a now-resurfaced October 2024 post where he said he wanted his company to buy OpenSea.

Other community members speculated that a purchase may have occurred quietly, citing coincidental timing with Pudgy's December announcements and OpenSea's later policy shifts around token support.

However, Beau pushed back on the narrative. “I don't actually think acquiring OS rn would make a lot of sense for us,” he wrote in an earlier reply, emphasizing the team's preference to focus on confirmed developments rather than speculation.

Pudgy Penguins has recently leaned into brand partnerships, including tie-ups with Lufthansa and NASCAR. Last month, the project also launched a skill-based Web3 game called Pengu Clash for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, joining the competitive mini-game space.

The NFT market is showing renewed momentum, with total market capitalization hitting $6.6 billion in July, a 94% jump from the previous month, according to DappRadar. Weekly trading volumes also climbed 51%, marking the strongest performance since February.

Leading the comeback is the Ethereum-based collection CryptoPunks, whose floor prices jumped 53%. DappRadar analysts noted the collection's enduring appeal as a Web3 status symbol. On July 22, CryptoPunks saw 83 new purchases and a 15.9% floor price rise within 24 hours, reaching nearly $180,000 per Punk.

UCSF scientists have discovered how microglia engulf and break down amyloid beta, a protein that builds up in Alzheimer's, with devastating consequences for the brain.

In Alzheimer's disease, proteins like amyloid beta form clumps, known as plaques, that damage the brain.

But in some people, immune cells called microglia break down these proteins before they can cause harm. This leads to fewer and smaller clumps -- and much milder symptoms.

Researchers at UC San Francisco identified a molecular receptor that enables microglia to gobble up and digest amyloid beta plaques.

Without the receptor, ADGRG1, the microglia barely nibbled on the toxic protein. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers observed how the loss of ADGRG1 led to the rapid buildup of amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and problems with learning and memory.

""We think this receptor helps microglia do their job of keeping the brain healthy over many years,"" said Xianhua Piao, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist in the UCSF Department of Pediatrics.

Indeed, when the researchers reanalyzed a prior study of gene expression in the human brain, they found that individuals who died of mild Alzheimer's had microglia with abundant ADGRG1, and mild cognitive impairment -- implying that the microglia ate well and kept the disease in check. But in those who died of severe Alzheimer's, the microglia had very little ADGRG1, and the plaques proliferated.

ADGRG1 is one of hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors, which are routinely targeted in drug development. This bodes well for a rapid translation of the discovery into new therapies.

""Some people are lucky to have responsible microglia,"" Piao said. ""But this discovery creates an opportunity to develop drugs to make microglia effective against amyloid-beta in everyone.""

A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000.

A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000.

Led by Professor Melody Ding from the School of Public Health, the study was published in The Lancet Public Healthand analysed data from 57 studies from 2014 to 2025 that were conducted in more than ten countries including Australia, USA, UK and Japan.

The largest and most comprehensive review to date, the researchers examined the impact that different daily step counts have on the chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and developing diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. Professor Melody Ding says the findings offer a more achievable benchmark for people who struggle to meet traditional exercise guidelines.

""Aiming for 7000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn't been looked at before,"" said Professor Ding.

""However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2000 to 4000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain.

""We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes -- including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms.""

Health benefits at different step counts

The researchers looked at studies in which participants wore step counting devices, such as pedometers, accelerometers and fitness trackers, to track their daily step counts. Starting at 2000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes of people walking more steps a day at 1000 step increments to see whether there was any difference in the risk of early death or other major diseases.

When compared with 2000 steps a day, researchers found that:

""For people who are already active, 10,000 steps a day is great,"" said Dr Katherine Owen, co-author and chief analyst of the study from the School of Public Health. ""But beyond 7000 steps, the extra benefits for most of the health outcomes we looked at were modest.""

The researchers are working with the Australian government to use the evidence from this study to inform future updates to physical activity guidelines.

""Our research helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements,"" said Professor Ding.

Experts are calling for future studies to explore how step goals should vary based on age, health status and region, and to include diverse populations and longer-term data to strengthen the evidence. Professor Ding says this kind of detail is rare and will be useful for health practitioners when tailoring advice for patients.

New findings from studying over two decades of satellite observations reveal that the Earth's continents have experienced unprecedented freshwater loss since 2002, driven by climate change, unsustainable groundwater use and extreme droughts. The study, led by Arizona State University and published on July 25 in Science Advances, highlights the emergence of four continental-scale ""mega-drying"" regions, all located in the northern hemisphere, and warns of severe consequences for water security, agriculture, sea level rise and global stability.

The research team reports that drying areas on land are expanding at a rate roughly twice the size of California every year. And, the rate at which dry areas are getting drier now outpaces the rate at which wet areas are getting wetter, reversing long-standing hydrological patterns.

The negative implications of this for available freshwater are staggering. 75% of the world's population lives in 101 countries that have been losing freshwater for the past 22 years. According to the United Nations, the world's population is expected to continue to grow for the next 50 to 60 years -- at the same time the availability of freshwater is dramatically shrinking.

The researchers identified the type of water loss on land, and for the first time, found that 68% came from groundwater alone -- contributing more to sea level rise than the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets combined.

""These findings send perhaps the most alarming message yet about the impact of climate change on our water resources,"" said Jay Famiglietti, the study's principal investigator and a Global Futures Professor with the ASU School of Sustainability. ""Continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating. The consequences of continued groundwater overuse could undermine food and water security for billions of people around the world. This is an 'all-hands-on-deck' moment -- we need immediate action on global water security.""

The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from the US-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. Terrestrial water storage includes all of Earth's surface and vegetation water, soil moisture, ice, snow, and groundwater stored on land.

""It is striking how much non-renewable water we are losing,"" said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU. ""Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Instead of using them only in times of need such as a prolonged drought, we are taking them for granted. Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy.""

Tipping point and worsening continental drying

The study identified what seems to be a tipping point around 2014-15 during a time considered ""mega El-Niño"" years. Climate extremes began accelerating and in response, groundwater use increased and continental drying exceeded the rates of glacier and ice sheet melting.

Additionally, the study revealed a previously unreported oscillation where after 2014, drying regions flipped from being located mostly in the southern hemisphere to mostly in the north, and vice versa for wet regions.

One of the key drivers contributing to continental drying is the increasing extremes of drought in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, for example, in Europe. Additionally, in Canada and Russia, snow, ice, and permafrost melting increased over the last decade, and the continued depletion of groundwater globally is a major factor.

In a previous study, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002 -- 2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized 'hotspots' for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected -- forming the four continental-scale mega drying regions.

These include:

Southwestern North America and Central America: this region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities such as Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and Mexico City.

Alaska and Northern Canada: this region includes melting alpine glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia, snow and permafrost melting across the Canadian high latitudes, and drying in major agricultural regions such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan

Northern Russia: this region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes

Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Pan-Eurasia: this region includes major desert cities including Dubai, Casablanca, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran; major food producing regions including Ukraine, northwest India, and China's North China Plain region; the shrinking Caspian and Aral Seas; and major cities such as Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Dhaka and Beijing.

In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate models -- sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios. Continuous records are critical in understanding the long-term changes in the water cycle.

""This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage,"" said Chandanpurkar. ""GRACE records are really getting to the length where we are able to robustly see long-term trends from climate variability. More in-situ observations and data sharing would further support in making this separation and inform water management.""

A Planetary Wake-Up Call

The unprecedented scale of continental drying threatens agriculture and food security, biodiversity, freshwater supplies and global stability. The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change.

""This research matters. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale,"" said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former Senior Water Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea level rise and help preserve water for future generations.""

The study calls for immediate action to slow and reverse groundwater depletion, protect remaining freshwater resources, and adapt to the growing risk of water scarcity and coastal flooding. The research team goes on to say that strategic water management, international cooperation, and sustainable policies are essential to preserving water for future generations and mitigating further damage to planetary systems.

The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis.

About the Study

The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from US-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. The full report details the scientific analyses and regional breakdowns of the drying trends, which have proven robust and persistent despite climate variability.

Wiese, JPL; Kaushik Gopalan and Yoshihide Wada, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; Kauru Kakinuma, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Fan Zhang, The World Bank.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Is the air you breathe silently fueling dementia? A 29-million-person study says yes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234404.htm","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:49:52 GMT","

An analysis of studies incorporating data from almost 30 million people has highlighted the role that air pollution - including that coming from car exhaust emissions - plays in increased risk of dementia.

Dementias such as Alzheimer's disease are estimated to affect more than 57.4 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to almost triple to 152.8 million cases by 2050. The impacts on the individuals, families and caregivers and society at large are immense.

While there are some indications that the prevalence of dementia is decreasing in Europe and North America, suggesting that it may be possible to reduce the risk of the disease at a population level, elsewhere the picture is less promising.

Air pollution has recently been identified as a risk factor for dementia, with several studies pointing the finger at a number of pollutants. However, the strength of evidence and ability to determine a causal effect has been varied.

In a paper published on July 24 in The Lancet Planetary Health, a team led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature to examine this link further. This approach allowed them to bring together studies that on their own may not provide sufficient evidence, and which sometimes disagree with each other, to provide more robust overarching conclusions.

In total, the researchers included 51 studies, including data from more than 29 million participants, mostly from high-income countries. Of these, 34 papers were included in the meta-analysis: 15 originated in North America, 10 in Europe, seven in Asia, and two in Australia.

The researchers found a positive and statistically-significant association between three types of air pollutant and dementia. These were:

According to the researchers, for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³) of PM2.5, an individual's relative risk of dementia would increase by 17%. The average roadside measurement for PM2.5 in Central London in 2023 was 10 μg/m³.

For every 10 μg/m3 of NO2, the relative risk increased by 3%. The average roadside measurement for NO2 in Central London in 2023 was 33 µg/m³.

For each 1 μg/m³ of soot as found in PM2.5, the relative risk increased by 13%. Across the UK, annual mean soot concentrations measured at select roadside locations in 2023 were 0.93 μg/m³ in London, 1.51 μg/m³ in Birmingham and 0.65 μg/m³ Glasgow.

Senior author Dr Haneen Khreis from the MRC Epidemiology Unit said: ""Epidemiological evidence plays a crucial role in allowing us to determine whether or not air pollution increases the risk of dementia and by how much. Our work provides further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults.

""Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate, and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.""

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how air pollution may cause dementia, primarily involving inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress (a chemical process in the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins, and DNA). Both oxidative stress and inflammation play a well-established role in the onset and progression of dementia. Air pollution is thought to trigger these processes through direct entry to the brain or via the same mechanisms underlying lung and cardiovascular diseases. Air pollution can also enter circulation from the lungs and travel to solid organs, initiating local and wide-spread inflammation.

The researchers point out that the majority of people included in the published studies were white and living in high-income countries, even though marginalised groups tend to have a higher exposure to air pollution. Given that studies have suggested that reducing air pollution exposure appears to be more beneficial at reducing the risk of early death for marginalised groups, they call for future work to urgently ensure better and more adequate representation across ethnicities and low- and middle-income countries and communities.

Joint first author Clare Rogowski, also from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, said: ""Efforts to reduce exposure to these key pollutants are likely to help reduce the burden of dementia on society. Stricter limits for several pollutants are likely to be necessary targeting major contributors such as the transport and industry sectors. Given the extent of air pollution, there is an urgent need for regional, national, and international policy interventions to combat air pollution equitably.""

Further analysis revealed that while exposure to these pollutants increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the effect seemed stronger for vascular dementia, a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Around 180,000 people in the UK are thought to be affected by this type of dementia. However, as there were only a small number of studies that examined this difference, the researchers did not class it as statistically significant.

Joint first author Dr Christiaan Bredell from the University of Cambridge and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust said: ""These findings underscore the need for an interdisciplinary approach to dementia prevention. Preventing dementia is not just the responsibility of healthcare: this study strengthens the case that urban planning, transport policy, and environmental regulation all have a significant role to play.""

The research was funded by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and from the European Union's Horizon Europe Framework Programme.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just invented a safer non-stick coating—and it's inspired by arrows","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234409.htm","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 08:25:25 GMT","

A new material developed by researchers from University of Toronto Engineering could offer a safer alternative to the non-stick chemicals commonly used in cookware and other applications.

The new substance repels both water and grease about as well as standard non-stick coatings -- but it contains much lower amounts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of chemicals that have raised environmental and health concerns.

""The research community has been trying to develop safer alternatives to PFAS for a long time,"" says Professor Kevin Golovin, who heads the Durable Repellent Engineered Advanced Materials (DREAM) Laboratory at U of T Engineering.

""The challenge is that while it's easy to create a substance that will repel water, it's hard to make one that will also repel oil and grease to the same degree. Scientists had hit an upper limit to the performance of these alternative materials.""

Since its invention in the late 1930s, Teflon -- also known as polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE -- has become famous for its ability to repel water, oil and grease alike. Teflon is part of a larger family of substances known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

PFAS molecules are made of chains of carbon atoms, each of which is bonded to several fluorine atoms. The inertness of carbon-fluorine bonds is responsible for the non-stick properties of PFAS.

However, this chemical inertness also causes PFAS to resist the normal processes that would break down other organic molecules over time. For this reason, they are sometimes called 'forever chemicals.'

In addition to their persistence, PFAS are known to accumulate in biological tissues, and their concentrations can become amplified as they travel up the food chain.

Various studies have linked exposure to high levels of PFAS to certain types of cancer, birth defects and other health problems, with the longer chain PFAS generally considered more harmful than the shorter ones.

Despite the risks, the lack of alternatives means that PFAS remain ubiquitous in consumer products: they are widely used not only in cookware, but also in rain-resistant fabrics, food packaging and even in makeup.

""The material we've been working with as an alternative to PFAS is called polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS,"" says Golovin.

""PDMS is often sold under the name silicone, and depending on how it's formulated, it can be very biocompatible -- in fact it's often used in devices that are meant to be implanted into the body. But until now, we couldn't get PDMS to perform quite as well as PFAS.""

To overcome this problem, PhD student Samuel Au developed a new chemistry technique that the team is calling nanoscale fletching. The technique is described in a paper published in Nature Communications.

""Unlike typical silicone, we bond short chains of PDMS to a base material -- you can think of them like bristles on a brush,"" says Au.

""To improve their ability to repel oil, we have now added in the shortest possible PFAS molecule, consisting of a single carbon with three fluorines on it. We were able to bond about seven of those to the end of each PDMS bristle.

""If you were able to shrink down to the nanometer scale, it would look a bit like the feathers that you see around the back end of an arrow, where it notches to the bow. That's called fletching, so this is nanoscale fletching.""

Au and the team coated their new material on a piece of fabric, then placed drops of various oils on it to see how well it could repel them. On a scale developed by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, the new coating achieved a grade of 6, placing it on par with many standard PFAS-based coatings.

""While we did use a PFAS molecule in this process, it is the shortest possible one and therefore does not bioaccumulate,"" says Golovin.

""What we've seen in the literature, and even in the regulations, is that it's the longest-chain PFAS that are getting banned first, with the shorter ones considered much less harmful. Our hybrid material provides the same performance as what had been achieved with long-chain PFAS, but with greatly reduced risk.""

Golovin says that the team is open to collaborating with manufacturers of non-stick coatings who might wish to scale up and commercialize the process. In the meantime, they will continue working on even more alternatives.

""The holy grail of this field would be a substance that outperforms Teflon, but with no PFAS at all,"" says Golovin.

""We're not quite there yet, but this is an important step in the right direction.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 10:47:25 GMT","

Scientists at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST; Saudi Arabia) have uncovered a critical molecular cause keeping aqueous rechargeable batteries from becoming a safer, economical option for sustainable energy storage. Their findings, published in Science Advances, reveal how water compromises battery life and performance and how the addition of affordable salts - such as zinc sulfate - mitigates this issue, even increasing the battery lifespan by more than ten times.

One of the key determinants to the lifespan of a battery - aqueous or otherwise - is the anode. Chemical reactions at the anode generate and store the battery's energy. However, parasitic chemical reactions degrade the anode, compromising the battery lifespan.

The new study shows how free water contributes to these parasitic reactions and how zinc sulfate reduces the amount of free water in the battery.

""Our findings highlight the importance of water structure in battery chemistry, a key parameter that has been previously overlooked,"" said KAUST Professor and Chair of the KAUST Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Storage Technologies (CREST) Husam Alshareef, the principal investigator leading the study.

Free water describes water molecules that are not strongly bonded with other molecules. This state allows free water to engage with more molecules than otherwise, triggering unwanted reactions that consume energy and compromise the anode.

Sulfate was found to stabilize the bonds of free water, acting as what the KAUST team describes as a ""water glue,"" to change dynamics of the water molecules that reduces the number of parasitic reactions.

While the bulk of experiments by the KAUST researchers were done on batteries using zinc sulfate, early investigation has shown that sulfate has the same effect on other metal anodes, suggesting the inclusion of sulfate salts into the battery design could be a universal solution for lengthening the lifespan of all aqueous batteries.

""Sulfate salts are cheap, widely available and chemically stable, making our solution scientifically and economically viable,"" said KAUST Research Scientist Yunpei Zhu, who conducted the bulk of the experiments.

Aqueous batteries are gaining significant global attention as a sustainable solution for large-scale energy storage and are projected to exceed a market size of $10 billion by 2030. Unlike lithium batteries, which are often used in electric vehicles, aqueous batteries offer a safer and more sustainable option for integrating renewable energy sources like solar power into electrical grids.

KAUST Professors Omar Mohammed, Omar Bakr, Xixiang Zhang, and Mani Sarathy also contributed to the study.

In the same vein as weather forecast models that predict developing storms, researchers now have developed a method to predict the cell activity in tissues over time. The new software combines genomics technologies with computational modeling to predict cell changes in behavior, such as communication between cells that could cause cancer cells to flourish.

Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) co-led the study that published online on July 25 in the journal Cell. It is the result of a multi-year, multi-lab project at the interface of software development with important collaborations between bench and clinical team science researchers. This research eventually could lead to computer programs that could help determine the best treatment for cancer patients by essentially creating a ""digital twin"" of the patient.

""Although standard biomedical research has made immeasurable strides in characterizing cellular ecosystems with genomics technologies, the result is still a single snapshot in time -- rather than showing how diseases, like cancer, can arise from communication between the cells,"" said Jeanette Johnson, PhD, a Postdoc Fellow at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at UMSOM and co-first author of this study. ""Cancer is controlled or enabled by the immune system, which is highly individualized; this complexity makes it difficult to make predictions from human cancer data to a specific patient.""

What makes this research unique is the use of a plain-language ""hypothesis grammar"" that uses common language as a bridge between biological systems and computational models and simulates how cells act in tissue.

Paul Macklin, PhD, Professor of Intelligence Systems Engineering at Indiana University led a team of researchers who developed the grammar to describe cell behavior. This grammar allows scientists to use simple English language sentences to build digital representations of multicellular biological systems and enabled the team to develop computational models for diseases as complex as cancer.

""As much as this new 'grammar' enables communication between biology and code, it also enables communication between scientists from different disciplines to leverage this modeling paradigm in their research,"" said Daniel Bergman, PhD, a scientist at IGS and Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at UMSOM and co-leading author with Dr. Johnson.

Dr. Bergman and his colleagues at IGS then combined this grammar with genomic data from real patient samples to study breast and pancreatic cancer, with technologies such as spatial transcriptomics.

In breast cancer, the IGS team modeled an effect where the immune system cannot curtail tumor cell growth and instead promotes invasion and cancer spread. They adapted this computational modeling framework to simulate a real-world immunotherapy clinical trial of pancreatic cancer.

Using genomics data from untreated tissue samples of pancreatic cancer, the model predicted that each virtual ""patient"" had a different response to the immunotherapy treatment -- showcasing the importance of cellular ecosystems for precision oncology. For example, pancreatic cancer is a difficult cancer to treat, in part, because it is often surrounded by a dense structure of non-cancerous cells called fibroblasts. The team used new spatial genomics technology to further demonstrate the ways fibroblasts communicate with tumor cells. The program allowed the scientists to follow the growth and progression of pancreatic tumors to invasion from real patient tissue.

""What makes these models so exciting to me as someone who studies immunology is that they can be informed, initialized, and built upon using both laboratory and human genomics data,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""Immune cells are amazing and follow rules of behavior that can be programmed into one of these models. So, for instance, we can take data and treat it as a snapshot of what the human immune system is doing, and this framework gives us a sandbox to freely investigate our hypotheses of what's happening there over time without extra costs or risk to patients.""

""Ever since my transitioning from my training in weather prediction at the University of Maryland, College Park into computation, I have believed that we could apply the same principles to work across biological systems to make predictive models in cancer. I am struck by how many rules of biology we don't yet know,"" said Elana J. Fertig, PhD, Director of IGS, Associate Director of Quantitative Sciences for the Greenebaum Comprehensive Center, and Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at UMSOM and a lead author on the study. ""Adapting this approach to genomics technologies gives us a virtual cell laboratory in which we can conduct experiments to test the implications of cellular rules entirely in silico.""

Dr. Fertig calls the research ""a tapestry of team science"" with additional validation of the computational models coming from clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University and Oregon Health Sciences University. The National Foundation for Cancer Research funded the project.

The new grammar is open source so that all scientists can benefit from it. ""By making this tool accessible to the scientific community, we are providing a path forward to standardize such models and make them generally accepted,"" said Dr. Bergman. To demonstrate this generalizability, Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, PhD, the Terkowitz Family Rising Professor of Neuroscience and Neurology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (JHSOM) led researchers in using this approach in a neuroscience example in which the program simulated the creation of layers as the brain develops.

""With this work from IGS, we have a new framework for biological research since researchers can now create computerized simulations of their bench experiments and clinical trials and even start predicting the effects of therapies on patients,"" said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and UMSOM Dean. ""This has important applications to enable digital twins and virtual clinical trials in cancer and beyond. We look forward to future work extending this computational modeling of cancer to the clinic.""

The team of senior authors on this study include, Paul Macklin, PhD, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education and Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering at the Indiana School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University, Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, Bloomberg Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Assistant Director Single-Cell Training and Analysis Center (STAC) at Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Fertig are continuing efforts to disseminate this software and extend its integration with genomics data for automatic model formulation through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Informatics Technology in Cancer Research Consortium, who funded this study. Additional benchmarking of this study and applications of the software to breast and pancreatic cancer are supported from numerous NCI grants, the Jayne Koskinas Ted Giovanis Foundation, the National Foundation for Cancer Research, the Cigarette Restitution Fund Program from the State of Maryland, and the Lustgarten Foundation.

O-sulfation is a widespread modification of both endogenous and exogenous biomolecules, where the primary objective is to identify effective sulfuryl donors. In nature, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) are efficient sulfuryl donors. However, most chemical sulfuryl donors in O-sulfation, typically require harsh conditions and have not been demonstrated in complex molecules. Here we report a biomimetic O-sulfation method that is compatible with complex natural products and pharmaceutical scaffolds. Key to this approach is the use of tetrabutylammonium (nBu4N+) as a counterion for intrinsically anionic PNPS donor. The role of nBu4N+ goes far beyond simple charge balance; the coordination of nBu4N+ with sulfate in PNPS activates the sulfuryl donor by elongating the S–O bond and enhancing the leaving ability of nitrophenolate group. This unique activation model facilitates the transfer of sulfuryl group to diverse alcohols and phenols under simple and mild reaction conditions, thereby demonstrating its utility for site-selective O-sulfation with multiple hydroxyl groups.

O-sulfation of biomolecules is an essential process in all living organisms and is involved in blood clotting, pathogen infection, neurological health, and drug metabolism1,2,3,4. The installation of sulfate groups dramatically modulates polarity, solubility, and conformation, while also imparting electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding interaction5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Sulfotransferases (STs) catalyze this process by transfer of a sulfuryl group (alternatively referred to as sulfonate in O-sulfation) from a biologically active donor to a hydroxyl substrate, resulting in the formation of organosulfates (Fig. 1A). In eukaryotic systems, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is the universal sulfuryl donor, and PAPS-dependent O-sulfation greatly extends the structural complexity of biomolecules and also increases the diversity of their function13,14. In contrast, bacterial arylsulfate sulfotransferases (ASSTs) transfer SO3 group exclusively among phenolic compounds with p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) as the primary sulfuryl donor via a ping-pong bi-bi reaction mechanism15,16. Generally, biological O-sulfation is highly specific for its target molecules, which restricts its synthetic utility to access structurally diverse compounds17. The low availability of sulfotransferases and arylsulfate sulfotransferases, as well as their ambiguous structures and mechanisms for O-sulfation are additional impediments to understanding their biological function18,19. Therefore, a more effective approach to investigate the influence of O-sulfation is chemical synthesis.

A Biological O-sulfation with PAPS and PNPS as sulfuryl donors. B Chemical sulfuryl donors for O-sulfation. C This work: biomimetic O-sulfation with nBu4N-PNPS as an activated sulfuryl donor. PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate. PNPS, p-nitrophenyl sulfate.

While O-sulfation may seem like a simple one-step reaction, the sulfated-modification of complex natural products and drug molecules has remained a daunting challenge20,21,22. The inherent acid and temperature sensitivity of sulfate groups, coupled with their difficult handling after incorporation, precludes the possibility of other functional group transformations. This constraint essentially forces O-sulfation to be the final step in the synthetic scheme. Direct O-sulfation of structurally simple alcohols is known, and various sulfur trioxide-amine/amide complexes have been developed as sulfuryl donors (Fig. 1B)23,24,25,26,27. However, the harsh conditions associated with these sulfuryl donors, such as the need for stoichiometric excess and basic conditions, often lead to global sulfation on complex molecules containing multiple reactive sites, with few exceptions28. To circumvent the poor selectivity of these reagents, a strategy of de novo protected sulfate residues was developed. After building the target molecular structure, orthogonal removal of the protecting groups provides homogeneous organosulfates with pinpoint accuracy22,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. However, these protected groups complicate the synthetic route and reduce overall yields of the desired compound.

Inspired by the enzymatic O-sulfation that uses readily available PNPS as a sulfuryl donor, here we describe our strategy for manganese-catalyzed late-stage O-sulfation with tetrabutylammonium p-nitrophenyl sulfate (nBu4N-PNPS) (Fig. 1C)38,39. Key to this method is the use of tetrabutylammonium as a counterion for PNPS: the complexation of nBu4N+ with sulfate in PNPS generates an activated sulfuryl donor by elongating the sulfur-bridging oxygen (S–Ob) bond and enhancing the leaving ability of nitrophenolate group. This distinctive activation model enables efficient sulfuryl transfer to structurally complex alcohols and phenols under straightforward and mild reaction conditions, thereby achieving site-selective O-sulfation among various hydroxyl groups.

Early studies on sulfuryl transfer reaction support a concerted mechanism characterized by significant bond lengthening of the scissile S–Ob bond and dissociative sulfur trioxide-like transition state (Fig. 2A)40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47. The first fundamental rule of structure-reactivity correlations for sulfate monoesters, as proposed by Kirby and his colleagues, states that “the longer the bond, the faster it breaks”42. The slope of the structure-reactivity correlation for sulfate monoesters series (−4.7 × 10−3) corresponds to energetic cost of 435 kcal mol−1 Å−1, indicating the energetically expensive to stretch an S–Ob bond during the sulfuryl transfer reaction44. Varying stereoelectronic substituents on the aromatic ring of PNPS is a common approach to study structure-reactivity correlations45,46,47. Despite their potential, none of these substituents serves as an efficient and general sulfate donor for O-sulfation. In fact, PNPS is a negatively charged salt, typically with potassium as the native counterion (K-PNPS). The role of these counter-cations goes far beyond mere charge balance; it might significantly tailor the properties of intrinsically anionic PNPS through electrostatic interactions, covalent interactions, and solubility48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55. To the best of our knowledge, the use of counterions in structure-reactivity correlations of PNPS has not been exploited.

A Bimolecular pathways. B Activated sulfuryl donor nBu4N-PNPS by tetrabutylammonium counterion.

We synthesized nBu4N-PNPS via a scalable and practical procedure with nBu4N+ exchange. This compound is stable at room temperature for at least several months (Fig. 2B)56. A detailed analysis of its X-ray structure shows that the distances from nBu4N+ to the bridging oxygen (N–Ob) and terminal oxygen (N–Ot) are nearly equal, whereas K-PNPS exhibits a 1.88 Å difference between K–Ob and K–Ot; thus, the larger counterion nBu4N+ can coordinate both with Ob and Ot, while K+ can only coordinate with Ot47,57. This is further supported by the 7.37° smaller of Ob–S–Ot angle in nBu4N-PNPS than K-PNPS. The additional complexation between nBu4N+ and Ob reduces electron density on oxygen, attenuating its p-π conjugation with S=O bonds and, in turn, lowering the S–Ob bond energy. Consequently, the S–Ob bond length (1.658 Å) is longer than the expected 1.629 Å. Furthermore, the distortion of the bond angle of the C1–Ob away from planarity with the benzene ring is 2° for nBu4N+, in contrast to 5° for K+. This facilitates better conjugation of Ob in nBu4N-PNPS with the π system of p-nitrophenyl, which increases the C1–Ob bond energy (1.359 Å vs 1.398 Å) and improves the leaving ability of nitrophenolate. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the bridging oxygen (Ob) in nBu4N-PNPS was measured in subsequent O-sulfation experiments (Fig. 2A), and an 18kOb value of 1.0177 confirms the S–Ob bond cleavage in the transition state43. The Na-PNPS structure reveals that Na⁺ counterion exhibits both coordinated and non-coordinated interactions with Ob. Notably, S–Ob bonds involved in Na⁺ coordination are longer (1.651 Å) than those not coordinated (1.640 Å) (Table S2).

With nBu4N-PNPS as an activated SO3 donor, its sulfuryl transfer potential was evaluated on testosterone 1a. O-sulfation with Mn(OTf)2 as a catalyst in MeCN at 25 °C afforded the desired sulfated testosterone 1 in 72% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Control experiments confirmed the essentiality of Mn(OTf)2 for O-sulfation reaction (Table 1, entry 2). The Lewis acid Mn(OTf)2 likely serves as an activator for the sulfate group in nBu4N-PNPS, and enhances the electrophilicity of the sulfur atom for the subsequent nucleophilic attack (Fig. S1).30 Other manganese salts and Fe(OTf)3 showed lower reactivity, while Ag(OTf)2 was ineffective (Table 1, entries 3-5). Although dichloromethane (DCM) gave a higher yield, MeCN was chosen as a less toxic solvent (Table 1, entry 6). The O-sulfation reaction proved relatively insensitive to air and temperature, proceeding efficiently under mild and simple conditions (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). The use of potassium, sodium, tetraethylammonium p-nitrophenyl sulfate provided the desired product in moderate yields; however, it is not as general and efficient as nBu4N-PNPS (Table 1, entries 9–11; Fig. S2). The corresponding potassium, sodium, and tetraethylammonium sulfate products were less stable during purification than their tetrabutylammonium (nBu4N⁺) counterparts53. Furthermore, their poor solubility in organic solvents required aqueous purification and ion-exchange chromatography, limiting their practical utility.

The mild conditions and simple reaction setup make it applicable to a variety of structurally diverse medicinal agents and natural products. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, this protocol was found to be general and robust, with remarkable functional group tolerances. Several natural steroid hormones, including diosgenin (2), cholesterol (3), epiandrosterone (4), and estrone (5), could be readily sulfated with high efficiency. Phenolic motifs in sesamol (6), mecarbinate (7), and monobenzone (8) were viable in this O-sulfation, albeit with moderate yields. These lower yields relative to alkyl sulfates resulted from their inherent instability and mass losses during purification. For other substrates, moderate or poor yields arose from poor reaction conversion; no significant by-products were detected. Terpenoids perilla alcohol (9), mevastatin (10), β-citronellol (11), and oleanic acid (12) underwent sulfation smoothly. We further established that O-sulfation is efficient for a diverse range of quinones and nucleosides, such as aloe emodin (13), idebenone (14), stavudine (15), and azidothymidine (16). Other structurally complex substrates were sulfated directly with this method, including the genital warts agent podophyllotoxin (17), insect repellent picaridin (18), selective estrogen receptor modulator ospemifene (19), proxyphylline (20), ezetimibe (21), antibiotic florfenicol (22), and muscle relaxant methocarbamol (23). Additionally, tertiary alcohol 24 and disaccharide (25) were also amenable to these reaction conditions. Protic groups such as carboxylic acid (12), phenols (13, 21), primary (22) and secondary amides (23) are tolerated; however, basic amines are incompatible due to their deactivation to Lewis acid Mn(OTf)2 catalyst.

nBu4N-PNPS demonstrates a mild profile and high chemoselectivity compared to other sulfuryl donor reagents, such as sulfur trioxide-amine/amide complex and sulfurochloridic acid. For example, mevastatin (10) was successfully sulfated with nBu4N-PNPS under nearly neutral conditions to avoid decomposition. In contrast, the use of sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex or sulfurochloridic acid was less productive and produced elimination by-products (Fig. S3). They also led to the formation of both monosulfated and disulfated analogues upon reaction with pleuromulin (26) due to their inability to differentiate between primary and secondary alcohols. O-sulfation with nBu4N-PNPS can discriminate among different hydroxyl groups and afford a sulfated analogue with synthetically useful selectivity; for instance, a 55% yield of the sulfated forskolin analogue 27 was obtained, despite the presence of three hydroxyl groups in forskolin. We identified several trends to predict the O-sulfation site among multiple hydroxyl groups: (1) alcohols are selectively sulfated in the presence of phenols; (2) primary alcohols are preferentially sulfated over secondary and tertiary alcohols; (3) β, β′-dibranched secondary alcohols typically react much more slowly; (4) tertiary alcohols are unreactive unless they are less sterically-hindered. These guidelines have the potential to accurately predict the reactivity and selectivity of O-sulfation for the evaluated substrates.

Hydroxyl-containing amino acids, including tyrosine (28), threonine (29), and proline (30) could be efficiently sulfated (Fig. 4). This method was then extended to oligopeptides with protected serine and threonine residues. We found that common side chains in canonical amino acids are compatible, such as methionine (31, 34), tryptophan (32), valine (33) and phenylalanine (33, 34), demonstrating broad functional group tolerance. Tripeptide ritonavir (35) could be modified to access its sulfate-conjugates. Such post-translational modification of peptide sequences is a significant challenge via traditional O-sulfonation method.

In conclusion, we have developed an efficient and general method for the late-stage O-sulfation with tetrabutylammonium p-nitrophenyl sulfate (nBu4N-PNPS). The often-overlooked interplay of the instrinsically anionic PNPS with counterions is essential to modulate the reactivity, solubility, and function of the parent compound PNPS. Therefore, the bioinspired sulfuryl donor with the activation by tetrabutylammonium enables this O-sulfation reaction to proceed under simple and mild conditions, demonstrating a broader substrate scope and greater functional group tolerance than any reported sulfation protocols. We anticipate that this method will be a valuable addition to the late-stage sulfated conjugation with significant implications for biological functions and drug discovery.

To a 4 mL borosilicate vial equipped with a stir bar was added substrate (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv), Mn(OTf)2 (3.6 mg, 0.01 mmol, 10 mol%), tetrabutylammonium 4-nitrophenyl sulfate (nBu4N-PNPS, 69.1 mg, 0.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and solvent (0.5 mL, c = 0.2 M). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 °C or 50 °C for 4 h, and then diluted with CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The resulting mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with CH2Cl2/MeOH (100:1 \(\longrightarrow\) 50:1\(\longrightarrow\) 30:1, v/v) to afford tetrabutylammonium sulfate salt.

The main way to tell how old a TV is? Look at the bezels. Until about 10 years ago, they were thick picture frames, but they've slowly gotten smaller and smaller as the models turned over. With its new QM8K QLED, TCL has removed them entirely.

Innovations in panel design mean that this blindingly bright screen looks like it's floating in space on its pedestal mount. It's a classy party trick that makes it easy to hide on the wall with images or artwork on it, and it improves the viewing angle to boot.

This flagship model costs a pretty penny more than TCL's other value-first options, but that's for good reason: It competes directly with more expensive mini LED models from Samsung and Sony, and the great viewing angle and brightness even give high-end OLED models a run for their money. If you want a good picture and great apps for less, you can get it with a more affordable Hisense or TCL model, but if you want a great picture, this is the most affordable way to get it this year.

The experience of setting up the QM8K is basically the same as with any other TV. The QM8K comes in a large cardboard box surrounded by foam, and you'll want two people to pull it out, put it on a soft surface like a bed or table with a blanket, and install the included pedestal mount. It comes with a power cable and backlit (!) remote, but you'll need to supply your own HDMI cables if you want to connect anything to any of its four ports (two HDMI 2.1, two HDMI 2.0).

I always love a TV with a pedestal mount, and this mount is sturdy and easy to attach. It also allows you to tilt the TV. Likewise, the included Google TV interface is extremely easy to use, with QR-based logins for essentially every modern streaming app, and speedy swaps between apps (something I had an issue with on last year's TCL models).

The TV supports Chromecast and Airplay 2, which makes casting music and YouTube clips super easy for folks who are visiting and on your Wi-Fi. The TV has Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 support, and it was more than capable of keeping up with 4K streaming on my mesh network at home. It has Ethernet as well, should you want to hard-wire in for the fastest speeds.

The lack of bezels isn't immediately noticeable if you're not looking for it, but once you see that the brushed gunmetal frame of the TV now immediately transitions to screen after just 3.2 millimeters—rather than having a 10 mm-ish black rim—every comparable model seems old and tired. The gorgeous crystal WHVA panel is capable of up to 3,040 local dimming zones (depending on the size of TV you buy), which makes for a stunning image, and the lack of frame makes it look like the picture is hovering in space.

Five thousand nits (according to TCL) of peak brightness means that this TV is outstandingly bright—so bright that it will actually hurt your eyes if you have it on the highest backlight setting in a dark room. Ask me how I know.

The best new mode for viewing is Filmmaker Mode, which looks extremely accurate out of the box. The brightness peaks a thousand or two nits lower in this mode than in full Vivid mode, but that's more than bright enough for HDR colors to pop when streaming or playing discs. Other built-in viewing modes range from the brighter Standard mode (good for rooms with lights on) to Cinema (you'll want the lights off). Sports mode is great, particularly because the TV has a 144-Hz native refresh rate, as is Game Mode, which turns on variable refresh rate (and a frame accelerator) for seamless gaming.

As far as viewing options: The world is your oyster. Combine the aforementioned specs and modes with compatibility with every major HDR format (from HDR10+ to Dolby Vision IQ and IMAX Enhanced content)—you really can't find something that won't play to its full potential.

Popping in my favorite 4K Blu-Ray discs felt like a treat on this TV, which showcases near-OLED levels of contrast amid its beautiful color highlights. I particularly loved watching vividly mastered films like Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse, which is utterly beautiful in a dark room on this panel. Still, it manages to restrain itself when dealing with more vintage-y content like Ford v Ferrari.

Speaking of Ferraris, a new collaboration with Bang & Olufsen brings branded speakers to the back of the screen. These larger drivers do better than virtually all built-in TV speakers in the modern era, but if you're buying a screen this beautiful, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not also have a sturdy home-theater listening system, or even a nicer soundbar, to go with it.

As far as daily usability, it's really hard to think of a high-end model that can do more than this. Samsung's highest-end QLED models might be prettier (I have one in the studio in early testing as I type this), but they have a worse interface and don't even support Dolby Vision. If you want a solid TV that can do everything very well, I have a hard time pointing you elsewhere.

It's great in a bright room, it's great in a dark room, and with a viewing angle that's 40 percent wider than before, it's great in a wide room too. I can't think of a room it doesn't belong in.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 1994, an earthquake of a proof shook up the mathematical world. The mathematician Andrew Wiles had finally settled Fermat's Last Theorem, a central problem in number theory that had remained open for over three centuries. The proof didn't just enthral mathematicians—it made the front page of The New York Times.

But to accomplish it, Wiles (with help from the mathematician Richard Taylor) first had to prove a more subtle intermediate statement—one with implications that extended beyond Fermat's puzzle.

This intermediate proof involved showing that an important kind of equation called an elliptic curve can always be tied to a completely different mathematical object called a modular form. Wiles and Taylor had essentially unlocked a portal between disparate mathematical realms, revealing that each looks like a distorted mirror image of the other. If mathematicians want to understand something about an elliptic curve, Wiles and Taylor showed, they can move into the world of modular forms, find and study their object's mirror image, then carry their conclusions back with them.

This connection between worlds, called “modularity,” didn't just enable Wiles to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Mathematicians soon used it to make progress on all sorts of previously intractable problems.

Modularity also forms the foundation of the Langlands program, a sweeping set of conjectures aimed at developing a “grand unified theory” of mathematics. If the conjectures are true, then all sorts of equations beyond elliptic curves will be similarly tethered to objects in their mirror realm. Mathematicians will be able to jump between the worlds as they please to answer even more questions.

But proving the correspondence between elliptic curves and modular forms has been incredibly difficult. Many researchers thought that establishing some of these more complicated correspondences would be impossible.

Now, a team of four mathematicians has proved them wrong. In February, the quartet finally succeeded in extending the modularity connection from elliptic curves to more complicated equations called abelian surfaces. The team—Frank Calegari of the University of Chicago, George Boxer and Toby Gee of Imperial College London, and Vincent Pilloni of the French National Center for Scientific Research—proved that every abelian surface belonging to a certain major class can always be associated to a modular form.

Toby Gee, Frank Calegari, and Vincent Pilloni, along with George Boxer (not pictured), spent nearly a decade on the proof.

“We mostly believe that all the conjectures are true, but it's so exciting to see it actually realized,” said Ana Caraiani, a mathematician at Imperial College London. “And in a case that you really thought was going to be out of reach.”

It's just the beginning of a hunt that will take years—mathematicians ultimately want to show modularity for every abelian surface. But the result can already help answer many open questions, just as proving modularity for elliptic curves opened up all sorts of new research directions.

The elliptic curve is a particularly fundamental type of equation that uses just two variables—x and y. If you graph its solutions, you'll see what appear to be simple curves. But these solutions are interrelated in rich and complicated ways, and they show up in many of number theory's most important questions. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for instance—one of the toughest open problems in math, with a $1 million reward for whoever proves it first—is about the nature of solutions to elliptic curves.

Elliptic curves can be hard to study directly. So sometimes mathematicians prefer to approach them from a different angle.

That's where modular forms come in. A modular form is a highly symmetric function that appears in an ostensibly separate area of mathematical study called analysis. Because they exhibit so many nice symmetries, modular forms can be easier to work with.

At first, these objects seem as though they shouldn't be related. But Taylor and Wiles' proof revealed that every elliptic curve corresponds to a specific modular form. They have certain properties in common—for instance, a set of numbers that describes the solutions to an elliptic curve will also crop up in its associated modular form. Mathematicians can therefore use modular forms to gain new insights into elliptic curves.

But mathematicians think Taylor and Wiles' modularity theorem is just one instance of a universal fact. There's a much more general class of objects beyond elliptic curves. And all of these objects should also have a partner in the broader world of symmetric functions like modular forms. This, in essence, is what the Langlands program is all about.

An elliptic curve has only two variables—x and y—so it can be graphed on a flat sheet of paper. But if you add another variable, z, you get a curvy surface that lives in three-dimensional space. This more complicated object is called an abelian surface, and as with elliptic curves, its solutions have an ornate structure that mathematicians want to understand.

It seemed natural that abelian surfaces should correspond to more complicated types of modular forms. But the extra variable makes them much harder to construct and their solutions much harder to find. Proving that they, too, satisfy a modularity theorem seemed completely out of reach. “It was a known problem not to think about, because people have thought about it and got stuck,” Gee said.

But Boxer, Calegari, Gee, and Pilloni wanted to try.

All four mathematicians were involved in research on the Langlands program, and they wanted to prove one of these conjectures for “an object that actually turns up in real life, rather than some weird thing,” Calegari said.

Not only do abelian surfaces show up in real life—the real life of a mathematician, that is—but proving a modularity theorem about them would open new mathematical doors. “There are lots of things you can do if you have this statement that you have no chance of doing otherwise,” Calegari said.

“After a coffee, we would always joke that we had to go back to the mine.”

The mathematicians started working together in 2016, hoping to follow the same steps that Taylor and Wiles had in their proof about elliptic curves. But every one of those steps was much more complicated for abelian surfaces.

So they focused on a particular type of abelian surface, called an ordinary abelian surface, that was easier to work with. For any such surface, there's a set of numbers that describes the structure of its solutions. If they could show that the same set of numbers could also be derived from a modular form, they'd be done. The numbers would serve as a unique tag, allowing them to pair each of their abelian surfaces with a modular form.

The problem was that while these numbers are straightforward to compute for a given abelian surface, mathematicians don't know how to construct a modular form with the exact same tag. Modular forms are simply too difficult to build when the requirements are so constrained. “The objects you're looking for, you don't really know they exist,” Pilloni said.

Instead, the mathematicians showed that it would be enough to construct a modular form whose numbers matched those of the abelian surface in a weaker sense. The modular form's numbers only had to be equivalent in the realm of what's known as clock arithmetic.

Imagine a clock: If the hour hand starts at 10 and four hours pass, the clock will point to 2. But clock arithmetic can be done with any number, not just (as in the case of real-world clocks) the number 12.

Boxer, Calegari, Gee, and Pilloni only needed to show that their two sets of numbers matched when they used a clock that goes up to 3. This meant that, for a given abelian surface, the mathematicians had more flexibility when it came to building the associated modular form.

But even this proved too difficult.

Then they stumbled on a trove of modular forms whose corresponding numbers were easy to calculate—so long as they defined their numbers according to a clock that goes up to 2. But the abelian surface needed one that goes up to 3.

The mathematicians had an idea of how to roughly bridge these two different clocks. But they didn't know how to make the connection airtight so they could find a true match for the abelian surface in the world of modular forms. Then a new piece of mathematics appeared that turned out to be just what they needed.

Lue Pan's work in a seemingly disparate area of number theory turned out to be essential.

In 2020, a number theorist named Lue Pan posted a proof about modular forms that didn't initially seem connected to the quartet's problem. But they soon recognized that the techniques he'd developed were surprisingly relevant. “I didn't expect that,” Pan said.

After years of regular meetings, mostly on Zoom, the mathematicians started to make progress adapting Pan's techniques, but major hurdles remained. Then, in the summer of 2023, Boxer, Gee, and Pilloni saw a conference in Bonn, Germany, as the perfect opportunity to come together. The only problem was that Calegari was supposed to travel to China at the same time to give a talk. But a difficult visit to the Chinese consulate in Chicago made him reconsider. “Eight hours later, my visa was rejected and my car was towed,” he said. He decided to scrap the China talk and join his collaborators in Germany.

Gee secured the team a room in the basement of the Hausdorff Research Institute, where they were unlikely to be disturbed by itinerant mathematicians. There, they spent an entire week working on Pan's theorem, one 12-hour day after the next, only coming up to ground level occasionally for caffeine. “After a coffee, we would always joke that we had to go back to the mine,” Pilloni said.

The grind paid off. “There were many twists to come later,” Calegari said, “but at the end of that week I thought we more or less had it.”

It took another year and a half to turn Calegari's conviction into a 230-page proof, which they posted online in February. Putting all the pieces together, they'd proved that any ordinary abelian surface has an associated modular form.

Their new portal could one day be as powerful as Taylor and Wiles' result, revealing more about abelian surfaces than anyone thought possible. But first, the team will have to extend their result to non-ordinary abelian surfaces. They've teamed up with Pan to continue the hunt. “Ten years from now, I'd be surprised if we haven't found almost all of them,” Gee said.

The work has also allowed mathematicians to formulate new conjectures—such as an analogue of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture that involves abelian surfaces instead of elliptic curves. “Now we at least know that the analogue makes sense” for these ordinary surfaces, said Andrew Sutherland, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Previously we did not know that.”

“Lots of things that I had dreamed we would be able to one day prove are now within reach because of this theorem,” he added. “It changes things.”

The Department of Government Efficiency hopes to use a new AI tool to eliminate half of the federal government's regulatory mandates, according to The Washington Post.

Citing a PowerPoint presentation dated July 1, The Post reports that the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool is supposed to analyze around 200,000 federal regulations and identify the ones that are no longer required by law, with the goal of eliminating half those regulations by the first anniversary of President Donald Trump's return to office.

It seems this work is already underway, with the presentation declaring the tool has already been used to review regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to write “100% of deregulations” Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

A White House spokesperson told The Post that “no single plan has been approved or greenlit” but praised the DOGE team as “the best and brightest in the business.”

This is just the latest AI tool developed by DOGE (led in the early months of the Trump administration by Elon Musk), including one reportedly error-prone tool that would hallucinate the size of Veterans Affairs contracts.

This is exactly why governments should step in and regulate Visa and MasterCard, to prevent them from banning porn or other adult services.If this kind of banning goes too far, there will come a point when even Joe Blow and his dog start using cryptocurrency. And once (truly private and anonymous) cryptocurrency becomes widely circulated, people will no longer need to exchange it back into fiat currency. Joe might start paying other people directly with crypto and eventually, perhaps even his rent, utilities, groceries...?And then what? How will governments collect tax revenue?

I dont want queer dating sims to be banned but they are gonna be if no one is honest about what shows up next to them in places where they exist.

You don't get porn movies on Netflix or Disney stream. You don't get adult toys in your local grocery store. Why do we sell porn on Steam?Why haven't game stores just spin off separate store front for porn content? It is basically free, since they already have the infrasructure.While being removed from general stores, porn has become very visible on big gaming platforms which majority of customers don't associate with porn. Backlash is inevitable.I think we can expect a bigger push against porn in general as pendulum swings back on the other side.

It is basically free, since they already have the infrasructure.While being removed from general stores, porn has become very visible on big gaming platforms which majority of customers don't associate with porn. Backlash is inevitable.I think we can expect a bigger push against porn in general as pendulum swings back on the other side.

For extremely explicit stuff, sure, the adults-only line might be clear for a lot of folks. But other stuff is not as clear cut: if media describes sex at all, is it adult? Even Supreme Court justices have trouble defining in this area.…and all of that is ignoring the elephants in the room: whether or not explicit media even should be restricted for non-adults, the fact that there are highly variable and localized levels of people's preparedness for adult media (even more variable and subjective than developmental cutoffs for alcohol sale), and the abundant historical evidence that attempts to draw an acceptability/adults-only line in subjective areas like this are inevitably extended to provide cover for political agendas (e.g. homophobia).

But the problem isn't porn. That's the low hanging fruit for a massive power grab The problem is that card companies can/will/did blackmail multiple companies into changing, and in some small cases shut-down their entire businesses.In a post-cash world, this is completely unacceptable, and a blatant power grab. If the payment processors are allowed to set this precedent, then there will be nothing to stop these for-profit companies from blocking anybody, anywhere from buying anything - for any or no reason.People are blaming a specific protest group. Personally I believe they are being scapegoated. And honestly if a tiny group from a tiny economy are so easily able to control international macroeconomics, then the root cause is still that the card services are vulnerable to such an attack.The only appropriate response is swift and severe regulation of these critically necessary card and banking services, up to and including the dissolution of both Visa and MasterCard - and in the US strict caps on card fees, as well as an amendment to the Constitution ensure that our right to own property permanently includes the right to buy property.Are the payment providers going to weaponize their de facto control over all purchases to target guns next? Churches? Birth control? Inner-City hospitals?
Which apps or social music companies do you think they'll allow to live, or die? 
Will they blackmail the Internet service providers? Political parties? Entire countries? Which side of which wars do you think Visa will force us to support? Is a company called ""MasterCard"" for or against letting people with your skin color buy food?
You don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody should have to know.It doesn't matter where you land politically, the point is that these companies cannot be allowed to wield this kind of control.
Our society really does depend on it. 
...Because we can't go back to cash anymore, and they very much know it.

I mostly agree with this.  There are legitimate issues with even the biggest and most respected porn sites being very lax with taking down underage and nonconsensual content.  The card companies AFAICT aren't being pressured to reform because of this kind of content, but more the LGBT content which is harming nobody.

Credit has become ubiquitous, in a manner that belies its supposed purpose, at least as was originally practiced before consumers were offered and employed credit for absolutely everything.Then again, governments and ""regulated"" entities are also capable of blackmail. I'm not sure these private companies would ever have an incentive to care about what you spend their money on unless governments gave them a reason to - which is why this is happening. At the end of the day you run into the same perpetual problem - you want x, some mob wants y. Good luck.

In the US at least the classier vibrators have been starting to be sold first at shops like Sharper Image, and now, indeed, grocery stores.

I'd be more interested in questioning these than why porn is available on Steam.

Because the payment processing is unreliable and prohibitively expensive. For all the whining about ""moral pearl clutching"", the reality is that adult oriented businesses deal with massively higher rates of fraud and charge-backs. Visa and Mastercard couldn't care less about the ethical issues, it's simply a risk calculation for their business.

reply

The answer is, I think, monopoly environments: they contain poor incentive structures for competitive differentiation, and encourage extreme risk aversion by the monopolists. Add to that the “it's not really about chargebacks, it's a culture war” agenda (which isn't just lobbying pressure on payment processors; plenty of the calls are coming from inside the house there), and the outcome of de facto censorship is likely.

reply

This gets repeated, but it's not the real reason. If it were, Visa/MasterCard would be fine with a store like Steam offering those games as e.g. crypto-only purchases.

reply

reply

The risk is not from Valve; disputes pass through to the processor. This is the same problem dating sites, gambling, etc. all deal with. Any sufficiently large adult oriented business becomes a de-facto payment processor, where their entire core business function is in managing this risk, not whatever they actually do for the end user. It's either that, or charge the exorbitant fees that come with using a niche provider who takes on that risk.

Which makes sense - you have buyers and sellers who insist on anonymity, services that leave no trace once rendered, buyers and sellers lying to family and friends about what they're doing, etc.There's often no ""normal"" amount of consumption, for example, some sellers receive million dollar tips.Money laundering is a massive problem, and it enables some really terrible things.I suspect the fact that American banks are so anti-porn comes from the fact that the American financial sector has such strong anti-money laundering regs (as opposed to, say, the American real estate sector, or the UK financial sector).One of the reasons OF is doing well is because they insist on following know your customer laws.

There have been several scandals related to payment processing and money laundering, and some of them connected to companies that do a lot of business with porn. Usually, you will see banks breaking away when those scandals break to the public.However, banks do not break away just because they don't like the transactions they're seeing. What they actually do is to enforce stricter rules by financially penalizing those who make them lose money. Your transactions are getting canceled a lot (by having to be flagged/undone/paid back etc.)? You'll have to pay higher fees, and if it keeps happening, you will lose your license.You know when they do often break immediately, however? When there are campaigns by special interests groups, usually connected to conservative groups, to paint companies as having illegal content, even when they don't have this problem any more than any social media platform. In those cases, they don't wait for any tribunal.

It doesn't matter much when it's just regular subscribers - nobody really cares about consumer rights in the adult content space. That's why so many creators can get away with pretending they're the ones replying to messages. But I'm betting there's going to be a CSEM scandal linked to this in the next few years.

Even if somebody thinks certain speech should be censored, I doubt they'd want what they consider unsavory speech being driven to use a payment system like Bitcoin, and for that to become the norm, it would open up much more potential for abuse.

    Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.

Bonus: it also aims to eliminate sex ed.    eliminate central promotion of abortion; comprehensive
    sexuality education; and the new woke gender ideology

They seem totally fine with the age checks many states are enacting for porn sites. The Republican Party loves slagging pedophiles (real or imagined) and hating on LGBTQIA+ people or trying to make their lives as difficult/horrible as possible.Yeah some games delisted were horrible. One of the main offenders had already been pulled as soon as Steam (or was it Itch) was notified. But they still used it as evidence. The platforms were policing themselves well.But not only did gratuitous porn games and abuse games get delisted, lots of games on related to inclusiveness of LGBTQIA+ did too from what I'm seeing from developers on social media.I suspect if anything the administration would be happy to let people use this as yet another hammer in their culture war against such people existing.That's why.

If it's not a credit card, it's what debit? Different countries do it differently, so that's a big hassle for the storefront. Sure you can use a payment processor, but look it's someone to pressure to prevent you from taking money again.Maybe Crypto? How do people buy that crypto? Probably want to use credit cards. Oops.

That's an institution to pressure to block you again.If your new system interacts with the old system at all there is an attack point.

Yes but no. Currently the issue is that these two payment systems - both credit/debit card networks - (1) have the power to decide with impunity, because they have critical mass. And (2) have visibility into who each vendor is and what they are selling. If there is one case of abusing market dominance, this is it - and for all we frequently hear, this is REALLY not all that common. (And it's ""funny"" that we hear a lot about Apple's app store - but not about their anti-adult content rules!)For example, right now a bank would have a VERY hard time preventing you from paying for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT with crypto. That bank would have no visibility into who you are paying with that crypto. There are other crypto intermediaries but they are ""diffuse"". Nobody in there has both visibility and power.For example, right now some vendors accept gift cards as payment. Buy a Home Depot gift card in cash at your local store and use it to pay for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT. Obviously this is not a very efficient payment infrastructure but it exists.But yes of course, imposing to credit card networks to be content-blind would be helpful and soooo much more efficient.

The problem with alternatives to things like OnlyFans is that the performers who work through OnlyFans want to go where people can find them. They can dumb down their acts - and have lots of paying traffic, or they can do what they would prefer - and have hardly any paying traffic. That's tough.

reply

They could not allow those games to be sold through those particular payment processors and require wire transfers instead. More cumbersome payment method, but better than outright banning them.If the payment processors try to dictate what content these sites may host even when it  involves competing processors that sounds quite anti-competitive practice.

They're not ""targeting"" payment processors. Payment processors have to deal with significantly more problems due to the nature of porn games and chargebacks. Fix those problems and the payment processors won't have a reason anymore to ban porn (or anything). What's the point of a capitalist economy if not for startups to target market needs like these?

reply

This is commonly repeated, but doesn't hold up. Chargeback fees (especially for card-not-present transactions) are paid by the merchant and are simply increased (with reserves required) for high-risk accounts. It also wouldn't make sense to target hyper-specific niches if it were really about chargebacks, they would go after all of it, and go after things like the CS marketplace.But the biggest giveaway IMO is that they do not allow, e.g., Steam selling these games crypto-only. It's either remove them entirely or remove credit cards entirely. If it was really about specific titles having high fraud/chargeback rates, selling them some other way would be fine.

In this case with Steam and Itch.io they are targeting legal games and is just 100% in the wrong. There is a checkered history of Visa/Mastercard dropping legitimate causes because it's hot politically. Which is also in the wrong.Bitcoin/crypto was supposed to be the way around this kind of censorship, but that's basically a ponzi scheme so that's not the way forward. Unfortunately Visa/Mastercard have a monopoly on the market and they use it regularly to keep out competition.

Unfortunately Visa/Mastercard have a monopoly on the market and they use it regularly to keep out competition. Regulation/investigations need to be done to fix this, but that sure as hell isn't happening under this presidency.

The point I'm more interested in here is the ""Why do you people always presume they know what is best for other people?"". To which my answer is that many people make it their job to care about what people are exposed to. Often it's rooted in extensive experience and literature. I don't think it's a good notion to outright disregard everyone who seems to have a better idea on how people should live. Among other things, not everyone needs to make the same mistakes over and over again, like falling into an addiction, just because ""they can't tell me to not fall into this addiction"".And yeah, there will be a lot of busybodies as well. When there's power, there will be abuse as well.

That's their framing, it's not what they actually do.If Collective Shout was a group that studied which things caused harm, and then campaigned against those things, then the point you're trying to make could stand.They're not. They've campaigned to ban rap artists, GTA 5, ""50 Shades"", lingerie ads, whatever random thing is around at the time - always under the pretext that it harms someone, but never with any evidence or substantial arguments that it does.In practice groups like this campaign against whatever they don't like, so it's correct to refute them on those grounds.

This defines them as identical. Morals are what people think makes society better, and their absence worse.There's lots of other ways to dislike something besides morals.For example, I don't like spectator sports. It's not a moral issue, just taste, so me not watching sport is genuinely sufficient.Conversely, I think analytics tracking is harmful to society even though I also find it interesting to see the results, and should be banned. Me simply not using it isn't enough.Anti-porn people? I disagree with them. If they are motivated by religious fundamentalism, then I disagree with the foundation of their worldview. But this is how it is not simply enough to respond with ""if you don't like it, don't buy it"".

You've indicated two things here which you assert are legitimate:* Their fight for their goals* The thinking underlying these goalsOn the latter: Nobody except the people doing the thinking can (at least with current technology) truly know.  And it may be entirely unimportant.  My best guess is that u/fenomas has it about right; their aesthetic seems to have informed a manufactured narrative about societal impact.  It may be that these people have personal unresolved sexual trauma which is activated by these subjects.  Surely no matter their reasons, they deserve to be treated with compassion.  But I don't think that u/fenomas is being illogical here, or failing to steelman their position; I think that it's perfectly reasonable to question someone's basis for advocacy of censorship.However, on the former, I more strongly disagree with your use of the word ""legitimately"".  Using the heavy hand of the state (including the unfortunate configuration in which payment processors need its anointment and good graces and are thus vulnerable to political pressure) to censor the internet - a resource characterized chiefly by its cross-cultural and cross-political availability and unity - is not a legitimate tactic.  The internet does not seem to tolerate this variety of censorship; in every instance, the Streisand Effect, May 35, and similar phenomena have quickly and decisively punctured the erected walls.Whether these people truly view these materials as likely to harm society or not, their legitimate avenue of change is through voluntarily persuasion, not censorship by way of force.

That's inferiority complex pushed into moral superiority feeling. All just emotions of unbalanced/uneducated people who should know better but clearly don't. No place for such behavior in truly democratic society, their rights to decide what should be happening and what shouldn't generally end at the door of their house (and even that just within legal framework).Otherwise lets give some room for neonazis too for example, they certainly have a vision about how the society should look like and behave. They are at the end just bunch of folks who want to change society for what they consider a better one, right?

In some countries, maybe.  In the US, there were concerted attempts (like the First Amendment to the Constitution) to prevent that from being the government's job, because of the fear that government would use that job to suppress dissent and coerce opinions.If payment processors are picking up that job, and doing so in a coordinated manner that doesn't allow porn companies to simply say ""use these payment rails to do business with us, not those ones,"" it is not unreasonable to suspect that they are doing so not for their own business interests but as a proxy for powers that the government is denied.  Someone should be taking a long look at whether the US-based payment processors are becoming a tool of censorship and, if so, how that censorship is being coordinated.  It's not like Visa and Mastercard come up with these things independently and on a whim.

Anyway, some people wouldn't even call it censorship if private businesses disagree and decide not to do business, for any reason, even if it's public pressure. Should private payment processors be free to choose whose money they process? If not, why not? Be really careful with your answer, because taking away their freedom to choose is a type of censorship, and possibly a worse one because it would be a public/government censorship and not a private transaction censorship. Steam and Itch.io do still have the right to ship all these games, they're choosing not to. They also still have the right to use other payment processors, and/or create their own.I'd be willing to bet the payment processors in question would rather not be forced to cut off business, and do not care whether people pay for porn. They are simply trying to avoid public backlash and avoid being blacklisted by a large number of people who happen to believe porn is damaging.

If I were to take a stab such a protocol, it would live on a web of trust that kept track of interpersonal debts.  So if Alice owes Bob, and Bob owes Charlie, then Charlie can ""pay"" Alice by instructing Bob to cancel both of those debts.  In this case Bob is the clearinghouse.  Some network connectivity is needed (Alice, Bob, and Charlie all on the same network) but it still works if the internet partitions.  We incentivize Bob to keep his device available for this by creating a new debt when the transaction settles: this time it's one where Alice and Charlie owe Bob for having been the transaction processor.If Bob didn't want to act in this capacity, he wouldn't have trusted Alice and Charlie to begin with.  Charlie would then need to find a different path to Alice if he wanted to use the network to pay her.  (Presumably they don't trust each other directly, otherwise they'd be creating new debts instead of cancelling transitive ones).  In this scenario I suppose Bob would be acting as ""censor"" but his capacity to do so is not greater than any other user of the network.For Charlie to be fully denied the ability to pay Alice, one of them would have to be behaving so badly that everyone refuses to trust them. That's a desirable outcome, if we must have something like censorship, it should not depend on the feeling of some guy who owns a bank but is otherwise unconnected with the parties of the transaction.  It should be decided by the people who are near to Alice and Bob on the trust graph and therefore have to deal with the real world consequences of Alice and Bob's behavior.  If they want to collectively prevent those two from doing business, that's their right since it's their community that that business is happening in.One imagines this featuring in cases where some rich foreigner wants to set up mining operations that would poison the drinking water.  The locals can collectively prevent that foreign money from buying local groceries, thereby limiting the ability of the foreign actor to harm them.So that's my harebrained idea.  But I'm not making up fictions and asking people to treat them like money.  The people involved with USD are. If they want us to continue participating in their harebrained idea, they should recognize that giving us a system with problematic properties represents a risk that they might lose their privileged position.  My point is just that it's on them, the designers of the system, to figure it out how to make it all work--we need only accept or reject it.

Like, the people with the “blueberry expansion” one, you really think they were born with that? No, of course not, that would be dumb.I think the main reason people put forth the “latent fetish” explanation is in order to argue that pornography is harmless.As for why it harms me?The purpose of sexuality is for relations with one's spouse. On average, I expect it to be counterproductive in that regards. Most women wouldn't find it appealing, and looking for specifically women who would find the idea appealing would substantially restrict the pool to search among. Also, most of the versions of the fantasy I have violated conservation of energy, and therefore cannot be physically achieved. Why would I want to want something impossible?And, generally, lust promotes lust.

There's a 3rd explanation: fetishes aren't inborn, but they're not instilled by porn either.  Instead, they develop through a complex interaction of psychological, developmental, neurological, and cultural factors.One theory is that, if a person repeatedly experiences sexual arousal in the presence of a specific object or situation (even coincidentally), the brain may begin to link that stimulus with arousal (classical conditioning).  Or if the experience isn't repeated but it is intense, it can become imprinted as erotically significant.  In both cases, the fetish can be considered “latent” in the sense that it existed prior to one's encounter with porn related to that fetish.  Porn simply revealed what was already there (and showed the viewer there are others out there like them, too!).So-called “normal” sexual behavior is just the median of millions of data points.  There is not one person who fits that median in all respects.  Even if you can't find a partner who finds your specific fetish “appealing”, there are plenty of women out there who won't specifically judge you for it either.  Failing that, just enjoy the fetish in your own mind and don't divulge it to your partner.  You're entitled to an inner life, after all.Just as we have a biological imperative to procreate, we also have one to eat.  But I'd disqualify any potential partner who thought less of me for liking tacos.  Again, as long as one's fetish doesn't harm others, why should sex be any different?

Porn might involve large media files which gives it an up-front advantage re: ""more"", but it doesn't create shockwaves the way censorship does.

Online, anybody who flamebaits is protected by the platforms and can censor the responses. They delete opposing comments, shadowban users, harsh language usually gets automatically deleted by the platform  - and all that shouting-down is actually just counted as ""engagement"" which algorithmically boosts and spreads the bad idea further. The argument just directly profits the person with the bad idea, and incentivizes them to come up with even worse ideas to make everybody even madder.This kind of censorship is causing a whole lot of problems right now.

For example, the UAE is notorious for both widespread censorship, and an entire class of foreign workers in various forms of indentured servitude (which for women is often prostitution)...

I question the bit about sex trafficking. From my perspective a lot of consenting adults are making a lot of money by willingly participating in the industry. If someone is abusing that and forcing someone to participate, that's already a crime that should be prosecuted. It's not an excuse to shut down commerce between consenting adults.

It's the same with porn and the Christian Right.  If people feel incomplete and try to fill that gap with a porn habit, the porn is an indicator of a problem, not the problem itself.  Filling that gap with right wing propaganda doesn't address the problem, it just changes it into something that can be used for political advantage.You're missing the root causes here.

Most often this doesn't happen because one side fails to understand the other, it happens because one side is dishonest about their motivations or goals.In this case, the censors would like you to believe that they think pornography is harmful. The reality is that they're religious zealots who feel the need to prevent other people from making their own choices about something their religious leaders have told them is evil. They can't admit their real goal though, or people will realize it's just westernized Sharia law and stop taking them seriously.

It may not be good logic, or even self-consistent, but everyone is always using some logic. I'm saying ""find it if you want to convince them.""

However, I disagree in two ways.Firstly, while villainizing them is unhelpful convincing them is utterly impossible when religion is involved. It doesn't matter if we learn to understand their perspective, especially as logic/reason often doesn't apply and they aren't being honest about their goals and motivations.I think the best anyone can hope for in such cases is for all parties to agree that we all have belief structures, and that we don't get to force those beliefs on others via the law. IE - ""The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" It's the only rational basis for a society in which different belief systems coexist. The United States used to understand this, but we seem to have forgotten.Secondly, I do agree that it might be easier to reason with folks the further you get from the top of the ladder. The ""true believers"" who fly airplanes into buildings or who want to outlaw eating candy because it might lead to smiling on a Sunday didn't start down that path last week.The issue with the bottom up approach is that the folks on the bottom seldom have any real power, and for good reason. If pawns were allowed to move backwards they would kill their kings.

There is some truth to that, but if one were to operate at that level then Facebook would be illegal.Porn is a convenient thing to weaponize anger in your constituents (just like babies not being born). It pushes emotional triggers and riles people up and then they're waiting to be told what to hate/attack next.

Banning porn is not going to do a whole lot. Pornography is illegal in South Korea and if anything they have some of the worst gender toxicity.

It's called regulations, not blackmail, and yest the government should, because it's accountable to its people, meanwhile CC companies are not. Everything all companies are allowed to to is regulated by the government. Companies only exist at the mercy of the government, otherwise angry mobs can break in and ransack the place.> Do you really think the credit card companies care where you spend your money?Obviously they do care, when you see their rulings on this matter they care very much(did you not read the articles before commenting?), otherwise they wouldn't be pushing censorship rules on sellers. Or more specific they care about activists complaining how CC companies let you spend your money.

Yet, there's a lot of porn there too. A whole lot of voyeur porn too. As well as prostitution, which is also illegal.Making something legal or illegal is just signaling. The real part is how it actually is implemented in practice. And as you imply, things are pretty complex. We really need to be careful about our own tendencies to want things to be simple. It always backfires...

I hope with this added context that my previous comment will make much more sense and you can interpret it closer to what I intended.I'll just add, I don't think most people work in those absolutes. So I'd be wary of jumping to the extreme interpretation. People might interpret you as being disingenuous and using the logical fallacy ""logical extreme"" or ""reductio ad absurdum"". But I'm pretty sure you're not doing that because then I'd be grossly misinterpreting you, right?

  * It models unrealistic and possibly unhealthy notions about sexuality
  * It can be exploitive of its subjects (yes, sometimes empowering too)

That's kind of it. I don't think it should be banned at all.I believe that ""free speech"" is critical to a well functioning society, but we need to recognize that it can have negative impacts. A key example is the right-wing Hate Industrial Complex: decades of right wing propaganda have conditioned tens of millions of Americans to consider their fellow citizens as non human.I don't have an answer for how to address this, but you can't fix a problem until you recognize the problem and that it needs fixing.

Sounds great, where do I sign?Sure ban porn, but IMO ban social media first. Or at the very least, mandate educational materials on it. Kids grow up thinking it's important and it ruins their lives. Brainrot content deadens their sensory inputs. Same thing needs to happen with AI; we seriously need some required education in these spaces.

If we are to talk about exploitation, then capitalism itself is subject to be attacked and prohibited.If we work for a living, we sell our bodies to someone else for a time (40h a week or more). Does it really matter if we work on a factory floor doing parts, sitting and coding at a desk, or having sex in front of a camera? Labor is labor.Sure its the christian 'sex is bad' in various stripes (puritanical to catholic to baptist etc). But in reality, its just different labor.Now, capitalism in exploitive in that you generate X value, and you get a small percentage of your labor's output. Some owner is who collects the surplus.So if exploitation is the problem, then its time to start looking at worker cooperatives, unions, banning shows like Shark Tank, and all the capitalist propaganda.But no, its just 'sex icky'. We won't actually look at the root of exploitation.

The human experience has never been pure reason. A picture of a naked person will have wildly different effects than a picture of a dog, even though you could technically say they're both ""just pixels on a screen"". Reductionism doesn't get an argument anywhere; it's too commonly an intellectually lazy defense of the vulgar.

Porn is way easier to define than obscenity, so I don't see that being a problem.

reply

This shows a fairly low level of engagement with the sorts of people that are pushing to ban porn. It's not uncommon for them to be anti-screens, social media, etc. for similar reasons. The movement is often as much an attempt to get kids outsides and reduce the influence of smartphones and the internet on society as it is an attempt to ban porn.

In general though outside protected classes business can, and should IMHO, have a lot of discretion over who they choose to do business with and how they do business.Unless we want a carve out for payment processors. Treat them as a utility of sorts? Sounds like an interesting idea TBH.To me it's critical though that society has room to moderate itself where the government can not and should not. Something we've lost with social media is the ability to collectively ignore the guy at the bar nobody likes talking to. All the guys from all the bars are on the internet now being very loud.

Given that there are two payment processors that have about 90% global market share (excluding China) and your bank chooses the payment processor for the most part, yes we should regulate them and force them to process payment for any legal business.They have the ability to effectively determine what we can spend our money on when we can't get cash to the vendor in person, and almost every alternative processor has to deal with them and is also subject to their rules.The only way around this is via informal networks. Cryptocurrency isn't an option for many as it's very hard to obtain, due to the duopoly coercing banks and governments to keep people on their systems.I don't live in the US, and where I live has a local electronic non-credit card payment system which has been around since the 80s. It's less popular now because only the card networks support contactless payments instead of swipe/chip and pin. All the systems support contactless use, but banks won't enable it because it has no interchange fees.

I ran an online porn website for almost 20 years. For 15 years it was my primary source of income.I'm in Canada which, compared to the USA is extremely progressive.In 2022, after a decade of doing business with a certain bank as this business, never having hidden anything about what we did,  my wife and I received an urgent, signature required, overnighted letter from our bank informing us that they were terminating our accounts and that we had one month until we would no longer have access to any funds.The way this played out was that we had an incoming wire transfer get flagged and they phoned us to ask us questions about the wire. We answered everything on the phone honestly and transparently. We were doing nothing wrong.A few months later we get another phone call from our branch asking us to come in in person, urgently, and do an ""extreme due diligence"" check. During this process we had to answer an insane amount of questions about our business activities. They saw a credit card transaction from JetBrains, for example, and asked us to explain who JetBrains was and why we were doing business with them etc.A couple of weeks later we were informed about the termination with a brief letter explaining that we fell outside of their ""risk appetite.""We managed to get an extension on the closure, and for two months we tried in vain to find any banking in Canada that would take us... and we ultimately ended up shutting down a business that represented two decades of our lives.During that time we reached out to industry insiders, some of which we happened to know were in Canada. They all told us that they bank in the USA.One branch manager at a bank we met with was extremely empathetic but obviously couldn't put her own job on the line, and she explained exactly what was going on.The issue is ""Know Your Customer"" regulations that are coming into effect that are meant to target things like money laundering. These regulations force banks to ask questions that they never really cared about before. This branch manager explained that a local strip club used to say they were a ""banquet hall"", and everyone at the branch knew exactly what they were but it was ""don't ask / don't tell.""But once they start digging into these details because the government is forcing them to, then these things get to their compliance departments. And the policies 
exist because they're afraid of things like human trafficking and other things.And our major banks have foreign investors from all around the world. Including from countries where porn is actually illegal.While you point the finger at puritanism in the USA ... consider that in countries like Iceland, producing porn can land you in jail. Now consider MAJOR investments originating in countries like Saudi Arabia etc. and consider how that might impact your bottom line if they all pull out due to nonsense morality conflicts.

I understand the risk tolerance aspect from a bank, they wouldn't want to give a massive loan to a property developer or oil driller going under water. But when it comes to basic deposit services where nobody is asking them to risk their own money, they should be forced to allow any customer who isn't breaking any laws, such as in your case.

If you take that statement at face value (not sure if you should), it's fascinating to think that your business was able to operate for two decades with what I assume are the standard problems people in the porn industry face (e.g. chargebacks from customers unwilling to admit they subscribed in their SO's presence and so pretending it was a scam, etc.)And yet seemingly none of the bank's risk heuristics based on actual transaction profiling ever went off.Wouldn't that mean that, in practice, being in the porn industry isn't as high-risk as banks / payment processors think it is?And would this not then suggest a gap in the market, for an (ideally vertically-integrated) bank + payment processor + card issuer + KYC provider, who is willing to1. evaluate risk on a customer-by-customer basis (through e.g. continuous dynamic network analysis of transaction flow, with txs annotated with their KYC info) rather than by actuarial categorization; and2. avoid seeking any investment (at any remove) by parties who would insist they avoid these types of customers?

I'm not sure if Bitcoin is the right answer due to the 51% attack vulnerability. And a network of miners where everyone can join in principle sounds pretty yolo, but it seems the be the one of the few organizations that exist outside of government? At least, it does in principle, the fact that the whole crypto industry is a mix of scams and recreation of the actual finance industry isn't helping that case, but a part of it definitely still exists outside of it.We need more digital systems that exist outside of governments. I'm not sure if it's feasible, but stuff like this is egregious.I wonder what our view on all of this is in a 1000 years. People in the future probably look at us in disbelief with how we practiced our ethics.

Humans engaged in tribalistic groupthink committing moral atrocities is a tale as old as time.It is never wise to accept a majority or status quo position reflexively without thoroughly interrogating the ideas held within. A great deal of majority positions are morally reprehensible and ethically indefensible, and that has always been the case throughout human history.Human sacrifices of the innocent were not a ""different culture"", they were barbaric murders that were always wrong. They were also normative in much of the world for much of human history.The values espoused (but not always upheld) by western societies that many of us take for granted today are the exception to the rules throughout human history - rules that promoted needless bloodshed, widespread suffering, and persecution of the innocent.It is not arrogant to assert that loss of innocent human life is reprehensible and the societies that normalize it should be condemned. To assert otherwise isn't simply innocuously defending pluralism, it's defending atrocities.All life is inherently valuable and I will not apologize for asserting that, no matter how many billions of people disagree for tribalistic, persecutory reasons.

However that isn't a free standing view on my part. I acknowledge that the conservatives raise a number of hard hitting points about corrosion of the social fabric, but observe that even jurisdictions with far stricter laws than the US still appear to suffer the same ills (in addition to those caused by the laws themselves).My view is that this is due to modern technology having fundamentally changed the social dynamic. Continually eroding civil liberties in a doomed attempt to regain some imagined ideal of the past strikes me as nothing more than an obscene parallel to the war on drugs.Given that we clearly recognize that certain activities are detrimental to society when flaunted in public surely we could apply the same principle to various forms of expression? It's not much of a leap - you'll already land yourself in trouble if you go around shouting your head off or intimidating people for example. Analogous to alcohol consumption, I'd much prefer a clear distinction between standards for public displays, secluded public business establishments, and private gatherings than the bizarre scenarios that the current obscenity laws inevitably give rise to.

I used Steven as an example if private prosecution, where a private organization can take away your freedom outside of public prosecutors.Steven did similar work to an investigative journalist at a high level, he brought attention to, and fought for a marginalized group. He did it through the court system rather than through publication. Despite doing it legally.I don't see much of a difference. As recent times have shown, much of the legal system(and legal protections) depend on someone enforcing. Without that, there's little difference between the government boot and the corpo boot.

It's perfectly fine to say ""I think porn is generally unhealthy and would suggest people not partake, but I think they ought to be able if they'd like"". It's also reasonable to say ""I think things like porn, alcohol, cigarettes, violence, and/or gambling should be accessible to adults, but they should not be able to advertise in spaces where children are likely to visit (like an online video game store), and stores should check ID to purchase those things, and 'paying via advertising' should not act as a loophole for those ID checks.""

I'd actually hypothesise that if you locked three sets of teenage boys in rooms, one with only porn games, one with only social media and one with only sitcoms, that the first group would likely emerge the healthiest of the three.

Evidence. If you think something is harmful to society, you have a hypothesis. The next step is to test it. Not assume it's true and ban everything.I have seen zero evidence that any of these games are harmful. If I had to hazard a guess, and this is again just a hypothesis, I'd actually suspect that a teenager exposed to porn games is less likely to suffer mental-health issues than one on algorithmic social media or forming intimate connections with chatbots.

Of course, these things don't live in a vacuum; the manufacturers of e.g. pesticides have a vested financial interest in selling their product, because money.

My long-held belief is that there's a certain hubris to saying that you know best for everyone. So I default to letting people do things, since preventing them is exerting power over them. With that framing, you would need evidence that something is harmful if you're going to exert power over other people to prevent them from doing it.

reply

This makes sense. If anybody at any point thinks that something might be bad, it should immediately and permanently be prohibited for everyone. We don't need a mechanism to check this because people are never mistaken or misled, and there is no such thing as a bad actor.Since the principle should always prevail, it applies to people as well. If anybody thinks that another person could do harm in the future, they should be allowed to kill them in order to protect society from harm.A system where the only rule is “every person gets to make the rules for everyone else” isn't the stupidest imaginable thing because

Thing is though, if violent video games caused people to become violent, Columbine wouldn't have been a rare incident.But it's a difficult one. People play video games but for most people it doesn't change their moral compass; it doesn't make them think ripping out people's spines is normal or acceptable. It desensitizes them to a point I suppose.Does porn, porn games or simulated CSAM make people normalize objectification and violence towards people and children? I can't answer that, and I don't know if there's been any studies towards especially CSAM since it's such a taboo. N=1, but 20+ years of porn on occasion hasn't turned me into some rampant sex addict.

Like, the “woman turns into a giant blueberry” one seems to pretty clearly trace back to someone's experience with the scene in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”.And, like, if someone starts out looking at/for breast expansion porn, they're probably going to be exposed to a far bit of lactation porn as well, and I think there's a fair chance that they'll start seeking that out as well? For example.Why would we expect this pattern to not apply in the case of CP/CSAM?

End of page 3, the author does a litterature review and finds that current studies show that exposure to CSAM increases probability of offending for those with predispositions.

reply

If that's the case, then all these studies were observational studies, which lack the ability to infer causality. They can at best hint at directions to pursue for studies that can infer causality.As a concrete example of the way that observational studies can go wrong despite good intentions: It was believed for a long time that paedophiles have lower average IQs than the general population. This was based on the observation that a larger fraction than would be expected of those caught and sentenced for sexual crimes involving children were of low IQ. Of course, a better explanation of this observation is that paedophiles with higher IQs are better at covering their tracks and evading suspicion.

By your logic, CSAM consumers would be ""magically"" unaffected by viewing this porn subcategory.How convienient.

reply

Until genuine evidence is available, either outcome seems plausible. It could be that consuming CSAM pushes people towards committing sex crimes, or it could be that it ""magically"" doesn't, the same way people playing violent video games are ""magically"" unaffected by doing so.ETA: An example of the inability of porn to influence sexual behavior is the plight of gay Western men in the 1950s-1980s. During this time homosexuality was absolutely demonised across essentially all of Western society, so there was ample interest from gay men in ""correcting"" their ""errant"" desires (this is not to say that all gay men felt this way). At the same time, heterosexual porn was widespread and easily available, though admittedly to a lesser extent than it is today. Given these forces at play, if it were possible for a gay man to develop an interest in having sex with women merely by looking at heterosexual porn, it does seem like there would have been large numbers of gay men who successfully ""converted"" to straight men. But AFAIK it is disputed that any such genuine conversion has ever taken place.

The first is that you're banning free expression, and banning free expression is inherently harmful.There's also the displacement theory - with the legal content being much more accessible and regulated to ensure minors aren't involved in production, it displaces illegal content that does harm minors.

And the difficult thing about that is that externalities do exist for some things. Pollution affects everyone, for instance, and those externalities need to be accounted for. It's not a trivial definitional problem to distinguish valid externalities from spurious/invalid claims, unfortunately.

These people are on one end of the authoritarian spectrum. The other are anarchists, usually ancaps in places I frequent, and they are just as wrong because they are ignoring how people in the real world will actually behave. Negative externalities are precisely the thing that they ignore, minimize, or try to redirect your attention by linking you to a 2 hour video which is supposed to address it but doesn't.Well, at least they do generally get out of other people's lives though. But it's a system which doesn't work and when it fails, leads to the rise of authoritarians.

A better example would be to consider that pre-op transgender people, namely MtF, can share the same spaces that were reserved to biological women. For instance in sport. If I'm a woman and now I have to compete with a biological man in MMA because society chose that it's the new normal, yes, I'm going to suffer from it.If society decides that it's fair to feed Tiktok to toddlers who end up having their neurons fried, I'm going to suffer from it as well when they grew up as they won't be able to do their job well. If society decides that it's fair to allow CSAM everywhere, I guess that a few children are going to suffer as it becomes mainstream.We don't live in a vacuum.

I cannot agree with the toddlers example: 1) it's possible it does some damage but as I said, to even consider it, we need proof; 2) even if they are bad at life, it doesn't automatically harm another individual - don't hire incompetents and they won't harm your business. They might harm society in general but society does not IMO have any right to force people to optimize for society's goals. The balance might change if this was true and happened on such a scale that society measurably declined but then I am still of the opinion that we should have mechanisms how a group of people should be able to get together separate themselves from others. We have no right to force the Amish to start using modern tech, even if a few more able bodies would probably be beneficial on some scale. Similarly, if the majority feed TikTok to their toddlers and a minority does not, they should be able and allowed to form their own society with its own rules, as long as everyone participates willingly.

According to your thinking, no one can ""force"" medical faculties to say that now anyone can buy a surgical doctor degree for 10$, that said if you have to get urgent surgery you'll pay for the consequences as the ""doctor"" who'll operate won't be qualified.This is why we need basic rules, norms and constraints that allows us to reach a better optimum than the free-for-all that you recommend. It's also a question of personal values: I value more living in a CSAM-free society, than one where pedos can watch it freely. Amishes value being in a highly religious and low-tech society than giving birth without pain or having air conditioning.I agree that leaving the society should be possible (emigration, for instance, as the Amishes did). But each society has its local optimum, so you'll have to choose with different constraints. You can for instance go to Russia where it's legal to own and watch CSAM, but with other constraints.

Lying is an offensive action by which the liar gains an advantage at someone else's expense.

The problem is actually the slippery slope happened earlier, with advertisers. The slippery slope was advertisers not wanting to advertise on porn sites and adult content. It is the same thing we see with the creation of Algospeak and self-censorship. As the article points out, it is also very hard to accurately classify this information. I mean even on YouTube the other day I got a video in my shorts feed that was flagged for sensitive topic. The video? About a veteran who was wearing a shirt that said ""Do not give in to the war within. End veteran suicide."" Here's the vid, it still has the content warning[0]. What about this video is sensitive? That it mentions the word ""suicide?"" (Twice?) There's not even options in the settings and YouTube definitely knows I'm in my 30's.... How do I even say ""this was improperly flagged?"" We're just letting algorithms shape our culture in a way we clearly don't want. We wouldn't have Algospeak if we wanted it... Sure, covert speech has formed in the past but mostly under duress and the current form allows for a much more rapid iteration and I really don't think that's good for society. It comes with the best intentions, but I guess we all know the old clique, right? The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. As much as it sucks to admit, a lot of ""evil"" is created by ""good"" people trying to do ""good"" things (quotes to let you define good and evil however you want)The reason I point out the argument is we can modify ""Don't like porn?

So then what? Since they really believe what they said, how can you blame them for their actions?You might argue that since they are wrong, their beliefs should be changed.

Historically, my observation is that some of the most evil things ever perpetrated by humans were done in the name of trying to make society better. So I'm pretty hesitant to enforce my views on other people or even attempt to. If they were acting in good faith, this would be sort of like a Black Lives Matter type of approach that is trying to raise public awareness around an issue. But they're not acting in good faith in trying to get society to see their point of view. Instead, they are trying to go after the fulcrums of society and enforce their view using backroom deals. It's a transparent power play, and it's not in good faith: real good faith actors look at both sides of the issue, both the values and the harm, and they try to develop a balanced response. This is not what's happening here.

Porn is just the thin end of the wedge (as was ""violence in video games"" a generation ago) - porn is something society considers as distasteful, so politicians are less likely to go on record as supporting porn.

I don't like the conservative angle which is to be ""proper"" or it's against god, but from the scientific side this stuff is bad.Now I also agree that censorship is bad too and on a moral level this stuff doesn't harm anyone morally.I'm still a staunch 90s liberal, but over time I'm starting to realize that there's an evolutionary reason why conservative values exist. Humans weren't designed to live in a world of only fans where every girl who's slightly hot can gain so much power over hundreds of men.

But we do know that the population issue correlates with so many changes in society, and it's a big freaking deal.Another thing is rising womens power. I'm all for it. It's moral and right to give women equal rights and equal power, but humanity has never encountered such a scenario. It's always the men that lead the hunt and the family and they were the bread winners for millions of years. Were humans evolved to support such changes? Like if we satisfy every moral imperative in our primitive brains and build a utopia but human biology was never meant for utopia is it right?That's the problem. The population is declining. We don't know why. But we do know everything is different.So I know I got off on a huge tangent here. But i feel porn is one of these things. It's right to keep it open and free, but it's causing unexpected side effects. Most of us were not meant to deal with that level of extreme hedonism.

But even if that was true, who's to say that population has to keep growing? There's 8 billion of us, isn't that enough? Housing prices are through the roof and most young people can't even hope to be able to afford a house. Human population has doubled about 4 times in the last 100 years. If it doubles yet again there's going to be 16 billion of us. Do you think the world and humanity can sustain infinite exponential growth? I don't think so. The only reasons to want population growth is because the pension system is a Ponzi scheme, but that's a completely different problem.I also find it interesting that on one hand the argument against porn is, ""porn is bad because it encourages X behavior in real life"", but then another is ""porn is bad because it discourages sex in real life"".

The issue is bigger then that. It's weird though. First for context, when population grows, that growth is compounding usually. There's an acceleration.Now that the population is in freefall, the freefall is also compounding. Like there are structural impacts that will effect most of the asian countries (where this problem will hit first) that will effect them economically.

Games that are pedophilia is very different form games that appeal to potential pedophiles. The first one is not only not allowed on Steam but outright illegal overall.

It's really hard to determine what triggers someone to commit crime.

If it really is an example of a rare false positive, a manual fix for that one specific game is a reasonable thing to seek, without giving the pedos their heyday like most of the comments here suggest.

Do you really think Visa and MasterCard should be making decisions what is acceptable for like everyone?Otherwise any random weirdos from UK or Australia will censor what are you allowed to watch or play in the US.And China can also put pretty good pressure on payment processors too. They'll certainly want many games gone since they are worse than pedos for CCP.

Another way to think of this is 'long tail risk'. Some subset of people out there will develop real life problems from: porn, sex work, alcohol, weed, drugs, gambling, other 'moral' issues. It is difficult to meaningfully address both the median user and the problematic user.See also decrim.

I think many of these slippery slopes are defined in hindsight. What all of these represent are simply struggles for power.

reply

Exhibit A - emotional: the government has outlawed violent crime and wants to outlaw intimidation. Argument “once they outlaw intimidation, next they'll outlaw regular insults, next they'll outlaw criticism”. This is a bad slippery slope argument because (I'm assuming) intimidation should be outlawed. Insults and criticism should not, but are not. If the government votes in evil-gov or you encounter evil-cop, it's as easy for them to harass you for insults and criticism, as it would be had intimidation never been outlawed.Exhibit B - physical: the government wants to give every citizen a brain implant that can be remotely activated to stun them. This would significantly prevent crime. However, it would also be a terrible idea, because now if you get evil-gov or evil-cop, it's significantly easier for them to remotely stun you for non-crime.The key is that in Exhibit A, evil-gov and evil-cop face equal resistance for punishing insults and criticism regardless of whether intimidation is outlawed, because either way, people understand that intimidation should be outlawed and insults and criticism should not. More generally, moving the Overton Window to contain a “good” thing doesn't make it contain a “bad” thing, at least not enough so that the “good” thing isn't worth it. But in Exhibit B, evil-gov and evil-cop face ineffective resistance for stunning people for insults and criticism, because people allowed good-gov and good-cop to give them stun implants for punishing crime; whereas if evil-gov or evil-cop stepped up and said “alright, we're going to give everyone stun implants to punish insults and criticism”, they would face effective resistance.—-Put into perspective: Visa and Mastercard using their Monopoly to effectively prevent payment for depictions of incest and rape, assuming you think that is OK, is Exhibit A. However, Visa and Mastercard having a monopoly in the first place is Exhibit B. My argument is “we should break the Visa and Mastercard monopoly (or popularize crypto) to prevent them from restricting LGBTQ and firearms etc. in the future” (this argument still applies if they're restricting some of that now). A counter-argument is “this will allow incest depictions, hate speech, and moreover actual drug and sex trafficking*, etc.” and my counter is “those things are bad, but are they bad enough to leave us vulnerable to power shifts restricting good content in the future?” I support free speech with a similar argument**.It's an argument that relies on the uncertain future, but nonetheless the change here clearly and significantly decreases the probability of a bad future, because bad-gov or bad-cop must acquire power then revert the monopoly breakup; whereas the emotional example can't even rely on the future, because if bad-gov or bad-cop acquire enough power to cause the bad thing, they would've just as likely acquired enough power had we not avoided causing the good thing.* Also note these things are already exchanged with real money, and breaking up the Visa/Mastercard monopoly won't make them legal nor stop law enforcement from tracking and prosecuting them. The more general argument is that it's better for society to make it hard for law enforcement to prosecute crime then give them the resources to do so, but also make it hard for them to prosecute non-crime; then make it easy for law-enforcement to prosecute crime so they need less resources, but also make it easy for them to prosecute non-crime. The justification is that we spend extra resources and let some crimes avoid prosecution, in exchange for decreased risk of non-crime prosecution now and in the future.** and that speech is mild enough, sans confidential information etc., that it shouldn't be blocked simply to content whoever says it. But even confidential information doesn't warrant e.g. a universal backdoor and filter that could be stolen and exploited by a bad actor.

Money talks, and it's one of the few ways I have to show my opposition. I hope others will do the same. It's sad, because itch is kinda one of the last few places for ""indie"" as a thing with the vibe of indies, at least (I mean they aren't Steam or the other big publishers).  I'm surprised Epic didn't buy them out yet just like they did with Bandcamp.  Probably next on the block.

reply

It strikes me that they had a gun held to their head by a mobster. If itch didn't comply, they'd lose all their revenue, and we'd lose the website in its entirety, which is much more than just smut.Pushing back against the payment processors, rather than itch under duress, would have made money talk in the right direction.

Bitcoin can be used as currency for occasional transactions between individuals. But you don't want your business to depend on it. It doesn't scale, not due to technological reasons, but because of legal issues and customer experience expectation.

Bitcoin adoption is a chicken and egg problem. But my guess is that censoring porn creates a very big incentive for people to start using it.

It's the same thing as a company needing a building for their factory. They decide they don't want to pay rent anymore, they're going to control their own properties they own themselves now. But the business of managing the property now falls to the business to do. So even when companies own their own properties they often end up hiring a property management company to deal the the day to day operations of running a commercial property. Because in the end they don't want to have to worry about their janitorial contracts, handling elevator certifications, landscaping contracts, maintenance techs, etc. They want to focus on producing widgets.Same thing with hosting a digital storefront. Sure one could spend all the time managing servers on your own offices and ensure good uptime and security and what not, or you can just sign up for Shopify or others and they'll manage it all for you. If managing servers and software stacks and digital security isn't your main business competency, why get into it?Most companies won't want to deal the logistics of handling crypto. So they'll often outsource that work, because I'm the end they want to focus on selling widgets not handling payments. For the same kinds of reasons why they'll hire a company to do cash logistics.Do you need to hire payment processor to accept crypto? No. But in the end you will need to do that work though.I'm not the reason why people choose these big centralized services. I'm not that powerful. They choose them because they see value in the services they offer. Not everyone wants to be their own bank.

Porn is a tiny market. It's not worth it losing the payment processors everyone is on to serve porn game buyers.

I agree with this point but I don't agree with the premise. I don't really care about the censorship of porn, but it is a slippery slope to censorship in general. If you give them an inch they will take a mile.I think there is sometimes a business justification of putting your foot in the ground, even if the short term consequences are harsh.

For all of the talk (hype) about how crypto has the potential to avoid the exact type of meddling and manipulation and pressuring we're seeing now, it surprises me that no equivalents to PayPal have really popped up - that best that can be done is apparently something along the lines of what Linux was on the desktop a decade or two ago. Basically, before Valve and others picked up the slack and worked on things your average person actually cares about - notably, gaming and simple(r) to use desktop environments and software stores.Where's the flagship platform for payments that's built on crypto but lets you ignore the technical details, that's trivial to implement as a merchant and is a download away on app stores? If there are a few of those, why would anyone bother with these puritan payment processors?

(Unaffiliated, I hold some pocket money on there not to run a Lightning node myself)The on-chain transaction is just to ""fund"" a channel between two parties. These two parties can then make unlimited trasnfers between each other instantaneously for free. These nodes are organised in a network and can relay payment from other nodes as well. It's a bit like the Internet. You don't need to peer with everybody, you just need a path from A to B.If you and I have a channel funded with 100 sat, we can move these around as many times as we wish, even on behalf of others, but if you need to transfer more than you have on your side, you need to fund the channel with another on-chain transaction.

Itch.io is heavily saturated with anime porn games along with steam to the point I find both difficult to navigate even with nsfw filters turned on. Turning those filters off and it is pretty egregious the volume of it all let alone subject matter. I dont care about porn but the platforms have done a piss poor job for the majority of people who are not looking for porn games but find games like cyberpunk totally acceptable. How can i see cyberpunk but not hentai?This is happening because it was too easy for someone to pull up the home page on said platforms and point to several incest porn games. Using payment processors is not a solution i favor but people cannot find that experience acceptable.On a personal note, i dont want to live in a society that deems it acceptable to have a “no incest” filter for games. That is line for me and not for religion but because I find incest disgusting.

Googling for news, it seems like the story between DLSite and M/V is a push and pull. Many articles turn up that say they have an agreement, then a disagreement, then an agreement again, then a suspension, then they bring it back again etc.My point here is that their relationship with M/V seems to have failed to actually change them, so, the point ""they're powerless to change Japan"" stands.

I used to work for a fintech. As new employee I had coffee with a colleague who explained KYC, AML, and other compliance topics to me. They mentioned that marijuana businesses can't bank their money due to these considerations as it would make banks knowing accomplices to the federal crime of trafficking a controlled substance. This threat is material because cannabis, unlike adult content, is actually illegal, so I don't think it's a substantially similar example to what's mentioned in this thread.

For the better part of a decade feminists have been wildly anti-objectification, not anti-sex. It's an important distinction.For example, most modern feminists are pro sex-work, but only under conditions that guarantee safety, autonomy, and health care for the sex workers. That's very different from how most sex work is done today. So a modern feminist might say that we should be doing more to protect the sex workers who are held in bondage by a pimp, and forced to walk the streets while simultaneously arguing in favor of well regulated, protected brothels or private sex work.

Compare, for example, Sex and the City, where 4 women were regularly engaged in a variety of sexual encounters and say, background dancers in a music video or advert that exist to appeal as objects to a male audience.

reply

In a different context I might be more sympathetic to this specific formulation of the concept since it's not always clear how much agency the background dancers in a music video or advert have. However, on the original topic of video games, the notion of ""character agency"" is rather pernicious.

reply

In Kotor 2, there's a character called ""The Handmaiden"", who will join your party if the player character is a male. She talks at great length about her situation and the decisions the player should make. She's depicted as a chaste, virginal religious character. But one of the very first things you can do with her when she joins your party is spar with her. And she strips into black lingerie to do so. Then she stays in black lingerie on your ship while you go and do other stuff.She's clearly there as an object for the audience to drool over. It's given a very surface level justification (""we always spar with only our bodies""), but that justification is provided the instant before the player sees her in her undies. (Which, it's important to note, aren't like modest undergarments one might expect from a religious figure like this, but are specifically sexy underwear.)Compare this to another Star Wars game, Jedi: Fallen Order, where the Night Sister Mirrin can becomes romantically involved with the player character. She has a well developed culture, and is given space to articulate her personality, choices, and opinions in a cogent way. She can be a romantic interest without being an object. She is as complex as all the other characters, and we don't see her positioned in sexy lingerie suddenly out of the blue.I can come up with other examples if those aren't illustrative.

What I'm disputing is any application of objectification theory to media analysis wherein there are no actual agents involved. Neither The Handmaiden nor Night Sister Mirrin ever possessed any agency, nor were they deprived of it. There is simply no moral valence in how one treats or regards them.The demand here is that they be treated as if they possessed agency. I see no reason or obligation to do so.

The only solution is you download stuff and it remains runnable and usable without any connection or authorisation to any service. The distribution of it can remain wherever and you can go via a side channel if you want.

I don't get this. Let's say it openly: what's the problem with sex and nudity in games?

Or not enough to pull from the stores, anyway?What I don't care about are the finer points of whether this technically counts as ""censorship"", because in pratice it is. There SHOULD be a place to buy games which depict nudity and sex. The quality of those games is not and should not be the focus of conversation (e.g. ""they are AI slop"" or ""badly made"", etc), because that's NOT what bothers the people doing the censorship -- they'd also be against the best, AAA made, high quality games with sex and nudity.Again, I ask: what is wrong with sex and nudity in games, that makes it worse than gore, violence and war? Why cannot whatever age-restriction measures taken for the purchase of violent games be also applied to sex games?Finally: we all know they are not going to stop at this, right?

I don't buy the ""multiple countries' cultures"" excuse because this seems to be spearheaded by conservative groups from the Christian anglosphere, the same culture that produces these same games to begin with; and also: other cultures forbid depictions of explicit violence, alcohol, women without their heads covered or publicly disagreeing with their husbands, etc. I don't see a push to ban games which depict alcohol consumption or independent women, do you?Let's call a spade a spade, and recognize this for what it is.Also: there's absolutely nothing wrong with erotica in games. Just place it behind the same safety checks as violent games. If those don't work, then they also don't work for violent games, in which case: shall we ban all games with violence?

Hi, we're Shraman and Shreyas Kar, brothers and founders of Golpo: the most powerful AI video generator for explainer videos. Golpo turns your documents, internal workflows (PDFs, Jira boards, GitHub repos, Google Calendars, etc.) into fully produced, customizable explainer videos through our platform or API in any language. Our videos can be used for anything from creating complex workflows, product demos, technical papers, or even stories starring your baby cousin and Captain Underpants in Bengali.

Ask: Try it: video.golpoai.com

Reach out: If you want to use our API or generate videos at scale, email us at founders@golpoai.com. We'd love to chat.

Here is a video made by Golpo explaining Golpo.

https://youtu.be/3jyBks8QxQo







Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc…

But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. A video can change someone's mind in a way almost no other medium can.

Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. If you need to actually communicate something, no AI video tool would be useful for you.

We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents.

Golpo is built specifically for use cases on explaining, learning, and reporting, and feels authentic and engaging in a way no other AI video generator does.

After Golpo generates a video, you can fully customize its animations frame by frame. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes

We are both brothers and Stanford CS students and have been building together our entire lives.

Scientists have discovered a dinosaur that might have chirped like a bird, a finding that suggests the evolutionary origins of birdsong may be far more ancient than we previously thought.

In a paper published last week in the journal PeerJ, an international team of researchers describes a 163-million-year-old fossil found in northeastern China's Hebei Province. The fossil dinosaur, which they've dubbed Pulaosaurus qinglong, measures just 28 inches (72 centimeters) and is largely complete, giving researchers an unusually detailed look at its anatomy, including its surprisingly birdlike throat.

“Even when you have a dinosaur skeleton preserved, you don't always have these isolated bones preserved with other skull elements,” Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and an author of the paper, told The New York Times. “They're very thin bones, very delicate and hard to preserve.”

In vertebrates, the vocal organs protect the airway and can produce sounds, including basic noises like hisses, groans, and grunts. In most living reptiles, these structures are made of cartilage and are relatively simple. Birds, however, have delicate, bony, flexible vocal organs that can make more complicated and diverse sounds.

Pulaosuarus' throat seems somewhere between the two. Its vocal structures appear to be similar to that of another dinosaur, Pinacosaurus, a kind of ankylosaur with a large, bony larynx that may have been flexible enough to produce birdlike chirps and tweets, the researchers told the Times.

The researchers believe that Pulaosaurus lived during the late Jurassic period and belonged to the same group of creatures that would later give rise to “duck-billed” dinosaurs like hadrosaurs. But Pulaosaurus and Pinacosaurus are separated by millions of years of evolution, and neither belong to the group of dinosaurs that eventually produced birds. While it's possible they developed their vocal features independently, the presence of similar structures in such distinct species indicates that dinosaurs' ancient ancestors may have been pretty chirpy.

That means the origins of birdsong could lie in creatures that lived more than 230 million years ago, but it remains a mystery as to how or when modern birds' voice box, called the syrinx, evolved—or if any dinosaur shared their incredible vocal prowess.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The End of Work as We Know It","https://gizmodo.com/the-end-of-work-as-we-know-it-2000635294","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:19:04 GMT","

For centuries, work has defined us. It has given us identity, purpose, and status in society. But what happens when work, our source of income, itself begins to disappear? Not because of war, depression, or outsourcing, but because of algorithms. What does it mean to work in an AI-driven economy? I spent this month of July interviewing several experts from diverse corners of the labor landscape. Through these conversations, a complex and often contradictory picture emerges, one filled with both promise and peril, efficiency and exploitation, displacement and dignity.

From the C-suite, the AI revolution is viewed with a mixture of excitement and urgency. Elijah Clark, a consultant who advises companies on AI implementation, is blunt about the bottom line. “CEOs are extremely excited about the opportunities that AI brings,” he says. “As a CEO myself, I can tell you, I'm extremely excited about it. I've laid off employees myself because of AI. AI doesn't go on strike. It doesn't ask for a pay raise. These things that you don't have to deal with as a CEO.”

This unvarnished perspective reveals a fundamental truth about the corporate embrace of AI: it is, at its core, a quest for efficiency and profitability. And in this quest, human labor is often seen as a liability, an obstacle to be overcome. Clark recalls firing 27 out of 30 student workers in a sales enablement team he was leading. “We can get done in less than a day, less than an hour, what they were taking a week to produce,” he explains. “In the area of efficiency, it made more sense to get rid of people.”

Peter Miscovich, JLL's Global Future of Work Leader, sees AI as an “accelerant of a trend that was underway for the last 40, 50 years.” He describes a “decoupling” of headcount from real estate and revenue, a trend that is now being supercharged by AI. “Today, 20% of the Fortune 500 in 2025 has less headcount than they had in 2015,” he notes.

But Miscovich also paints a picture of a future where the physical workplace is not obsolete but transformed. He envisions “experiential workplaces” that are “highly amenitized” and “highly desirable,” like a “boutique hotel.” In these “Lego-ized” offices, with their movable walls and plug-and-play technology, the goal is to create a “magnet” for talent. “You can whip the children, or you can give the children candy,” he says. “And, you know, people respond better to the candy than to the whipping.”

Yet, even in this vision of a more pleasant workplace, the specter of displacement looms large. Miscovich acknowledges that companies are planning for a future where headcount could be “reduced by 40%.” And Clark is even more direct. “A lot of CEOs are saying that, knowing that they're going to come up in the next six months to a year and start laying people off,” he says. “They're looking for ways to save money at every single company that exists.”

While executives and consultants talk of efficiency and experience, a very different story is being told by those on the front lines of the AI economy. Adrienne Williams, a former Amazon delivery driver and warehouse worker, offers a starkly different perspective. “It's a new era in like forced labor,” she says. “It's not slavery, because slavery is different. You can't move around, but it is forced labor.”

Williams, a research fellow at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR) that focuses on examining the social and ethical impact of AI, is referring to the invisible work that we all do to train AI systems every time we use our phones, browse social media, or shop online. “You're already training AI,” she explains. “And so as they're taking jobs away, if we just had the ability to understand who was taking our data, how it was being used and the revenue it was making, we should have some sovereignty over that.”

This “invisible work” is made visible in the stories of gig workers like Krystal Kauffman, who has been working on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform since 2015. She has witnessed firsthand the shift from a diverse range of tasks to a near-exclusive focus on “data labeling, data annotation, things like that.” This work, she explains, is the human labor that powers the AI boom. “Human labor is absolutely powering the AI boom,” she says. “And I think one thing that a lot of people say is, ‘teach AI to think,' but it's actually, at the end of the day, it's not thinking. It's recognizing patterns.”

The conditions for this hidden workforce are often exploitative. Kauffman, who is also a research fellow at DAIR, describes how workers are “hidden,” “underpaid,” and denied basic benefits. She also speaks of the psychological toll of content moderation, a common form of AI-related work. “We talked to somebody who was moderating video content of a war in which his family was involved in a genocide, and he saw his own cousin through annotating data,” she recalls. “And then he was told to get over it and get back to work.”

Williams, who has worked in both warehouses and classrooms, has seen the harmful effects of AI in a variety of settings. In schools, she says, AI-driven educational tools are creating a “very carceral” environment where children are suffering from “migraines, back pain, neck pain.” In warehouses, workers are “ruining their hands, getting tendonitis so bad they can't move them,” and pregnant women are being fired for needing “modified duties.” “I've talked to women who have lost their babies because Amazon refused to give them modified duties,” she says.

In the face of this technological onslaught, there are those who are fighting to preserve the dignity of human labor. Ai-jen Poo, president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, is a leading voice in this movement. She champions “care work”—the work of nurturing children, supporting people with disabilities, and caring for older adults—as a prime example of the kind of “human-anchored” work that technology cannot easily replace.

“That work of enabling potential and supporting dignity and agency for other human beings is at its heart human work,” she says. “Now, what I think needs to happen is that technology should be leveraged to support quality of work and quality of life as the fundamental goals, as opposed to displacing human workers.”

Poo argues for a fundamental rethinking of our economic priorities. “I would create a whole new foundation of safety net that workers could expect,” she says, “that they could have access to basic human needs like health care, paid time off, paid leave, affordable child care, affordable long-term care. I would raise the minimum wage so that at least people who are working are earning a wage that can allow them to pay the bills.”

For the care workers Poo represents, their work is more than just a job; it's a “calling.” “The median income for a home care worker is $22,000 per year,” she notes. “And people in our membership have done this work for three decades. They see it as a calling, and what they would really like is for these jobs to offer the kind of economic security and dignity that they deserve.”

The conversations with these specialists reveal a stark choice, a fork in the road for the future of work. On the one hand, there is the path of unchecked technological determinism, where AI is used to maximize profits, displace workers, and deepen existing inequalities. Adrienne Williams warns that AI has the potential to “exacerbate all these problems we already have,” particularly for “poor people across the board.”

On the other hand, there is the possibility of a more democratic and humane future, one where technology is harnessed to serve human needs and values. Ai-jen Poo believes that we can “democratize” AI by giving “working-class people the ability to shape these tools and to have a voice.” She points to the work of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which is “building our own tools” to empower care workers.

Krystal Kauffman also sees hope in the growing movement of worker organizations. “The company wants to keep this group at the bottom,” she says of gig workers, “but I think what we're seeing is that group saying ‘no more, we exist,' and starting to push back.”

Ultimately, the question of the purpose of work in an AI-driven economy is a question of values. Is the purpose of our economy to generate wealth for a few, or to create a society where everyone has the opportunity to live a dignified and meaningful life?

Clark is clear that from the CEO's perspective, the “humanness inside of the whole thing is not happening.” The focus is on “growth and that's maintaining the business and efficiency and profit.” But for Ai-jen Poo, the meaning of work is something much deeper. “Work should be about a way that people feel a sense of pride in their contributions to their families, their communities and to society as a whole,” she says. “Feel a sense of belonging and have recognition for their contribution and feel like they have agency over their future.”

The question is not just whether machines will do what we do, but whether they will unmake who we are.

The warning signs are everywhere: companies building systems not to empower workers but to erase them, workers internalizing the message that their skills, their labor and even their humanity are replaceable, and an economy barreling ahead with no plan for how to absorb the shock when work stops being the thing that binds us together.

It is not inevitable that this ends badly. There are choices to be made: to build laws that actually have teeth, to create safety nets strong enough to handle mass change, to treat data labor as labor, and to finally value work that cannot be automated, the work of caring for each other and our communities.

But we do not have much time. As Clark told me bluntly: “I am hired by CEOs to figure out how to use AI to cut jobs. Not in ten years. Right now.”

The real question is no longer whether AI will change work. It is whether we will let it change what it means to be human.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","‘Alien: Earth' Crashes Into Comic-Con With a Massive Outdoor Experience","https://gizmodo.com/alien-earth-activation-fx-sdcc-2025-2000634479","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 01:15:38 GMT","

The USCSS Maginot, a Weyland Yutani research vessel, crashed into the large lawn next to Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con this weekend. Onlookers remarked they hoped there was nothing dangerous on board, as containers had spilled all over the surrounding area.

That's both the tease for a very cool activation put together by FX for its new show, Alien: Earth, as well as the setup for Alien: Earth itself. The show, which debuts August 12, centers on a crashed ship and all the horrors that it contains. One of them is a xenomorph, everyone's favorite killer alien with acid for blood. But the xeno isn't the only creature on the Maginot. At least on the show. At Comic-Con, it was the main one, but there were teases of others.

io9 was lucky enough to walk through the Alien Earth activation during the daytime of the con, with the understanding this was just half the experience. You could also come back in the evening, and what was once light, bright, and open becomes dark, dim, and scary. It's a whole other, more terrifying experience.

But even in the daylight, the amount of work and detail that's been put into this activation is impressive. You enter through an almost military installation surrounding the crashed ship. Containers with those classic Alien eggs are scattered about, as well as some new, odd, yellow eggs. You enter the MUTHUR computer room, just like out of the original film, and traverse two long hallways, both of which have been torn to pieces by… something. Finally, you enter a massive research facility, which offers a hint of just how many different species had been collected by the ship, only to, in the end, finally be greeted by the Xeno itself. Luckily, we survived. Here's a video of the experience.

And here are a few photos.

If you're at Comic-Con, the Alien: Earth exhibition is on the Hilton Bayfront Lawn and is open Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the one experience and then 4:30 to 10 p.m. for the “Code Red” evening experience. The daytime experience will also be open Sunday from 11 a.m. to a.m.-3 p.m.

Alien: Earth is on FX August 12, and we'll have more soon.

Vampires, witches, and demons, beware: the Talamasca, a secret group that fans of Interview With the Vampire will already have an inkling about, has you under surveillance. But can the watchers themselves be trusted? The first teaser trailer for Talamasca: The Secret Order, AMC's latest show in its Anne Rice Immortal Universe, suggests that even those on the inside should definitely watch their backs.

The trailer heavily features a very blonde Elizabeth McGovern doing her best to recruit Nicholas Denton's character (who has a rare talent, we're told) into the group.

You also get a glimpse of guest star Jason Schwartzman having what appears to be an absolute blast playing a vampire—as well as Eric Bogosian, reprising his fan-favorite journalist character Daniel Molloy from Interview With the Vampire.

The rest of the cast includes William Fichtner, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, and Celine Buckens; the co-showrunners are John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) and Mark Lafferty (Halt and Catch Fire).

Talamasca: The Secret Order hits AMC October 26.

In 2021, researchers in Antarctica noticed giant cracks developing on the Brunt Ice Shelf, an enormous stretch of ice on the continent's northwestern corner. Two years later, the fracture grew so large that a gigantic iceberg almost twice the size of New York City broke free in a process called calving, sending scientists scrambling to investigate the icy chunk, which they named iceberg A-81.

A team of researchers affiliated with the British Antarctic Survey sought to understand the forces driving this “crack behavior” in the huge ice shelf. By devising a mathematical model to account for natural forces affecting ice shelves, the researchers found that iceberg A-81—and most other icebergs, for that matter—likely snapped off from tidal forces buffeting the ice shelves in spring, when the currents are strongest. 

The paper, published in Nature Communications on July 24, supports common-sense assumptions about environmental forces playing a major role in driving calving events, but the proposed model could also improve prediction models for calving events, a historically challenging task.

“Understanding what controls the timing of these events is crucial, because calving not only affects the shape and melt rate of ice shelves but also their long-term stability,” said study lead author Oliver Marsh, in a statement. “It's incredibly exciting to uncover a link between something as predictable as the tides and the dramatic, sudden process of iceberg calving.” 

For the paper, Marsh and his colleagues first devised a mathematical model to calculate the threshold for crack behavior in the ice shelves using ocean tides or wind patterns as potential stressors. Next, they tested their predictions against GPS and radar data, paying close attention to the subtle movements and stresses that appeared within the ice shelf over time. They noticed that the fractures tended to grow most in spring, which happens to be when tides are strongest.

The model, however, is a simplified interpretation of real-life dynamics in Antarctica, the study authors admitted, and it better explains smaller, gradual changes in crack behavior. This means that more dramatic events—like extreme temperatures from climate change—will cause even bigger rifts in the ice. “Tides and wind are key to the timing of small individual rift growth events here,” the authors wrote in the paper, “but it is notable that an iceberg collision in 2021 caused more substantial rift growth in a single event than throughout 2020.”

Nevertheless, the study marks a crucial step in modeling the role of environmental drivers in calving events, which the authors argue will subsequently inform our models of iceberg calving under such extreme atmospheric or ocean conditions. Large icebergs also influence ocean circulation and local ecosystems, so the new model could serve as a useful tool for structuring research projects in Antarctica, Marsh explained. 

“Icebergs like A-81 can be thousands of square kilometers in size and account for roughly half of all ice lost from Antarctica each year,” Marsh said. “This kind of insight brings us closer to forecasting major ice loss events and their impact on sea level with far greater precision.”

Your network security is only as strong as its weakest link.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Popular bleach brand Clorox filed a case against Cognizant, its IT provider, after the company discovered that the latter had simply given away access credentials to hackers posing as employees. According to an NBC News Report, this breach allowed Scattered Spider, a hacking group that targets company service desks, to infect Clorox with ransomware in August 2023. This IT support gaffe allegedly resulted in around $380 million worth of damage and disruption for Clorox.

Cognizant manages Clorox's internal networks, and employees who have issues with their passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and VPNs must coordinate with the IT provider to regain access to their system. However, Clorox alleges that the Cognizant Service Desk gave access passwords without verifying the identity of the caller. Such action would contradict the policies that have been set in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access, which Ars Technica says include an internal verification and self-reset password tool. In case the user does not have access to this, Cognizant must check their identity by asking for their manager's name and their username. This would reset their password, but it will also email the employee and their supervisor to help ensure some level of security.

Unfortunately, this did not happen in several instances. Instead, Cognizant staff simply handed over the passwords without confirming the identity of the caller, it is claimed. One partial call transcript provides evidence of this, with the alleged hacker telling the Cognizant employee, “I don't have a password, so I can't connect.” They then replied without hesitation, “Oh, ok. Ok. So, let me provide the password to you, okay?”

Assuming the identity of authorized personnel is one of the most basic social engineering attacks, which is why many IT companies deploy several measures against it. However, it seems that Cognizant's employees were too trusting and violated protocol, potentially leading to millions of dollars in losses for Clorox. This goes to show that no matter how robust and sophisticated your cybersecurity is, it can always be breached at its weakest point.

“Cognizant was not duped by any elaborate ploy or sophisticated hacking techniques,” the lawsuit asserts. “The cybercriminal just called the Cognizant Service Desk, asked for credentials to access Clorox's network, and Cognizant handed the credentials right over.”

On top of layoffs and uncertainty for future nodes.

Intel's transformation under CEO Lip-Bu Tan is entering a ruthless new phase. The company, which only days ago revealed $2.9 billion in quarterly losses and the slashing of 15% of its workforce (something it already planned since last year), is now spinning off its Network and Edge Group (NEX) as a standalone business. It's the latest move in a ""sweeping effort"" to streamline Intel's core operations while divesting anything that doesn't fit Tan's new, AI-first strategy.

The plan, confirmed through a customer memo first reported by CRN and later corroborated by The Register, outlines Intel's intention to find strategic investors for NEX. Intel will remain an “anchor investor,” much like it did with Altera—the programmable logic division it acquired in 2015 and partially sold off earlier this year. The NEX business, which covers networking silicon, Ethernet, and communications infrastructure, will now chart its own course. “Backed by Intel, this new, independent company will be positioned to accelerate its customer-facing strategy and product roadmap by innovating faster and investing in new offerings,” said Sachin Katti, the group's chief and Intel's current AI strategy lead.

For Tan, the NEX spin-off is emblematic of a broader philosophy shift: Intel is exiting everything that's not essential to its x86 and AI ambitions. During its Q2 earnings call, Tan described Intel as being “overextended and inefficient,” citing a workforce reduction to 75,000 employees—a drop of over 30,000 from early 2025—and a pivot away from its once all-consuming foundry expansion plans. Even Intel's crown jewel, its process technology roadmap, is on the chopping block. Tan warned that Intel's next-generation 14A (1.4nm-class) node could be canceled entirely if the company fails to secure a major external customer, effectively surrendering the cutting-edge process race to TSMC and Samsung.



Intel's core CPU roadmap remains on track, at least for now. Panther Lake, built on the 18A node, is still planned for late 2025 with a heavy emphasis on AI performance and reintroducing Hyper-Threading to P-cores. On the server side, Granite Rapids is progressing, but AMD's EPYC dominance continues to challenge Intel's position in hyperscale workloads. With the NEX division spun out, Intel hopes to tighten its focus on these critical markets while cutting off segments that dilute margins.

The parallels to Altera's spin-off are impossible to ignore. Like Altera, which Intel sold a 51% stake in to Silver Lake earlier this year, NEX could thrive as an independent entity free from Intel's corporate bureaucracy. But the timing of the move raises questions about Intel's ability to stabilize its finances while keeping pace with rivals in both AI and semiconductor technology. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has already admitted to having fallen way behind in a previous memo as well.

To no one's surprise, Intel stock already took an 8% hit following its earnings report, and the news of the NEX spin-off underscores just how aggressively Tan is restructuring the company. Whether these bold moves will pay off depends on Intel's ability to execute on its AI roadmap, deliver competitive x86 products, and—perhaps most critically—find the partners it needs to keep its process technology ambitions alive.

Say goodbye to EufyMake 3D printers—for now, at least.

It's safe to say the 3D printing landscape has changed significantly from year to year, with many companies coming and going. A solid few have managed to stick around with notable success but today, however, it looks like one more might be backing down as Anker is reportedly pulling away from the 3D printer market. This information comes to us from an interview with Anker spokesperson Brett White shared by The Verge.

Anker has sold 3D printers under the name EufyMake for a while, with the AnkerMake M5 and AnkerMake M5C standing out as their flagship printers. These devices are no longer available, as well as a few critical replacement parts and accessories. Shortages, according to White, are due to supply issues that have made it impossible for Anker to reliably source the critical components they need.

While the two printers have been removed from the EufyMake website, you can still find a UV printer available. This is way different from your standard FDM 3D printer. This printer can print onto surfaces like textiles or wood and was recently part of the most successful Kickstarter campaign ever. The components that Anker is unable to source seems, at the moment, isolated to their FDM devices.

White confirmed that the AnkerMake M5 and AnkerMake M5C will no longer be made available for sale on an indefinite basis. It's possible that sales may resume in the future if components are more readily available. However, it's just as possible that Anker will no longer support these devices or create new models in the future.

White did assure that some accessories will remain available to customers but aren't listed for the public, so they can't be found on the website. Thus, customers need to reach out to EufyMake support (support@eufymake.com) to inquire about replacement components. It is also important to note that the availability of hotends and extruders for the M5C in particular are a hot issue, and these pieces may not be available even through support.

The annual festival brings together science, YouTube and little mayhem.

Open Sauce is a California festival that brings together crazy inventors, makers of every sort, and 150 nerdy YouTubers for a weekend of hands-on exhibits, live demos, and community connection. Founded by YouTuber William Osman, the event is like a science fair for grown-ups, with over 500 projects on display, from combat robotics to 3D printed musical instruments.

The YouTube element sets Open Sauce apart from other festivals. YouTube creators were invited to host panels and presentations on a number of topics, like 3D printing, science education, animation, prototyping inventions, rocketry, and much more. They also shared strategies for becoming a successful YouTuber. When they weren't on the stage, fan favorite creators could be spotted touring the exhibits and giving autographs. Presentations were live-streamed for a Virtual Open Sauce experience and recorded for on-demand playback through Sauce+, a streaming service dedicated to Open Sauce creators.

I had a chance to sit down with founder William Osman, a well known YouTuber and engineer to ask him why he started the festival. “I did it for the community,"" he said, “YouTube in the early days was a bunch of people who had a weird hobby, who would get together and collaborate making videos.”



He told me he wanted to bring back that earlier sense of community, and give nerds like himself a place where everyone could show up, hang out, and share their projects and “unhinged inventions.” He also said that Open Sauce is a place for makers to go crazy with their projects without worrying about how polished and professional the results might be. Osman feels that Open Source shows people, especially kids, that science and engineering are accessible and fun.

“It turns out that most people aren't actually really good at science and engineering,” he said. “They're pretty bad at it, and you just keep making mistakes over and over again until you make something more. And so when people come to Open Sauce, what I want them to see is that process, the real engineering process. I want them to look at what people have done and feel like I could do that myself, and come to the realization that it's not about being perfect, but it's about trying things until it works.”

Osman said that YouTube is an important element for the maker community as an outlet for sharing their creations. In the real world, many people do not have access to a community of like-minded creators like what they can find online.

“YouTube is a very important part of inspiring the next generation of engineers because it's the easiest place to show off fun, interesting engineering. And that's why we have 150 YouTubers at the Open Sauce to just communicate STEM and science and creativity out loud, online.”

I spent the whole weekend seeking out 3D printing makers and the projects they brought to Open Sauce. Several well-known 3D printing YouTubers were at the event, such as CNC Kitchen's Stefan Hermann, Made with Layer's Thomas Sanladerer and Joel Telling, the 3D Printing Nerd. I found Telling at the Elegoo booth checking out a set of mechanical cosplay wings printed in PETG by fellow creator Willow Creative. Willow was unable to attend the show, but she lent her wings, made on a Centauri Carbon and Orange Storm Giga, to Elegoo to show off. The amazing wings are lit with addressable 3 mm LED strips and powered by batteries worn on a backpack.



Elegoo also brought several 3D printed games for visitor to play, as well as tiny open source dancing robots, based on the OTTO robot design and run on ESP32-S3 chips. The shells were printed on the Centauri Carbon.



Elegoo also brought its latest 3D printers to the show, such as the Centauri Carbon and the yet to be released Jupiter 2, a 16K resin printer with a 14-inch LCD screen. Disclaimer

Full disclosure: Elegoo sponsored my travel to San Francisco.

Some projects were so well done, you couldn't even tell right away that they included 3D printing, like this “world's largest laptop” by No Bitrate's Alex Corea. The laptop is a massive 500% copy of a 16-inch Alienware X16 gaming laptop, with a fully functional trackpad, wireless mouse, and 77-inch screen. The light-up keys are each four inches wide, and the not-so-portable device weighs in at 370 pounds. It's about the size of a dining room table.



Some 3D printed projects were literal works of art, like this dragon skeleton made by YouTuber Bobby Duke Arts using a hand held 3D pen then sanded down with a Dremel tool. The dragon was on display in the Creator Museum, along with other projects created by featured YouTubers.



On the complete opposite end of the spectrum was Rob Cockerham's project, titled “3D print your name in 38 seconds”. I have to admit, my eyes lit up when I saw he was using my first 3D printer, a stock 2016 Creality CR10. Cockerham used a special script to print any name in, you guessed it, about 38 seconds. I gave him my twitter handle, which took more like 46 seconds. Cockerham said he chose to bring this project because demonstrating 3D printing normally takes way too long.

I've seen 3D printed guitars, violins and drums, but this was the first time I've seen a 3D printed “brass” instrument. Ben Heath and his dad brought several bugles, a natural horn (the precursor of the French horn) and a trombone for people to experience. Visitors to the booth could play one of the 3D printed buisines (a long straight horn from medieval times) using a printed mouthpiece they could keep. The horns were all printed in segments on a Creality Ender 3 using PLA, then glued together and sealed with epoxy to make them airtight. They actually sounded very good, especially when Heath demonstrated them using a standard metal mouthpiece.



One of the most intriguing booths was run by a local branch of the non-profit Precious Plastic, a worldwide, open source community of plastic recyclers. The group showed how plastic can be shredded, melted down and injection molded into products that could be sold. They demonstrated their technique by making Open Sauce coasters, using a mold that was carved with a CNC machine. Though the booth was recycling bottle caps, the method could be used to recycle 3D printer scraps, like PLA poop from multicolor machines.



Several of the exhibitors were showing off projects to launch businesses, like Andrew Swaim with his Kit of Plants Kickstarter. His faux plants are a mix of handcrafted fire-resistant paper and 3D printed parts. He originally made the plants to decorate his camper (also on display as a mobile maker studio).

FIFA has launched a stinging rebuke of FIFPro, world players' union, accusing the organisation of 'grandstanding', 'blackmail' and 'operating in opacity' over their financial accounts. 

The remarkable statement from the sport's top governing body indicted FIFPro for its 'series of personal and disrespectful attacks' and claimed its criticisms of FIFA suggest their leadership 'does not really care about the players'. 

It marks a deterioration in relations between the two bodies that have been at odds amid the ever increasing football calendar and issues over player welfare. 

'FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles - which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests,' said a FIFA spokesman. 

'The global football community deserves better. Players deserve better.' 

Ahead of the final of the competition, FIFA held a meeting to address concerns over player welfare and a minimum three-week off-season break was agreed. However, it is understood than no FIFPro representatives were invited.

FIFA insist that the measures agreed at the gathering, which also included a mandatory minimum 72 hours of rest between matches, prove their seriousness to address concerns and 'go beyond what FIFPRO has been pretending to be asking for'. 

'Instead of welcoming these unprecedented announcements that benefit players all around the world, FIFPRO has responded with a series of personal and disrespectful attacks,' A FIFA spokesman continued.

'This approach reveals a lot about FIFPRO priorities. It suggests that their leadership does not really care about the players, but rather about internal political fights and their image. 

'FIFA's proposed reforms are about impacting genuine change to support players and are far more important than preserving FIFPRO's perceived image.

'FIFPRO, regrettably, has consistently refused to engage constructively in these efforts. Instead of contributing meaningfully, they have opted for theatrical denunciations, prioritising media headlines over measurable progress for the players they claim to represent.'

FIFA's lambast of the organisation which represents 66,000 men's and women's players around the world, followed claims by Alex Phillips, the general secretary of FIFPro, that stars are worried about potential backlash from clubs and governing bodies. 

FIFPro believes that FIFA has adopted an 'autocratic' approach to its governance under president Gianni Infantino and accused the body of ignoring players' needs. 

'It is unacceptable for an organisation that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players,' said FIFPro following a meeting of 58 player unions in Amsterdam.

'One clear example of this disconnect was the recent Club World Cup, celebrated by president Infantino despite being held under conditions that were extreme and inappropriate for any human being, demonstrating a troubling insensitivity to human rights, even when it concerns elite athletes.' 

Players have raised concerns about their lack of rest, caused by the number of matches they are required to play, which has only increased with the introduction of the revamped Club World Cup this summer. 

Chelsea were crowned winners of the tournament on July 13 after beating Paris Saint-Germain in a final which took place just 35 days before the start of their Premier League campaign. 

Earlier this month, FIFPro president Sergio Marchi accused FIFA of choosing to 'continue increasing its income at the expense of the players' bodies and health', likened its approach to the 'bread and circuses' tactics used by Emperor Nero in ancient Rome and warned there could be no repeat of playing matches in such extreme heat at next summer's World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. 

In their response, FIFA cited 'the introduction of five substitutions' and 'concussion substitutes' among other 'wide-ranging measures' it claims has better supported players, insisting these to be more substantive that anything achieved by FIFPro. 

'These are not vague promises or grandstanding but are real and tangible actions,' added the FIFA spokesman. 

'As FIFPRO is interested in addressing matters such as good governance, maybe they would want to consider publishing their own statutes and releasing transparent annual accounts, to ensure that what is being preached is also being practiced. 

'Let us be clear: you cannot preach transparency while operating in opacity. The reality is this: FIFA remains firmly committed to placing players at the core of football's future, not just in words, but through concrete regulation and reform. 

'FIFA invites all genuine representatives of players to join us in that work - not by attacking from the sidelines, but by participating in transparent, solution-focused dialogue. 

'Therefore, FIFA invites FIFPRO to return to the negotiating table, once they have stopped their blackmail and withdrawn their complaints, and once they have published their statutes, their full financial reports (including all their sources of income, the detailed intellectual property rights of the players they claim to own, and the funding one of their regional divisions receives from some football organisations), and the full list of individual members they claim to represent.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Real Madrid deemed the new Club World Cup in the United States extremely important. They wanted it to be treated as seriously as the Champions League.

Although the end result was not in Madrid's favor, it was worth a try.

Madrid even paid Liverpool 10 million euros to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month early, and the Englishman lived up to expectations.

But for the players, the tournament was an additional burden after an already rigorous season. They were more fatigued and had less time for rest and vacation. A feud even broke out with Javier Tebas over the same issue.

Understandably, Los Blancos had to make it up to the players. And according to Marca, the club paid a bonus of 280,000 euros to each player for participating in the tournament.

According to the report, Real Madrid bagged more than 80 million euros from the tournament. The amount is significant, especially considering how few matches Madrid had to play and the fact that they did not even reach the final.

Given that the earnings came from the players' hard work, it was only fair to reward them. The bonus of 280,000 euros was negotiated by the Real Madrid captains. The breakdown includes 50,000 euros for advancing from the group stage, 80,000 for the Round of 16, and 150,000 for reaching the semifinals.

The massive earnings from such a short tournament could be one of the key reasons Real Madrid support holding the Club World Cup every two years instead of the current four-year cycle.

Participation in the tournament cut the players' vacation to just 24 days, significantly shorter than the usual break of over a month.

The upcoming season is going to be excruciatingly demanding for all the players. They will have to perform better, deliver stronger results than last season, and win more trophies to make up for last season's drought.

With less than a year to go until the 2026 World Cup, political tensions and U.S. policy threaten to pose problems as Canada, the United States and Mexico prepare to co-host the tournament.

Next year's FIFA World Cup will be the biggest ever, with the three countries hosting a record 48 teams. Between June 11 and July 19, they will play 104 matches, most of them in the U.S.

With millions of fans expected to cross borders to attend the games, U.S. President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies — which include travel bans on some countries, immigration raids and mass deportations — are generating anxiety.

“This is all being driven by the United States. And we're entirely the guilty party here,” said Victor Matheson, a professor at College of Holy Cross in Massachusetts who specializes in sports economics.

“You could have significant immigration problems with fans and players going across borders.”

The U.S. has travel bans in place for 12 countries and restrictions in place for seven, and is considering banning travellers from another 36 countries.

Though there are exemptions for athletes, staff and families, the unpredictability of Trump's administration means no one knows for certain what kind of rules might be in place by the time the tournament starts.

Economist Andrew Zimbalist, who wrote a book on the economics of hosting the World Cup, said Trump has the ability to make it difficult for people to travel, but it's not clear whether he will actually do so.

“I think probably Trump himself might not have the answers because … he responds very impetuously to changes in his environment,” he said.

Concerns about visas or political opposition to Trump might lead some soccer fans to decide not to attend at all, while others opt to attend the games in Canada instead, Zimbalist suggested. But he also pointed out that the quarter, semifinals and final are all taking place in the U.S.

A spokesperson for Canadian Heritage said Canada could see a million international visitors during the tournament.

“Given the tri-national nature of the event, it is anticipated that international and domestic travellers will move back and forth between Canada and the United States. The focus will continue to be on the flow of movement, the safety of travellers and the security of the borders,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the Canada Border Services Agency said the agency is working closely with federal government departments, host cities and FIFA “in the safety and security planning for this international event.”

Matheson said fans — particularly those from countries that have found themselves in Trump's crosshairs — have good reasons to be worried.

“I would be very concerned about planning a vacation that has you travelling from Mexico or from Canada into the United States and back. I don't think that you can guarantee that vacation of a lifetime is actually going to be there for you to actually take,” he said.

He said it's one thing to be denied entry, another to end up in jail and deported — potentially to a prison in El Salvador.

“No one wants to go to the World Cup to watch some soccer games and then end up in jail,” he said.

Trump's moves to impose tariffs on much of the world, including Canada, could also affect the World Cup.

Matheson offered the example of someone who makes jerseys for a country's team who would want to ship those jerseys across the border with the team.

“Tariffs make that type of inventory management pretty challenging,” he said.

Tim Elcombe is a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University whose areas of expertise include sports, politics and international affairs. He said “there was a sense that having the event in Canada, the United States and Mexico would almost be a bit of a calming of the political waters,” as the cup returned to Western countries.

Instead, he said, the 2026 tournament may be even more politically charged than the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Canada is co-hosting one of world's biggest sporting events with a country whose president has instigated a trade war and threatened annexation. Canadians have cut travel to the U.S. and stopped buying American products — and it's not clear what all of that might mean for the World Cup.

While Vancouver and Toronto will host some games, “really this is an American-centric competition,” Elcombe said.

“So how will Canadians feel about this? Will we get behind it? Will it become the event I think they were hoping it would be?”

In early July, labour and human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, wrote to FIFA president Gianni Infantino to say U.S. policies under Trump pose a “serious threat” to individuals, especially non-citizens.

The letter accused FIFA of ignoring “the clear evidence of the significant deterioration of the rights climate in the United States.”

Elcombe said while the United States is likely to take the brunt of scrutiny, Canada is not immune.

“Canada is going to have to be prepared for a very critical eye in terms of focus on some of the issues in Canada from a human rights perspective, because I think they will be exposed,” he said, citing Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples as one example.

MacIntosh Ross, a fellow at the Scott McCain and Leslie McLean Centre for Sport, Business and Health at Saint Mary's University, said Canada should put pressure on the U.S. government “to make sure that things happen in a safe or as safe a manner as possible.”

“The Canadian organizers and the Canadian government need to be very clear about their expectations for their partners in this World Cup and reiterate them and state them over and over again,” he said.

Elcombe noted Infantino, who has “very much established himself as a friend and supporter of President Trump,” could be a key player in determining how the coming months unfold.

It's difficult to predict what Trump might do, Zimbalist said. If there are political issues in the United States that he wants to distract people from, “you can see him doing crazier and crazier things internationally to get people's minds off of what's actually happening.”

But Trump also has shown that he cares about the World Cup and looking good as he hosts the tournament.

“I think he does care about image and he does care about being on the world stage,” Zimbalist said. “So I can see that being a significant deterrent, actually.”

The stage is set for an epic 2025 UEFA Women's Euro final on Sunday between reigning champs England and reignign World Cup winners Spain. A championship game two years in the making will pair two of Europe's giants for the continent's biggest crown. The match at St. Jakob-Park in Switzerland will serve as both a rematch and standard-bearer for the current state of women's football in Europe as Spain and England square off just two years following the FIFA 2023 Women's World Cup final.

Spain, 2023 World Cup champions, will place their technical mastery against England, 2022 Euro champions, and tournament lionhearts. The margins for error between the two sides are slim but just enough for each squad to feel confident about their chances. 

Both sides have been the top attacking teams this tournament, scoring 32 goals, with 17 for Spain and 15 for England, and 21 different goal scorers between the two nations, with England (11) edging out Spain (10) by one player. On the defensive end, Spain have three shutouts with two clean sheets in the knockout rounds and have only allowed three goals. England have conceded six goals and have one clean sheet in the tournament.

England enter the final after two extra-time knockout matches -- a quarterfinal penalty kick shootout against Sweden, and an extra-time victory against Italy in the semifinal, with sparks off the bench in Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. Spain, meanwhile, eliminated host nation Switzerland in the quarterfinal and defeated Germany for the first time in its program history during the semifinal.

Now, the two nations meet 707 days following their 2023 World Cup meeting with another trophy on the line. Spain look to win their first-ever Euro title, while England eye history with a potential repeat, which would be the first in over a decade.

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

The Big One, the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final: There were plenty of high stakes as the two sides met during the 2023 World Cup final. England was considered the heavy favorites following their 2022 Euro win, and Spain was seen as a team motivated to prove its federation and coaching staff for better conditions. The match played out to a narrow scoreline, with Spain the victors, 1-0, with a goal by defender Olga Carmona.

The Most Recent One, 2025 UEFA Nations League: The two sides have met since their World Cup match. They split two games earlier this year, more one-goal victories, during the 2025 UEFA Nations League. England got the better of Spain, 1-0, with a goal by Jess Park back in February, while Spain returned the favor in June. Spain's 2-1 win kicked off their sizzling summer, as Claudia Pina scored two goals off the bench and eliminated England from the competition.

England's 2022 Euro championship immediately launched the Lionesses into conversations around global elite programs and further set expectations for them at the 2023 World Cup. They ended up as runners-up in the 2023 final, and the build-up toward the 2025 Euro has seen the retirements of multiple key figures from the 2022 roster. Still, there are 14 players on England's Euro roster who were on the 2023 World Cup squad, eight of whom were starters during the World Cup final. 

Former Lionesses striker Ellen White, midfielder Fran Kirby, defender Rachel Daly, and goalkeeper Mary Earps were key players during England's magical Euro run but absences for this year's tournament -- with Earps announcing her departure in May, just two months ahead of the competition. During their current run, the group has had to manage injuries along the way. Forward Lauren James is nursing an ankle injury from the semifinal, and her status is in flux, while Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze are playing through leg injuries as well.

Head coach Sarina Wiegman has faced some criticism about stale tactics and a lack of rotations and late-game substitutions, but as nerve-rattling as the late-game heroics from Agyemang and Kelly have been, the coaching methodology has worked. This squad has emerged as the tournament lionhearts for their efforts.  

England are chasing a bit of history of their own, not only as title holders looking to repeat, but also as the first team to ever win a Euro after losing their opening match. They rallied through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final, and if they've expended this much energy and emotion, they'll empty the tank with just one more game to lift the title. 

Similarly to England, Spain's World Cup victory helped reset the program among the top three FIFA-ranked teams after being rated outside the top five before their 2023 World Cup run. Their Euro participants feature 11 players from the World Cup-winning roster, either eight starters from the final returning. Spain's key personnel changes from the 2023 World Cup to the 2025 Euro truly begin at the federation and coaching level. 

Their World Cup win was overshadowed, however. Former RFEF president Luis Rubiales initiated a non-consensual kiss with player Jenni Hermoso on the medal podium, and his close ties to former manager Jorge Vilda -- who players revolted against ahead of and after the World Cup due to his coaching style and leadership methods -- led to his firing and also the coach's eventual dismissal.

Montse Tome has been the head coach of the group since September 2023, and the program settled for a fourth-place finish at the 2024 Olympics after making their debut at the Summer Games. The former player turned coach faced criticisms for her lineup choices and somewhat predictable tactics during the competition, but making it this far is no small feat.

Spain's midfield mastery with the trio of Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guijarro continues to set the standard for their possession-based play, while forward Esther Gonzalez leads the team, and Euros, in the Golden Boot race. With plenty of holdovers from the World Cup final, Claudia Pina emerged as a bench player to a sure starter, and she has shown off her relentless efforts in attacking play and as a set-piece service threat. 

The team is making its first appearance in the Euro final and will aim to become the eighth different country to win the tournament. If they win, they will join Germany as the only nations to immediately follow a World Cup win with a Euro title. The Netherlands are the only team in the last 30 years to win the Euro (2017) in their first final appearance.

England: Hannah Hampton; Lucy Bronze, Leah Williamson, Esme Morgan, Alex Greenwood; Georgia Stanway, Kiera Walsh, Ella Toone; Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo

Spain: Cata Coll; Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Laia Aleixandri, Olga Carmona; Aitana Bonmati, Patri Guijarro, Alexia Putellas; Mariona Caldentey, Claudia Pina, Esther Gonzalez

There will be little that separates the two sides on the pitch, meaning the tactical matchups will be all the more intriguing. Could this be the game that England finally runs out of gas and personnel? Probably not, but it might make stretches of the game difficult for them to chase if they can't figure out how to play over Spain's midfield. Each team will score, but Spain will be the victors in extra time. Pick: Spain 2, England 1

Having twice saved a break point in the second set, a double fault and undercut forehand drop shot from Shelton enabled his opponent to move ahead 4-3. Davidovich Fokina wasn't able to consolidate though, as his forehand fell apart in handing the break right back.Energized and with the crowd fully behind him, Shelton dialed up his serve with a confident hold. This year's Australian Open semifinalist came within two points of forcing a decider in the 10th game, but that's as close as he would get.At 5-5, 15-15, Shelton pushed an overhead wide after letting a defensive lob bounce. A backhand error then set up Davidovich Fokina with two break points—and he pounced by passing Shelton at the net with a forehand up the line.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina stunned Ben Shelton last night, beating the American in straight sets to reach the Washington Open final.

Davidovich Fokina, seeded 12th, defeated Shelton 6-2 7-5 under the DC lights, setting up a match against Alex de Minaur in the final.

The Spaniard was an unlikely contender heading into the tournament, but has since proven his worth, beating the likes of Taylor Fritz and Learner Tien on his way to the final.

His achievements in Washington – a tournament he did not compete at in 2024 – have seen him enter a new conversation that few would have expected heading into the 2025 ATP Tour campaign.

The ATP Tour Finals, which take place in November in Turin, Italy, showcase the top eight players from the calendar year.

The tournament does not rely on a player's ranking but rather on the total number of ATP points accumulated during the calendar year. The top eight players qualify for November competition each year.

Davidovich Fokina's remarkable run in Washington has placed him directly in that conversation.

The Spaniard has gained 350 points so far this week. This has seen him rise seven places in the race, above the likes of Alexander Bublik, Tommy Paul and Holger Rune.

A post shared by Tennis TV (@tennistv)

Davidovich Fokina, who is in 11th place, sits behind only Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud and Ben Shelton, who sits in eighth place.

The world number 26 will contest a particularly important match against Alex de Minaur on Sunday. The match will decide the winner of the Washington Open, while also strengthening, or weakening, either player's chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour finals.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Alex de Minaur have a long history on the ATP Tour.

The pair first played each other at the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2019, with the Australian triumphing in four sets. de Minaur reached the final at the tournament, before losing to Jannik Sinner.

The Spaniard and Australian next met in 2021, with Davidovich Fokina winning in straight sets at the ATP Masters 1000 Monte-Carlo.

The Spaniard followed this up with victory at the 2022 Queen's Club Championships before de Minaur enacted revenge at the 2023 ATP Masters 1000 Canada.

Remarkably, Davidovich Fokina has never won an ATP Tour title. He will have a chance to change that against de Minaur on Sunday evening.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Sunday's final at the 2025 Citi Open has arrived in Washington, D.C. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina will look for his first title of his career in what should be a riveting match against World No. 13 Alex de Minaur. LWOT previews and predicts the ATP 500 title match.

Head-to-head: 2-2

As former ATP NextGen stars, these two players first met in 2019 at the NextGen ATP Finals, showcasing their athleticism and speed at a young age. De Minaur won that match, Davidovich Fokina returned the favor in their next two meetings, and de Minaur won their latest meeting 6-1 6-3 in Canada two years ago. Both players have had strong careers, though de Minaur has thrived on the ATP Tour with nine titles and has certainly had the higher ground on Tour.

Davidovich Fokina has played some of his best career tennis this week. His quarterfinal win over Taylor Fritz concluded after 1 a.m., a match that he trailed deep into the third set. In his 6-2 7-5 semifinal win over Ben Shelton on Saturday, he rebounded and had to fight off a vocal crowd after Shelton got a late push in the match during the second set. The Spaniard has been particulary strong on the forehand wing this week.

De Minaur made the final of this tournament seven years ago as a teenager, falling to Alexander Zverev in the title match. He's become more aggressive on court and strengthened his serve since then, something that will thrive on these faster courts. The Aussie has only dropped one set all week, claiming a brutal three-set win over Jiri Lehecka in the third round. He defeated Corentin Moutet in the semifinals 6-4 6-3, who had just come off an upset sh0ck over Daniil Medvedev.

It's easy to pick de Minaur as the favorite with his ATP final experience, but Davidovich Fokina is long overdue for an ATP title. The Spaniard is 0-3 in ATP finals, and some of the losses have been brutal. He's had a strong 2025 season, nearing a career high ranking and reaching two finals, but he faced debilitating pressure in both of those final matches. With the Spaniard playing clean tennis, and managing the pressure as an underdog in two successive matches, he may be able to play more freely being an underdog against the Aussie.

Ultimately, de Minaur should be hoisting the trophy on Sunday afternoon. The Aussie is one of the game's top returners, and he'll be able to capitalize on Davidovich Fokina's often inconsistent serve. While the Spaniard has served well this week, that stroke is often the first to crumble under pressure. De Minaur is also used to these conditions, and can grind out a player surely to be fatigued after a long week. Davidovich Fokina will have to play consistent tennis, but also shorten rallies as much as possible in order to avoid any long points that will let De Minaur settle in.
Prediction: De Minaur in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Nick Kyrgios names the smartest player on the ATP Tour as someone who he has previously called 'boring'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/nick-kyrgios-names-the-smartest-player-on-the-atp-tour-as-someone-who-he-has-previously-called-boring/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios is often vocal with what he thinks about players and rules in tennis.

Kyrgios keeps having injury setbacks, and has not played a singles match since March at the Miami Open.

His most recent appearance on the matchcourt in doubles did not go to plan either, with Kyrgios losing in under an hour with Gael Monfils.

Although Kyrgios' recent experience on the court has not gone so well, he does now appear to have changed his mind about a player he once criticised.

As part of the Washington Open's media day, players including Kyrgios, Emma Raducanu and Jessica Pegula were asked who they think is the smartest on tour.

Both Ben Shelton and Emma Navarro agreed that Pegula was their smartest player on tour, while she actually picked another American in Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

World number one and Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner was selected by Lorenzo Musetti and Daniil Medvedev.

Medvedev, himself, was selected by compatriot Andrey Rublev, while Holger Rune picked 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, and Elena Rybakina chose Barbora Krejcikova.

Hailey Baptiste played doubles with Venus Williams at the Washington Open this year,  but revealed that she thought Serena Williams was the smartest player.

Raducanu also chose a retired player and picked one of the pioneers of the WTA Tour in Billie Jean King.

When it came to Kyrgios' selection, he chose Casper Ruud and suggested that he thought the Norwegian appears to have his life together.

“I'm gonna go Casper Ruud,” said Kyrgios. “I feel like he's very smart he's got his stuff sorted.”

Who do you think is the smartest player on tour? 🤓#MubadalaCitiDCOpen pic.twitter.com/jqXbz6Xy2T

While Kyrgios and Ruud appear to be on good terms now, that has not always been the case.

At the Italian Open in 2019, Kyrgios was defaulted in a match against Ruud for throwing a chair onto the court.

This ignited a feud between the pair, with Ruud calling Kyrgios an ‘idiot' in an interview with Tennisportalen after he had been criticised for celebrating the default win.

Well…Kyrgios gets a game penalty and then walks off court, handing Casper Ruud a place in the last 16#ibi19 pic.twitter.com/T4jhvbV1RN

Kyrgios did not take too kindly to these comments and called Ruud boring in a rant on X (formerly known as Twitter).

He wrote at the time, “Hey @CasperRuud98 next time you have something to say, I would appreciate you say it to my face, I'm sure you wouldn't run your mouth so much after that. Until then I will continue to rather watch paint dry then watch you play tennis, boring **.

“But again, I also understand why you have to keep my name in your mouth, because people don't even realise that you play tennis (laughing face emoji) Goodluck in Milan champ x.”

But again, I also understand why you have to keep my name in your mouth, because people dont even realise that you play tennis 😂 goodluck in Milan champ x

Kyrgios continued his criticism of three-time Grand Slam finalist Ruud for a few more years after this, but it appears that all is now forgotten.

At an exhibition event in December last year, Kyrgios and Ruud actually played doubles together and were joking about any previous fallout.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Sunday action is in the cards for the National Bank Open, ATP Toronto Masters 1000. Here is your look at all the action.

Adam Walton is at a career high ranking after reaching the semis in Los Cabos, a late bloomer on the ATP Tour, he's into the top 100 now and 8-11 at tour level this year, along with a Challenger final and a title at that level. Bonzi at just 6-13 on the year really wants to find some form on hard courts this summer. His result in Washington was a first round exit, and Walton looks well positioned to hand Bonzi a second consecutive opening match defeat. Prediction: Walton in 2

The teenage wild card Arseneault is making his ATP main draw debut this is a big stage for him against the veteran Djere who is a respectable 15-12 on the season and won a title on clay this year. Djere's career hard court record is quite bad and Arseneault will have every chance, but it's hard to predict an upset in favor of a player who has rarely played opponents of Djere's caliber. Prediction: Djere in 3

With a record of 9-8 on the season, Ofner is trying to play his way back into the top 100. He's a credible all surface player, while Opelka at #74 in the world is 18-16 on the season overall, and has mostly played at the ATP level. Opelka comes off a tough loss to Daniil Medvedev in the second round of D.C., with his serve he looks like the favorite here. Prediction: Opelka in 2

Kecmanovic won a hard court title this year but is looking to bounce back from an opening match loss in D.C., Halys is just 12-19 on the season and has a worse record than his opponent. With both players suffering the same fate last week, neither can be said to be in good form, but Kecmanovic has been playing better on the season. Prediction: Kecmanovic in 2

Elena Rybakina has had a couple of concerning collapses this year and the latest came this past on Saturday, when the Kazakh blew a big lead and suffered a shock Washington semifinal loss.

After sealing a tight first set versus world No. 36 Leylah Fernandez, the No. 3 seed also went 3-1 up in the second set and had three consecutive break points to open a double-break second-set lead. 

But then, Rybakina's troubles started. First, the Kazakh didn't manage to get a break in the fifth game. Then, the 2022 Wimbledon champion got broken for the very first time in the match when she was serving to seal the win in the 10th game. To make it all worse, she completely disappeared in the second-set tie-break and won only three points there.

The third set was an extremely tight contest as not a single break point was seen. But then, the tie-break quickly turned into a one-sided battle as Fernandez took the opening four points before completing a 6-7 (2) 7-6 (3) 7-6 (3) comeback win.

LEYLAH ANNIE FERNANDEZ is into the @mubadalacitidc FINALS 🙌‼️  Extraordinary effort in 3 hours 8 minutes  One of the best matches all year  6-7(2) 7-6(3) 7-6(3) against Elena Rybakina (3)  Down 6-7(2) 1-3 *0-40 and 3-5 *40-40  1 match away from the 2021 U.S. Open Finals rematch! pic.twitter.com/oPPnJdoXcH

Over the last two months, Rybakina - ranked at No. 12 - has had three baffling losses. 

In the French Open round-of-16, the Kazakh was all over Iga Swiatek early on and opened a dominant 6-1 2-0 lead before allowing the Pole to come back and win 1-6 6-3 7-5. In the Berlin quarterfinal, the 2022 Wimbledon champion had four consecutive match points in the third-set tie-break against Aryna Sabalenka before stunningly losing the next six points and seeing the Belarusian win 7-6 (6) 3-6 7-6 (6).

In Washington, Rybakina had yet another collapse and lost herself when the time came for her to get over the finish line. 

Rybakina is now 33-14 on the year. She has been ranked outside the top-10 since April and that won't change on Monday.

In the build-up to the US Open, the first Masters 1000 event of the North American hard-court swing is set to get underway next week. 

The Canadian Open has seen some big names drop out already, with Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic withdrawing, before Carlos Alcaraz announced he would not feature in Toronto. 

With multiple stars pulling out, a huge opportunity has presented itself for the likes of Lorenzo Musetti and Ben Shelton, who have never won a Masters crown.  

Plenty of points are on offer for stars looking to rise in the rankings, but for one former major champion, the tournament marks one last dance on the ATP Tour. 

At the Canadian Open, former Wimbledon doubles champion Vasek Pospisil will play his last match in front of a home crowd. 

Pospisil emerged victorious at the All England Club in 2014 alongside Jack Sock to clinch his first and only Grand Slam title. 

His Canadian compatriot, Denis Shapovalov, said of his last dance: “I would love to see his match.

“In terms of his legacy, I mean, for me personally, he's one of the first big players in Canada, and he's definitely left a big mark in Canadian tennis.

Pospisil's best finishes at Grand Slams in doubles: 

“I remember growing up watching him and Milos playing Davis Cup ties, playing in important matches, playing semifinals here, the Rogers Cup.

“I mean, he's done a lot for Canadian tennis, he's done a lot for guys like me and Felix [Auger-Aliassime].”

Shapovalov continued: “When we were coming up, I remember he was one of the first top players that I was able to speak to and get advice from.

“He was always super, super nice, and very welcoming to me. So that definitely always stayed with me, and I think we have a great relationship for that reason.

“I think he's a great person, obviously with everything he's done with PTPA and to help the players really shows the type of person that he is.

“I mean, you see more behind closed doors about how good of a teammate he's been over the years, and how much he's really given back to my generation and to everyone around

“I think all the Canadians speak very highly of him. It's very sad to see him go. I definitely feel like he's got, I think he's got more to give, you know, if he could get healthy and get in shape, but for sure it's amazing to look back on what he's been able to achieve.”

Pospisil has been granted a wildcard for the event and will play his first match on Centre Court. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

  Sidford Tennis Club marked the end of Wimbledon fortnight on Sunday, July 13, with their own club tournament, BBQ, and live musical entertainment before watching the men's final match on the big screen.



  This is the third year in succession that the club has put on such an event, where members, friends, and family can come together to enjoy tennis, good food, and entertainment.



  This annual event is growing in popularity, with this year boasting a record attendance.



  The sunny weather was a bonus and contributed to the festivities, which saw club members Suzanne Clapp and Chris Long snatch a cat's whisker win over fellow members Helen Terry and Sarah Patterson in a nail-biting final doubles match.



  The action didn't stop there, as volunteers manned the BBQ while the club's in-house band, The Aces (Harry, Rachel, Ellen, Nick, Steve, and Chris), served up an enjoyable set of hits.



  As the band played a song by the Kinks, the Pimms and strawberries and cream helped to make it a truly ""lazy sunny afternoon"".



  The televised action later in the afternoon saw rousing support for both Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner and some spirited cheers for both players before the end result.



  Sidford Tennis Club would like to thank everyone who attended the event and who contributed so much to the friendly and lively atmosphere, and in particular, everyone involved in providing food and catering.



  The club looks forward to doing it all again next year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Mansour Bahrami says where he thinks Novak Djokovic is most likely to win his record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title","https://tennishead.net/mansour-bahrami-says-where-he-thinks-novak-djokovic-is-most-likely-to-win-his-record-breaking-25th-grand-slam-title/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic's window of opportunity is slowly closing.

The Serbian superstar is aiming to win his 25th Grand Slam title, which would break his jointly-held record for the most singles Grand Slams won by any player – a record currently shared with Margaret Court.

Despite his unmatched achievements, Djokovic has struggled to capture that elusive 25th major crown. When Djokovic plays at the US Open, it will mark two years since his last Grand Slam triumph.

Djokovic, who has withdrawn from the upcoming Toronto Open, has seen his past rivals – Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – retire from the sport.

Unfortunately for Djokovic, these icons have been replaced by future icons: Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

Mansour Bahrami, another icon of the sport, has weighed in on Djokovic's chances of winning another Grand Slam in his career.

After an impressive playing career, Mansour Bahrami has transformed himself into one of tennis' most prominent entertainers.

Bahrami, who performs numerous tricks and highlight-reel shots during invitational matches at Grand Slams, expressed his admiration for Novak Djokovic while speaking to Gigi Salmon on the Courtside Conversations Podcast.

Bahrami, who recently revealed what he said to Jannik Sinner before the Wimbledon final, noted that Wimbledon may have been Djokovic's last opportunity to win a 25th slam, while also pinpointing the tournament where Djokovic is most likely to break that elusive record.

Bahrami said: “I thought that he is going to do it. I know that it's going to get more and more difficult.

“For me Wimbledon was maybe the last one so it would be unbelievable and he has done so many things unbelievable that we all are amazed how great he's done. 

“He's a great champion, he's won everything and so is he capable at almost 39 to go and win Australian Open. I would say if there is one that would be Australian Open.

“But it's going to be very, very hard.”

Djokovic's latest opportunity went up in smoke at Wimbledon. The Serbian star lost to Jannik Sinner in straight sets at the semi-final stage – a repeat of the French Open.

Speaking after his record-equalling title in Flushing Meadows, Djokovic conveyed the experience of living his childhood dream, noting his opportunity at a ‘shot at history.'

Djokovic said: “It obviously means the world to me.

“I'm really living my childhood dream to compete at the highest level in this sport, which has given me and my family so much from difficult circumstances.

“I never thought I would be here but the last couple of years I thought I had a shot at history. Why not grab it when it is presented?”

After career-high rise, 20-year-old returns to tour with a tricky draw before US Open

Dubai: The hardcourt season was supposed to be her moment to shine. But just as Alex Eala begins her US Open build-up, the Filipino star finds herself facing an early challenge — a rankings drop and a first-round clash against a Grand Slam champion.

Eala, 20, has slipped from a career-best No 56 to world No 69 in the latest Women's Tennis Association (WTA) rankings following a three-week break from competition. The brief pause — which included a homecoming in Manila — came after a gruelling run through the European summer, where she made her debut in the main draws of both the French Open and Wimbledon.

Now back in action at the National Bank Open in Montreal, Eala faces one of the toughest opening-round assignments in the draw: 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova on Sunday. The Czech left-hander, a former world No 6 and Olympic silver medallist, is currently ranked 65th and brings far more experience to the clash at the IGA Stadium.

For Eala, however, tough draws are nothing new. Earlier this season in Miami, she stunned the tennis world with a sensational run to the semi-finals, knocking out three Grand Slam champions — Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and then-world No 1 Iga Swiatek — before losing to Jessica Pegula. That breakout propelled her into the top 60 for the first time in her career.

Since then, the former US Open junior champion has continued to make steady progress. In Eastbourne, she reached her first WTA final before narrowly losing in a three-set battle to Australian teenager Maya Joint. At Wimbledon, she faced a brutal first-round test against eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova and went down fighting in straight sets.

The recent break was seen as both a mental and physical recharge after a demanding stretch. But the downside is a dip in momentum and the loss of valuable ranking points, setting up a tougher road in the coming weeks as she builds toward the year's final Grand Slam.

Montreal will be the first of several tune-ups for Eala, who is expected to feature in Cincinnati before a final stop in Monterrey, Mexico before heading to New York. She's expected to face top-tier opponents in all three tournaments, including world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Grand Slam champions Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff.

Her goal: secure direct entry into the US Open main draw, scheduled from August 24 to September 7 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and prove that Miami was no fluke.

Despite the rankings dip, the Filipino tennis community remains optimistic. At just 20, Eala has shown she has the tools to compete with — and beat — the very best. But the next fortnight will test her ability to handle the grind, rebound from a setback, and navigate a tough schedule in the lead-up to Flushing Meadows.

But for Eala, the coming weeks are about more than just results. “There's still so much for me to achieve,” she told the media in Manila recently. “Of course, I want my first Grand Slam main draw win. But right now, I just want to enjoy playing on this stage.”

If she finds her rhythm early, another memorable run could be just around the corner. But for now, the focus is firmly on surviving Montreal — and the formidable challenge that awaits in Vondrousova.

Former British player Barry Cowan has identified what makes grass and hard courts Emma Raducanu's best surfaces as he looked ahead to the US Open.

Raducanu continued her positive 2025 campaign with an impressive run to the semi-finals of the Citi DC Open in Washington this week.

The 22-year-old saw off Marta Kostyuk, Naomi Osaka and Maria Sakkari without losing a set before falling 4-6, 3-6 to Anna Kalinskaya in the last four.

The Brit holds a 21-15 record this season and she has climbed 13 places from 46th to 33rd in the Live WTA Rankings with the 195 points she has gained for her run at the WTA 500 event.

Raducanu lost six of her first nine matches of 2025 before kickstarting her year with a run to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in March after linking up with coach Mark Petchey.

In an interview with Tennishead, Cowan addressed Raducanu's chances at the 2025 US Open, which will begin on August 24.

“Yeah, I think grass and fast hard courts are her best surfaces,” said the former world No 162.

Who is Emma Raducanu's first Canadian Open opponent? Elena-Gabriela Ruse is friends with the Brit

Emma Raducanu explains two-finger salute as she reveals key change to mentality

“I think the reason for that is that she is a great timer of a tennis ball. And when she won the US Open, she predominantly played her tennis on the baseline and used her great timing to hit the ball early and rush her opponents.

“Obviously, on the slower hard courts, on the clay courts, it's a totally different type of style that is required, but yeah, I mean, she can do well at the US Open, but I think that the women's tour is something where I do feel, you know, I look back to Washington last year as a good example. I thought she'd played a great in Washington.

“She played two really good matches, she won, she built momentum, she lost narrowly to [Paula] Badosa in the quarter-finals, and then she didn't play after that until the US Open.

“Well, you can't expect to play, you know, one great week and then not play for three or four weeks and then pick it up. At 30 years of age or 35 years of age, if you're a [Novak] Djokovic, or further back, Serena Williams — that's okay.

“But for Raducanu, she needs matches.”

Raducanu will face world No 56 Elena Gabriela Ruse in her opening match at the WTA 1000 event in Montreal next week.

Emma Raducanu turned heads when she teamed up with Elena Rybakina for doubles at the Citi Open.

The 2021 U.S. Open champion and the 2022 Wimbledon victor, both having faced their share of ups and downs post-titles, joined forces in Washington. They were forced to play in blistering heat in the United States, with Raducanu making her feelings clear on the playing conditions.

The pair, nicknamed ER-squared, cruised into the semifinals after securing two victories, first against Olivia Nicholls and Tereza Mihalikova, followed by a win over Giuliana Olmos and Aldila Sutjiadi, without dropping a set.

However, their streak came to an abrupt halt in the final four when they faced Taylor Townsend and Zhang Shuai, as Raducanu fell ill and they had to retire early in the first set. Despite the setback, this may not be the last we see of Raducanu and Rybakina as a team, with the Wimbledon champion speaking highly of her partner.

""Yeah, I think she's really nice girl. It was a lot of fun,"" Rybakina commented on Raducanu during her press conference. ""Of course [it was a] tough match, but I'm happy that I played doubles, and I think it's good as a practice, preparation for singles. So it was fun, and yeah, hopefully we can play a bit more in the future too.""



This dynamic duo was a long time in the making, as Raducanu disclosed that they had been planning to join forces right after Rybakina clinched the Wimbledon title by defeating Ons Jabeur in the 2022 showdown.

""How it came about, so in 2022 in Cincinnati, me and Elena were going to play doubles together, and that fell through,"" the world No. 46 explained.

""Then here, when I was in D.C., I thought it would be a good idea to play doubles, get some extra matches in these conditions. It's very different. And also the fact we were able to play before singles, I think that really helped.

""So, yeah, she was walking off the practice court, and I was on the practice court, and I was just, like, okay, I'll give it a shot. I wasn't really bothered if she said no. I asked her, and she was, like, Yeah, sure. That's how it came about.""

The duo has also made impressive strides in their respective singles tournaments, with Raducanu choosing to double down on both fronts in the 2025 editions to boost her physical game.

She teamed up with Britain's top player Katie Boulter at Queen's, then put up a valiant fight at Wimbledon, pushing Aryna Sabalenka to the brink in a promising loss, before heading to North America to join forces with Rybakina – a partnership that might just have a future.

Novak Djokovic's window of opportunity is slowly closing.

The Serbian superstar is aiming to win his 25th Grand Slam title, which would break his jointly-held record for the most singles Grand Slams won by any player – a record currently shared with Margaret Court.

Despite his unmatched achievements, Djokovic has struggled to capture that elusive 25th major crown. When Djokovic plays at the US Open, it will mark two years since his last Grand Slam triumph.

Djokovic, who has withdrawn from the upcoming Toronto Open, has seen his past rivals – Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – retire from the sport.

Unfortunately for Djokovic, these icons have been replaced by future icons: Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

Mansour Bahrami, another icon of the sport, has weighed in on Djokovic's chances of winning another Grand Slam in his career.

After an impressive playing career, Mansour Bahrami has transformed himself into one of tennis' most prominent entertainers.

Bahrami, who performs numerous tricks and highlight-reel shots during invitational matches at Grand Slams, expressed his admiration for Novak Djokovic while speaking to Gigi Salmon on the Courtside Conversations Podcast.

Bahrami, who recently revealed what he said to Jannik Sinner before the Wimbledon final, noted that Wimbledon may have been Djokovic's last opportunity to win a 25th slam, while also pinpointing the tournament where Djokovic is most likely to break that elusive record.

Bahrami said: “I thought that he is going to do it. I know that it's going to get more and more difficult.

“For me Wimbledon was maybe the last one so it would be unbelievable and he has done so many things unbelievable that we all are amazed how great he's done. 

“He's a great champion, he's won everything and so is he capable at almost 39 to go and win Australian Open. I would say if there is one that would be Australian Open.

“But it's going to be very, very hard.”

Djokovic's latest opportunity went up in smoke at Wimbledon. The Serbian star lost to Jannik Sinner in straight sets at the semi-final stage – a repeat of the French Open.

Speaking after his record-equalling title in Flushing Meadows, Djokovic conveyed the experience of living his childhood dream, noting his opportunity at a ‘shot at history.'

Djokovic said: “It obviously means the world to me.

“I'm really living my childhood dream to compete at the highest level in this sport, which has given me and my family so much from difficult circumstances.

“I never thought I would be here but the last couple of years I thought I had a shot at history. Why not grab it when it is presented?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Inside Shang's return: From constant pain to smiles in Toronto","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shang-toronto-2025-feature","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:18:16 GMT","

No matter what position Shang Juncheng was in, he felt pain in his right foot. Whether the Chinese #NextGenATP star was laying down, sitting or walking, he suffered from it. If the lefty accidentally hit his foot, that would “hurt pretty bad”.

“Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night and it started hurting and I had to walk around a little bit to circulate [it],” Shang told ATPTour.com on Saturday ahead of his return to action at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers following six months away. “It was not the nicest moment.” 

Shang began his season in Hong Kong, where he reached the semi-finals before retiring against Kei Nishikori. He then made it through less than two sets in the first round of the Australian Open against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina before bowing out.

“In Australia, I was struggling with it pretty bad. We thought it was a bone bruise or something like that, [and we thought] that it was not so serious,” Shang said. “But after a month, maybe, it was still hurting the same. Sometimes it would hurt more and I would have resting pain when I slept, so I was like, ‘Wow, this is possibly going in that direction'.”

Shang was referring to surgery. By Indian Wells, he decided to either compete in the season's first ATP Masters 1000 event or go see a foot specialist. Shang did the latter and has been on the mend since undergoing surgery on 5 March.

“The pain went away other than the cuts with the scalpel. Obviously with the medication at the beginning, it helped a lot,” Shang said. “But after, when I was rehabbing, it was hurting a little bit  here and there. When you walked, you were always kind of scared that something might break, because it doesn't feel like it's yours. 

“Overall it's been really good. I'm glad I had a good time at home, spending time with my family, and my physio Charlie is great. He's done a huge role in this rehab.” 

The former No. 47 player in the PIF ATP Rankings took advantage of six months in Florida. “Obviously, the golf game has improved a lot during that time,” Shang said, cracking a laugh.

But importantly, it was a chance to spend time with family and doing things players do not always have time for while competing on the ATP Tour. There was plenty of Harry Potter — ‘Jerry' spent time both reading the books and watching the movies. He laughed Saturday thinking about popular character Ronald Weasley casting a spell that backfired, resulting in him spitting up slugs.



It was not until the beginning of April that Shang began playing tennis and he was not comfortable on court for weeks after that. By Roland Garros, the pain was gone.

“That's when I realised, look, this foot thing is set and all we need to do is get back in shape and find the match rhythm, and I'll be all right for the tournaments,” Shang said. “I think the most exciting part is that there's no pain, and I'm playing happy on the court. It doesn't matter what the results are. 

“I'm just happy to play a few tournaments that are left this year, which is not many. But I get my favourite part of the season, which is at home, right after the US Open. So everything is, I think, positive.”


Shang, who had a wide smile on his face Saturday in the players' lounge, will make his return on Sunday in Toronto against a qualifier. It will be just his sixth match of the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“Obviously the rhythm on Tour is way different from when you're practising. When coaches are feeding you balls, the rhythm is completely different... There's a lot to play for [on Tour] and I just [have] very positive feelings to be back,” Shang said. “And most importantly for me again, is to just enjoy because I haven't played for so long, coming from only two tournaments this year. To play my first one as a 1000, I think it's very special to be here in Toronto.”

Alex de Minaur overcame a scrappy, error-prone performance to halt the run of French lucky loser Corentin Moutet 6-4, 6-3 and advance to the final of the Mubadala Citi DC Open Saturday night.

The Australian will need to sharpen his game ahead of Sunday's final against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina after spraying 33 unforced errors, including 21 in the opening set, and 21 for the match on his backhand, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Spaniard Davidovich Fokina completed a hat-trick of victories against American players, backing up victories over Learner Tien and top seed Taylor Fritz with a 6-2, 7-5 win over fourth seed Ben Shelton in the evening's second semi-final. 



""It wasn't pretty tennis, but I knew it was going to be a tricky match without a lot of rhythm,"" De Minuar said. ""That's what he's able to do to opponents. I had the mentality of doing whatever it took to get into the title match tomorrow.""

After winning 14 consecutive points to start the second set, De Minaur seemed to be coasting to victory but double faulted to drop serve at 4-1 and later failed to serve out the match at 5-2 in a game that started with a double fault.

In a more promising sign, De Minaur won 17 of 22 points at net, regularly approaching Moutet's weaker backhand wing with impunity.

De Minaur, who also reached the Washington, D.C. final in 2018 (l. to Zverev), improved to a Tour-leading 21 hard-court wins on the season. He also has the most wins at the ATP 500 level (41) since the start of the 2023 season.

By reaching the final, De Minaur passed Andrey Rublev at No. 10 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. 

Moutet, who came into the tournament as a lucky loser after losing in qualifying, has this week climbed 13 spots to No. 46 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, cracking the Top 50 for the first time in his career. 

Davidovich Fokina, hit just 10 winners but capitalised on Shelton's 35 unforced errors, including seven double faults. The 12th seed backed up impressively after the previous night rallying from 2-5 in the third set to beat World No. 4 Fritz around 1 a.m.

He becomes just the second Spanish finalist in Washington, following Alex Corretja's surprise victory over five-time champion Andre Agassi 25 years ago in 2000. 

The recently married 26-year-old claimed a career-best 33rd win on the season and a fifth Top-10 win of the year. He now sits at a career-high No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, ensuring that he will make his Top 20 debut on Monday.

""I knew that I wouldn't be fresh after such a late finish, but I knew with Ben that there wouldn't be a lot of long rallies and it would be a quick match. I knew I had to be there for every point,” Davidovich Fokina said.

""It's always special to win against a Top 10 player. To beat one of the best guys in the world is always special. Coming back from 2-5 against Taylor last night was a huge achievement.”

The left-hander won 16 of her first 17 points on serve, but watched as Rybakina rocketed consecutive return winners in the opening tiebreak to swing the momentum in her favor. The Kazakh appeared to be in control by securing an immediate break to launch set two, but an inability to extend her lead to a double break despite chances in her next two return games—including 0-40 at 3-1—would later cost the No. 3 seed.Sensing Rybakina's tightness, Fernandez worked the energy of the crowd to her advantage to level for 5-5. Back in another now-or-never situation, the Canadian opened a 5-0 lead en route to trading tiebreaks on the scoreboard.

We're going to play each other a bunch of times,"" Shelton said post-match, adding that ""it's tough not to cheer for a guy like that"" after the two hugged it out at the net.Shelton finished the match with 29 winners to Tiafoe's 20. He also hit just 18 unforced errors to Tiafoe's 28. But most impressively, 31 of Shelton's 55 serves went unreturned.

So my ability for my flat serves not only to be coming in at 145 [mph] but also rising above his shoulders is huge.""Second serve, too.

Sainz explains how a 'poor quali' led to a disappointing weekend at Spa

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Piastri took his sixth victory of the season in the rain-delayed Belgian Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri took his sixth victory of the 2025 Formula 1 season, extending his championship lead over Lando Norris in a rain-affected Belgian Grand Prix.

After an 80-minute rain delay, Piastri wasted no time in seizing the lead from team mate Norris, out-dragging the Briton into Les Combes on the first racing lap.

As the track dried out, McLaren split the strategy of its two drivers, putting Piastri on medium tyres while Norris, who stopped one lap later, elected for hard rubber. After losing time with his extra tour, Norris was unable to close the gap as the championship points margin extended to 16.

Charles Leclerc completed the podium trio for Ferrari, with Max Verstappen fourth and George Russell improving to fifth. Lewis Hamilton was the biggest mover though, starting in the pit lane and finishing seventh, after being among the first to switch to slick tyres.

Sainz explains how a 'poor quali' led to a disappointing weekend at Spa

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Lewis Hamilton described his Belgian Grand Prix Qualifying result as ""unacceptable"" after finishing 16th while Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc in third.

Lewis Hamilton conceded his early qualifying exits at the Belgian Grand Prix are ""unacceptable"" as he insisted he would apologise to his Ferrari team.

The seven-time Formula 1 champion will start Sunday's Grand Prix from 16th on the grid after a track limits violation on his final Q1 run resulted in his time being deleted, seeing him eliminated at the first hurdle. This came after a similarly disappointing Sprint Qualifying, where he had managed only the 18th fastest time to exit in SQ1.

In that Friday session, he had locked his rear tyres and spun – an error Hamilton described as a career first and later said was affected by a new component on his Ferrari.

Following his latest Qualifying disappointment on Saturday, when asked if he was beginning to feel more comfortable with the changes, Hamilton told Sky Sports F1: “Not particularly. I was the same as I was for the rest of the weekend. We made some changes, the car didn't feel terrible. I think it was even tougher for us. We had to put a second set [of soft tyres] on just to get through Q1.

“Then from my side, another mistake, so I've really got to look internally. I've got to apologise to my team, because that's just unacceptable to be out in both Q1s. It's a very, very poor performance from myself.”

Compounding Hamilton's difficulties is the impressive weekend being enjoyed by team mate Charles Leclerc, who qualified fourth for the Sprint, and third for the Grand Prix.

He added: “It's incredibly painful. It's turning out to be a pretty bad weekend so far.”

With rain expected to fall on Sunday, there is at least a chance for a clever strategy to change a driver's fortune, something highlighted by Nico Hulkenberg at Silverstone last time out as the Sauber driver claimed a stunning podium.

But even this prospect did little to lift Hamilton's spirits. He said: “Anything can happen here. I don't know. I have no clue about tomorrow. It's going to be very hard from where I am, so definitely a weekend to forget.”

Looking to what the remainder of the season could bring, Hamilton conceded: “I mean, we're trying to do the best with what we have, and then everyone is working flat out back at the factory.

""We have had upgrades, but I think that's probably it for the year, and the focus is now on next year's car. This season has been a tricky one.”

The Belgian Grand Prix got under way after an 80-minute rain delay.

Oscar Piastri took the lead of the Belgian Grand Prix from Lando Norris on the opening racing lap of a delayed race at Spa-Francorchamps.

Following an 80-minute rain delay and four laps behind the Safety Car, the Belgian Grand Prix got under way, with Norris leading McLaren team mate Piastri for a rolling start.

But a slide for Norris at La Source allowed Piastri to gain a tow and sweep into the lead on the approach to Les Combes.

Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen followed the McLaren pair, with Alex Albon also in the top five for Williams.

Sainz explains how a 'poor quali' led to a disappointing weekend at Spa

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa.

There was daylight between McLaren and the chasing pack in Saturday's Qualifying – but this isn't a race that's going to be won or lost by a couple of tenths on a low-fuel lap. Tyre deltas, degradation, end-of-straight speed and a weather forecast that's… exciting… are going to play their part in a race that certainly isn't going to be static.

This perhaps, is not what Lando Norris, taking his fourth pole of the season and winner last time out at Silverstone, wants to hear, but it will provide considerably more cheer for team mate and Championship leader Oscar Piastri, starting P2, and Sprint winner Max Verstappen, starting P4… or anyone looking to make an impact with smart strategic thinking.

There's two versions of this: the one that involves the chequered flag and the podium, and the other that brings in the scrutineers, the weighbridge and Document 44 formally disqualifying George Russell.

Let's take the second one first. The race was a two-stopper, with a top three of Lewis Hamilton, Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc all running a very similar medium>hard>hard strategy.

Lando Norris, classified P5, and Esteban Ocon in P9 did the same. They all pitted between Laps 11-15, and then again between Laps 25-30. At other circuits, that might appear as quite a narrow window, but in the context of a 44-lap Belgian Grand Prix on F1's longest track, it's more of a gaping chasm.

There were plenty of variations on a theme with Max Verstappen finishing fourth on a medium>hard>medium strategy, Carlos Sainz sixth with hard>medium>hard, Sergio Perez seventh with medium>medium>hard (plus two laps at the end on soft to bag the extra point and set the lap record).

Daniel Ricciardo was 10th, being the only driver to fit a soft tyre for strategic purposes, running soft>medium>hard but the real outlier in the list is Fernando Alonso. The Spanish driver was classified P8, hanging it out for a tough one-stop of medium>hard, making his solitary pit stop on lap 13.

Alonso, of course, looked like being the second one-stopper home, with George Russell taking the flag and standing on the top step of the podium. Russell started P6, made a place on the first lap, and pitted early, on Lap 10, when running P5. He held position through the stops, and rose through the leading pack when cars ahead started to duck in for their second stops.

At some point during the middle stint, Mercedes decided he had the tyres to make it work, and so Russell simply kept going, surviving late pressure from team-mate Hamilton to win by 0.526s. However, his car was 1.5kg below the minimum weight of 798kg so it was an easy decision for the stewards that in no way negates a perfectly executed strategic ambush.

Pirelli are trying something a little different this year with a compound bridge in place. Last year we had the C2, C3 and C4; this year we have the C1, C3 and C4. The original intention was to introduce a genuine dilemma between a flat-out two stop and a more managed one-stop.

Conditions this weekend mean it's not quite the designed choice – but there are plenty of options, depending on track temperature, ability to run in clean air, set-up decisions and – as is usually the case – what everyone else is doing.

Pirelli's sims suggest the two-stop race is the fastest way to the flag… just. Their favoured strategy is a soft>medium>medium race with unusually wide pit windows. They have an optimal first stop between Laps 12-18, and a second between 25-31. This is very different to the preferred options in last year's race when the soft tyre was not popular – but the tyres are a little more resilient in 2025.

It's the tortoise or the hare today – if you accept a few minor tweaks to a narrative that now has a highly-motivated tortoise with a turn of speed unwitnessed in most chelonians, and a hare that's lacking even an ounce of complacency. It's close between one and two stops, and could easily be the sort of decision that teams don't take until mid-race. It has an optimum window between Laps 16-22 of the 44.

“In our calculations, the two-stop soft>medium>medium is quicker than the one-stop soft>medium… but by just a few seconds,” says Pirelli motorsport director Mario Isola. “Tomorrow [Sunday] with lower temperatures and, because of those temperatures, degradation that can be more easily managed, soft>medium could be an option. It will need quite a high level of management… but it is possible.”

A mixed grid at Spa is not an unfamiliar sight – but generally it's been with engine penalties doing the damage. This year… we simply have a mixed grid – 13 places between Leclerc and Hamilton; 10 between Alex Albon and Sainz; 12 separating Russell and Kimi Antonelli.

There are cars with potential to be quick, threaded right through the field. Overtaking looked difficult in the Sprint – but with everyone on the same tyre of the same age, that's often the case in the first stint of a race also, but as degradation and tyre deltas come into play, things start to become more fluid.

Given the length of the straights at Spa, quick cars don't have to play long odds strategies to get up the field, they can simply drive a deterministic race and let pace win out.

But, for anyone wanting to try something different, there's another one-stop strategy available. Medium>hard has a pit window between Laps 17-23. On paper it's not quite as quick as the strategies involving a soft tyre – but it really does depend on which Spa turns up tomorrow.

We're at Spa so, frankly, what isn't the weather doing? So far this weekend we've had brilliant sunshine, light drizzle, heavy rain and an F3 session postponed because the medevac helicopter doesn't fly in heavy fog. Chances are it won't snow on Sunday, but everything else is on the table.

The forecast, as of Saturday evening, suggested a very wet Sunday – albeit with the race at the time most likely to be dry. There's an 80 per cent chance of rain in the morning, gradually decreasing through the early afternoon to 40 per cent between 1500-1700, before rising again to make the teams thoroughly miserable during pack-down.

Even if it doesn't rain during the race, rain before will have a significant impact on the viability of the hard compound. It looked good on Friday – but in cooler conditions and a track washed clean, it's going to slide around a lot, and suffer in much the same way it does in Barcelona.

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Invicta Racing's Leonardo Fornaroli took his second consecutive Sprint Race victory with his triumph in Belgium.

Invicta Racing's Leonardo Fornaroli took his second consecutive Sprint Race victory – following his win at Silverstone – with a brilliant drive at Spa-Francorchamps.

The Italian made a great start from third to take the lead into Turn 1, and from there on he fought off the challenge of Amaury Cordeel and managed a Safety Car restart to win the race.

Cordeel had been running second but contact with Victor Martins knocked him out of the race, with the ART Grand Prix driver finishing in P2 after starting in sixth.

PREMA Racing's Gabriele Minì charged through from eighth on the grid to finish in third, while pole-sitter Oliver Goethe wound up in fourth for MP Motorsport.

Goethe held of his fellow Red Bull Junior Josep María Martí in the final few laps, with the Campos Racing driver forced to settle for fifth.

Roman Stanek put two Invicta cars in the points with a run to sixth, ahead of Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne, as ART's Ritomo Miyata took the final point in P8.

Dunne is set to start from pole position in Sunday's Feature Race, where he will be joined on the front row by Miyata.

Lights out is set for 10:00 local time on Sunday, but until then, you can read an in-depth report of the FIA Formula 2 Sprint Race from Spa on the official website here.

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris report back after the Sprint at Spa-Francorchamps.

DRIVERS

1 – Max VERSTAPPEN (Red Bull Racing), 2 – Oscar PIASTRI (McLaren), 3 – Lando NORRIS (McLaren)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Jolyon Palmer)

Q: Lando, you're back to the top three at the end of that one. You had to work for it at the start with Charles Leclerc. Obviously, the start and the first run up towards Les Combes is tricky. The Ferrari came past but you dealt with him quickly.

Lando NORRIS: Yeah. I mean, not a lot going on. Obviously, a bit of fun at the start with trying to overtake Charles. Maybe could have positioned myself a little bit better but otherwise a bit too difficult to get past Max. Max drove a good race and I wasn't going to get past anyone unless Oscar got past Max. They drove good races. Not a lot we could do on a day like today, so looking forward to tomorrow.

Q: So, what are you thinking then when you're stuck in there? You could obviously see the top two very close together. Are you hoping that there's a bit of action ahead? Are you hoping that Oscar makes a mistake to fall towards you?

LN: Yeah. It's tough. Obviously, I hope for a bit of battling or something but the Red Bull was just too quick on the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into qualifying, I don't know. We'll reassess and see what we can do.

Q: And it wasn't the easiest day for you yesterday, but only one point lost to Oscar in terms of the championship, and you can regroup now ahead of the Grand Prix. You're off the back of two Grand Prix wins in a row. Can you make it three?

LN: This is the plan. I'm not too fussed about Sprint races, but obviously main races I prefer to win. We'll see. I wasn't too bad yesterday. I was comfortable, just a couple things didn't go my way. But I'm confident we can have a good result later and put in some good quality laps.

Q: Well done, Lando. Six more points in the bag.

LN: Thank you.

Q: Oscar, second place. We knew the start was going to be tricky for you on pole position. That Red Bull is very slippery. I guess it played out kind of how you expected it on the first lap.

Oscar PIASTRI: Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed and then obviously didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either. Still a good result, still good points. It is only the Sprint, the main points are tomorrow. Pretty happy with it but just a bit frustrating that I couldn't get past.

Q: I imagine you know the back of the Red Bull pretty well by now, having followed so close for so long, but the opportunity didn't quite come to you in that one. What do you do with the car then? Do you trim out some downforce? Are you looking at the weather? How can you stop this happening tomorrow?

OP: It's a great question. The weather is looking pretty bad for tomorrow, which obviously means you probably don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look, see what we can do. There's a lot of things to look into before tomorrow.

Q: Well, you've still been on fire this weekend, the man to beat on one lap so far. We've got that coming up later. Going to go and give it the beans again on Soft tyres only?

OP: Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Spa is my favourite track of the year and especially in qualifying it's just mega around here. Looking forward to some more laps this afternoon.

Q: We're looking forward to them too. Well done, Oscar.

OP: Thanks.

Q: Max, a Sprint win, a Spa special for you as well there getting the run on the first lap. I guess you knew that was your big chance with the Red Bull pace you've got on the straight line and you executed it to perfection.

Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah. It worked out really well. That's the only real opportunity you're going to get against them and we got it into Turn 5. Then I knew it was going to be very tough to keep them behind. It was just playing cat and mouse, DRS, battery usage. The whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't really afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny lock-up in the last corner but apart from that it was a great result to keep them behind and to have a win here in Spa. Of course it's a Sprint win but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there.

Q: It was a great performance. Lots of eyes in the mirrors. I want to talk to you about the brakes though because you mentioned at one point it was difficult to hit the peak pressure. We saw you as you referenced have a little run-on in the Bus Stop. What was going on there?

MV: Basically, you're keeping faster cars behind so you have to drive over the limit of what you think is possible. Tyre management is out of the window so that is what makes it really difficult. I'm just doing 15 qualifying laps to try and keep them behind on a track where tyre management is important. It wasn't easy but we managed to do it so I'm very happy with that.

Q: Still a lot going on in a race where there's no position change after the first lap but you're having to work that hard. So what about qualifying later on? The McLaren looks a little bit too quick but can you make some changes and get to pole?

MV: Do I feel pole is possible? I'm not sure but we'll try our best, try and set up the car how we want. After this race we'll have a few more ideas of what we want to do and then try to be as close as possible to them.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Very well done, Max. A perfectly executed sprint by you, a game of cat and mouse throughout. Just how much satisfaction does a win like that give you?

MV: Yeah, I'm just happy that I was able to hang on to it. I knew, of course, in the start there were possibilities up to Turn 5. We took it. And then, from there onwards, I knew also they had new Mediums. I knew that it was going to be even more difficult. Just trying to hang in there with the top speed that we had. I knew the middle sector was going to be the weaker area for us and just trying not to make any mistakes there, basically. And it worked very well. The only thing that I had was one time the braking into the last chicane. But it's also, you know, you're driving a bit over your own kind of management, so it's easy to just overheat the tyres a bit too much. But we hung in there and kept the two McLarens behind. Of course, very pleased to win here. I mean, it's my favourite track, home crowd, home feeling. So, yeah, just very nice always to be here.

Q: Max, just talk us through the move going into Turn 5 on Oscar on lap one. Were you surprised by your straight-line speed advantage?

MV: No. I knew that we had a little bit of a pace advantage on the straight. So, as soon as we got out of Turn 1, I knew that I would have a run to Turn 5.

Q: The setup worked well today. Do you see any reason to change it for the rest of the weekend?

MV: Need to have a look. Silverstone wasn't particularly fantastic for us on Sunday. So just need to have a double check, yeah, double check the weather basically, and we'll have a look what we'll do.

Q: Oscar, congratulations on P2. Although it was a slightly frustrating race for you staring at Max's gearbox for so long. Just how close did you get to making a move on him?

OP: Realistically, not that close. I think there was one or two times where I got within a car length but the problem is I didn't have enough. And Turn 5 is not really a corner where you can make a lunge on someone. Once they defend the inside, it's difficult to do anything. So I think realistically I was going to have to try and get past on the straight, which we were no chance of doing. A little bit frustrating, but we knew that was a possibility going into the Sprint and I was prepared for maybe not to be within eight tenths the whole race and not be able to do anything, but for this kind of result.

Q: And when you saw how easy it was for him to get past you up to Turn 5 on lap one, did you know at that moment that it was going to be very difficult for the rest of the race?

OP: Not necessarily. I was hoping we would be super quick in the middle sector and be able to hang on, but I think I could for the first part of the race. But spending that much time right behind someone, you overheat the tyres very quickly. Especially around here, they deg as well. It's not just getting hot. I think the back end of the race I lost some of the advantage in the middle sector that I had and obviously you don't gain anything more on the straight. So realistically I don't think we had quite enough to even get close enough, but we'll see what we can do for qualifying.

Q: What about tomorrow? The weather forecast looks like it's going to be rainy in the afternoon. What's the balance? Do you think you need more straight-line speed or are you going to play on the conservative side?

OP: I don't know yet. We'll wait and see. If it is wet, then naturally you want a bit more downforce, but if it's not wet, then I don't really want a repeat of the sprint race we've just had. So we'll have a look for sure, but it'll be interesting to see if anyone changes and which way we go.

Q: Lando, very well done on the P3. Just how much confidence does that sprint give you for the rest of the weekend?

LN: The same as what I had before. Like Oscar said, I think we knew we would find it tough to pass Max if he got ahead at the beginning. I got past Charles and from then it was just kind of a bit of a waiting game to see if anything happened, but nothing did. So I had confidence before that we would be quick. But here, you still need to be a bit quicker in this race than what we were today. Difficult. I think we probably have a quicker car altogether, but just not enough to overtake.

Q: Lando, what did we learn in that sprint that can help us for the rest of the weekend in terms of tyre wear? Franco Colapinto set his fastest lap on the soft tyre on the last lap. Just give us your thoughts on that.

LN: I don't know. Impressive. I don't know. The tyres are nowhere near good enough at the end, so I don't know if he just had some clearer air or something. I don't think that means anything. We'll see. We've just got qualifying ahead now, and then we'll wait and see what the weather makes us do tomorrow.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) A question for Max. Obviously, the first weekend for Laurent. Do you already see any changes in how the team operates? And also, how was the experience working with Simon Rennie again this weekend?

MV: It's very difficult to, within two weeks, suddenly say a lot of things need to change out of the blue. It's about starting the relationship and just understanding how everyone is operating. And then at one point, you come to conclusions and maybe you want to change something, and this is something that will happen over the coming weeks, months. So, it's really early days, but so far, he's very keen and very motivated, and that's exactly what you want also. I got on very well with him. So, yeah, it's been a very good start. And also with Simon, he has a lot of racing experience already. He's been part of the team for a very long time. The last few years, not anymore in a race engineer role, but he steps in and he's immediately on it. So again, very enjoyable to work with Simon.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) A question for Max and one for Oscar, please. Max, what's your first impression of the upgrade package so far and does it make you feel any more comfortable in the car? And Oscar, were you surprised by their race pace, not just the straight-line speed, but also the tyres holding on towards the end of the Sprint?

MV: Yeah. I think it's been good. We just tried to optimize the car. We tried to put performance on it like everyone else, and I think we are doing that. So that's for sure a positive. We just need to keep doing that.

OP: I think it was probably a little bit better than I expected, but I wasn't expecting Max to be slow, that's for sure. I knew it was going to be a challenge, maybe not quite as difficult as it was, but I think, like I said before, after following so closely for so long, the tyres just naturally get to a point where they can't do much anymore, and it's a bit of an equaliser. So, it wasn't a big surprise for me.

Q: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365.com) Max, any thoughts for the fact that you've actually given Laurent a winning start to his new job as Red Bull team principal? And also for the team as well. It's not a Grand Prix victory, but at least something to celebrate after all the turbulence of the past few weeks.

MV: The team can always count on me. They will always get my very best, whoever is in charge. They know that. I'm never holding back or anything. I'm always trying to give them the best possible result, and that's also what they pay me for. For sure, it's positive. We need, of course, positive energy, and that's a great start for us.

Q: (Josh Suttill – The Race) A question for Oscar. How much were you experimenting into La Source with the different lines? Because I think your race engineer said to be a bit more conservative at one point. And how much were you experimenting with the battery deployment as well to try and get past Max?

OP: I was trying. I was definitely trying. It's difficult because you want to save the battery at some points, you want to use it at some points, but you also don't want to drop too far back and give yourself too much of a gap to actually close up to because it wasn't as simple as just getting DRS and then letting DRS do the rest. You had to be even closer than that. That was tricky, but I certainly tried in those 15 laps, but to no avail.

Q: (Diletta Colombo – AutoMoto.it) A question for Max. You said before that you basically did 15 qualifying laps during the race. Do you think it could help you build the momentum to fight for the pole this afternoon?

MV: From what I've seen so far this weekend, I think that will be quite tough. But we'll try to improve the car a bit more. I think I got a bit more of an idea what I want with the car. Now is it always possible to do that with the car? I'm not sure. But we'll give it a go, and hopefully I can be close in qualifying.

Q: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Max. You mentioned on the radio the good work with the battery management. How much in this case is up to you and how much do you need the instructions by the team?

MV: I think it's always something that you decide together. Of course already before the race, but even during the race, they have to update you as quickly as possible with these things. I think everyone does that. But it was good. It was very nice today.

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

The F3 Feature Race had two red flag stoppages due to torrential rain and adverse weather conditions in Belgium

The Formula 3 Feature Race had two red flag stoppages due to torrential rain and adverse weather conditions on Sunday morning.

Starting behind the Safety Car, AIX Racing's James Hedley spun off at Eau Rouge after aquaplaning, though the Briton was able to recover to the pit lane.

Up ahead, Brando Badoer tagged Tim Tramnitz into a spin, leaving the former with race-ending damage and the latter out of the running also. Their collision along the Kemmel Straight brought out the first red flag of the day.

After a short break, the race resumed behind the Safety Car, but was quickly red flagged once again, this time after Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak spun to avoid Campos Racing team mate Nikola Tsolov between Turns 7 and 8.

His car needed recovering, and a second red flag followed though this time, Race Control confirmed that the race would not be resumed.

With no racing laps having taken place, no points were awarded for the Feature Race, meaning Championship leader Rafael Camara remains 28 points clear of closest challenger Nikola Tsolov heading to Budapest, 126 points to 98.

'We're just not strong enough' - Verstappen frustrated with pace of the car

Lando Norris scored his fourth pole of the season in Belgium, beating his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri by 0.085s.

Lando Norris was quickest of all in Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, bagging pole ahead of his team mate and Championship rival Oscar Piastri.

Norris was just 0.085s quicker than the Australian in the end, having been beaten by Piastri on Friday in Sprint Qualifying.

It was Norris' fourth pole of the season and 13th overall, and gives him a very decent chance of grabbing a third straight Grand Prix win – although much will depend on the weather, with rain predicted ahead of lights out for the Grand Prix.

The testing conditions of Spa-Francorchamps brought out Lewis Hamilton's best.

P7 might not sound like a huge result for a seven-time World Champion, but when you're reminded that Lewis Hamilton started 18th and in the pit lane at Spa, after a miserable qualifying performance, your Driver of the Day decision makes total sense. No one made up more places in a wet-dry Belgian Grand Prix than the Ferrari star, who pulled off countless passes in the treacherous conditions of the opening laps. Here's how the voting broke down…

Lewis Hamilton - 38.8%
Oscar Piastri - 10.6%
Charles Leclerc - 9.6%
Lando Norris - 6.7%
Alex Albon - 6.3%

Max Verstappen won the Belgian Grand Prix Sprint after snatching the lead on Lap 1 from Oscar Piastri.

Max Verstappen took his first Sprint victory of the 2025 Formula 1 season, fending off both McLaren drivers in Belgium.

Verstappen took the lead from Piastri on the opening lap on the long drag to Le Combes, with Charles Leclerc also passing Lando Norris. But while Norris quickly regained third, his championship-leading team mate remained stuck to the Red Bull's gearbox.

Leclerc, Eseteban Ocon, Carlos Sainz, Ollie Bearman and Isack Hadjar completed the points-paying positions.

After exiting Sprint Qualifying in the first phase on Friday, Lewis Hamilton was unable to make significant progress, as he took the flag in 15th.

Romijn is set to reprise her role as Mystique, a character she originated in 2000's ‘X-Men.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Rebecca Romijn is sharing an update on her return as Mystique in the highly-anticipated Avengers: Doomsday. 


	At The Hollywood Reporter's San Diego Comic-Con suite, the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds star admitted that she wasn't sure if she's finished filming for the forthcoming Marvel film because the script isn't fully complete.  




	“[I'm] not quite sure,” she said when asked if she was done shooting her scenes. “The script hasn't — they haven't finished writing it. It's been very, very fun, and we don't know yet. They keep everything very close to the vest themselves in an effort to keep everything under wraps.”

At THR's suite at #SDCC, #StarTrek: Strange New Worlds' Rebecca Romijn talks about what it was like returning to the role of 'Mystique' for #AvengersDoomsday pic.twitter.com/BTCNKcUmwS


	Romijn kept her lips sealed when asked if she's read the entire script, noting, “I cannot confirm nor deny that I have read the entire script.” She also admitted she “can't say” who she's filmed scenes alongside, but it was a “surreal” experience shooting with some of her original X-Men co-stars with a new, blended cast. 


	“It was very surreal to be with my old cast as well as a new cast. I had crazy dreams while I was there for a large chunk of shooting. Like, really kind of regressive dreams,” she shared. “It was very strange, my brain was really trying to organize. Like, wow, this is a character I played 25 years ago, 20 years ago. Yeah, [it was] very surreal.”


	The actress also shared what it was like revisiting the role of Mystique after nearly 20 years since she last portrayed the character in 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand. (Romijn made a brief cameo in 2011's X-Men: First Class.)

	











	“Oh, I know her very well. I went back in with full ownership of her. It was very nice to go back and play that character, ‘cause I had imposter syndrome in the very beginning,” she said. “I thought, maybe at the very beginning, I was just cast because I happened to be the model who was available to play Mystique at that moment. I mean, I auditioned and I got the role, because when you're very young, you're like, Do I deserve to be here? And I did not have that going back this time. It was a very different experience.” 


	Marvel revealed the Avengers: Doomsday cast in late March, which notably includes a string of actors from 20th Century Fox's X-Men universe. Joining Romijn from the inaugural 2000 film include Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto and James Marsden as Cyclops. The Traitors host Alan Cumming also returns as Nightcrawler, whom he played in X2: X-Men United, and Kelsey Grammer as Beast, from X-Men: The Last Stand.

The former 'Tonight Show' host took aim at partisan late-night shows in a recent interview: ""Why shoot for just half an audience?""


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Jay Leno took aim at late-night hosts whose political humor appeals to only “half their audience” by making jokes targeting only one side of the ideological spectrum.


	The 75-year-old former Tonight Show host made the comments during a recent interview with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. While the interview was taped at least two weeks ago — likely before CBS made its shock announcement that it was canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on July 17 — the portion of the interview containing the late-night criticism was posted on YouTube last week and has been making the rounds this weekend due to recent headlines.

					Steve Buscemi Recalls Failed Audition for Barry Levinson's 'Tin Men': ""There Was This Silence""		
			









	David Trulio, the president and CEO of the foundation, kicked things off by noting to Leno that his jokes were equally balanced between mocking Democrats and Republicans. 


	“I got hate letters saying, ‘You and your Republican friends,' and another saying, ‘I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,” Leno says. “That's how you get a whole audience. Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.”


	Continued Leno: “Rodney Dangerfield and I were friends. I knew Rodney 40 years and I have no idea if he was a Democrat or Republican. We never discussed politics, we just discussed jokes. I like to think that people come to a comedy show to get away from the pressures of life. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.”

	











	Leno concluded by saying: “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group — or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what's funny.”


	Leno hosted The Tonight Show for 17 years across two separate stints, starting in 1999 and concluding in 2014. During that time, the NBC series was often the top-rated late-night show.


	CBS abruptly announced The Late Show would conclude in May 2026, and called the move a “financial decision.” But it came days after Colbert criticized the network for paying “a big fat bribe” to President Donald Trump in the form of a $16 million settlement over a 60 Minutes interview. Newsbusters, a right-wing media watchdog, claimed The Late Show has hosted 176 outwardly left-leaning guests since 2022 and only one Republican, and booked 43 left-leaning guests since the start of 2025.


	Other late-night hosts — including current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon — have rallied behind Colbert since the decision, with fellow talents working under parent company Paramount Global having been especially scathing. “What made you that money are shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid…” Stewart said. “If you believe — as corporations or as networks — that you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar … Why would anyone watch you?”

The superstar singer wrapped up her latest tour at Allegiant Stadium on July 26.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Destiny's Child returned for one unforgettable night.


	During the final stop of her Cowboy Carter Tour at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on Saturday (July 26), Beyoncé surprised fans by reuniting onstage with former group members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, marking their first performance together in seven years.


	“Destiny's Child, b—t!” Bey shouted to a roaring crowd after briefly disappearing from the stage, then returning with Rowland and Williams as their hit “Independent Women” began to play.

	











	The surprise reunion arrived during the Renaissance segment of the show, as the trio kicked off a medley of iconic hits with their 2004 hit “Lose My Breath,” a song they hadn't performed together since Beyoncé's Coachella headlining sets in 2018. They followed with Bey's 2022 Renaissance track “Energy” before closing with Destiny Child's 2001 anthem “Bootylicious,” marking the first time the three-piece had performed the hit live since their appearance at Beyoncé's Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2013.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After the show, Beyoncé took to Instagram to share a photo of herself smiling onstage with Rowland and Williams by her side. Rowland and Williams also posted snapshots from the iconic moment on their respective IG accounts. 


	Since their debut in 1997, Destiny's Child has cemented its status as one of the most successful and influential girl groups in music history. Although the trio officially disbanded in 2006, they reunited for high-profile performances at the 2013 Super Bowl and Beyoncé's Coachella headlining set in 2018. The group also reunited offstage in 2023, when former members LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett shared backstage snapshots from Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour.

	











	Throughout their chart-topping career, Destiny's Child has earned 10 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including four No. 1 singles: “Say My Name” (three weeks), “Independent Women, Part I” (11 weeks), “Bills, Bills, Bills” (one week), and “Bootylicious” (two weeks). On the Billboard 200, the group landed four top 10 albums, including the No. 1s Survivor (two weeks) and #1's (one week).


	In addition to Destiny's Child, Beyoncé's final Cowboy Carter Tour show on Saturday featured surprise appearances from Shaboozey — who joined her for a medley of “Sweet Honey Buckiin',” “Pure/Honey,” and “Summer Renaissance” — and her husband, Jay-Z, who performed “N—s in Paris” solo and teamed up with Beyoncé for “Crazy in Love.”


	“Don't ever ask permission for something that already belongs to you,” Beyoncé told the audience near the end of Saturday's show, according to Rolling Stone. “God bless you, drive home safe, thank you for tonight! Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this a reality. I'm so deeply grateful.”


	Attendees in the VIP section at the Las Vegas finale included Kris Jenner, Khloé Kardashian, Tyler Perry, and Oprah Winfrey, TMZ reports. 


	Bey's tour concluded after a series of high-profile stops in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, London, Paris, Houston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Las Vegas.

The team behind the all-star benefit concert addresses providing donors with a ""transparent view into how FireAid is putting their dollars to work.""


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



FireAid, the all-star benefit concert event put on in January, raised $100 million for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts. On Saturday (July 26), the team behind the dual shows at L.A.'s Intuit Dome and Kia Forum released a statement in response to “misinformation being shared online” regarding funds distribution.


	The long list of performers at FireAid — which was livestreamed, and drew in more than 50 million viewers — included Green Day with Billie Eilish, Jelly Roll, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Olivia Rodrigo, Peso Pluma, Stevie Wonder, Lil Baby, Tate McRae, Sting, Alanis Morissette, Anderson .Paak with Dr. Dre and Sheila E, Dawes, John Mayer, a Nirvana reunion, Joni Mitchell, a reunited No Doubt, P!nk and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many others. Funds were raised from ticket and merchandise sales, sponsorships, donations from the public and private gifts.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	In February FireAid reported its first disbursement of funds in the amount of approximately $50 million, and in June the distribution of a second round of grants in the amount of $25 million. It's expected that the remaining $25 million will be distributed by the end of 2025.

	











	In a statement shared Saturday morning, organizers said, “There has been an increasing amount of misinformation being shared online about the distribution of FireAid funds. We want to address concerns and be certain that Angelenos and the thousands of donors who generously contributed have a transparent view into how FireAid is putting their dollars to work.”


	FireAid said the Los Angeles Times has reached out to more than 100 organizations that received funds to review the grants received and how the money was used, noting the publication “determined ‘FireAid was an urgent lifeline in the worst of the disaster and beyond.'”


	The $100 million raised helped survivors of the L.A. wildfires recover and rebuild, said FireAid, who reported partnering with area nonprofits that have the ability to directly reach people who found themselves in need of food stability, housing and more.


	“Each recipient is required to report on fund usage to ensure full transparency and impact,” said Saturday's statement. “The year-end results, which are due in December 2025, will be audited by FireAid's auditor, KPMG.”


	The FireAid website has a list of partners who've received grants — which is available at fireaidla.org/grants — and will continue to publish documentation of how funds are reaching people affected by wildfires in the L.A. region.


	“While there is much more work to do, the money raised through FireAid is delivering much needed assistance to as many people as possible,” said the note released on Saturday.

	As John Cena's Christopher Smith gets an upgrade with a parallel dimension in the forthcoming second season of the HBO Max/DC Studios' Peacemaker, so will its soundtrack.


	Following James Gunn's panel at San Diego Comic-Con previewing the sophomore installment — at the famed Hall H and prime Saturday evening spot of the weekend — the Superman helmer took to the stage at Peacefest to share additional news.


	“I am here to reveal right now — it is a song from my favorite band in the world that is objectively the greatest rock ‘n' roll band in the world, Foxy Shazam, here they are. They're gonna perform it for you guys — ‘Oh Lord' — come on guys!” the DC Studios co-CEO said in welcoming the group.

As of 2025, the band's lineup comprises lead vocalist Eric Nally, pianist Sky White, trumpeter/backing vocalist Alex Nauth, bassist Existential Youth, guitarist Devin Williams and drummer Teddy Aitkins.


	Earlier this evening, Gunn told the Hall H crowd of the forthcoming sophomore installment: “I really like TV shows where the characters don't just return every season and they're the same exact characters. I want to see growth. I want to see change and sometimes regression. And Peacemaker is a different guy this year. He's dealing with the demons he uncovered from the first season and trying to deal with them, and the world is not accepting him the way he is. They aren't accepting him as a hero.”

	











	As fans might expect, Gunn's blockbuster triumph Superman will predate the events of Peacemaker Season 2, with the show's characters appearing as that movie's supporting cast: Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabela Merced) and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn). That trio, as seen in the first teaser, grill Peacemaker for an interview with the Justice Gang.

James Gunn is really enjoying the spotlight these days. I liked him more when he was just the quiet Director who let his art speak for itself.

I need to see the choreography, but it doesn't seem as danceable as the first one.

Junior Edwards, one of the original cast members of the History Channel‘s Swamp People, has died, per a Facebook announcement posted by his grandson and co-star “Little” Willie Edwards.


	“Rest easy pawpaw….i know your [sic] probably running your hoop nets or doing something crazy inside those pearly gates…you will be extremely missed pawpaw we love you more than anything!!! Until we meet again,” Edwards wrote alongside a photo of his father, Willie Edwards, and grandfather on a boat.


	Though no cause of death was shared, a post from earlier this month indicated the grizzled alligator-hunting patriarch was experiencing health issues.

	“Yall keep him in yalls thoughts and prayers please…we need a miracle,” “Little” Willie Edwards wrote in a July 6 post. “Get better for us papa we love you!!!”


	Premiering on the History Channel in 2010, Swamp People featured Junior Edwards in Seasons 1 through 6 of the reality television series, which follows the day-to-day lives of alligator hunters living in the swamps of Louisiana's Atchafalaya River Basin. Though he departed the show in 2015, he returned in 2021's Season 12, and his tenure overall totals 100 episodes. The Season 16 Swamp People finale aired in April of this year, and the show is expected to return in 2026.


	His death sparked tributes from co-stars like Ronnie Adams and his hunting partner/fan-favorite cast member Ashley “Deadeye” Jones.


	“Praying for the Edward's [sic] in this time of need!!! Rest in peace Junior!!!” wrote Adams in an Instagram post.

He was one of the greatest alligator hunters there is! He was real hardcore outdoorsman! I watched this man bring in MONSTER gators at Duffys Gas Station in Pierre Part LA. This was after a looooong day for both of us and you can tell it! Glad we took a second for a pic!”

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps has come in with an estimated $218M global opening. While this is lower than where we saw it yesterday, it remains above the pre-weekend projection, both worldwide and in terms of international box office. The latter landed at $100M, the top end of our pre-opening projection.


	The overseas debut is 13% ahead of Thunderbolts*, 11% ahead of Superman and 4% above Captain America: Brave New World in like-for-like markets at current rates. The Fantastic Four folks also scored the biggest superhero opening of 2025 in Mexico, the UK, France, Italy, Spain and the European and Latin American regions, as well as several smaller markets.

	The offshore take of $100M is about 46% of the global total. Normally, in this genre, we see overseas numbers much higher than domestic, but that's not been the case recently (see Superman‘s bow at 43% from overseas). Is it a sign of the times, or the properties, or other vagaries? Likely a mix of those, but Hollywood is also facing challenges in Asia.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We've known for a long while now that China is not the slam-dunk it once was, and that's factored into consideration. What's more worrying is that studio films are not always clicking amid local productions in other Asian markets. This weekend is perhaps an anomaly because there is a huge movie (Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle) in Japan and also a new local title in Korea (Omniscient Reader), but there's a rethink needed for audiences in the region.


	This is food for thought that we'll revisit, but speaking of a movie that's doing better domestically than overseas, Warner Bros' Superman has topped the half-billion milestone, now at $502.7M worldwide, including $213.2M from international.


	On the flipside, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth has topped $700M global ($718.4M), with a heftier overseas haul ($416.8M), while Apple Original Films's F1, via Warner Bros, has sped to $509.7M worldwide amid great holds, and with $344.1M coming from the international box office.

	











	Also of note, Sony and Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later has topped $150M worldwide, with $80M from international and $70M from domestic.


	MORE…


PREVIOUS, SATURDAY UPDATE: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps is on its way towards a global opening of $220M-$230M, which would place it ahead of the pre-weekend projection. Through Friday, the Matt Shakman-directed F4:FS has grossed an estimated $106.2M worldwide. 


Domestic is at $57M through Friday and is eyeing a full weekend bow of $120M-$125M. The international box office through Friday is $49.2M with the whole opening frame looking at $100M-$105M. 


	Friday openers overseas included Spain, China and Japan. As previously noted, China is just not playing ball – nor was it expected to. Japan and Korea have local movies on the high end.


	Latin America and Europe are leaning into the family.


	The Top 5 markets for The Fantastic Four: First Steps through Friday are as follows: Mexico ($6.2M), UK ($5.7M), France ($3.5M), Brazil ($2.6M) and Italy ($2.4M). 


	We'll have a full update on Sunday.


PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps kicked off overseas rollout on Wednesday, and through Thursday is in 44 material offshore markets. The international box office cume through Thursday is an estimated $27M. That includes No. 1 opening days across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.


	At this early stage in the proceedings, First Steps is estimated to be running 57% ahead of Captain America: Brave New World, 32% over Superman and 9% above Thunderbolts* in like-for-like markets and at current exchange rates. 


	As we noted in our global preview, the international box office launch projection for the Matt Shakman-directed Fantastic Four is $90M-$100M, with room for upside.


	The movie — starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner — has also helped propel The Walt Disney Studios past the $3B mark globally. When The Fantastic Four's domestic previews are factored in today, Dis will cross the milestone; the first studio to get there in 2025.


	The Top 5 overseas markets on First Steps through Thursday are Mexico ($4.1M), UK ($2.8M), France ($2.7M), Italy ($1.7M) and Brazil ($1.7M).


	On Wednesday, France logged the 3rd highest opening day of 2025, up 84% on Thunderbolts*, 80% ahead of Superman (+13% including previews), 57% over Captain America: Brave New World and 16% over Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.


Italy also had the 3rd best opening day of 2025, ahead of Superman (+111%), Captain America: Brave New World (+81%), Thunderbolts* (+63%) and Quantumania (+47%).


Netherlands gave the family the 2nd highest opening day of 2025, well above Superman (+122%), Captain America: Brave New World (+67%), and Thunderbolts* (+37%), as well as 5% ahead of Quantumania.


	Asia-Pacific saw strong market shares in Wednesday launches (89% Indonesia, 76% Philippines, 53% Hong Kong) and positive social reactions.


	On Thursday, majors joining the family included Mexico, UK, Brazil, Australia, Germany and Korea.


	As noted above, the Latin America bows were all No. 1s while the regional debut saw the 3rd highest opening day of the year. 


Mexico, which leads all overseas play after just one day, came in 97% ahead of Brave New World, 51% ahead of Superman and 3% ahead of Thunderbolts*. First Steps took 68% market share on Thursday. 

	











	Also on Thursday, the UK greeted F4:FS with the 2nd biggest opening day of summer 2025. While the movie came in below Superman (-23%), that film opened on a Friday. Germany's opening Thursday was 136% ahead of Superman. 


	In Australia on Thursday F4:FS had 60% market share and scored the biggest Marvel opening day of the year, landing 57% ahead of Thunderbolts* and 45% ahead of Captain America: Brave New World. Versus Superman, it was -2%/-46% (including/excluding previews), the latter having launched during school holidays. 


	In Korea, where F4:FS opened on Thursday to sidestep a new local title, the debut was, as expected, somewhat muted, but still a No. 1 start on the day. The cume there through Friday (Friday is not reflected in the international total above) is $1.04M.


	Markets that open today include China, Japan and Spain. China, as previously noted, is soft on superheroes (and soft overall) and Japan has some mega local titles in the mix – but we should see some good numbers out of Spain.


	We'll have more throughout the weekend.

Not that earth moving of a box office to be honest. Superhero movies in general are still coming too frequently.

Superhero fatigue is real.

Demon Slayer will be #1 in Japan for the next month or two. Worth saying its name specifically since it'll do a solid $500-600m or so globally with ease!

So, basically the same as Superman. Overperforming domestically, underperforming globally.

Fantastic movie.  Very good writing and characters.  It's a complete story with no flaws.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: Ok, ok, ok, so Marvel Studios/Disney‘s The Fantastic Four: First Steps is coming in lighter at $118M after a -42% slide on Saturday against Friday/previews for what was $33.2M. As we said yesterday, cynics, go pound sand. $100M-plus opening for the industry? What major studio wouldn't want that? Also, for a superhero movie to continue to do $100M+ in its 3-day start, va bene for capes. 


	Worldwide debut is $218M, which is $2M shy of Superman‘s initial global pounce. 


	Still, that's a steep Friday/previews to Saturday decline, which indicates the movie was front-loaded. Nobody was spotting that yesterday, the lowest was a $120M debut. And families always go to the movies on Saturday. Fantastic Four‘s fall is sharper than Superman (-33%), Thunderbolts* (-22%), Deadpool & Wolverine (-36%), and Captain America: Brave New World (-32%). 

	











	Wha happened?




			Watch on Deadline		







	Essentially, fewer families went to see Marvel's first family than DC Studios' Superman. Go figure. According to EntTelligence, while metro centers with populations over 1M overperformed on Fantastic Four: First Steps, rural and suburban areas (where families live) under performed on average -13%. Also, kids under 13 only repped 8% of the population. It just is what it is. It doesn't mean Fantastic Four is broken, it's just a crappy thing when the industry over projects on a big movie during its opening weekend, and then it comes in lower by Sunday and Monday. Disney figures that Fantastic Four will ease -16% today with $27.8M.  

	











	The norm attendance for families to a PG-13 superhero movie is 21% per EntTelligence. Fantastic Four came in at 17%.  


	I'm telling you again for the Nth time: whenever tracking or studio's distribution departments project on $100M+ openings, there's always a rounding an error. It's never perfect. One box office insider said “On Friday, I had Fantastic Four doing $135M.”


	Also, there's a lot of PG-13 family entertainment in the market this weekend with the third weekend of Superman doing $24.8M, and Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth at $13M in its fourth sesh.  


	Also good to note that older audiences embraced Fantastic Four more (maybe it's the period of it all that kept some families away) with Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak showing that the best definite recommends came from 35-44 at 80%, 45-54 at 72% and over 55 at 78% versus 18-24 at 69% and 25-34 at 69%. 


	Imax and PLFs were huge at 40%, with Imax alone contributing close to 14% of the weekend or $16M at 418 hubs. That's the second-highest ever domestic market share for an MCU film and eighth consecutive +10% domestic indexing opening for Imax. 3D repped 13%. 


	Comscore reports that the YTD box office has crossed $5.2 billion, +13% from the Jan. 1-July 27 frame of last year. Summer is currently +10% of summer 2024 with $2.86 billion. That said, summer is -15% behind 2019's at the same point in time (after the first Friday start in May); that figure being $3.3 billion. 


	Sunday numbers:

This is steeper than his genre movies, Hereditary (-50%) and Midsommar (-49%) and even sharper than the second weekend wide release (technically third weekend) of Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme (-49%). It remains questionable whether this net $25M production can make it to $13M. Aster's Beau Is Afraid shrieked its final domestic take at $8.1M.  


	8. Saiyaara (YRF) 210 (-85) theaters, $390K (+143%), Sat $506K Sun $504K 3-day $1.4M (+131%), Total $3.3M/Week 2


	10. Oh Hi! (SPC) 866 theaters, Fri $736K Sat $218K Sun $175K , 3-day $1.1M/Wk 1Alright results in NYC, LA, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Austin, DC and Denver. 


SATURDAY AM: The Fantastic Four: First Steps at $120M-$125M is one of the sixth best openings for a Marvel Cinematic Universe title post Covid and that's a great thing. For all the “does it or does it not beat Superman?” in the Coke and Pepsi fight between Marvel and DC – who cares? It's the fourth $100M-plus opening of the year for a movie and that spells “excellent” for the business. Not to mention, it's solid footing for a superhero movie.

	











	There is still a path to $125M, as we told you the movie has been pacing like James Gunn's Superman. Yesterday's first/day previews for Fantastic Four came in at $57M, which is $900K ahead of Superman‘s $56.1M, and the second highest opening day of 2025 to date behind A Minecraft Movie‘s $57.1M. Wouldn't ya know — the MCU title also received an A- CinemaScore, the same as Superman. If the movie comes in under $125M, box office nerds, it's not the end of the world or the demise of the superhero movie. As we always report, and this was true pre-Covid, predicting $100M+ openings given the small sampling isn't a perfect science.


	The Hollywood feature directorial debut of WandaVision helmer Matt Shakman is poised to rank as his highest opening at the domestic box office. Ditto for Pedro Pascal (his previous being Gladiator 2 at $55M), Joseph Quinn (same, Gladiator 2), Vanessa Kirby (previous Mission: Impossible Fallout at $61M) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (previous being Jennifer Lawrence's No Hard Feelings at $15M). 


	Some in the industry had their doubts as to whether Fantastic Four could tip $100M as this was a period movie, however, rivals are applauding Disney's marketing campaign which connected with audiences. Marketing campaign under Disney marketing czar Asad Ayaz leaned into the uniqueness that this was a period MCU movie with its retro-futuristic 1960s aesthetic and optimism as well as introducing Marvel's first family, and the threat of new big baddie Galactus.


	PLFs and Imax are contributing a huge 40% of the weekend with 3D alone accounting for 13%. The movie is playing evenly throughout the United States and Canada, but best in South, South Central and West. AMC Disney Springs in Orlando is the highest grossing location so far with just over $176K. 


	Definite recommend has upticked to 72% which is right around where Superman was at 74%. The Latino/Hispanic and Asian American moviegoer turnout was higher on First Steps than Superman respectively with (31% to 26%) and (11% to 9%). Black moviegoers turnout was even between both movies at 19%. Caucasian was bigger on Superman over Marvel's first family, 41% to 34%. 


	Under 35 turnout on First Steps is 71% to Superman‘s 66%. Overall, again, very similar demos between the movies with Fantastic Four showing men over 25 (40%) to Superman‘s 43%; men under 25 at 29% to Superman‘s 25%, women over 25 at 20% to 19%, and women under 25 at 11% to 13%. Male to female split at 69%/31% is close to par with Gunn's Man of Steel pic.


	This weekend for all titles is coming in at $194M, which is -32% off from a year ago when MCU delivered the biggest opening for a R-rated movie in Deadpool & Wolverine ($211.4M), that Shawn Levy-directed movie driving a $284.8M overall Friday-Sunday.


	We'll have more updates as the weekend goes on in this crazy San Diego Comic-Con weekend. Speaking of Gunn, he'll be down here showing off the second season of DC HBO's Peacemaker season 2. Amazon MGM Studios is also here with Ryan Gosling and Project Hail Mary with Ketchup Entertainment showing off the first public footage of the Warner Bros-made Coyote vs. Acme this morning.

	10. Oh Hi! (SPC) 886 theaters, Fri $743K, 3-day $1.5M/Wk 1


FRIDAY MIDDAY UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps is looking a lot like DC's Superman right now in its opening: an estimated $56 million Friday and a three-day total of around $125M.


	Family movies, and this is Marvel's first family, tend to see a lot of walk-up business on Saturday, so that's working in the Matt Shakman-directed movie's favor. We'll monitor changing demos throughout the weekend, but Superman pulled in 31% parents and kids (9% under 12). Fantastic Four pulled in 7% kids under 12 last night with a 93% general audience according to Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak. The under-35 crowd was massive last night at 70% versus Superman‘s 66%. Friday's cume of course includes last night's $24.4M in previews.


	Exits are very good: 70% definite recommend from the main audience and 70% from kids under 12. 


	We'll have more updates as they come.

First Steps' Thursday night alone also came close to toppling the opening weekend of the previous Fox-Marvel movie Fantastic Four from Josh Trank, which debuted to $25.6M. The original Tim Story-directed Fantastic Four at Fox debuted to $56M, with the 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Silver Surfer opening to $58M.


	MCU's take starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner will beat that opening, as its earlier-week projections were for $100M-$110M.


	iSpot shows that Disney had a lower spend on Fantastic Four on linear than Warner Bros did on Superman, $14.6M-$28.1M. Disney's campaign reached 950 million household TV ad impressions while Superman‘s hit 1.52 billion. Fantastic Four: First Steps spot ran during NBA games (17.7%), Good Morning America (3.5%), SportsCenter (3.4%), Bachelor in Paradise (2.7%) and MLB games (2.7%). The top networks for First Steps spots by impressions were ABC (31.0%), ESPN (8.5%), FX (6.8%), Freeform (6.3%) and National Geographic (4.6%). Note the above doesn't include cross-promo spots Disney had with other brands.


	Here's how the rest of the week went:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,275 theaters, Thu $4.76M (-28% from Wed), Week $86.8M (-51%), Total $264.6M/Wk 2


	2.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 3,854 theaters, Thu $2.38M (-12%), Week $35.7M (-41%), Total $288.5M/Wk 3


	3.) I Know What You Did Last Summer (Sony) 3,206 theaters, Thu $1M (-16%), Week $18.4M/Wk 1

	











	4.) Smurfs (Par) 3,504 theaters, Thu $1.26M (-9%), Week $17.4M/Wk 1 


	5.) F1 (Apple/WB), 3,094 theaters, Thu $1.13M (-13%), Week $15.3M (-26%), Total $159.3M/Wk 4 


PREVIOUS EXCLUSIVE, Thursday PM: Superhero movies aren't dead, silly. The second comic-book movie in the past two weeks, Disney/Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps is conquering around $23 million in previews tonight that began at 2 p.m.. Domestic outlook was $100M-$110M, but the Matt Shakman-directed movie is bound to shoot higher. The numbers are from sources, not Disney.


	These mark the best previews for an MCU title year to date, double that of Thunderbolts* ($11.5M, $31.8M Friday, $74.3M opening) and 92% higher than Captain America: Brave New World ($12M, $40.9M Friday, $88.8M 3-day). First Steps‘ current RT critic score is 88% and audience is 92% for the 1960s-futuristic-themed movie, which are close to the respective figures of Thunderbolts* (88%/93%), and critically higher than last summer's Deadpool & Wolverine (78%) and about the same with that R-rated MCU title's audience rating (94%).


Fantastic Four‘s Thursday is also the 12th time that an MCU movie has posted previews north of $20M+ (2019's Avengers: Endgame still owns the all-time domestic preview record with $60M). 


	Tonight's figure is similar to the $22.5M previews that James Gunn's Superman did two Thursdays ago (granted, that figure included an extra $2.8M in Amazon Prime member advance screenings). For those with short memories, Superman went on to do a $56.1M Friday (of which previews repped 40%) and an opening of $125M off an A- CinemaScore, 84% Rotten Tomatoes critics score and 92% audience rating.


	Social media analytics firm RelishMix reports that Fantastic Four is the first movie of the year to break the billion mark in regards to social media reach across TikTok, Facebook, X, Instagram and YouTube, ahead of Jurassic World Rebirth (921M) and Superman (953M). Other movies with a billion followers on social media include 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home (1.2 billion) and Deadpool & Wolverine (1.15 billion).


	RelishMix says “this cast is fully social and nearly completely activated, especially after the world premiere red carpet, including Pedro Pascal at 11.4M, Joseph Quinn at 5.6M, Vanessa Kirby at 2.6M and Julia Garner at 1.5M.”


	The analytics org reports, “Convo on The Fantastic Four: First Steps is running positive as fans are interested in Marvel delving into the ‘60s retro-futurist setting and the promise of a new chapter for the comics universe. Comments include, ‘Setting it in the '60s was a good idea. This looks better than the previous Fantastic Four movies.' and ‘This is maybe the first Marvel film I'm genuine excited for — can't wait to see it.' The individuality of the film is alluring to many: ‘So excited to get a new Marvel film where I haven't had to watch hours of existing movies/shows as a prerequisite for watching!' The film's villain, Galactus, is a cool element for many: ‘Galactus is Coming this movie is about to be Fantastic!' and, ‘The shadow of that helmet — chills.'”

I've been on the fence about Eddington because of Phoenix. He's never thrilled me as an actor and his last few movies I didn't care for.

There was clearly a lot of interest in First Steps, and this is probably going to be the most successful of the three attempts to make this a franchise (it may not be as profitable as the lower-budgeted 2005 film, we'll see).  I get the impression the production team and cast did a great job.  

And I just did not want to see it.  I had to see Superman.  I saw it on its first Friday  I saw it again this past Friday.  And now it's grossed about as much as Man of Steel did in its entire run–in just three weekends.  It's just around the 500mil WW mark.  After three weekends.  And for all the talk about ticket price inflation, the real story is that post-pandemic theater attendance remains far below where it was in 2013.  To the point where I'd guess it cancels out inflation.  

How much people want to see a film is one thing.  How much they enjoy it–quite another. Legs still matter.  But in this current era of motion picture distribution, streaming #'s matter a hell of a lot, and we can't go just by ticket sales anymore.  A lot of people are not ready to return to the multiplexes, and after being in two over the past few weeks–hard to blame them.  It takes a lot to get me there.  Superman (and Krypto) got me there.

Nolan's THE ODYSSEY will sell more IMAX tickets a year before its release than First Steps would do in his entire Box Office run. 

That's a power Disney/Marvel NEVER will be able to do.

118mi wknd did not sounds good in my book.
And that -42% HUGE Friday-to-Saturday decline only proves me that people was in the Friday Premiere only for the ‘AVATAR FIRE AND ASH' Exclusive trailer

The Avatar movies are massive at the box office, but I don't find many die hard fans of them. To watch an entire movie just for a trailer takes die hard fandom. I would guess the heavy front loading is due to the Fantastic Four comic fandom rushing out to see the MCU version of these characters.

Superman made 12 millions less than than the new Jurassic Park in one less week. How is it a disappointment, again?

Studios don't discriminate against foreign currency. Superman is probably going to make $150mil less than Jurassic World worldwide.

I think getting to >$300mil domestic should count as a win for Superman, most people didn't expect more. Doing less than $300mil internationally, when Man of Steel made $380mil there 12 years ago is very bad though.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Jamie Lee Curtis Says She's Been “Self-Retiring” & “Prepping To Get Out” After Watching Her Parents Be “Rejected” By Hollywood As They Aged","https://deadline.com/2025/07/jamie-lee-curtis-retiring-aging-hollywood-freakier-friday-1236469819/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 00:42:00 GMT","


					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


	Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis opened up about her considerations of retirement and Hollywood's aging problem in relation to her parents, icons of the industry Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis.


	In an extensive interview with The Guardian tied to the upcoming Aug. 8 release of Disney's Freakier Friday, the Halloween actress slammed the entertainment world's treatment of older actors, particularly women. 


	“I witnessed my parents lose the very thing that gave them their fame and their life and their livelihood, when the industry rejected them at a certain age,” she explained. “I watched them reach incredible success and then have it slowly erode to where it was gone. And that's very painful.”

	Because of this, Curtis added, “I have been self-retiring for 30 years. I have been prepping to get out, so that I don't have to suffer the same as my family did. I want to leave the party before I'm no longer invited.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the accompanying photoshoot for the story, Curtis donned oversized plastic lips to lambast the rise of cosmetic surgery over recent years, and the pressure women feel to alter themselves. Two months ago, she told 60 Minutes that she once had plastic surgery at 25 following a derogatory remark about her appearance and “regretted it immediately and have kind of sort of regretted it since.”


	“The wax lips is my statement against plastic surgery,” The Bear star said of the aesthetic choice. “I've been very vocal about the genocide of a generation of women by the cosmeceutical industrial complex, who've disfigured themselves. The wax lips really sends it home.”

	











	Defending her use of the word “genocide,” she added: “I've used that word for a long time and I use it specifically because it's a strong word. I believe that we have wiped out a generation or two of natural human [appearance]. The concept that you can alter the way you look through chemicals, surgical procedures, fillers — there's a disfigurement of generations of predominantly women who are altering their appearances. And it is aided and abetted by AI, because now the filter face is what people want. I'm not filtered right now. The minute I lay a filter on and you see the before and after, it's hard not to go: ‘Oh, well that looks better.' But what's better? Better is fake. And there are too many examples — I will not name them — but very recently we have had a big onslaught through media, many of those people.”


	Alongside the soon-to-be-released followup to 2003's Freaky Friday, Curtis will star in a Murder, She Wrote reboot; is producing The Lost Bus, a film based on the 2018 Camp Fire starring Matthew McConaughey; and starring and executive producing Scarpetta, based on Patricia Cornwell best-selling novels, which is already picked up for two seasons at Prime Video, alongside Nicole Kidman. She will also produce and star in the psychological horror film Sender, alongside Britt Lower, David Dastmalchian and Anna Baryshnikov, and appear in James L. Brooks' dramedy Ella McCay, also starring Woody Harrelson, Emma Mackey, Ayo Edebiri, Rebecca Hall and Albert Brooks.

I love you Jamie. You go Girl. You stated the issue so well. You inspire my generation of women and I'm not even an actress.

Hollywood is particularly hard on older women, but it isn't alone. Society is hard on women over 45. Retirement is 62-70 but most industries reject women over 45. That's a big gap.

This is so annoying – she won an Oscar two years ago and has a recurring role on the best show on y
Shut up

These is much truth in this attitude towards aging in general and in Hollywood in particular, especially towards women.  However, this has been changing, not least in part due to actors like Curtis as well as more enlightened producers and directors.  Also, the dominant Baby Boomer generation has created a demand for content that is about and includes older actors.

You're the one on the bubble. Jamie Lee is the most grounded person I've seen in the business. It's like you didn't even read the article, because you just wanted to trash her.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ozzy Osbourne scores first trailer for Peacemaker season two","https://www.avclub.com/sdcc-2025-peacemaker-season-2-trailer-ozzy-osbourne","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 00:29:00 GMT","

After his cameo in Superman, John Cena's Peacemaker is ready to take center stage. At San Diego Comic-Con today, the wrestler-turned-actor took the stage in costume to sit for a panel about the show. And as the trailer for season two, released alongside the panel, depicts, Chris Smith (aka Peacemaker) wants things to be different than how they were in season one, all the way back in 2022. 

“I don't wanna be a joke anymore,” the character intones in voiceover as clips role of Peacemaker riding a motorcycle and Chris nuzzling a bald eagle roll. “I wanna be a real hero.” “You wear a clown costume. You go out and beat up people,” responds Jennifer Holland's Emilia Harcourt. But Peacemaker's not the only one thinking about the past—it seems like Rick Flag Sr. wants to avenge his son's death after his end at Peacemaker's hands in 2021's The Suicide Squad. Also, there are portals to parallel worlds, of course. 



At the panel in San Diego, Gunn confirmed (via Total Film) that season two of Peacemaker picks up about one month after the events of Superman, and that we can expect Guy Gardener and Hawkgirl in the first episode. And while Gunn did confirm that there would have “a lot more modern bands” than the glam metal-centric soundtrack for season one. That said, Ozzy Osbourne does score the trailer released today, and Total Film reports that his music will also feature in the season. 

Peacemaker season two adds Frank Grillo, David Denman, Sol Rodriguez, and Tim Meadows to its returning cast of John Cena, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, and Robert Patrick. Season two premieres on HBO Max on August 21 at 9 pm ET.

Kelly Osbourne shared a touching moment with her late father Ozzy Osbourne in a clip she shared to social media on Saturday, July 26.

She took to her Instagram Stories to re-share a clip from his A&E show “Jack & Ozzy's World Detour.” The words, “One of the best Ozzy moments ever!” was written on top of the video. 

A post shared by Lily Kelsey (@weeniedogadventures)

The heartwarming clip showed Ozzy getting into a motorhome that his daughter was driving. She proceeded to tell him, “Morning, I got this song in my head I have to play it for you.”

Kelly Osbourne began to play the song “Paradise” by George Ezra. She started to sing along to it, and the two ended up having a brief jam session as it played. Both danced in unison as the song continued.

“I love you,” Kelly told her iconic father. He responded with, “I love you more.”

The 40-year-old previously took to her Instagram Story after Ozzy passed to express her sadness. 

Kelly posted the lyrics to the classic Black Sabbath song “Changes.” She previously recorded the song with her dad as a duet in 2003.

“I feel unhappy I am so sad. I lost the best friend I ever had,” Kelly wrote. She added a broken heart emoji.

The family released a statement about Ozzy Osbourne's passing on Tuesday, July 22. 

“It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the statement read. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”

It continued, “We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” The statement had the names of his wife Sharon Osbourne as well as four of his children, Jack, Kelly, Aimee and Louis.

Friends and fans have taken to social media to express their sadness over the tragic news.

Icon Jon Bon Jovi expressed his sadness for the Osbourne family on social media. “Much luv to Sharon and the beautiful Osbourne Family,” he wrote. “So sorry to hear of your loss. Rest easy Ozzy.”

Singer Elton John added how he lost a friend. “He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods — a true legend,” he shared on social media. “He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met.”

The rocker was 76 at the time of his death. Over the years, he was very open about his health struggles as he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Sky Hogan is mourning the loss of her husband, wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, after his death on Thursday, July 24. The 71-year-old WWE legend died of cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater Beach, Florida. In a heartfelt message posted to Instagram on Friday, Sky shared her devastation, writing, “My heart is in pieces.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Sky, who married the Hulkster in 2023, revealed that Hogan had been dealing with health issues, though she believed he would recover. “I had so much faith in his strength,” she wrote. “I thought we still had more time.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Reflecting on his unwavering commitment to his supporters, Sky described how much Hogan cherished his fans, even as his health declined.

“You meant everything to him,” she said. “He would have done anything for you.”

While fans around the world knew him as Hulk Hogan, Sky remembered him simply as Terry, the man she loved. “This loss is sudden and impossible to process. To the world, he was a legend… but to me, he was my Terry. My partner. My heart.”

In the months leading up to his passing, Hulk Hogan had undergone an intensive spinal procedure known as a four-level Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Fusion (ACDF). The May surgery, which impacted his spine, vocal cords, and breathing, left him in a fragile state, requiring frequent hospital visits as part of a long recovery.

His wife, Sky Daily, had previously addressed concerns about his health earlier this month, shutting down speculation about his condition. “His heart is strong, and there was never any lack of oxygen or brain damage,” she said at the time. “None of those rumors are true. He's been recovering from a major surgery with a long and layered healing process.”

Hulk Hogan, born Terry Bollea, died on Thursday, July 24, at 71. According to TMZ, the WWE Hall of Famer went into cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida.

Suri Cruise, the only child of former couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, was spotted looking stunning as she strolled the streets of New York City on July 9, 2025. The 19-year-old wore a flowy low-rise skirt and cropped white tank top. She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag.

In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. The story says Suri's masterful use of interesting accessories elevates her basics to a level of street coolness. 

According to Hello! magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. “Of course, I will miss the close proximity, but I'm really proud of her and I'm happy,” the outlet says mom Katie Holmes told Town & Country about Suri's new chapter. 

A post shared by Elder Ordonez (@elderordonez1)

Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season.

A post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes)

“I can't wait to get back into a tank top. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. She also named “nice, simple slip dresses” as an essential. 

But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. “Wearing a glamorous dress to the ballet or opera makes me feel like I am the New York woman I dreamt of being when I was a little girl,” she told the “Fashion Bible.”

Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.”

The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans.

“JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters.

“You know you triggered an entire generation with this post,” teased another, before adding, “Cannot wait to see the project.”

A third fan quoted the show's famous line, “I remember everything,” and punctuated it with a crying emoji.

Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Doctor Who Tried to Rescue Beloved Malcolm-Jamal Warner Speaks Out","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-doctor-rescue-details/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 01:56:02 GMT","

The doctor who tried to save the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner is sharing his story. The doctor recalled how he pulled Warner out of the “rough” Costa Rica ocean and brought him to shore.

A post shared by Jennifer Hudson (@iamjhud)

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, the doctor, who asked not to be identified by name, shared that he was enjoying his vacation at the time of the incident.

“I was about 200 meters from the incident, at Playa Grande, spending the day on vacation with my partner,” he recalled. “There were very few people on the beach, and the sea was rough.”

According to the outlet, the doctor heard people calling for help. “I ran to the area and entered the sea with my surfboard, heading into the rip current toward the person being pointed at by some beachgoers,” the doctor shared. 

He continued, “After a few minutes, I saw a shadow, dove down and pulled the person out.”

The doctor got back to the beach and found another man lying on the sand who was struggling to breathe. “[He was] just someone who tried to help during the emergency, without any rescue equipment,” the doctor noted.

He went on to describe the emergency personnel who arrived on scene. “Immediately, [first responders] began providing first aid to Malcolm, but he had no vital signs,” the doctor recalled. 

He added, “Two tourists ran over to help. They identified themselves as doctors, making a total of three physicians at the scene.”

Red Cross personnel arrived and used specialized equipment, including a defibrillator, but Warner did not respond. He was pronounced dead at the scene at age 54.

The other man was transported to a local medical clinic and was later released.

“The people who take part in this kind of rescue are always deeply affected,” the doctor shared. “You have to understand it's not easy, and it also takes time to heal.”

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

Elberth León, head of the Tourist Police for Costa Rica's Atlantic region, initially said Warner's 8-year-old daughter was in the water with him and was rescued, but new reports say otherwise.

Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) confirmed she was on the shore at the time of the incident, People reports.

“Mr. Warner was playing with his daughter at the seashore at one point. He then left her out of the water, and he and a friend of his entered the sea,” the statement read.

“It was at that moment that they were swept away by the current, and the friend managed to get out,” the statement noted. “However, Mr. Warner was unable to get out and was pulled out by several people on the beach. He received care from Red Cross officials, but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

The actor's cause of death was ruled “asphyxiation by submersion.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Inside Steve Jobs' Daughter's $6.7 Million Wedding","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/steve-jobs-daughter-marries-harry-charles/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 01:54:26 GMT","

Eve Jobs, the youngest daughter of Apple visionary Steve Jobs, has tied the knot with British Olympian Harry Charles. The couple got married in a lavish countryside ceremony that blended tech-world prestige with old-world charm. 

As per reports, the 27-year-old model and equestrian exchanged vows with Charles, 26, inside the picturesque St Michael's and All Angels Church in Great Tew, England.

A post shared by Eve Jobs (@evejobs)

Guests arrived in dinner jackets and elegant dresses for the countryside affair, which reportedly cost $6.7 million. The wedding was orchestrated by top-tier event planner Stanlee Gatti, according to The U.S. Sun.

Bruce Springsteen's daughter, Jessica Springsteen, served as one of nine bridesmaids, all dressed in matching red satin cocktail gowns. Page six reported that the bride herself arrived fashionably late, about 30 minutes via a private road, and left the church with her new husband in a luxury Mercedes van.

Locals described the wedding as something out of a movie. “The sleepy village…feels like it's turning into a no-go zone,” a source told the U.S. Sun. “There are secret service operatives and blokes who look like they work for the FBI.”

“This is a very quiet place not far from the Cotswolds,” they added. “Everyone is used to tourists and famous faces, but this is something else.”

Hello magazine reported that, although the wedding ceremony was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. local time, guests continued to arrive by the busload as anticipation built in the quiet village of Great Tew.

Among the high-profile attendees expected at the event were former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and her daughter, Phoebe, as well as Princess Beatrice and Jennifer Gates, daughter of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

The guest list also included an eclectic mix of stars: Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders, Jessica Springsteen, renowned Apple designer Jony Ive, and Sofia Abramovich, daughter of former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.

Adding even more buzz to the already star-studded affair, former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron — a neighbor with a home nearby — was rumored to attend.

At the same time, reality star Kourtney Kardashian was spotted in the area ahead of the big day.

The pair went public with their relationship during the 2024 Paris Olympics, where Harry helped Team Great Britain take home the gold in team show jumping. Eve shared a sweet Instagram video of the moment he ran to hug her post-victory, writing: “TEAM GOLD!!!!! Beyond proud of you my love!!!!”

They made it Instagram official soon after, with Eve posting a snap captioned, “golden.” Charles later told Tatler he planned to “go over to the States” and “spend some time with [his] girlfriend, Eve.”

“We're just going to sit and enjoy and reflect on it,” he added.

“RHOBH” alum Lisa Rinna is back from filming “Traitors” season 4 in Scotland. She called the experience “harder than anything,” including “Dancing With the Stars” and performing on Broadway. 

Rinna told her husband Harry Hamlin on their podcast “Let's Not Talk About the Husband” that the people who participate in the show are “badasses … fierce badasses.”

Hamlin jokingly asked his wife if he should be worried, asking her, “So you came home a fierce badass. Should I get my flack jacket on? Do I need to put a helmet on?” Rinna responded, “Have I been nice so far? Have I bit your head off yet? No.”

Rinna couldn't say much about her experience, explaining to Hamlin, “… I'm under an NDA and I would have to kill you.” She then summed up her experience with maybe a bit of a tongue-in-cheek comment, “Fun. All good. Fun, fun, fun.”

One thing Rinna could share about filming “Traitors” was the fact that her phone was taken away while filming. And she was so grateful that it did. “They take your phone from you … And I will tell you, it was the greatest thing to ever happen,” she told Hamlin. 

She continued, “I needed to be in rehab detox for my phone, and I never would have done it.” Rinna explained that while, like so many people, she's basically addicted to her phone, it was freeing to not have access to it. 

“I didn't have to look at an email. I didn't have to do anything,” she shared. “The only responsibility I had was to play the game. That's it.” 

She also explained that since returning from the U.K., she's been able to limit her screen time like never before. “… Now that I'm back in reality … I have to answer people and do some things, but I'm not fully back,” she said.

In June, the “Traitors” season 4 cast was revealed, and Rinna was not the only “Real Housewives” star on the roster. The cast includes Candiace Dillard Bassett of “RHOP,” Caroline Stanbury of Bravo's “Ladies of London” and “RHODubai,” Dorinda Medley of “RHONY” and Porsha Williams of “RHOA.”  

Other cast members include “DWTS” alum Mark Ballas, Olympic figure skating champions Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, Stephen Colletti of “Laguna Beach” fame, “RuPaul's Drag Race” alum Monét X Change,  Donna Kelce, mother of Travis and and Jason Kelce, Rob Rausch from “Love Island,” and more. 

“Traitors” season 4 does not yet have a premiere date, but is expected to air in early 2026.

Last week on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Steve Buscemi — from… well, everything — revealed that long before he was famous, he often found himself in rooms with casting agents and directors unable to connect at all.

“I was always hot and cold,” Buscemi explained. “I never knew if I should wing it, cause sometimes I'd be good if I went in the room and I didn't really prepare. And then, the next time I'd do it, I would fail.”

And Buscemi has auditioned for the best of the best — including “Rain Man” filmmaker Barry Levinson when he was working on the 1987 movie “Tin Men.” He decided he had to “really prepare” for the meeting. “And I studied the sides, the script, and went in there and did my reading… did my audition, and he looked at me and went, ‘That was really good. That's really good, Steve. Alright. Let's do it again, but this time try it…' and he gave me a very specific note.”

Buscemi listen and took the note. He was ready for another try. “And then I read it again the exact same way I just did,” he chuckled. “There was this silence and we both just looked at each other. I think I even said, ‘That was the same, wasn't it?' And he said, ‘Yeah, it's OK, it's OK.' Needless to say, I did not get that part.”

 










Another time he auditioned for EGOT-winner Mike Nichols and casting director Juliet Taylor, even though he knew he had a conflict. “My agent at the time said, ‘No, no, no. Just go. When are you gonna have an opportunity to meet these people?” So off Bescemi went, and he killed it… but when he revealed he couldn't make the shooting dates, Taylor stared at him and said, “What is wrong with you?”

Of course, Buscemi has proven himself several times over — enough to impress the Emmys (he has one on eight nominations) — in such diverse projects as “Fargo,” “30 Rock,” “Reservoir Dogs,” and “Boardwalk Empire.” It's a resume that doesn't need regurgitating. He's become such a recognizable face, in fact, he can play himself on “The Studio” in a season that also had cameos from legends like Martin Scorsese and Charlize Theron, also playing themselves.

Buscemi is far from the only famous actor to struggle with an audition — even a now-A-lister like Hugh Jackman, who has since gone from Wolverine to “The Music Man,” bungled what might've been his big break: the Benjamin Bratt role in “Miss Congeniality” — an experienced he described as “humiliating.”

“No one knew X-Men yet. I was a nobody,” Jackson once told Variety, though in spite of his unknown status he had the opportunity to shoot his audition with Sandra Bullock. He recalled thinking, “‘Holy shit! She's amazing! And so quick and fast. I'm not even vaguely up to speed here.' I was pedaling as fast as I could, but I didn't know the script well enough.”

 










Years before her own series “Girls” made her a household name, Lena Dunham auditioned for Penny Marshall's 2001 film “Riding in Cars With Boys,” and it did not go well… though not in a traumatic way.

“When I was 12, I met Penny Marshall in a failed audition for a film, ‘Riding in Cars With Boys.' And that was really big for me,” Dunham related on “The Jess Cagle Show.” “I was treated actually really well. There was no cruelty. The only thing I'll say is I understand why I didn't get the role.

Dunham explained that Marshall asked each of the young performers to tell her their names, heights, where they were from, and… then… to smile. “And I said, I'm Lena, I'm from New York, and I don't smile on command.' And Penny Marshall said, ‘It's called acting, honey.'”

Dunham, now an experienced director (whose “Good Sex” is filming now with Natalie Portman, Meg Ryan, and Mark Ruffalo), now sees things Marshall's way. “The thing is, she was right,” Dunham said. “Would you hire an actor who is like I'm sorry, I can't smile on command?' The thing is, I'm with Penny on this one.”

You win some. You lose some. You learn some.

“Groove Is in the Heart,” the debut single of quintessential New York dance act Deee-Lite, was a blur of frantic tambourine jingles, slide whistles, a stuttering Eva Gabor sample, Bootsy Collins interjections, a Q-Tip verse, and lyrical references to succotash and Horton Hears a Who!. No wonder the beguiling track caught on like a polyester body suit on fire. “We're going to dance… We're going to dance… We're going to dance, and have some fun.” As introductory proclamations go, those words were nearly as direct and promising as, “Let there be light.”

Radio was ready for the trio. The single, which sported a four-on-the-floor stomp, was released a little more than a month after the first house song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Madonna's “Vogue,” wrapped its three-week stretch at the summit. In the summer of 1990, house-inflected dance pop was hot. Deee-Lite's smash sounded like many things (chiefly Herbie Hancock's “Bring Down the Birds,” from which “Groove” cribbed its bassline), but nothing quite sounded like it, not even within the group's own discography. Its popularity was boosted by its video, in which Deee-Lite vamp in front of psychedelic displays that at times approximate moving tie-dyes. The video opens with singer Lady Miss Kier asking questions that seem both self-explanatory and impossible to answer correctly (“How do you say deee-groovy? How do you say deee-gorgeous?”). What's notable is not merely how weird everything is, but how confidently it's delivered. If the public was confused, Deee-Lite surely weren't.

Their pride—combined with their thrifted '70s looks—brought a downtown New York aesthetic to mainstream culture. Deee-Lite ran in the same circles as the “club kids” who became talk-show staples in the early '90s (RuPaul and Michael Alig among them). They might have come off as intimidatingly cool if their song, whose main hook consisted of Kier singing the words of the title four times in different catchy iterations, weren't so accessible.

Deee-Lite had spent most of the late '80s gigging around New York (specifically downtown Manhattan), building a reputation as purveyors of retro pop-funk and eventually house music, which already taken hold in major U.S. metros like Chicago and New York. The road to Deee-Lite kicked off in 1982, when Youngstown, Ohio-born textiles designer Kierin Magenta Kirby (eventually Lady Miss Kier) met Ukrainian émigré Dmitry Brill (Supa DJ Dmitry) in Washington Square Park, among the NYU students, strung-out gutter hypes, and guys selling fake weed. They soon entered a romantic relationship that lasted some 13 years. Dmitry had taken piano lessons back home in the former U.S.S.R. and moved to New York in 1979 at age 15. Clubland lured him and he DJed at places like the Pyramid, the Red Zone, and Nell's. Kier would go-go dance at parties thrown by nightlife legend Susanne Bartsch and work the coat check at Limelight (she claimed to have been fired for blowing her nose on someone's fur coat).

The third Deee-Lite member, the Korean Japanese producer Towa Tei, didn't move to New York until 1987, the year after Deee-Lite officially formed. After he arrived from Japan, Towa started hanging out at Afrochine and, one night, he passed a DJ tape he'd made to Dmitry, who was spinning at the club. Kier credited Towa for blessing the group with its “techno” side. “We were all going to schools at some point, but we all dropped out and I guess we got hooked up in the club scene because it was fun,” she said. New York stories don't get more classic than that.

Deee-Lite honed their sound against the commercial rise of house music. Starting in the '80s, major labels kept their eyes on Europe and snatched up acts that hit there—even American ones. After Steve “Silk” Hurley's “Jack Your Body” became the first house song to hit No. 1 in the UK in 1987, his J.M. Silk project signed to RCA. To Select, Kier acknowledged how the success of Technotronic and Soul II Soul opened doors for her group, explaining, “If it wasn't for them getting in the pop charts we wouldn't have got anywhere.” Early on, Deee-Lite sent out a demo to every major label, according to Details. The only response was from a label calling it “completely unoriginal.” A few years later, during the dance-pop frenzy, they caused a bidding war. They eventually signed a reported seven-album deal with Elektra.

Deee-Lite were the rare self-produced early '90s dance pop act with a vision. They imagined the vibes and connectedness of a good party on a global scale, preaching unity and peace on their first album and then wading into specifics like the broken judicial system, safe sex in the time of AIDS, and environmental collapse on their second, 1992's Infinity Within. The group plausibly claimed it had “total creative control” in a 1991 interview with Keyboard. Their messaging was intentionally simplistic—Kier told Select that they crafted their lyrics so 5 year olds could understand them. “It's really easy to over-intellectualize things, to satisfy your ego by certain words, but it doesn't go right with the age of communication,” said the frontwoman.

After “Groove” became one of the defining singles of the '90s, Deee-Lite enjoyed “it” status. They played SNL and performed in front of the massive crowd at Rock and Rio II. They were on the covers of magazines like Spin and Paper. They walked Thierry Mugler's runway. The group's first album, World Clique, went gold (as did “Groove”) and spawned two additional No. 1s on Billboard's Club Play chart, “Power of Love” and “Good Beat.” But ubiquity had a downside, especially in the early '90s when selling out was a thing that the self-consciously cool deliberately avoided. “The fame quickly turned to shame because all of a sudden, we felt like we were in the same category with what we always detested, which is overexposed, force-fed. We didn't ask anyone to play our song 13 times a day,” Kier told Project X in 1994.

“Groove” threatened to swallow what the rest of Deee-Lite was about, including their wide-ranging sound (funk icons Bootsy Collins, Maceo Parker, and Fred Wesley played on the group's first two albums and toured with them). Infinity Within not only built on World Clique's socially aware ethos but became more inward-looking and specific in its politics. It also presented a new look for the band that dipped further back in time to the visual aesthetic of the 1950s. Kier wore beatnik stripes and a beret in promo shots and posed like a pinup on the album's cover. Deee-Lite were doing eras before people were calling them eras.

And then, for 1994's Dewdrops in the Garden, another pivot. “As much as I liked the last album, it was a little over-produced and a little too slick,” Kier told Mixmag. Infinity Within had bangers, but a few of its housey numbers sported the kind of muted bass that tends to suggest music for radio and not the club. The low end on Dewdrops, though, was robust, at times gurgling. This was an album made for the club. Kier told Mixmag that a lot of the songs were written “literally on the dance floor.” She explained, ”If something came to me, I made sure I brought a Walkman and would really feel the crowd and write right there, down there in the DJ booth writing some hook.” Dmitry, meanwhile, played Dewdrops drafts while DJing and modified the songs based on the crowds' reactions.

On Dewdrops, Deee-Lite took their cues from rave culture, and the techno and breakbeat hardcore influences meant a tougher, sometimes acidic sound. It was still housey in parts, but icier—more Slam than Tony Humphries. The group once again revamped their look, with Kier rocking pigtails and sportier duds. Without the big hair and over-the-top vintage attire of their first two albums, the considerable and repeatedly acknowledged influence of Kier's drag queen peers fell to the wayside during the Dewdrops era. She explained, “People are dancing for 10 hours straight, including me, so you're dressing more for the dance floor, for the long stretch, you know? If you're going to a three-day rave in the mountains, you want to be comfortable.”

Kier's then-recent travels found her not just at mountain raves, but in the Hopi ruins and amid the pyramids of the Yucatan. The psychedelia on Dewdrops is more explicit than ever—“Music Selector Is the Soul Reflector” integrates a recording by Timothy Leary and there's a song called “DMT” (short for “Dance Music Trance”—sure, Jan). In opener “Say Ahhh…” she raps about “Rolling Phillies, acting silly.” The group had long been open about their drug use, and in a 2006 interview, Kier attributed her vocal training to LSD. In addition to good vibes, the drugs also had Deee-Lite dropping out… at least of the kind of specific political commentary that partly defined their previous album. Lyrically, Dewdrops was “more about personal politics rather than global,” according to a Kier quote in its press release. It continues: “We're going back to our original concept… People have enough problems, they don't have to hear it in music. Just making uplifting music is a political statement in itself.”

Tenuous as that reasoning may have been, it's certainly true that Dewdrops' tracks mostly focus on matters of the heart and feet. Roughly half of the album is dance cuts, and the other half is midtempo, hip-hop inflected material, complete with rapping from Kier, whose relaxed flow avoids try-hard affect and casts her as a missing link between Queen Latifah at her most laid-back and Kitty Pryde. There's also scratching from new member DJ Ani (Ani Q. Schempf), who filled in for Towa Tei while he was away making his solo debut, Future Listening! The midtempos skew horny—three songs discuss petting in various intensities (“Say Ahh…,” “Apple Juice Kissing,” and the perfectly titled “Stay in Bed, Forget the Rest”), but even “Picnic in the Summertime,” an ode to “watching people have a good time” in a city park, contains the killer couplet: “Come at me like a panther/'Cause you know yes is my answer.”

Interspersed among these odes to interpersonal connection are what appear to be breakup songs. Deee-Lite had released breakup songs before, but “Bittersweet Loving” and “Somebody” seemed to speak to something immediate. According to Mixmag, Kier and Dmitry split in 1993, resulting in palpable tension: “At the photo session, Kier is asked to put her head on Dmitry's stomach, and she hesitates.” In 2006, though, the Sydney Morning Herald printed that they'd actually split in 1995, after Dewdrops had run its course, and quoted Kier as saying, “When Dmitry and I split up, that was the end of the band. It was sad because I loved the band. I didn't want to leave the band and the music and I missed my writing partner, but we couldn't get along.” Perhaps they were on-again-off-again for a while. People can be as hard to quit as cigarettes.

Deee-Lite assembled Dewdrops using trusted musical tools, but they'd been sharpened. Since the beginning, Deee-Lite had espoused the virtues of sampling, but Dewdrops is a veritable shrine to the craft. There's even an interlude, “Sampladelic,” that acknowledges this ethos. Sources vary from Earth, Wind & Fire to industrial band Die Warzau to hip-hop-adjacent dancehall toaster Super Cat to the Monkees. It's a veritable crate-digger's smorgasbord. Some songs are patchworks—“Apple Juice Kissing” borrows the groove of the Clash's “Armagideon Time,” the lead guitar from Jamaican dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson's “Loraine,” and drums from the Detroit Emeralds' “You're Getting a Little Too Smart” (a classic break that's been sampled hundreds of times). “Party Happening People” swivels between swing house (à la “Horny” by Cajmere, aka Green Velvet) and an Amen break (though not at jungle velocity—it was still early). “DMT” speeds up the break from Kool & the Gang's “N.T.”

The vintage textures, particularly on the dance tracks, help distinguish the material from the group's contemporaries and yet situate it within a larger musical history. It's effective thrifting. Deee-Lite often discussed their fealty to style over fashion (“Fashion is something you buy, style is something you acquire,” said Dmitry) and they applied this principle to music as well as visual aesthetics. It's the concert of sensibilities and sources that made Deee-Lite stand out from the pack. “Call Me,” the only track that Towa worked on, incorporates the bleepy sound of landline dial tones. In the single, “Bring Me Your Love,” they reproduce the main draw of Lil Louis' “French Kiss,” slowing down the track only to speed it back up. During re-liftoff, the disco string hits start flying like throwing stars and an album that is bubbling with energy unveils yet another way to zoom.

In general, the uptempos avoid traditional structures—the approach to songwriting is track-y, which is to say that rarely do eight bars go by without a change, and rarely are these changes anything less than catchy as fuck. Dewdrops' songs are at times chains of hooks. “Bittersweet Loving” has seven distinct motifs that thrive on repetition. Kier's innate musicality is on full display in her vocal performance: A single word, “bittersweet,” becomes an earworm as she octave-hops its delivery. Elsewhere, she'll spit out a word (“Freedom!”) only to then really sink her teeth into it (“Free-duh-huh-uh-hum”). She sounds utterly inspired even when a track's lyrics in full are: “Get with the party happening people… Feel the flow are you feeling it? Yes I'm feeling it.”

Dewdrops contained no indication Deee-Lite were anywhere near slowing down. It's full of life and packs in more joy than any previous Deee-Lite release. While it has its share of lyrical relics that make it unmistakably '90s (subway tokens, eschewing cell phones, the condom code), its overall sound hasn't aged much. It benefits from a kind of stasis that set into dance music not long after it was released.

In the years leading up to Dewdrops, technological advances were spawning new subgenres seemingly every few months. Innovation didn't evaporate after, but some of those now calcified dance music styles more or less function as they have for decades. A vocal jungle track or disco house song has become simply a musical form, as reliable as a folk song, power ballad, or punk ripper. Time-blindness allows something like “Call Me” to sound at home in a contemporary set. Deee-Lite's left-leaning politics, psychedelic rhapsodizing, and club cultural reporting only strengthen the relevance of Dewdrops.

After Deee-Lite disbanded, Kier and Towa pursued solo projects and collaborations, while Dmitry and Ani kept DJing; Kier launched her own DJ career. In 1996, Elektra released a compilation of vintage and previously unreleased remixes, Sampladelic Relics and Dancefloor Oddities; The Very Best of Deee-Lite followed in 2001. In 2006, Kier said that a Deee-Lite reunion would “never happen, ever.” She declined to elaborate in detail, saying, “Well, that is a long, vicious story filled with heartache. I don't think anyone's ready for that story.” In retrospect, the career of Deee-Lite is a showcase of smiles frozen in time and hope for a better future that never arrived. Deee-Lite's ebullient third album, 31 years later, is wrapped in the poignancy of inadvertent swan song. It was their last party, and no one knew. Bittersweet loving, indeed.

Donald Trump‘s bizarre combination of speech mannerisms, physical quirks, and garish physical appearance has over the past decade of his political career often functioned as teflon. 


	The president's absurdist, abhorrent political persona is endlessly mockable — as Saturday Night Live or any late-night host can attest — but it's also a key component of his increasingly authoritarian politics, and his presentation only seems to be getting worse.


	Trump is the oldest man to assume the presidency in the history of the United States. The man he succeeded, former President Joe Biden, had to abandon his reelection bid over widespread concern — and a wealth of evidence — that he was too old to hold the nation's highest office. Biden's apparent decline dominated the summer of 2024 and has continued to be a story into Trump's second term in office. Meanwhile, Trump's innumerable gaffes and otherwise troubling behavior — like when he cut a town hall event short to play music videos and sway onstage less than a month before the election — were largely written off as Trump being Trump.

	











	The 2024 election cycle was defined not only by Trump's scorched-earth comeback to the White House, but by a heated Democratic Party debate over Biden's age and physical decline, the gerontocracy that has entrenched itself in power, and the duty of care those surrounding a leader in decline have to advise that leader not to try to hold onto their office at the expense of their constituents. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In the case of Trump, the president is not, today, the same man who first assumed office in 2017. He has new health issues, less self control, stronger authoritarian impulses, and visibly looser skin. His clear physical aging has been accompanied by a string of gaffes and senior moments that can no longer be excused by the trappings of his public persona. 


	If the standard — as Trump has himself stressed repeatedly in reference to Biden — is that a president's cognitive decline is a disqualifier and a potential liability, it's worth taking a look at the man currently sitting behind the Resolute Desk and some of his more egregious senior moments in his second term as president.

Trump told false story about his uncle teaching the Unabomber


	Remember when Biden told that insane story about fighting Corn Pop (who was a “bad dude”) and it produced a whole news cycle about how the aging president could be losing it? Well this should have been Trump's “Corn Pop” moment. 


	Earlier this month, while addressing attendees at a Pennsylvania energy summit, Trump told a bizarre story about his uncle, former Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor John Trump. 


	“[Ted] Kaczynski was one of his students,” Trump claimed, referring to the prodigal mathematician turned hermit and serial mass murder known as the “Unabomber.” 


	“That's a smart man. Kaczynski was one of his students. Do you know who Kaczynski was?” Trump said. “There's very little difference between a madman and a genius. But Kaczynski, I said, ‘What kind of a student was he, Uncle John?' — Dr. John Trump. He said ‘seriously good,' he said he'd go around correcting everybody. But it didn't work out so well for him.” 


	Basically nothing about this story — outside of Trump's uncle being an MIT professor — was true. 


	Kaczynski was not a student at MIT. Ever. He got his undergraduate degree at Harvard, and completed his masters and doctorate at the University of Michigan. John Trump died in 1985, more than a decade before Kaczynski was caught and identified as the Unabomber. It's extremely unlikely John Trump would have known him, and there is no reason Trump would have asked his uncle about Kaczynski.

Trump said he was surprised Jerome Powell, whom he appointed, was appointed


	Trump built a career on firing people. He loves it, it gives him a thrill. There's one man in D.C. he apparently cannot fire: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. And it's driving him up the walls. 

	











	Powell was appointed to his position as Fed chair in 2018 by Donald Trump, and ushered the American economy through the turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic, and a subsequent period of persistent inflation that battered consumers. Despite the Fed having mostly gotten a handle on inflation, Trump has been publicly fuming (and threatening to fire) Powell for months now over his refusal to cut down interest rates — partially in response to Trump's inflationary tariffs and pinball economic policies. 


	Earlier this month, Trump complained that Powell was “a terrible fed chair.” 


	“I'm surprised he was appointed, I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him,” he added. 


	Biden did reappoint Powell — but it was Trump who initially appointed him.  At this point, though, it seems that blaming his predecessor is so reflexive for Trump that he's erased his own appointments from his memory. 


Trump dumped on his own trade deal


	During his first term, Trump regularly made a point of criticizing the North American Free Trade Agreement and exalted his own negotiations of a new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement as the work of a diplomatic and economic genius. Until he forgot about it. 


	“I look at some of these agreements, I'd read them at night, and I'd say, ‘Who would ever sign a thing like this?'” Trump said of past economic trade deals in North America during his tariff frenzy in the spring. “So the tariffs will go forward, yes, and we're gonna make up a lot of territory. All we want is reciprocal. We want reciprocity.”


	Other nations best beware. Negotiating a trade deal with the White House in order to avoid a punishing tariff regime may be only a temporary solution, as the president may soon forget he even signed it. 


Trump called the prime minister of Japan “Mr. Japan”


	There are very basic expectations to being a head of state. One is remembering the names of your international counterparts, even if only for a few minutes in front of a camera. 


	Should you forget, say, the name of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the conventions of the English language provide several alternatives that would allow one to avoid outing yourself and forgetful or ignorant. The “prime minister of Japan” or “prime minister” would likely suffice. Not — as Trump chose to blurt out — “Mr. Japan.”


	“Dear Mr. Japan: Here's the story,” Trump said during a June interview with Fox News on his proposed deadlines for tariff deals with foreign governments. “You're going to pay a 25 percent tariff on your cars.”

	











	The Trump administration ultimately did figure out whom they needed to address their letter to, and struck a deal with the Japanese government to avoid the implementation of ruinous tariffs.


Trump said he's going to spend time in Florida when asked about detainees in Alligator Alcatraz


	During a press conference following his visit to a Florida detention center built deep in the Everglades — a location chosen for its outright hostility to human life — Trump was asked by a reporter how long he expected detainees to be held in the center before being deported. 


	The president instead responded with a bizarre rant about how he would be spending plenty of time in Florida, how much he loved the state, and how nice it was for the reporter to think of him. 


	“This is my home state. I love it. I love your government. I love all the people around, these are all friends of mine,” Trump said. “I feel very comfortable in the state. I'll spend a lot of time here.” 


	The president added that he had a “very nice little place, nice little cottage,” in Palm Beach — a reference to his Mar-a-Lago luxury golf club. He then bemoaned that many people were leaving cities like New York to come to places like Palm Beach and states like Florida. 


	“But thank you very much. I'll be here as much as I can — very nice question,” he concluded, leaving the actual question unanswered and the room confused. 


Trump rambles about trophy wives and yachts during West Point commencement


	During a commencement address at the West Point, Trump advised graduates of the prestigious military college not to marry a trophy wife. 


	In the middle of a bizarre tangent about William Levitt — a man who made boatloads of cash pioneering the American suburb — Trump lamented that Levitt's second marriage didn't work out so well. 


	“Could you say a trophy wife? I guess we can say a trophy wife. It didn't work out too well,” the president rambled, perhaps amid a series of flashbacks to his own marriages. “But it doesn't work out too well, I must tell you. A lot of trophy wives, [it] doesn't work out, but it made him happy for a little while, at least.” 


	“But he found a new wife,” Trump continued. “He sold his little boat. You got a big yacht. He had one of the biggest yachts anywhere in the world. He moved for time to Monte Carlo, and he led a good life.”

	How much will it cost to renovate the Boeing 747-8 gifted by Qatar into the next Air Force One? That's classified information. But a recent $934 million transfer of funds to a Pentagon budget may hold a clue.


	The New York Times reported that this “transfer” to an unnamed classified project described in a Pentagon document sent to Capitol Hill likely includes the cost of renovating the gifted plane into a lavish gold-accented flying palace for President Trump. The funds were moved to a budget dedicated to updating America's ground-based nuclear missiles, and Air Force officials told the paper that at least some of the funds for the renovations will come from the nuclear modernization project.


	Making the project even more absurd, because the renovations will take one or two years to complete, Trump will only fly in the plane as president for a short time until he leaves office and the plane is ostensibly transferred to his presidential library in 2029 — at least that is what Trump has said will happen. (Unless, that is, Trump finds a way to extend his time in office beyond this four year term, as he has often hinted at, though that would be extremely unconstitutional.)

	











	Among the improvements to the plane are upgrades to its communications systems and engines as well as the addition of antimissile systems. Plus, U.S. intelligence will need to identify and remove any covert listening devices that Qatar may have embedded in the plane's walls. Finally, the plane will be treated to similar internal decor to the Oval Office, which Trump has outfitted with tacky gold accents.

	Trump pursued the gift from Qatar, he said, because Boeing is years behind schedule to deliver two new planes to serve as Air Force Ones, a project that has already cost $4 billion.


	Air Force Secretary Troy E. Meink testified to Congress in June about the cost to renovate the Qatar plane.


	“I think there has been a number thrown around on the order of $1 billion,” he said. “But a lot of those costs associated with that are costs that we'd have experienced anyway, we will just experience them early,” ahead of Boeing's scheduled delivery of its new Air Force Ones. “So it wouldn't be anywhere near that.”

	He added, “We believe the actual retrofit of that aircraft is probably less than $400 million.”


	But engineers and Air Force experts familiar with this kind of work shed doubt on that price tag, and members of Congress have voiced worries that Trump will want to use the plane quickly, and he will push the Air Force to complete the work before installing proper safety mechanisms.


	While the Pentagon will reveal the price to modernize America's ground-base nuclear missiles, it declined to share with the Times just how much the plane upgrades will cost.

	“The more we learn about this deal, the more disturbing it becomes,” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told the paper. “The security implications of accepting a private plane from a foreign nation as Air Force One and the resulting ethical concerns a gift of that sizes creates were already significant.”


	She also expressed concern that “this administration is diverting funds from the nuclear modernization budget to finance costly renovations to this plane,” which means the U.S. is “weakening our credibility to fund a vanity project for President Trump.”

	A civilian ship carrying aid to Palestinians in Gaza was intercepted by the Israeli military in international waters on Saturday, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirmed. 


	The Handala flotilla was carrying baby formula, diapers, food, and medicine. The passengers were detained and the cargo was seized. The coalition said the boat was intercepted “in international waters outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international maritime law.” 


	“Israel has no legal authority to detain international civilians aboard the Handala,” Ann Wright, a member of the Freedom Flotilla's steering committee, said in a statement. “This is not a matter of internal Israeli jurisdiction. These are foreign nationals operating under international law in international waters. Their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end.”


	This week, the United Nations' World Food Program said the famine in Gaza has reached “new and astonishing levels of desperation, with a third of the population not eating for multiple days in a row.” According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, there have been 40 hunger-related deaths this month. 

	











	More than 100 aid agencies and rights groups have warned of a “mass starvation” across Gaza. 


	“There is no one in Gaza now outside the scope of famine, not even myself,” Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, who leads the pediatric ward at Nasser Hospital in Gaza, told The New York Times. “I am speaking to you as a health official, but I, too, am searching for flour to feed my family.”

	











	There were 21 civilians from 12 countries on the flotilla, including Christian Smalls, the former president of the Amazon Labor Union; European Union Parliament member Emma Fourreau; human rights attorney Huwaida Arraf; and two Al Jazeera journalists. The crew members said they would go on hunger strike if they were to be abducted. 


	“Israeli officials have ignored the International Court of Justice's binding orders that require the facilitation of humanitarian access to Gaza,” the Freedom Flotilla Coalition said in a statement. “The continued attacks on peaceful civilian missions represent a grave violation of international law.”

	Arraf was among a group of activists who sought to travel on an aid flotilla to Gaza last spring, when the population was already considered to be at imminent risk of famine.


	“We can't sit by and let it happen,” Arraf told Rolling Stone at the time. “People have been marching in the millions around the world, and still our governments are not listening to the people. And so we're taking that protest to the sea and we're directly challenging Israel's closure policy — the siege, the blockade, which are unlawful.” 


	During that attempt, Turkish port authorities blocked the ships from leaving.


	Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has led a brutal siege on Gaza and a near-total blockade. 


	Israel has tightly restricted the flow of humanitarian aid, arguing that Hamas had been stealing aid provided through the U.N. According to a Times report on Saturday, military officials admitted that Israel had no proof for such claims. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the foreign aid bureau shuttered by President Donald Trump's administration, similarly found no evidence that Hamas was regularly stealing assistance to Gaza, according to ABC News. 


	In recent months, Israel has been accused, in several instances, of indiscriminately firing on Gazans attempting to get food at operations run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a recently created aid group backed by Israel and the Trump administration.

	Israel's military said Saturday it would begin airdropping aid into Gaza and implementing humanitarian pauses for the delivery of aid this weekend. However, the Israeli military has killed more than 1,000 people trying to get food since May, mainly near aid sites, according to the United Nations. 


	“This is a deliberate and human-made disaster,” Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, a charity working in Gaza, told NPR. “Those children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them.”

	In June, the Israeli military intercepted another humanitarian aid ship from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Among those captured were climate activist Greta Thunberg and European Parliament member Rima Hassan. Thunberg was deported the next day. Hassan spent three days in Israeli custody, including time in solitary confinement. 


	“Over the years, Israel has tried various methods to stop us,” Arraf, the human rights attorney, told Democracy Now on Friday. “It has been very violent, from attacking, beating, abducting, arresting, jailing and even killing our volunteers. In 2010, a flotilla that… I was on, Israel killed 10 of our volunteers. But that did not stop us. And it's not going to stop us now.”

	“Superman is the best friend you could have,” Iggy Pop recently said, responding to the prominent use of “Punkrocker,” his 2006 collaboration with Teddybears, in the final scene of Superman — and he proved he meant it Saturday night by playing the formerly obscure track live for the first time ever. 


	The song, which has exploded on streaming services and gone viral on TikTok since the movie‘s release, concluded Pop's performance at Portland, Oregon's Project Pabst Festival. Pop dedicated the performance to Superman, according to a crowd member who posted video.


	The song's use in Superman ties in with a moment earlier in the movie when David Corenswet's Kal-El suggests, in a conversation with Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane, that kindness is “the real punk rock” — a line that writer/director James Gunn recently told Rolling Stone is “the point of the movie.” In the same interview, Gunn said that he had first encountered “Punkrocker” when it popped up via Spotify's algorithm, and that the song stuck with him.

	“And so when I wrote that line, I think I thought back to that song and knew that would really work well,” Gunn told Rolling Stone. “And I just liked how the ending juggled all these different pieces of the movie in a way where we showed that the real punk rock was him, his dad, all the way to the shot of the dad making the baby fly. He flies because of his parents.”

	The end credits of Superman also feature another punk moment, via a song by the Mighty Crabjoys, a fictional pop-punk band said to be among Clark Kent's childhood favorites. Gunn, a former rock musician, wrote “The Mighty Crabjoys Theme” with Foxy Shazam's Eric Nally. “I literally wrote that song and sang it into my phone the first thing in the morning,” says GUnn. “It took five minutes, and then Eric turned it into the fun song that it is.”

	The Supreme Court's right-wing supermajority helped put President Donald Trump back in office. Now it's letting him run rampant, often without even bothering to give us an explanation.


	In 17 straight cases — “an unprecedented number compared to every prior presidency,” according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck — the Supreme Court granted the Trump Justice Department's emergency requests, halting orders from lower courts that had temporarily blocked the administration's overreach. In doing so, the court has allowed the key planks of Trump's Project 2025 agenda to take effect.


	Some of the Trump 2.0 policies the high court has greenlit include:


	It would, however, be too simple to say the Supreme Court has rolled over because it's gone full MAGA — though that is quite true for at least a couple members of the Republican majority. The Roberts Court's capitulation is also an act of appeasement designed to preserve its power by avoiding confrontation with a would-be autocrat. 


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Chief Justice John Roberts has spent his two decades on the bench building up his court as the country's main policymaking and -breaking body of government. Yet the Roberts Court's landmark antidemocratic rulings unleashing money in politics, gutting the Voting Rights Act, and granting Trump sweeping criminal immunity for trying to overturn the 2020 election, all led directly to Trump 2.0.

	











	And within weeks of regaining power, Trump began attacking — and defying — judges who stood in the way of what he regarded as his electoral mandate to do whatever he wanted, Constitution be damned.

	At first, Roberts spoke out against Trump's calls to impeach lower court judges for daring to rule against him. In a statement, the chief justice wrote, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”


	But what seemed at the time like a rebuke now reads more like friendly advice, given how Trump has fared before the chief. 


	The appellate review process of Trump's authoritarian agenda has so far been anything but normal. Virtually all of Trump's wins have come on the Supreme Court's emergency — or “shadow” — docket, where the justices make decisions without the benefit of full briefing or oral argument and, often, provide no reasoning for their votes.


	Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's solicitude towards Trump on the shadow docket suggests Trump's attacks against lower court judges have influenced the votes of the members of the high court's right-wing supermajority that have not gone totally MAGA. To those justices — Roberts chief among them — Trump's ever-present threat of defiance has presented the Supreme Court with a choice: be a rubber stamp to appease Trump and preserve the prospect that he will obey future adverse rulings, or refuse to be a rubber stamp even just once and reveal just how illusory the court's power has always been.

	Chief Justice Roberts has chosen appeasement, and without any guarantee that Trump will honor the court's credit should the chief ever lead his colleagues in declaring Trump has gone too far.


	Indeed, the justices have already shied away from such a confrontation in the one Trump case the Supreme Court did move to the merits docket. Rather than resolve whether Trump's executive order attacking birthright citizenship is constitutional, the Roberts majority instead accepted the Trump DOJ's argument that the lower courts had no power to issue a universal injunction against the policy. The ruling only indefinitely delays the Supreme Court from ruling on the merits of the citizenship-stripping order while the lower courts wrestle with ancillary questions over the proper scope of potential relief. For all intents and purposes, the damage has been done.


	While the Roberts majority cowers from Trump to preserve its own relevance, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is calling her colleagues to account over the real-world effects of their capitulation. She's also showing us a path forward. 

	











	In a series of dissents at the end of this term, Justice Jackson all but accused the Roberts majority of being in the pocket of “moneyed interests” on the merits docket (i.e. in fully briefed and argued cases), and in Trump's pocket on the shadow docket, pointing to the “court's demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this president's legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.”


	In a series of posts on BlueSky, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) applauded Jackson for dispensing with the “collegiality” befitting “ordinary times.”


	“What if we are in a time when a billionaire-funded scheme has spent decades trying to pack the court with billionaire-agreeable justices, so as to “capture” the court in the sense of ‘regulatory capture' or ‘agency capture' — and what if the billionaires have finally succeeded,” Sen. Whitehouse asked in a series of rhetorical questions.


	And speaking to the Indianapolis Bar Association recently, Jackson said her separate opinions this term reflect her concerns about the state of our democracy. 


	“I'm really very interested in getting people to focus and to invest and to pay attention to what is happening in our country and in our government,” Jackson told the audience, according to a report from The New York Times.


	But Justice Jackson is doing more than calling out her colleagues. In separate opinion after separate opinion, she is also articulating a pro-democracy vision for a court that defers to the people, facilitates a truly representative and multiracial republic, and polices clear constitutional limits. 


	“[W]hen Congress speaks, courts should listen,” she wrote in an April concurrence. But, she's chronicled her colleagues' “aggrandizement of judicial power” while insisting on the courts' role to stop the executive branch's lawlessness. “The court has cleared a path for the executive to choose law-free action at this perilous moment for our Constitution,” she wrote in her dissent to June's birthright citizenship decision, “right when the judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints.”


	In other words, the Roberts majority makes stuff up to get in the way of the people's will and ignores clear constitutional and statutory commands to let Trump run rampant.


	That is exactly backwards. 

	











	We need a Supreme Court that — absent clear constitutional or statutory commands — gets out of the way of the people's will.

	Sen. Markwayne Mullin tried to blame former President Barack Obama for Jeffrey Epstein‘s 2008 plea deal, despite Obama not being president at the time.


	Mullin made the comments while being interviewed by Jake Tapper on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. First, Tapper and Mullin debated over whether the attorney general has the ability to release documents related to the Epstein investigation, with Mullin insisting that only judges have the ability to make that information public and Tapper arguing that there is additional information that Attorney General Pam Bondi could — and has promised to — release, yet she has not done so.


	Then Mullin made a bizarre claim that Epstein struck a deal in Florida in 2009, under President Obama. But that is factually incorrect, as Tapper pointed out.


	“Remember there was a plea deal that was struck in 2009, way before I was in office, way before Trump was even considering it to be in office, way before Pam Bondi was office, way before Kash Patel was director,” Mullin said. “2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made underneath the Obama administration with Epstein, and that sweetheart has not been exposed.”

	











	“No, that's not right,” Tapper said. 

MULLIN: There was a sweetheart plea deal that was struck in 2009 under ObamaTAPPER: No. It was 2008. The US attorney was Alex Acosta. He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become Trump's secretary of laborM: Who was in office at the time?T: BushM: No. Obama was in officeTAPPER: Not true


	“It's not? Well, when was the case heard?” Mullin asked.


	“It was 2008… The U.S. attorney at the time was a guy named Alex Acosta,” Tapper said. “He was a Bush appointee. He went on to become President Trump's secretary of labor. It all took place in 2008.”

	











	“Who was in office at the time?” Mullin asked.


	“2008, George W. Bush,” Tapper said, reciting a well-known fact.


	But Mullin continued to insist on incorrect information.


	“No, 2009 is when the case came out, and it was — and Obama was in office at the time,” Mullin said.


	“It's not true. It's not true,” Tapper said.


	Mullin doubled down later in the interview.

Holy shit — Markwayne Mullin insists later in the interview again that Obama oversaw actually oversaw the sweetheart deal with Epstein, even after Tapper (accurately) fact-checked him. Yikes.


	“I will go back to what you're saying about it wasn't true,” Mullin said. “The case was sealed in 2009. That's absolutely true. It was heard in 2008. It was sealed in 2009.”

	Tapper is correct, and Mullin is wrong. An executive summary report of the Epstein case by the Justice Department states that in the summer of 2008, then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in which the billionaire pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. Because of the deal, instead of serving a possible life sentence, he was sentenced to 18 months in a work-release program followed by 12 months of house arrest. Epstein was then allowed to leave the minimum-security facility for 12 hours a day to work at a foundation he had incorporated. Epstein was released after serving less than 13 months. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender and make payments to his victims. According to the Justice Department, Epstein began serving his sentence in Oct. 2008, and a judge unsealed the non-prosecution agreement in Sept. 2009.

The National UFO Historic Records Center (NUFOHRC) in Rio Rancho has recently undergone significant facility upgrades and acquired substantial new collections, while also pursuing an ambitious international expansion aimed at global data sharing and leveraging artificial intelligence for research.

Since November, the center has completely redone the surrounding grounds of its buildings in cooperation with the Rio Rancho public school system. This involved replacing old asphalt and dirt with new concrete, sidewalks, curbs and a new asphalt private parking lot. Security was also enhanced, with old chain link fences replaced by new security fencing around the entire perimeter, featuring badge-access-only sidewalk and vehicle gates. These improvements are viewed as enhancing the center's role as an educational tool.

The center's archives have seen a significant increase in materials with two major acquisitions. A large collection was received from Mike Christol, who recorded thousands of hours of audio and video from television, radio and podcasts. Following Christol's death, individuals in Indiana and Kentucky seeking a home for the collection sent numerous boxes of his material, leading to the creation of a whole new wing specifically for audio and video. This collection includes VHS tapes from the late 1980s, local, national and international TV shows as well as interviews with UFO witnesses.

More recently, the center received over 150 boxes and a number of file cabinets of historical data from Jan Aldridge, a center team member and one of the country's leading UFO historians. Aldridge compiled this data from various archives and collections nationwide over 40 years, and it is currently being organized and sorted. Among the recent discoveries within Aldridge's collection were Canadian files from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which will be integrated into the center's master case file collection.

To manage its expanding holdings, the center has a dedicated team of pro bono volunteers. Executive Director David Marler told the Roswell Daily Record during a recent visit, “In addition to collections we've acquired, we've also acquired a very dedicated, diligent team of volunteers who are coming in almost every weekend, like clockwork, and helping us sort these collections. As you can see firsthand and you can appreciate, there's a lot of work that goes in behind the scenes, just sorting these collections, processing, getting them organized.”

Marler described the center's collection as ""not a static collection"" but one that is ""constantly growing"" and ""developing a life of its own."" The center receives numerous national and international inquiries, such as a recent one about a 1976 Kentucky abduction case, for which they hold the original case file and audio recordings.

Looking ahead, NUFOHRC is actively seeking state funding. Sandoval County has also discussed providing financial assistance. The ultimate goal is to not only expand the current facility but eventually establish a freestanding, state-of-the-art facility. They seek to expand their archive while adding interpretive, educational and historical museum components as well.

A key strategic initiative involves establishing an international network of archivists and researchers, led by international liaison Diego Diaz. Diaz has been communicating with numerous countries in South America and plans to connect with colleagues in Europe. The center aims to encourage other countries to create their own national record centers to foster a global data-sharing network.

“We really are trying to establish an international network of not only archivists, but researchers with the ultimate goal of sharing the data,” Marler explained. “The reason we created the archives was to make the data available to serious researchers, academics, the general public, but they're also sitting on vast treasure troves of case files and history, and it just makes sense to not operate in a silo, but create an international network.”

The objective of this global network is to make all data points accessible on the internet for research. Diaz emphasized the importance of this, stating, ""It's not just an American phenomena. It's a worldwide phenomena.""

He added that once everything is digitized, artificial intelligence will be able to connect dots that researchers would not have the means to do in a lifetime, marking an exciting technological advancement. The data will be available to serious researchers, academics and the general public.

The center welcomes donations of materials and items, as well as volunteers. To learn more visit nufohrc.org

THIS technique by UFO hunters may bring extraterrestrial spaceships to earth","https://www.wionews.com/trending/aliens-to-visit-scotland-this-technique-by-ufo-hunters-may-bring-extraterrestrial-spaceships-to-earth-1753602815522","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 08:30:00 GMT","

The Strange Phenomena Investigations will use the CE5 method to contact unidentified aerial phenomena using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month.

A team of UFO researchers has planned to use a technique to invite extraterrestrial spacecraft to Dechmont Woods in Scotland's West Lothian later this month. The controversial technique known as Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) will be led by the paranormal researcher Malcolm Robinson.

The Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) method involves group meditation, telepathic intention, and sound recordings designed to encourage peaceful contact with unidentified aerial phenomena. The site where the technique will be involved had already witnessed extraterrestrial spacecraft in 1979, which marks one of the UK's most famous close encounter incidents.

The UFO experience was first reported by forestry worker Bob Taylor, who encountered a dome-shaped craft and was physically dragged by spiked objects, leaving him with torn clothing and minor injuries. However, the incident remained unexplained, as the official investigation by the police labelled the attack as a potential assault.

Meanwhile, Malcolm Robinson expects that the plan could work, as participants witnessed “flashing lights” during a trial run. “We are trying to bring any off-world craft into our airspace. There is a desire to bring forward these objects, which people claim to be UFOs or UAPs. The meditation will send out a desire for open contact,"" Robinson said, The Scottish Sun reported.

“In the background, we play these special sound effects, which help to enhance the mood but also the meditative process. It all sounds very airy-fairy, I get that, but this has been tried successfully all over the world,"" he added.

This method is known as the Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind protocol, which was developed by Dr. Steven Greer, founder of the Centre for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

Through this process, the Strange Phenomena Investigations will try to communicate using telepathy and guided meditations, which followers believe will help guide UFOs at Dechmont Woods, near Livingston, later this month.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

A decade ago, actor/director Matt Cohen and his filmmaking partner Sean Flanagan had an idea to make an animated comedy series about a group of over-the-hill legendary characters hanging out in a Cheers-like bar called Public Domain. “The regulars at this Hollywood watering hole were all once famous characters that have fallen into the public domain,” says Cohen, who played young John Winchester on Supernatural and directed the final-season episode “Give Me Shelter.”

“They drink together and wait for the opportunity to be rediscovered, and rebooted by Tinseltown,” Cohen explains. “We've never asked the question, when life gets hard, where do they go and how do they deal with it? It's essentially the look at every actor in Hollywood told by a favorite animated character. We'll see what they're doing in their 40s-60s, post their Hollywood careers.”

According to Cohen, there are about “200 public domain characters that audiences will recognize. It's going to feel a lot like an animated Cheers, but with characters you know and love from your favorite shows and the shows that you share with your children.”

Nathan Milburn

To voice the characters, Cohen reached out “to the circle of talent that I know and love like siblings,” he says, “the Supernatural family.” Nearly every role is played by a former cast member. Among them: Jake Abel (voicing Hercules), Jim Beaver (Sidney Sam), Rob Benedict (Kaulu), Briana Buckmaster (Dorothy Gale), Ruth Connell (Peter Pan's Wendy Darling), Adam Fergus (Sherlock Holmes), Gil McKinney (The Mad Hatter), and Richard Speight Jr. (Quasimodo). “Working together and offering feedback is how the Supernatural family always shined.”

“This is a funny comedy and it's really a good time,” Cohen notes. (It's also an adult comedy with risqué lines and scenarios.) “When you get up from the couch after finishing the pilot and Louden Swain band's front man Rob Benedict's song is heard over the credits, you're going to feel wrapped in a warm hug and you'll want to go smile at one of your friends and tell them about it.”

Fans helped finance the pilot, which will be available free on YouTube in August. (A cut arrived on YouTube in July.) Hoping the show will get picked up by a streamer, the creators have 100-plus episodes ready to go — including ones in which Quasimodo and the Little Mermaid (voiced by Cohen's wife, Mandy Musgrave) fall in love, and the Phantom of the Opera and Hercules “figure out to how to jump rope.”

Cohen voices the series' only original character, Shep Salazar, “a washed-up child actor trying to run the bar and control all these hooligans,” he says. Bottoms up!

Since the Pokémon world's debut in the late '90s, there have always been several Pokémon that are considered to be adorable. In the meantime, there are many Pokémon who have had shockingly somber storylines in the games, manga or anime. Some of these Pokémon who have had tragic stories have also fallen into the roster of Pokémon considered to be cute, such as Chimchar and Charmander.

Another Pokémon that is often considered to be adorable among fans, and which has also been part of several tragic stories in the Pokémon media, is the Psychic-type Pokémon Espurr. According to the Pokédex, this feline Pokémon already has quite a lot on its plate, as it is always trying to control its immense powers. However, in not one, but two different stories in the Pokémon world, the Restraint Pokémon is shown to deal with even more obstacles, ones that continue to haunt fans.

Although the Pokémon franchise is great for fans of any age, many of the storylines present in the anime can be rather gruesome.

Espurr, the Restraint Pokémon, was introduced in Generation VI, as one of the brand-new Pokémon created for the Kalos region. A pure Psychic-type Pokémon, Espurr is usually a shade of pale violet, with lavender eyes and white paws, alongside folded ears that are white at the ends. Espurr's Shiny form, in the meantime, has the same small details, though its fur is a shade of light pink instead of violet.

The small Psychic-type Pokémon is usually seen with an expressionless face, as it is desperately trying to restrain its psychic powers, which are too powerful for it to handle. If Espurr did not work so hard to control its powers, then a great blast of psychic energy would strike everything around three hundred feet of the Restraint Pokémon, according to its Pokédex entry in Pokémon Alpha Sapphire.

The intelligent Psychic-type showcases some of the most distinctive designs in the franchise, with different demeanors to match.

When Espurr evolves at level 25, it will evolve into Meowstic, the Constraint Pokémon. Just like its prior evolution, Meowstic also must work hard to keep its powers at bay, lest a great amount of psychic energy cause unexpected chaos. However, compared to Espurr, Meowstic appears to have a better grasp on how to deal with its powers, though they are certainly still immense. A Meowstic's appearance upon evolving depends on its gender, though both work with a similar color palette.

For instance, a male Meowstic is mainly a shade of dark blue, with white accents and teal eyes. Meanwhile, a female Meowstic has white fur, with blue accents and bright yellow eyes. In battle, a male Meowstic mainly depends on defensive moves, trying its best to also help its allies during battle. However, a female Meowstic is known to be more aggressive, and is not afraid to use most of its power to use intense offensive moves.

The Psychic-type feline Pokémon debuted in Pokémon the Series: XY, in the episode ""Seeking Shelter from the Storm!"", where the story takes place in a seemingly abandoned mansion. During a sudden storm, Ash and his friends enter the mansion, not aware that Team Rocket has also decided to remain there until the rain stops.

As such, each group believes that the other is a horde of ghosts, constantly making the others scream in surprise. In the meantime, a lone Espurr is revealed to be responsible for the odd happenings at the mansion, and it wishes for the newcomers to leave its home. Thanks to Meowth, everyone is able to figure out why Espurr wants to protect its home so much.

The world of Pokémon has many wonderful creatures based on real-life animals, and the roster of feline Pokémon is undoubtedly cute and cool.

In the past, Espurr was taken in by a kind older woman named Lacy, who also let Espurr hold onto a pendant that she once received from her husband. However, when Espurr went to visit Lacy in order to return her pendant, the mansion's owner was nowhere to be found. As such, Espurr vowed to protect its dear friend's home, as it awaited the day Lacy would return. Sadly, the group would later learn from Lacy's granddaughter, Elise, that Lacy had passed away.

Elise promised that she would stay at the mansion and renovate it, and that the Restraint Pokémon was welcome to visit anytime it wanted. The new owner also said she would take Espurr to Lacy's grave, where it could truly say goodbye. The Pokémon world is no stranger to dealing with complex subjects such as death, yet this episode is certainly one of the most somber and bittersweet ones on the roster.

Though its debut episode in the Pokémon the Series: XY anime arc was certainly impactful, the storyline that truly made Espurr one of the most haunting Pokémon in the Kalos Pokédex was its role in the original Generation VI games. During the post-game in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, the player character crosses paths with Looker, a detective investigating the many villainous teams in the Pokémon world. In Generation VI, he sets up the Looker Bureau in order to look into Team Flare and their whereabouts in the Kalos region.

In one such case, Looker and the player discover a young orphan named Emma, who is often shown alongside her Espurr friend, nicknamed ""Mimi"". Looker thus invites Emma to live at the Looker Bureau, where she can work as his assistant. While she is learning from Looker, Emma begins to worry that she is a financial burden on him and the Looker Bureau. Though Looker tells her she is absolutely not, Emma still decides to find some part-time work in order to help him.

However, the café that Emma decides to work at turns out to be the Lysandre Café, where she is met by Xerosic, a lead scientist for Team Flare. Xerosic has created a new invention called the Expansion Suit, which grants the wearer the ability to change their appearance alongside superhuman strength and combat abilities. Xerosic tricks Emma into becoming a test subject for the Expansion Suit, using a remote to control her actions while she is unconscious. While she is in this state, Xerosic has Emma, working under the codename ""Essentia"", steal the Pokémon from unsuspecting Trainers.

In its 28+ year history, Pokémon has brought players many unique and interesting female characters, including Officer Jenny.

Upon waking up, Emma has no memory of the actions she committed as Essentia. Looker soon learns about this new figure in Kalos, and starts to investigate alongside the player and Mimi. It is Mimi who discovers that Essentia is truly Emma, though as she is being controlled by Xerosic, she has no memory of her friends and is programmed only to fight. Essentia thus tries to attack Mimi, but ultimately injures Looker instead, all while the suit begins to malfunction. In the Pokémon Generations episode ""The Investigation"", Essentia actually kicks Mimi away, a shocking moment that continues to haunt fans today.

In the end, Looker is able to confront Xerosic, and Emma is freed from Team Flare's control. However, she also becomes the owner of the Pokémon left behind by Xerosic, who bonded with her during her time working for Xerosic. Emma is also given the Essentia suit to control, now without a mind-controlling remote. After Looker leaves the region and makes Emma the new head of the detective agency, the player can battle against Emma on certain days, matches where she will wear the Expansion Suit and use the Pokémon given to her by Xerosic.

Emma and Mimi will return to the franchise in the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which appears to take place some time after the events of Pokémon X and Pokémon Y. In the game, Emma is still acting as the head of the Looker Bureau, with Mimi and their other Pokémon friends alongside her. However, Emma now has a Key Stone, allowing her to Mega Evolve Pokémon from her roster. Although Emma and Mimi appear to have happier lives in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, one cannot help but reflect on their story in Generation VI, and how it nearly ended in tragedy.

Expanding across a multitude of media, including TCGs, video games, manga, live-action movies and anime, the Pokémon franchise is set in a shared world of humans and creatures with a wide variety of special abilities.

Pokémon Y does not often get the praise it deserves. With Pokémon Y, the franchise was embarked on a new journey that would take place on the 3DS. The 3DS offered new avenues of graphic improvement and boy were fans in for a treat. The sixth generation takes place in the Kalos region, which is inspired by France. In terms of plot, Y does not do much to change the Pokémon formula. However, Y does offer new gameplay experiences.With this installment, we are introduced to the concept of Mega Evolutions. This is a perfect example of Game Freak shaking up the system without deviating from its tradition. Mega Evolutions were a huge hit. Pokémon who could access Mega Evolution would transform in appearance mid battle. They would also be on the receiving end of a drastic boost in the stats department. Not only was the move executed brilliantly from an artistic standpoint but it also seamlessly impacted the game's strategy. In addition, for the first time in history it seemed like nobody had an issue with the game's graphics. Much of this had to do with the long awaited debut of 3D animations on the 3DS. Pokémon games had a history of being underdeveloped in the graphics department. Pokémon Y finally harnessed all the raw power of the handheld device that operated the game. Towns, gyms and battles all oozed personality by displaying vibrant colors and animations. It's a shame that in terms of plot and story progression of Y sees the Pokémon franchise revert to old habits. This is extremely upsetting considering its predecessor in Black and White provided the best narrative to transpire in a Pokémon game.

Each monster type in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game has its own identity, as players often select a type to use because of its play style. Warrior-type decks are known for a combo-heavy playstyle that is built around powerful spell cards, while Zombie-type decks rely on bringing monsters back from the GY and using powerful control floodgates to maintain the tempo of the match. These types, along with some others, have simple-to-understand mechanics, which makes them easy to pick up for new players, but other types are a bit more complicated to understand, and Psychic-type monsters firmly belong in the latter category.

Throughout Yu-Gi-Oh!'s illustrious 25+ year history, Psychic-type monsters have struggled to have a consistent identity, as they were control cards early in the game, and that has changed to a combo focus in the modern era. This makes it difficult for players to utilize the monster type if they are not dedicated to understanding every useful option that the type has to offer. Despite this, players have utilized a plethora of Psychic-type monsters over the years, and many of them have had a significant impact on the meta.

While it was not common early in Yu-Gi-Oh!'s history, Konami has begun to experiment with card placement in specific columns in recent years, and many of the cards that revolve around this mechanic have been niche control tools. However, in one instance, Konami built an entire archetype of cards built around placing cards in columns strategically, and the most important card in this archetype is Meek-Knight Blue Sky.

Attribute

ATK/DEF

Light

2000/2500

These slithering serpents have some of Yu-Gi-Oh's most intriguing mechanics

Mekk-Knight Blue Sky is the most versatile monster in the Mekk-Knight archetype because of its ability to search numerous Mekk-Knight cards from the deck to the hand. The card can be special summoned from the hand if two or more cards are in the same column, and, when it is special summoned, it can add a number of Mekk-Knight cards from the deck to the hand up to the number of cards in that combo. The Mekk-Knight deck might have lost popularity over the years due to power creep, but it was once one of the best strategies in the game, and Mekk-Knight Blue Sky was a large part of the reason why.

Control decks are often built around Trap Cards because they are the most prominent way to interrupt the opponent during their turn, but not every trap card has the same purpose, and some of them often resemble other card types. The Amazement archetype tried to blend trap cards with equip cards, which was a great way to demonstrate the archetype's amusement park theme. The deck is built around its ringleader, Amazement Administrator Arlekino, who just so happens to be one of the best Psychic-type monsters ever printed.

ATK/DEF

Dark

2600/2200

Once per turn, players can use the effect of Amazement Administrator Arlekino to banish any number of Attraction trap cards from the GY and destroy that many cards on the opponent's side of the field. Its second effect also provides an incredible amount of utility, as it can equip Attraction trap cards from the deck to the opponent's monsters, which can hinder their plays in a variety of ways. While the Amazement archetype did not live up to the hype surrounding it, its boss monster was not the problem with the lovingly crafted strategy.

Link 1 monsters are often incredibly difficult for Konami to balance because they usually start combos while requiring very few resources. Furthermore, these cards usually have numerous ways for the player to stop the opponent from interacting with them, so these cards usually get to start their combos without worrying about counterplay. On rare occasions, Konami will create a Link 1 monster that actually follows basic balance principles, and Gravity Controller is the best example of this concept.

Attribute

ATK/DEF

Dark

1000/NA

Gravity Controller cannot be used as link material the turn that it is summoned, which is the main feature that keeps this card balanced in the meta. However, its effect is incredibly useful against an opponent's established board because it can return both itself and the monster it attacks to the deck, which is an intriguing form of removal that most cards don't have access to. While it might not be as powerful as most Link-1 powerhouses, it is still one of the most versatile Link monsters ever printed.

Konami is no stranger to making archetypes that are clearly inspired by other intellectual property, but it very rarely blends two pieces of media together to make beloved strategies. The most notable exception to this is the Kozmo archetype, a mid-2010s deck that is among the most popular strategies of that era of the game. The archetype blended inspiration from both the Star Wars and the Wizard of Oz franchises, and the most notable card that this archetype had at its disposal was Kozmo Farmgirl.

Attribute

ATK/DEF

Light

1500/1000

Kozmo Farmgirl provided consistency with both of its effects, but its first effect was far easier to use, as it could banish itself from the field to summon any level 4 or lower Kozmo monster from the hand. However, in the rare circumstance that the card managed to deal battle damage, it allowed players to add a Kozmo card from the deck to the hand. Overall, the Kozmo archetype is one of the most beloved archetypes of all time, but it would have been incomplete without the consistency provided by Kozmo Farmgirl.

The PSY-Frame archetype is one of Konami's strangest experiments in card design, as it is an archetype of hand traps that all summon one level 6 normal monster (PSY-Frame Driver) and themselves when they are activated. This might seem counterintuitive, but it does allow these cards to dodge negate effects like Called by the Grave, so these cards were once some of the game's most versatile handtraps. However, the main appeal of this archetype has always been its boss monster, and PSY-Framelord Omega still occasionally sees competitive play to this day.

This hybrid-type has some of Yu-Gi-Oh's most powerful monsters

PSY-Framelord Omega allows players to banish itself from the board to banish a card from the opponent's hand until the next standby phase of the player that controls PSY-Framelord Omega, which can be useful for avoiding handtraps during a combo. Furthermore, the card can return banished cards to the GY, which is useful for getting resources back throughout the game, making this card a great piece of disruption as well as a way to continue to play in a drawn-out match.

Throughout Yu-Gi-Oh!'s history, Konami has often tried to boost the power level of Ritual monsters so they are in line with their extra deck counterparts, but this is often difficult because of the amount of resources it takes to summon these monsters. However, that does not mean that individual cards that support Ritual monsters have always failed, and Libromancer Geek Boy is a core part of one of the most consistent Ritual monster strategies in recent memory.

Libromancer Geek Boy can special summon itself from the hand by revealing a Ritual monster in the hand, which makes it incredibly easy to summon. However, the most important part of the card is its ability to add a ""Libromancer"" spell card from the deck to the hand when it is special summoned so that players can easily Ritual summon the boss monsters of the deck. While Libromancer is eclipsed by current Ritual monster decks, some of its cards are still useful, and Libromancer Geek Boy is a phenomenal combo starter for the archetype.

The Kashtira archetype is one of the strongest archetypes in recent memory because it could stop the opponent from using zones on their board, which prevented them from starting combos to break through the board. However, perhaps the archetype's best application has been as a generic engine that has been used better by other decks, and the best of these staple cards is Kashtira Fenrir.

Kashtira Fenrir is useful for several reasons, one of which is the fact that it is level 7, which makes it useful to use as material for the summon of Rank 7 XYZ monsters. Along with its useful level, it can be special summoned from the hand if a player controls no monsters, so it is incredibly easy to get onto the board and work around the opponent's setup. Furthermore, it can also banish a face-up card on the opponent's board, making it an incredible piece of generic removal. The Kashtira archetype is not as popular as it once was, but Kashtira Fenrir still sees competitive play in various strategies.

In the modern era of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Konami seems to dislike printing Pendulum monsters because they were difficult to balance when the mechanic was first released, and they ruined one competitive format. Because of this, many cards that support the card type are currently on the game's Forbidden & Limited Card List, and the most notable of these cards is Heavymetalfoes Electrumite.

Heavymetalfoes Electrumite can add a Pendulum monster from the deck to the extra deck face up when it is link summoned, which makes it work around the traditional restrictions of Pendulum monsters. Furthermore, its second effect allows players to destroy a card they control to add a Pendulum monster from the face-up extra deck to the hand. Finally, the card also has a third useful effect, as players can draw a card if a card leaves their Pendulum Zone, which punishes the opponent for disrupting the board. Overall, Heavymetalfoes Electrumite is still banned from competitive play to this day, and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.

The Virtual World archetype was once meta because it had a variety of options to counter many of the other meta decks, and it had various boss monsters of differing extra deck monsters. The archetype allowed itself to go between different monster types depending on the spot of a combo it finds itself in, which made the deck incredibly versatile. One card in the deck has more versatility than any other, and that is why Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu is among the best Psychic-type monsters of all time.

1600/600

Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu special summons itself from the hand by sending a Virtual World monster with a different type than it from the deck to the GY, then adding a Virtual World card with a different type from the deck. While this effect might be incredibly convoluted, it allowed the Virtual World archetype to be remarkably resilient, which made it a meta mainstay for a few years.

Handtraps are arguably the most integral mechanic in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game because they are the main way to interrupt the opponent's plays during their turn. While some of them are used in nearly every format and have become staples of almost every deck in the game. However, some of them are used in specific circumstances, and Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit is the best of the latter bunch.

Attribute

0/1800

Taking down these opponents in Yu-Gi-Oh! requires expert strategy and skill, but it's certainly not impossible if you play your cards right.

Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit can destroy a card on the field by discarding itself from the hand, which is great for interrupting field spells, as those cards need to be on the board to utilize their effects. Overall, Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit is more format-dependent than some other hand traps, but that does not mean that it is not a formidable threat in a variety of formats.

Complaint comes as Trump administration faces pressure over Epstein files scandal

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Donald Trump, who has regularly indulged in conspiracy theories alongside his supporters during his rise to power, complained on Sunday that Democrats are too focused on conspiracy theories, as fallout for the administration continues over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

“All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense,” Trump said during a meeting in Scotland with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer.""

Trump himself has long employed conspiracies as a candidate and then president, from becoming one of the leading proponents of the Obama birther conspiracy, to playing into his supporters' fixation with the QAnon movement. 

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump continued this trend, latching onto a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets.

Now, after years of courting conspiracies about his opponents, the spotlight has turned on Trump over Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a federal trial on sex trafficking charges. 

The administration's handling of materials related to Epstein investigations — disclosing an initial tranche of information that was mostly already public earlier this year, then suggesting it would not provide further releases, even as recent reporting further highlighted Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier — has driven a rare wedge between Trump and his base.

The Epstein scandal has also provided ammunition to Democrats to scrutinize the president.

Pressure reached such a fever pitch that House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress off to its summer recess early, temporarily averting a bipartisan push to release more Epstein files.

Despite Trump's protests, the issue doesn't look set to settle anytime soon, after Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, was subpoenaed to testify in Congress and gave an interview to the Justice Department.

Amid continued furor over the Epstein case, the Trump administration has asked a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the alleged trafficker, while opposing Maxwell's bid at the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. 

The Epstein saga appears set to continue, as does Trump and his allies' insistence that conspiracies are at work to thwart the MAGA movement.

The president has taken to describing the 2016 investigations into whether Russia collaborated with this presidential campaign as a “coup” orchestrated by Barack Obama, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the former president to face criminal charges for the “treasonous conspiracy.”

(Obama's office has said the claims are a “ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”)

Thailand and Cambodia on Sunday signaled their readiness to negotiate an end to a deadly border dispute following mediation efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump. The fighting, now in its fourth day, has killed at least 34 people and displaced more than 168,000.

Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday that he spoke to the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia and suggested he would not move forward with trade agreements with either country if the hostilities continued. He later said both sides agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said Sunday his country agreed to pursue an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire."" He said Trump told him that Thailand had also agreed to halt attacks following Trump's conversation with Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai.

""This is positive news for the soldiers and people of both countries,"" Hun Manet said in a statement.

He said he tasked his deputy, Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, to coordinate next steps with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and to engage directly with Thailand's foreign minister to implement the ceasefire.

Thailand expressed cautious support. Phumtham thanked Trump and said that Thailand agreed in principle to a ceasefire but stressed the need for ""sincere intention"" from Cambodia, the Thai Foreign Ministry said. Phumtam called for swift bilateral talks to discuss concrete steps toward a peaceful resolution, it said.

The fighting first flared Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand closed its border crossings with Cambodia.

Despite the diplomatic efforts, fighting continued Sunday along parts of the contested border, with both sides refusing to budge and trading blame over renewed shelling and troop movements.

Col. Richa Suksowanont, a Thai army deputy spokesperson, said Cambodian forces fired heavy artillery into Surin province, including at civilian homes early Sunday. He said Cambodia also launched rocket attacks targeting the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple claimed by both countries, and other areas in a bid to reclaim territory secured by Thai troops. Thai forces responded with long-range artillery to strike Cambodian artillery and rocket launchers.

Richa said Trump's efforts to mediate was a ""separate matter."" The battlefield operations will continue and a ceasefire can only happen if Cambodia formally initiates negotiations, he added.

""Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law,"" Thailand's Foreign Ministry said separately.

Cambodian Defense Ministry spokesperson Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata accused Thai forces of escalating the violence with bombardment of Cambodian territory early Sunday, followed by a ""large-scale incursion"" involving tanks and ground troops in multiple areas.

""Such actions undermine all efforts toward peaceful resolution and expose Thailand's clear intent to escalate rather than de-escalate the conflict,"" she said.

Thailand on Sunday reported a new death of a soldier, bringing the total number of fatalities to 21, mostly civilians. Cambodia said 13 people have been killed. More than 131,000 people in Thailand have evacuated to safe locations and over 37,000 people fled from three Cambodian provinces. Many border villages are mostly deserted, with many schools and hospitals shut.

Pichayut Surasit, an air-conditioning technician in Thailand, said the sudden outbreak of fighting meant leaving his work in Bangkok to return home to protect his family.

""I didn't have the heart to continue with my work when I heard the news. I wanted to come back as soon as possible but I had to wait until the evening,"" he said. Now at a shelter in Surin housing some 6,000 evacuees, Pichayut worries for his wife and twin daughters, hoping the conflict will end soon so they can return to their home in Kap Choeng district, one of the hardest hit by shelling.

Bualee Chanduang, a local vendor who moved to the same shelter Thursday with her family and pet rabbit, is counting on swift negotiations to end the violence. ""I pray for God to help that both sides can agree to talk and end this war,"" she said.

The U.N. Security Council has called on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional bloc, to mediate peace between the two members. Human Rights Watch has condemned the reported use of cluster munitions, weapons banned by International law, in populated areas, and urged both governments to protect civilians.

The 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The latest tensions flared in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand's domestic politics.

Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet in Stockholm on Monday to tackle longstanding economic disputes at the centre of the countries' trade war, aiming to extend a truce keeping sharply higher tariffs at bay.

China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with President Donald Trump's administration, after Beijing and Washington reached a preliminary deal in June to end weeks of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs.

Without an agreement, global supply chains could face renewed turmoil from duties exceeding 100 per cent.

The Stockholm talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, take place a day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meets Trump at his golf course in Scotland to try to clinch a deal that would likely see a 15 per cent baseline tariff on most EU goods.

Trade analysts on both sides of the Pacific say the discussions in the Swedish capital are unlikely to produce any breakthroughs but could prevent further escalation and help create conditions for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet later this year.

Previous U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva and London in May and June focused on bringing U.S. and Chinese retaliatory tariffs down from triple-digit levels and restoring the flow of rare earth minerals halted by China and Nvidia H20 AI chips and other goods halted by the United States. 

U.S. to discuss tariff deadline extension with China as Trump, Philippines reach deal

So far, the talks have not delved into broader economic issues. They include U.S. complaints that China's state-led, export-driven model is flooding world markets with cheap goods, and Beijing's complaints that U.S. national security export controls on tech goods seek to stunt Chinese growth.

“Stockholm will be the first meaningful round of U.S.-China trade talks,” said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at China consultancy firm Plenum.

Trump has been successful in pressuring some other trading partners, including Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, into deals accepting higher U.S. tariffs of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. 

He said there was a 50-50 chance that the U.S. and the 27-member European Union could also reach a framework trade pact, adding that Brussels wanted to “make a deal very badly”.

Two of Trump's top trade officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, will attend the Scotland talks and then travel to Stockholm. 

Analysts say the U.S.-China negotiations are far more complex and will require more time. China's grip on the global market for rare earth minerals and magnets, used in everything from military hardware to car windshield wiper motors, has proved to be an effective leverage point on U.S. industries.

In the background of the talks is speculation about a possible meeting between Trump and Xi in late October.

Trump has said he will decide soon whether to visit China in a landmark trip to address trade and security tensions. A new flare-up of tariffs and export controls would likely derail any plans for a meeting with Xi.

“The Stockholm meeting is an opportunity to start laying the groundwork for a Trump visit to China,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

Bessent has already said he wants to work out an extension of the August 12 deadline to prevent tariffs snapping back to 145 per cent on the U.S. side and 125 per cent on the Chinese side.

Still, China will likely request a reduction of multi-layered U.S. tariffs totaling 55 per cent on most goods and further easing of U.S. high-tech export controls, analysts said. Beijing has argued that such purchases would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached US$295.5-billion in 2024.

China is currently facing a 20 per cent tariff related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis, a 10 per cent reciprocal tariff, and 25 per cent duties on most industrial goods imposed during Trump's first term.

Bessent has also said he would discuss with He the need for China to rebalance its economy away from exports toward domestic consumer demand. The shift would require China to put an end to a protracted property crisis and boost social safety nets to encourage household spending.

Michael Froman, a former U.S. trade representative during Barack Obama's administration, said such a shift has been a goal of U.S. policymakers for two decades.

“Can we effectively use tariffs to get China to fundamentally change their economic strategy? That remains to be seen,” said Froman, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.

The United Kingdom could resort to military force against China in the event of an escalation over Taiwan, British Defense Secretary John Healey has said, though he emphasized that London continues to prefer a diplomatic resolution.

Speaking to The Telegraph during a visit to Australia, Healey said Britain would “secure peace through strength” if necessary – marking one of the clearest signals yet from a senior UK official regarding the possibility of direct confrontation with Beijing.

Healey made the remarks as the HMS Prince of Wales, a British aircraft carrier equipped with F-35 fighter jets, docked in the northern Australian city of Darwin. It is the first time in nearly 30 years that a British strike group has arrived in the region. The carrier is on a nine-month Pacific deployment, participating in Australia's Talisman Sabre exercise and visiting ports in Japan and South Korea.

”If we have to fight, as we have done in the past, Australia and the UK are nations that will fight together. We exercise together and by exercising together and being more ready to fight, we deter better together,” Healey said when asked what London would do in case of an escalation around Taiwan.

The secretary then said he was speaking in “general terms.” According to Healey, London's approach to Taiwan has not changed. China considers the island of Taiwan part of its territory under the One-China principle, and insists on eventual reunification. According to the Chinese government, peaceful reunion is preferable, but it reserves the right to use force if necessary.

Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, when nationalist forces retreated to the island after losing the Chinese Civil War. Most nations, including Russia, recognize Taiwan as part of China. The UK, as well as the US, also formally stick to the One-China principle while maintaining informal ties with Taiwan and supplying it with weapons and ammunition.

Last month, Beijing criticized a British warship's passage through the Taiwan Strait in Chinese territorial waters. Such actions “deliberately cause trouble” and undermine peace in the area, it said.

What if the next global security pact wasn't forged in Brussels or Washington – but in Beijing, with Iran at the table?

This is no longer a theoretical question. At the mid-July meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers in China, Iran made it clear: Tehran now views the SCO not just as a regional forum, but as a potential counterweight to NATO. In doing so, it signaled a profound strategic pivot – away from an outdated Western-dominated system and toward an emerging Eurasian order.

The summit highlighted the increasing resilience of multilateral Eurasian cooperation in the face of growing global turbulence. Russia was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who also met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping – an encounter that underscored the strength of the Moscow-Beijing axis. On the sidelines, Lavrov held bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of China, Pakistan, India, and notably, Iran. His talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi focused on diplomatic solutions to the nuclear issue and emphasized deepening strategic coordination.

The Iranian side used the platform with purpose. Araghchi expressed his appreciation for the SCO's solidarity amid Israeli aggression and stressed that Iran views the organization not as symbolic, but as a practical mechanism for regional unity and global positioning.

India's full participation also contradicted predictions in Western circles that geopolitical tensions would paralyze the SCO. Instead, New Delhi reaffirmed its commitment to the platform. The implication is clear: unlike NATO, where unity depends on compliance with a central authority, the SCO has proven flexible enough to accommodate diverse interests while building consensus.

For Russia, the SCO remains a cornerstone of its Eurasian strategy. Moscow serves as a balancing force – linking China with South and Central Asia, and now, with an assertive Iran. Russia's approach is pragmatic, multi-vector, and geared toward creating a new geopolitical equilibrium.

The heart of the summit was Abbas Araghchi's speech – an assertive and legally grounded critique of Israeli and American actions. He cited Article 2, Section 4 of the UN Charter, denounced attacks on Iran's IAEA-monitored nuclear facilities, and invoked Resolution 487 of the UN Security Council. His message: Western aggression has no legal cover, and no amount of narrative control can change that.

But beyond condemnation, Araghchi delivered a concrete roadmap to strengthen the SCO as a vehicle for collective security and sovereignty:

A collective security body to respond to external aggression, sabotage, and terrorism

A permanent coordination mechanism for documenting and countering subversive acts

A Center for Sanctions Resistance, to shield member economies from unilateral Western measures

A Shanghai Security Forum for defense and intelligence coordination

Enhanced cultural and media cooperation to counter cognitive and information warfare

These are not rhetorical gestures – they are blueprints for institutional transformation. Iran is operationalizing a new security doctrine built on multipolarity, mutual defense, and resistance to hybrid threats.

While NATO is structured around a rigid hierarchy dominated by Washington, the SCO embodies a post-hegemonic vision: sovereignty, equality, and civilizational plurality. Its member states represent over 40% of the global population, possess vast industrial capacities, and share a collective desire to break the unipolar mold.

Tehran's bet is clear: the SCO offers not just a geopolitical shelter, but a platform for advancing a new global logic – one rooted in strategic autonomy, not dependency.

The sophistication and clarity of Araghchi's initiatives suggest that Tehran is preparing for the long game. Behind closed doors, the summit likely featured discussions – formal and informal – about deepening SCO institutionalism, perhaps even rethinking the organization's mandate.

Araghchi made that vision explicit: “The SCO is gradually strengthening its position on the world stage... It must adopt a more active, independent, and structured role.” That's diplomatic code for institutional realignment.

The Western response was immediate. Within days of Iran's proposals, the EU imposed new sanctions on eight individuals and one Iranian organization – citing vague claims of “serious human rights violations.” Israel, by contrast, faced no new penalties.

It is geopolitical signaling. Tehran's push to turn the SCO into an action-oriented bloc is seen in Brussels and Washington as a direct threat to the current order. The more coherent and proactive the SCO becomes, the harsher the pressure will grow.

But that pressure proves Iran's point. The rules-based order is no longer rules-based – it is power-based. For countries like Iran, the only path to sovereignty is through multilateral defiance and integration on their own terms.

Iran is not improvising. It is positioning itself as a co-architect of a post-Western security order. Its vision for the SCO goes beyond survival – it is about shaping an international system where no single bloc can dominate through sanctions, information warfare, or coercive diplomacy.

This strategy has implications far beyond Tehran. If the SCO embraces Iran's proposals and begins to institutionalize them, we could be witnessing the early formation of the 21st-century's first true alternative to NATO.

The West may dismiss this as fantasy – but in Eurasia, the future is already being drafted. And this time, it's not happening in English.

Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to start talks on a ceasefire. US President Donald Trump had warned that he would not pursue trade agreements with either country if they continued fighting. However, the sides have continued to exchange fire.

A territorial dispute had been simmering between the countries since the colonial era, as an early 20th century French map left some parts of the border ill-defined.

On Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines in the disputed area, prompting Thailand to allege that they were newly laid. A skirmish ensued the next day that escalated into sustained fighting, with each side accusing the other of provoking the conflict.

Since the start of hostilities, at least 34 people have been killed, including civilians and soldiers on both sides; tens of thousands have been displaced.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had spoken with both countries' leaders and urged an “immediate ceasefire.” 

“We happen to be, by coincidence, currently dealing on Trade with both Countries, but do not want to make any Deal, with either Country, if they are fighting — And I have told them so,” he wrote.

He later added that the countries “have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE.”

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Sunday that his country has agreed to an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire,” adding that Trump told him Thailand had also agreed to halt attacks.

Thailand's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai had spoken with Trump and “in principle” accepted the ceasefire proposal. However, it added that Thailand expected “genuine commitment from Cambodia.”

Despite the statements, the two countries exchanged fire on Sunday. Cambodia accused Thailand of launching a “large-scale incursion” with tanks and heavy shelling. Bangkok countered that a cessation of hostilities “cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith” and accused the opposing forces of violating humanitarian law.

Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamad Hasan announced that the two countries will hold talks in his country on Monday, adding that Kuala Lumpur should guide the settlement process.

TEL AVIV, July 27. /TASS/. Israel is determined to achieve all of its goals in the Gaza Strip and eliminate Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

""We will continue to fight, we will continue to act until we achieve all of our war goals — until complete victory,"" he said in a vide address while visiting the Ramon Air Force Base in the Negev Desert. ""We will eliminate Hamas.""

""In order to complete this goal (Hamas elimination - TASS), and also the release of our hostages, we are making progress in fighting and negotiating,"" he said.

""In any path we choose, we will have to continue to allow the entry of minimal humanitarian supplies [to the Gaza Strip]. We have done this until now,"" Netanyahu said, adding that the United Nations is lying about Israel by saying that it is ""not allowing humanitarian supplies to enter."" ""It is allowed. There are secured convoys,"" he stressed.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BERLIN, July 27. /TASS/. Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger has said that the country is open to discussing its potential membership in NATO and that such a discussion could be ""quite productive"" amid growing security threats.

""One thing is clear: neutrality alone cannot protect us,"" she said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. According to Meinl-Reisinger, the security situation is becoming increasingly instable and Russia is allegedly growing more and more aggressive. ""[Austria] is protected by investments in defense and partner relations. I am principally open to discussing the future of Austria's security and defense policy,"" she stated.

""Although there is no majority in favor of the NATO membership either in parliament or among the population, such a discussion could be quite productive,"" she said. ""I don't mean to say that we must join NATO triumphantly. But we cannot sit by saying: if we do no harm to anyone, no one will do any harm to us. It would be naive,"" she stressed, adding that the world has changed.

""However, I want to make thig clear: we have a partner, the European Union, who will defend us in an emergency situation. At the same time, we are contributing much to European security,"" she noted, adding that the Austrian military is participating in numerous EU peacekeeping missions. ""In this context, Austria's neutrality has visibly changed since its accession to the European Union in 1995,"" he pointed out.

Earlier, her party, New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS), called on its partners in the ruling coalition to look at the possible participation in the creation of a European army instead of sticking to the country's neutrality. Austria's off-bloc status is committed to paper in a special constitutional law, which was passed by parliament in 1955.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was to meet with US President Donald Trump after press time last night to clinch a trade deal for Europe that would likely see a 15 percent baseline tariff on most EU goods, but end months of uncertainty for EU companies.

Trump, in Scotland for a few days of golfing and bilateral meetings, told reporters upon his arrival on Friday evening that von der Leyen was a highly respected leader and he was looking forward to meeting with her on his golf course in Turnberry.

He said there was a 50-50 chance that the US and the 27-member EU could reach a framework trade pact, adding that Brussels wanted to “make a deal very badly.”

The EU faces US tariffs on more than 70 percent of its exports, with 50 percent on steel and aluminum, 25 percent on cars and car parts and a 10 percent levy on most other EU goods. Trump has said he would hike the rate to 30 percent on Friday, a level EU officials said would wipe out whole chunks of transatlantic commerce.

Further tariffs on copper and pharmaceuticals are looming.

A 15 percent tariff on most EU goods would be seen by many in Europe as a poor outcome compared with the initial European ambition of a zero-for-zero tariff deal on all industrial goods.

However, it would be better than 30 percent and it would remove uncertainty about business conditions that has already hit profits of European companies. For Trump a deal with the EU would be the biggest trade agreement, surpassing the US$550 billion accord reached with Japan on Tuesday last week.

Trump, who is seeking to reorder the global economy and reduce decades-old US trade deficits, has so far reeled in agreements with the UK, Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam, although his administration has failed to deliver on a promise of “90 deals in 90 days.”

The EU deal would be a huge prize, given that the US and EU are each other's largest trading partners by far and account for a third of global trade.

“We're cautiously optimistic that there will be a deal reached,” said a Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “But it's not over till it's over.”

In case there is no deal and the US imposes 30 percent tariffs, the EU prepared countertariffs on 93 billion euros (US$109.2 billion) of US goods.

EU diplomats have said a possible deal would likely include a broad 15 percent tariff on EU goods imported into the US, mirroring the US-Japan deal, along with a 50 percent tariff on European steel and aluminum.

It remains unclear if Washington would exempt EU imports from other sectoral tariffs on automobiles, pharmaceuticals and other goods that have already been announced or are pending, although EU officials are hopeful the 15 percent baseline tariff would apply also to cars and pharmaceuticals.

Serving craft beer, playing mahjong, stacking shelves and boxing, the dozens of humanoid robots at Shanghai's World AI Conference (WAIC) this weekend were embodiments of China's growing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess and ambition.

The annual event is primed at showcasing China's progress in the ever-evolving field of AI, with the government aiming to position the country as a world leader on both technology and regulation as it snaps at the US' heels.

Opening the event on Saturday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) announced that China would set up a new organization for cooperation on AI governance, warning the benefits of development must be balanced with the risks.

In the cavernous expo next door, the mood was more giddy than concerned.

“Demand is currently very strong, whether in terms of data, scenarios, model training, or artificial construction. The overall atmosphere in all these areas is very lively,” said Yang Yifan (楊一帆), research and development director at Transwarp Technology Co (星環信息科技), a Shanghai-based AI platform provider.

Organizers said that this year's WAIC involved more than 800 companies, showcasing more than 3,000 products — the undeniable crowd pleasers being the humanoid robots and their raft of slightly surreal party tricks. 

At one booth, a robot played drums, half a beat out of time, to Queen's We Will Rock You, while a man in safety goggles and a security vest hyped up a giggling crowd.

Other droids, some dressed in working overalls or baseball caps, worked on assembly lines, played curling with human opponents or sloppily served soft drinks from a dispenser. While most of the machines on display were still a little jerky, the increasing sophistication year-on-year was clear to see. 

The Chinese government has poured support into robotics, an area in which some experts think China might already have the upper hand over the US. At Hangzhou-based Unitree Technology Co's (宇樹科技) stall, its G1 android — about 130cm tall, with a two-hour battery life — kicked, pivoted and punched, keeping its balance with relative fluidity as it shadowboxed around a ring.

Most high-tech helpers do not need hardware. At the expo, AI companions — in the form of middle-aged businessmen, scantily clad women and ancient warriors — waved at people from screens, asking how their day was, while other stalls ran demos allowing visitors to create their own digital avatars.

Tech giant Baidu Inc (百度) on Saturday announced a new generation of technology for its “digital humans” — AI agents modeled on real people, which it says are “capable of thinking, making decisions, and collaborating.”

The company recently ran a six-hour e-commerce broadcast hosted by the “digital human” of a well-known streamer and another avatar. 

The two agents beat the human streamer's debut sales in some categories, Baidu said.

For now, few visitors to the WAIC expo seemed worried about the potential ramifications of the back-flipping dog robots they were excitedly watching. 

“When it comes to China's AI development, we have a comparatively good foundation of data and also a wealth of application scenarios,” Yang said. “There are many more opportunities for experimentation.”

The government is on track to launch the Build Canada Homes initiative this fall, according to Housing Minister Gregor Robertson's spokesperson Renée LeBlanc Proctor.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has been quiet since the federal election about the housing crisis, the same issue that contributed to the Liberals' fading popularity under their previous leader.

Behind the scenes, however, housing stakeholders are fielding a flurry of calls from government officials seeking their advice on the creation of Build Canada Homes, a new federal entity that Mr. Carney has said will get the government back in the business of homebuilding. 

His ambitions, announced during his campaign, were big: act as a developer to build affordable housing, spur innovation in the housing sector and offer low-cost financing to affordable-housing builders. 

However, trade turmoil has quickly overshadowed housing affordability in the political arena, creating a void of information on how the federal government plans to get more homes built.

Renée LeBlanc Proctor, a spokesperson for Housing Minister Gregor Robertson, said in a statement that the government was on track to launch the initiative this fall and stakeholders would learn more soon.

But questions still linger about how the new entity will function, and what its creation will mean for existing programs. Meanwhile, some leaders in the housing policy and advocacy spaces are worried that if the government doesn't move quickly to spur more supply, the economic slowdown caused by U.S. tariffs will set plans further behind. 

Mr. Carney promised the initiative would be a “lean, mission-driven organization” focused on building affordable housing by leveraging public lands and partnering with the private sector. He pitched it as a central piece of the government's plan to double the rate of homebuilding in the country.

Opinion: Ottawa must resist the temptation to fiddle with CMHC amid housing market slump

Raymond Sullivan, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association, an organization that represents the social and non-profit housing sector, said he's encouraged to see affordable housing at the heart of Build Canada Homes' mission. 

But given how long it can take to set up a new bureaucracy, Mr. Sullivan said the government should roll out elements of Build Canada Homes as they become ready, rather than wait for the entire organization to be set up.

“We're not going to have a cake that's fully baked and ready to launch in the fall. So let's focus on the pieces that are already available to us,” he said.

University of Toronto senior housing researcher Carolyn Whitzman said there are two versions of the initiative that are being discussed in policy circles: one that is limited in scope and focused primarily on partnering with developers to build affordable housing on public land, and one that also has a larger mandate encompassing financing and innovation programs. 

Figuring out what exactly Build Canada Homes will be responsible for and how it will distinguish itself from organizations such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation appear to be some of the details Ottawa is trying to hammer out, according to stakeholders consulted by the government. 

Mr. Sullivan said Ottawa should ensure social-housing projects in the pipeline are not affected by the organization's creation. 

“We don't want to see any kind of interruption. We need to know that the government is there as a partner with us, not sitting back for a year building a new structure, but ready to work on things that are ready,” he said.

Real estate is not a financial slam dunk, Canadians are learning the hard way

Some housing experts and stakeholders are skeptical that Build Canada Homes will be a sufficient solution to the housing shortage. 

The government has had mixed success with its housing initiatives in the past – such as the slow progress it's made on converting unused office space into affordable housing recently flagged by the Auditor-General – and a new organization will likely take time to begin delivering results.

“They've talked about partnering with industry to actually build the units, which will be important, because governments around the world have proven that they can't properly get into the actual construction game,” said Kevin Lee, CEO of the Canadian Home Builders' Association. 

Mr. Lee said building affordable housing on public lands also won't be enough to get the government to its goal of 500,000 housing starts a year. (The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts was 283,734 units in June.) 

Meanwhile, the private and social-housing sectors are impatient for clarity on other policy fronts, including the promised GST rebate for first-time homebuyers. Mr. Lee said the delay is affecting demand at a time when the economy is already slowing down the housing market. 

“Having something like that that was promised not get turned into official policy has really thrown another wrench into the system,” said Mr. Lee. 

Proposed GST rebate for first-time homebuyers could offer average relief of $27,000, PBO says

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne introduced legislation in late May to provide the GST rebates. But unlike the government's “One Canadian Economy” legislation, which was rushed through the House of Commons and Senate during the four-week sitting, the bill on GST rebates must wait for Parliament to return in the fall. 

The government's prioritization of fast-tracking approvals for major projects and managing trade tensions with the U.S. reflects a shift in the public's priorities, as well. Polling by Abacus Data shows U.S. President Donald Trump is the second-most important issue to Canadians, with housing and the economy nearly tied for third. (The rising cost of living – which includes housing costs – was the No. 1 issue.)

Mike Moffatt, founding director of the University of Ottawa's Missing Middle Initiative, said the shift in priorities is understandable, though he warned housing could become of greater importance again.

“The government would be doing itself favours if they do the legwork now, because if it becomes a big concern, or the primary concern for Canadians, again, it might be too late to really address that,” Mr. Moffatt said.

The trade war with the United States also has repercussions for the housing market, which won't make the government's job of spurring homebuilding any easier. 

RBC assistant chief economist Robert Hogue said the housing market is slowing down in part as “payback for an exceptionally strong period” after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“However, the trade war kind of put a damper on things and really affected confidence in most of Canada, and that's when we saw, through the winter and spring, a lot of potential home buyers saying, ‘might as well sit it out,'” he said.

These three housing markets are bucking national trends, and Trump is one reason why

“The challenge is to get more demand for new construction at a time when building costs have gone up and and you've got now more inventory in the existing home market, in many places around Canada.”

Mr. Moffatt said as the government works on setting up the organization, it needs to roll out policies that will have a more immediate effect on the housing market.

For example, the government could expand its proposed GST rebate so that all homebuyers of a primary residence are eligible, he said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in the spring his government would match the tax break if it were extended to all homebuyers.

Prof. Whitzman said social-housing builders also are seeking information on a number of programs, including the affordable housing fund, which provided capital for the repair of existing affordable and community housing. That fund recently ran out of money, leaving its future in limbo.

“I'm not saying Build Canada Homes is a bad idea,” she said. “But there's stuff that could be happening tomorrow and there's stuff that should be happening tomorrow.”

A regional passenger train derailed in southern Germany, killing at least three people and seriously injuring others.

At least three people were killed and several others were injured after a passenger train derailed in southwestern Germany on Sunday, according to local authorities.

""According to current investigations, three people were killed and other passengers were seriously injured,"" Ulm police said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear how many people were wounded. 

The train had been carrying around 100 passengers when at least two carriages derailed at around 6:10 p.m. (1610 GMT) near the town of Riedlingen in the state of Baden-Württemberg.

Emergency services including fire brigade, rescue crews and police were attending the scene, while Baden-Württemberg state interior minister Thomas Strobl was also on his way, according to a spokesperson.

""I am in close contact with the interior minister and the transport minister and have asked them to support the rescue forces by all means,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz wrote in a post on X. 

The regional train had been traveling through a hilly and wooded area between Sigmaringen and the city of Ulm where, according to the local Südwest Presse newspaper, the local hospital was freeing up beds to receive casualties.

Police were initially unable to confirm what had caused the accident.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has managed to negotiate a 15% US tariff. She calls the transatlantic agreement ""the biggest deal ever.""

The United States and the European Union on Sunday reached a trade deal, ending a months-long standoff.

 ""We have reached a deal. It's a good deal for everybody,"" US President Donald Trump told reporters after talks with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland.

""We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world. And it's a big deal. It's a huge deal,"" said von der Leyen, who was seeking to finalize an agreement with Washington before the August 1 deadline.

""It will bring stability, it will bring predictability. That's very important for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" she added. 

Ahead of the crunch talks, Trump gave ""a good 50-50 chance"" on Friday for a deal to be reached with the European Union.

""We are agreeing that the tariff straight across, for automobiles and everything else, will be a straight across tariff of 15%,"" according to Trump. Currently, most EU goods face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts.

But the rate would not apply to steel and aluminum, which are being taxed at 50%.

Trump also said the bloc had agreed to purchase ""$750 billion (€638 billion) worth of energy"" from the US, as well as $600 billion more in additional investments.

""Purchases of US energy products will diversify our sources of supply and contribute to Europe's energy security. We will replace Russian gas and oil by significant purchases of US LNG, oil and nuclear fuels,"" von der Leyen told reporters.

She added that the baseline tariff rate of 15% on imported EU goods would apply to cars, semiconductors and pharmaceutical goods.

At the start of the meeting, Trump said that ""fairness"" was the main remaining sticking point.

""Europe is very closed. We don't sell cars into Europe. We don't sell essentially agriculture of any great degree,"" he said.

The trade pact means the bloc would avoid the 30% tariffs that Trump had threatened on all goods from the EU on July 12. 

The 15% rate is the same as the one announced with Japan earlier this week. But it marks a significant compromise, especially given that von der Leyen offered a ""zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods"" when talks began.

Still, the EU chief said they agreed ""zero-for-zero tariffs on a number of strategic products"" including aircraft and aircraft parts, some chemicals, and certain agricultural products.

She added that the framework trade deal did not contain any decision regarding the spirits sector.

The trade pact will need to be approved by all 27 member states. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the trade deal following the announcement.

""We managed to avert a trade conflict that would have hit the export-oriented German economy hard,"" Merz posted on X.

            A regional passenger train derailed in southern Germany, killing at least three people and seriously injuring others on Sunday, authorities said.
    


            Federal and local police said the cause of the crash near Riedlingen, roughly 158 kilometers (98 miles) west of Munich, remains under investigation. Photos from the scene showed parts of the train on its side as rescuers climbed atop the carriages.
    


            It was not immediately clear how many people were injured. Roughly 100 people were onboard the train when at least two carriages derailed in a forested area around 6:10 p.m. (1610 GMT).
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in a post on social platform X, said he mourned the victims and gave his condolences to their families.

            Wildfires that have engulfed Turkey for weeks threatened the country's fourth-largest city early Sunday, causing more than 1,700 people to flee their homes and leaving a firefighter dead.
    


            Meanwhile, firefighters elsewhere in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro, were also battling blazes fed by unusually high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.
    


            Overnight fires in the forested mountains surrounding Bursa in northwest Turkey spread rapidly, tinting the night sky over the city's eastern suburbs with a red glow. Dozens of severe wildfires have hit the country daily since late June, with the government declaring two western provinces, Izmir and Bilecik, disaster areas on Friday.
    


            Bursa governor's office said in a statement Sunday that 1,765 people had been safely evacuated from villages to the northeast as more than 1,900 firefighters battled the flames. The highway linking Bursa to the capital, Ankara, was closed as surrounding forests burned.

            A firefighter died from a heart attack while on the job, the city's mayor, Mustafa Bozbey, said in a statement, adding that the flames had scorched 3,000 hectares (7,413 acres) around the city.
    


            Orhan Saribal, an opposition parliamentarian for the province, described the scene as “an apocalypse.”
    


            By morning, lessening winds brought some respite to firefighters, who continued efforts to battle the flames. However, TV footage revealed an ashen landscape where farms and pine forests had earlier stood.
    


            Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said fire crews across the country confronted 84 separate blazes Saturday. The country's northwest was under the greatest threat, including Karabuk, where wildfires have burned since Tuesday, he said.
    


            Unseasonably high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds have been fueling the wildfires.
    


            The General Directorate of Meteorology said Turkey recorded its highest ever temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern Sirnak province on Friday. The highest temperatures for July were seen in 132 other locations, it said.
    


            Fourteen people have died in recent weeks, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers killed Wednesday in a fire in Eskisehir in western Turkey.
    


            Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said late Saturday that prosecutors had investigated fires in 33 provinces since June 26, and that legal action had been taken against 97 suspects.
    


            In Greece, firefighters battled active wildfires in the country's southwest and on the island of Kythera on Sunday, following a blaze that scorched the northern Athens suburb of Kryoneri on Saturday. High temperatures, reaching 38°C (100°F) or more, persist across much of the country, though winds have eased slightly.
    


            In Kryoneri, 27 residents were evacuated overnight with police assistance after some initially ignored warnings. Authorities urged the public to comply with evacuation orders, warning that resistance puts both civilians and rescuers in danger.
    


            The fire service reported three people hospitalized with breathing issues and one firefighter treated for burns at a military hospital. On the island of Evia, where another fire is now under control, media reports indicate large numbers of animals perished in barns.
    


            On Bulgaria's southern borders with Greece and Turkey, as well as the western Serbian frontier, firefighters battled wildfires as the government declared the worst-hit provinces disaster zones. Residents across nearly half the country were issued with a code red warning, the highest level.
    


            National Fire Service chief Alexander Djartov told reporters that 236 wildfires were burning, many fanned by strong winds. The government had asked EU partners for help, he added, and aircraft were expected from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Hungary and Sweden later Sunday.
    


            In the southwestern Strumyani region, overnight blazes forced firefighters to retreat. They were reinforced Sunday by soldiers. Dozens of people fled their homes in the western Tran region as flames threatened villages near the Serbian border.

Emmy-Award winning host John Walsh touts results: 1,200 arrests, 61 child rescues, as series returns to FOX.

The man imprisoned for kidnapping and murdering a six-year-old boy in New York City nearly 45 years ago has had his conviction overturned. 

64-year-old Pedro Hernandez has been serving 25 years to life in prison after being convicted in 2017 of killing Etan Patz in 1979. 

Patz vanished on the first day he was allowed to walk to the school bus stop by himself on May 25, 1979. He was one of the first missing children to be pictured on milk cartons in a case that drew national attention. 

President Ronald Reagan later declared May 25, 1983, the first National Missing Children's Day in memory of Patz.

COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTION, ORDERS NEW TRIAL OF MAN CONVICTED IN 1979 ETAN PATZ MURDER

On the morning of May 25, 1979, the first-grader was granted permission from his parents to walk alone to the bus stop, located just a block and a half away from where the family lived. His mother took him downstairs and watched him walk into the distance – he was never seen again. 

At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez was working at a convenience shop as a teenager in the child's downtown Manhattan neighborhood. He initially spoke with authorities as they were canvassing for the child, but he did not become a suspect until police received a 2012 tip revealing that Hernandez had previously made remarks about killing a child in New York, but had not mentioned Patz by name. 

Hernandez was arrested in 2012 and ultimately confessed to the crime after seven hours of questioning, telling investigators he had lured Patz into the store's basement with the promise of giving him a soda. Once inside, Hernandez said he had choked the child because ""something just took over me,"" before putting Patz – who Hernandez said was still alive – inside a box and leaving it alongside a pile of trash.

However, Hernandez's lawyers insisted the confession was the result of a mental illness that caused their client to misinterpret his imagination from reality. The attorneys also pointed to Hernandez's very low IQ. 

""Several factors likely contributed to his confession, including low IQ, mental illness, and heightened suggestibility,"" Jonathan Alpert, psychotherapist and author of ""Therapy Nation,"" told Fox News Digital. ""These make someone more prone to internalizing guilt or fabricating details to meet perceived expectations."" 

Alpert has not treated any of the individuals involved in the case.

Hernandez was initially tried in New York state court twice – with the first trial ending in a jury deadlock in 2015 – before an appeal transferred the case into federal court.  

At the time, prosecutors claimed that Hernandez was faking or exaggerating his illness, pointing to Hernandez reportedly admitting to the crimes before police read him his rights and began recording their interview in 2012. He went on to repeat his confession at least twice while being recorded. 

The confession ultimately led to questions from jurors during their nine days of deliberations, with their final inquiry revolving around whether they were required to rule out the two recorded confessions if they were to determine that the first one was invalid – with the judge telling them they were not. 

EXPERT WARNS IDAHO MURDERER'S PLEA DEAL STRATEGY IS A DANGEROUS CALCULATED 'LONG GAME'

An appeals court later ruled the judge should have provided a better explanation to the jury regarding their options, which could have included not factoring in all three of Hernandez's confessions. 

Referring to a jury note during the trial, the appeals court said the judge had provided a ""clearly wrong"" and ""manifestly prejudicial"" response to the question posed. 

The court's decision to overturn Hernandez's conviction and grant him a new trial raises questions regarding mental health and confessions in court cases, as Alpert points to the frequent susceptibility of individuals with mental health disorders to ""have an intense need to gain approval from authority figures."" 

SCOTT PETERSON'S 'STRONGEST ARGUMENT' FOR MURDER CONVICTION APPEAL IS A LONG SHOT: CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER

""When interrogators suggest a narrative, these individuals can absorb and repeat it, not out of deceit, but out of compliance. Over time, they may even start to believe it themselves, especially when under stress or exhaustion."" 

While a new trial could bring additional clarity for a case that has spanned decades, Alpert warns that it could also lead to misunderstandings regarding testimony and evidence years later. 

""A retrial has the potential to bring clarity, especially if new psychological insights or evidence are introduced,"" Alpert told Fox News Digital. ""But it could just as easily create more confusion, particularly if the case continues to rely heavily on interpretation rather than hard facts.""

The case garnered national attention, with Patz's photo being one of the first to be circulated on milk cartons throughout the country. His parents spent decades in the same home and with the same phone number, in hopes of their son eventually returning to them. 

The child's family worked to help establish a national missing-children hotline and pioneered a new way for law enforcement agencies throughout the country to distribute information regarding such cases. 

""They waited and persevered for 35 years for justice for Etan, which today, sadly, may have been lost,"" former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. told The Associated Press after hearing about the reversal.

The court ordered Hernandez's release unless he receives a new trial within ""a reasonable time period."" 

""For more than 13 years, Pedro Hernandez has been in prison for a crime he did not commit and based on a conviction that the Second Circuit has now made clear was obtained in clear violation of law,"" Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""We are grateful the Court has now given Pedro a chance to get his life back, and we call upon the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to drop these misguided charges and focus their efforts where they belong – on finding those actually responsible for the disappearance of Etan Patz.""

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

""This case highlights a broader issue in the legal system,"" Alpert said. ""Confessions are not always reliable. Mental illness, coercion or desperation can all lead someone to admit guilt falsely. Without physical evidence to support a confession, courts must proceed with extreme caution. Understanding the psychology behind a confession is essential before treating it as fact.""

President Donald Trump announces a trade deal between the United States and the European Union with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a trade deal between the U.S. and European Union on Sunday.

The announcement came moments after the two had addressed the media, agreeing that the likelihood of an agreement was about 50-50. Von der Leyen said the negotiations had taken some ""heavy lifting,"" but the two leaders agreed they were happy with the result.

""We are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else will be a straight-across tariff of 15%,"" Trump said.

""So we have a tariff of 15%. We have the opening up of all of the European countries, which I think I could say were essentially closed. I mean, you weren't exactly taking our orders. You weren't exactly taking our agriculture,"" he added, addressing von der Leyen.

Von der Leyen said Europe will also purchase $150 billion worth of U.S. energy as part of the deal, in addition to making $600 billion in other investments into the U.S.

TRUMP HEADS TO SCOTLAND TO TALK GOLF, POLITICS AND TRADE

Trump and von der Leyen had sounded unsure of whether a deal would be reached even as they spoke to the press in Scotland on Sunday.

""We look forward to talking to see if we can do something,"" Trump had said of the negotiations. ""We've had, a very good relationship over the years, but it's been a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.""

Responding to a reporter's question, von der Leyen agreed with Trump that there must be a ""rebalancing"" of the bilateral trade, which is worth billions of dollars.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says negotiating a trade deal with the U.S. took some ""heavy lifting.""

""It is about rebalancing,"" von der Leyen said as she sat next to Trump. ""You can call it fairness, you can call it rebalancing. We have a surplus and the United States has a deficit, and we have to rebalance it.""

President Donald Trump holds a conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Turnberry, Scotland.

President Donald Trump blasted the European Union for not providing aid to Gaza on Sunday, adding that Israel must ""make a decision"" about how to handle the region with Hamas still holding hostages.

Trump made the comments while meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland. He said that the U.S. has given millions in aid to Gazans, but claimed there has been no assistance from European countries.

""We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food for Gaza, and nobody acknowledged it. Nobody talks about it. And it makes you feel a little bad when you do that. And, you know, you have other countries not giving anything. None of the European countries, by the way, gave – I mean, nobody gave but us and nobody said, gee, thank you very much. And it would be nice to have at least a thank you.""

Trump went on to note that a deal needs to be made between Israel and Hamas to end the war and return the last remaining hostages to Israel, despite many of them being dead.

""But we have a lot of bodies, and the parents want those bodies as much as they would want their child if that child were alive,"" Trump said of the hostages and their families.

He suggested that Hamas is reluctant to make a deal for the final hostages because they feel it would be ""the end for them"" if they lose leverage against Israel.

""You know, they had a routine discussion the other day and all of a sudden they hardened up. They don't want to give them back. And so Israel is going to have to make a decision,"" Trump said.

The meeting comes as the IDF highlighted its efforts to deliver aid into Gaza after restricting the flow in recent months.

Israel is now conducting airdrops for aid throughout the region, and the IDF says it conducted 28 drops in a matter of hours on Sunday.

President Donald Trump says Israel's leaders must ""make a decision"" about how to end the war in Gaza. 

""Let me be clear: Israel supports aid for civilians, not for Hamas. The IDF will continue to support the flow of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,"" an IDF spokesperson said, claiming Israel transferred roughly 250 trucks full of aid into Gaza this week.

The IDF argues the reports about starvation in Gaza were a false campaign promoted by Hamas, but hunger is spreading across the region after the United Nations and the IDF previously failed to reach an agreement about aid distribution, Fox News' Trey Yingst reported.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump's 'historic' trade deal with Japan and the advancements in artificial intelligence.

Japanese populist Sohei Kamiya stunned many in the country when his Sanseitō party won 14 seats in Japan's Upper House elections last week.

""From supermarket manager to bright political star … populism has hit the shores of Japan like a tsunami,"" Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital about 47-year-old Kamiya's surprise achievement. 

Holding 15 of 248 Upper House seats is not sufficient for Kamiya's party to submit legislation. However, polling data shows Sanseitō's impact with younger voters, as Kyodo News reported that more than 20% of voters from 18 to 40 voted for his party.

TRUMP SECURES HISTORIC $550B TRADE DEAL WITH JAPAN: ‘NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT'

Inspired by President Donald Trump's leadership style, Kamiya's rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to ""blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.

Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump's MAGA motto, proclaiming ""Japanese first"" as his party promises to strengthen Japan's culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration. 

Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya's goals of ""protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan"" are ""fairly populist,"" they do not represent ""a radical move towards the right wing."" 

In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, ""are more right-wing than Sanseitō."" Gatling described members of Kamiya's party as ""pretty reasonable."" 

Gaitlin said that Kamiya, formerly a reservist in the Self-Defense Forces and an English teacher, ""doesn't appear to be playing."" Kamiya ""has been honing his message for some time,"" Gatling said.

Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya's anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan ""xenophobic"" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. ""It's not that we're xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures,"" Kamiya said. ""You are meddling too much in our internal affairs."" 

Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic ""just doesn't ring true."" He explained that the country has ""one of the most astonishing cultures in history,"" formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create ""a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world.""

Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.

The rice trade would be critical to this arrangement, with Sanseitō eager to curb imports of U.S. rice. At present, imports of U.S. rice are set to increase by 75%, thanks to a $550 billion trade deal President Donald Trump signed with Japan on July 22.

Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseitō's desire to turn the nation's farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. ""The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,"" he explained. ""I'm not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.""

While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseitō in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not ""interested in building a coalition government."" Gatling believes the party's future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that ""they have reasonable policies.""

Chang said Sanseitō's win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has ""been adrift"" since Abe's 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ""is weak and unpopular,"" and the LDP now finds itself ""in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,"" Chang said. ""Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.""

While the political waves leave Japan ""rudderless,"" Chang said to ""expect Sanseitō to only get stronger, which means Japan will turn inward. Around the world, societies have had enough of large foreign populations that do not assimilate, so we should not be surprised that Kamiya will become even more influential.

""Change occurs slowly in Japan until it happens all at once. Japan is now on the verge of an all-at-once moment,"" Chang said.

President Donald Trump said that the United States reached a trade deal with the European Union.

He told reporters it will include a 15% tariff on most imports, including automobiles. The deal comes after months of trade talks between the two bodies.

The deal is in line with recent trade deals the Trump administration has struck with other countries. Before this announcement, the EU was set to be subject to 30% tariffs by Trump's August 1 trade deal deadline.

Trump also said that the EU agreed to purchase $750 billion of American energy and would increase its investment in the U.S. by more than $600 billion above its current levels. A timeline for these investments was not announced.

The trade deal still represents a large increase in tariffs for the U.S.-EU relationship.

The 15% automobile tariff on European cars will be lower than the 25% overall tariff on automobiles that Trump announced in April. 

Trump additionally suggested that pharmaceuticals from the EU will be in a separate deal. The EU was hoping to cap the tariff rate on pharmaceuticals, which is the continent's largest export to the U.S. 

“Pharmaceuticals are very special,” Trump said to reporters before the meeting.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union, said that this deal will “rebalance” the American and European trading relationship. The two leaders met while Trump was on a trip to Scotland.

During his presidency, Trump has frequently delayed his tariff deadlines and changed the proposed rates. 

These tariffs on the EU were announced April 2 as a part of Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs, but were paused for 90 days less than a week later and capped at 10% for the most part. The tariffs were set to go into effect July 9, but that was extended to August 1. 

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that there will be “No extensions. No more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place.”

Trump previously said the new Aug. 1 deadline is “firm but not 100% firm.”

NINETY DEALS IN 90 DAYS: TRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE CLOUDS ‘LIBERATION DAY' ECONOMIC FORECAST

The Trump administration said they would make “90 deals in 90 days,” but have announced just around a dozen since. These include deals with the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Japan and Indonesia. Trump recently signaled trade agreements are coming soon with Cambodia and Thailand.

The Trump administration has not yet struck a deal with China, which at one point in Trump's trade war was subject to the highest tariff rate at 145%. The Trump administration has also not yet struck a deal with Canada, one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday that Rep. James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, could question former first lady Jill Biden and the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Republican lawmakers have been rallying against former President Joe Biden for his use of an autopen to issue pardons. The committee has called Biden administration officials to Capitol Hill to testify.

“Even though Anthony Fauci has been pardoned, there is some question whether it's a legitimate pardon. His pardon wasn't signed by President Biden,” Paul said during an appearance on the radio show Cats Roundtable on WABC 770 AM.

“It's unclear whether President Biden is mentally cognizant enough of the situation to know who he pardoned. Hundreds and hundreds of people were pardoned in a day by a mechanical signature from a machine. We do know there's been testimony from the people running the machine that they never talked to the president, that they talked to an assistant that works for the president's wife,” he added. 

Many members of the Biden administration have pleaded their Fifth Amendment rights in the congressional investigation. Biden's chief of staff until 2023, however, testified for several hours last week. 

Biden has argued that other presidents in previous administrations have used an autopen. Republicans have still questioned their validity. 

Paul pointed to Biden's pardon of his son Hunter Biden that was seemingly not signed using an autopen.

“I think there is a question whether these pardons are valid. Interestingly, when he had to do the pardon for his son, he didn't take any chances by running it for the autopen,” Paul said.

“The pardon for Hunter Biden for any crimes committed over the last 10 years, any crimes, was done by personal hand signature by Biden, not the autopen,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

French President Emmanuel Macron was likely motivated to declare his intent to recognize Palestine by a desire to quell Islamic separatism in his own country.

The decision, announced on Thursday, is a break from the ranks of the European establishment, which has offered limp support to a two-state solution without daring to recognize the territories during the ongoing conflict with Israel.

Growing discontent within his own nation's borders, concerns about religious extremism, and a government report pushing for Palestinian state recognition point to the idea that his decision might have been motivated by self-interest.

“France's recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state must be motivated by domestic French politics, because it certainly does nothing to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace,” Orde Kittrie, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and law professor at Arizona State University, speculated to the Washington Examiner.

Kittrie, who also served for over a decade as an attorney at the United States's State Department, pointed to the tumultuous relationship between the French government and Islamic communities within its borders as a possible motivator.

“France's Muslim population numbers over 6 million, the largest in Europe, and Macron has recently undertaken a crackdown on what he calls Islamic separatism in France, which has led to accusations that his government is making it harder for Muslims to express their identity.”

She continued, “Macron's foreign policy move to throw Israel under the bus was evidently taken to appease Muslim critics of his domestic crackdown on Islamic separatism.”

The assertion that Macron is offering gestures towards Palestine for domestic benefit is not without basis. The French government itself has acknowledged that such a move could help appease Muslim citizens, who accuse their leaders of Islamophobia.

The French Ministry of Interior released a report in May that noted a “tense climate prevailing in France following October 7 between Jewish and Muslim communities” and “deep unease within the latter, which perceives the French position as openly pro-Israel, in line with an alleged ‘state Islamophobia,' supporting Jewish Israelis against Muslim Palestinians.” 

The report claimed that this dichotomy is being weaponized by the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist groups operating clandestinely in France to radicalize Muslim citizens.

The Interior Ministry report explicitly suggested the recognition of Palestine as a means of quelling Islamic unrest, according to a translation from the Center for Security Policy.

“To counter this narrative, and independently of the measures mentioned in this report that would reaffirm that Muslim faith and culture are as respectable as others and that the Republic guarantees their free exercise and manifestation, France's recognition of a Palestinian state alongside Israel within secure and recognized borders could help alleviate these frustrations.”

France is home to approximately 9 million Muslims, the second-largest religion in the country behind Christianity.

The country has passed an abundance of laws cracking down on what Macron calls “Islamic separatism,” an ideology he believes is an “enemy of the Republic”. Previous laws restricting religious expression in public spaces have been augmented by crackdowns on illicit Islamic homeschools, doctors providing “virginity certificates,” instances of clandestine polygamy, and reports of forced marriages.

These measures have only inflamed tensions between Muslims and the rest of French society.

If Macron was hoping for support in his decision from across the Atlantic, he is likely disappointed.

President Donald Trump dismissed the announcement as meaningless while speaking to Friday's reporters at the White House.

UK, GERMANY, FRANCE HOLD CALL ON GAZA AFTER MACRON SAYS HE'LL RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE

“What he says doesn't matter,” Trump said. “He's a very good guy. I like him. But that statement doesn't carry weight.”

Kittrie claims the French government's decision to appease Palestinian leaders is weakening U.S. negotiating positions, providing the illusion of a path forward outside previously established demands.

“Macron's statement undercuts both the United States and Middle East peace by relieving pressure on the Palestinians to compromise with Israel,” she explained to the Washington Examiner. “Hamas is a lot less likely to agree to release the hostages, and Abbas is a lot less likely to agree to peace with Israel, when European leaders like Macron are making unilateral concessions.”

France's decision is expected to be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Zelensky Learned the Wrong Lesson From Trump","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/zelensky-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies/683672/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 17:30:00 GMT","

Trump withdrew from the fight against kleptocracy, and other countries have absorbed that fact.

Volodymyr Zelensky built a mythic reputation as a lonely bulwark against global tyranny. On Tuesday, the president of Ukraine signed that reputation away, enacting a law that gutted the independence of his country's anti-corruption agencies just as they closed in on his closest political allies, reportedly including one of his longtime business partners and a former deputy prime minister. To justify the decision, he cloaked it in an invented conspiracy, insinuating that Russian moles had implanted themselves in the machinery of justice. This is a scoundrel's playbook.

Despite the ongoing war, Ukrainians swamped the streets of Kyiv in protest of their president's betrayal of democracy, forcing Zelensky to introduce new legislation reversing the bill he had just signed into law. It was a concession of error—and possibly an empty gesture, because the new bill is hardly a lock to pass the legislature. That Zelensky brazenly weakened Ukraine's anti-corruption guardrails in the first place shouldn't come as a shock. They were erected only under sustained pressure from the Obama administration as part of an explicit bargain: In exchange for military and financial support, Ukraine would rein in its oligarchs and reform its public institutions. Over time, the country drifted, however unevenly, toward a system that was more transparent, less captive to hidden hands.

But in the Trump era, the United States has grown proudly tolerant of global corruption. In fact, it actively encourages its proliferation. Beyond the president's own venal example, this is deliberate policy. Brick by brick, Donald Trump has dismantled the apparatus that his predecessors built to constrain global kleptocracy, and leaders around the world have absorbed the fact that the pressure for open, democratic governance is off.

Anne Applebaum: Kleptocracy, Inc.

Three weeks into his current term, Trump paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act—loudly declaring that the United States wasn't going to police foreign bribery. Weeks later, America skipped a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's anti-bribery working group for the first time since its founding 30 years ago. As the head of the anti-corruption group Transparency International warned, Trump was sending “a dangerous signal that bribery is back on the table.”

For decades, the U.S.did more than prosecute bribery cases; it tried to cultivate civil-society organizations that helped emerging democracies combat corruption themselves. But upon returning to the presidency, Trump destroyed USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the U.S. Institute of Peace, dismantling the constellation of government agencies that had quietly tutored investigative journalists, trained judges, and funded watchdogs.

These groups weren't incidental casualties in DOGE's seemingly scattershot demolition of the American state. Trump long loathed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which he described as a “horrible law,” an animus stoked by the fact that some of his closest associates have been accused of murky dealings abroad. Crushing programs and organizations that fight kleptocracy meshed with the “America First” instincts of his base; the likes of Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon abhor the export of liberal values to the world.

From the wreckage of these institutions, a Trump Doctrine has taken shape, one that uses American economic and political power to shield corrupt autocrats from accountability. Benjamin Netanyahu, on trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, has been a prime beneficiary. Just as he was preparing to testify under oath, Trump denounced the prosecution as a “political witch hunt” and threatened to withhold U.S. aid if the trial moved forward. Given Israel's reliance on American support, the threat had bite. Not long after Trump's outburst, the court postponed Netanyahu's testimony, citing national-security concerns.

Trump acts as if justice for strongmen is a moral imperative. No retaliatory measure is apparently off limits. To defend his populist ally in Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to an attempted coup, Trump revoked the visa of Alexandre de Moraes, the Supreme Court justice overseeing the case. Last month, Trump threatened to impose 50 percent tariffs on Brazilian steel, aluminum, and agricultural exports to punish the country for Bolsonaro's prosecution.

This is hard-nosed realism, not just ideological kinship. To protect himself, Trump must defend the rights of populist kleptocrats everywhere. He must discredit the sort of prosecution that he might someday face. That requires recasting malfeasance as perfectly acceptable statesmanship.

Listen: The kleptocracy club

By stripping anti-corruption from the moral vocabulary of American foreign policy, Trump is reengineering the global order. He's laying the foundation for a new world in which kleptocracy flourishes unfettered, because there's no longer a superpower that, even rhetorically, aspires to purge the world of corruption. Of course, the United States has never pushed as hard as it could, and ill-gotten gains have been smuggled into its bank accounts, cloaked in shell companies. Still, oligarchs were forced to disguise their thievery, because there was at least the threat of legal consequence. In the world that Trump is building, there's no need for disguise—corruption is a credential, not a liability.

Zelensky is evidence of the new paradigm. Although his initial campaign for president in 2019 was backed by an oligarch, he could never be confused for Bolsonaro or Netanyahu. He didn't  enrich himself by plundering the state. But now that Trump has given the world permission to turn away from the ideals of good governance, even the sainted Zelensky has seized the opportunity to protect the illicit profiteering of his friends and allies.

Yet there's a legacy of the old system that Trump hasn't wholly eliminated: the institutions and civil societies that the United States spent a generation helping build. In Ukraine, those organizations and activists have refused to accept a retreat into oligarchy, and they might still preserve their governmental guardians against corruption. For now, they are all that remain between the world and a new golden age of impunity.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Want to make a career pivot? Here's what this Google exec says you should do first.","https://www.businessinsider.com/career-pivot-google-ai-executive-mira-lane-2025-7","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:06:00 GMT","

Google executive Mira Lane is all for following your passions and changing your career. That's exactly what she did.

But she encourages approaching a career shift with a plan.

""For people that are wanting to pivot, I would pivot with information,"" the senior director and founder of the Envisioning Studio at Google told Business Insider.

Lane, who started her career as a software developer and went on to create an AI prototyping lab that explores the impact of tech innovation on society, said that many people switch careers multiple times because they're uncertain. 

She said job seekers should gather as much information as possible to make sure that the career pivot they're making is the right move.

That includes talking to people in the industry, watching YouTube videos about jobs that interest you, and trying out internships, Lane said. If you're earlier in your career, you should also try to choose a college that provides opportunities to gain work experience.

The idea is to ""constantly get some feedback,"" Lane said.

Whether you're just starting out in the workforce or looking to make a shift mid-career, changing careers is common. However, Lane's advice comes amid an ongoing workforce transformation driven by AI advancements. 

A 2025 World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally expect to reduce staff in the next five years because of the new tech, meaning more people may be forced to adjust.

""All the jobs are kind of evolving in this moment,"" Lane said. ""Everything's kind of shifting. So you want to be in a space where you're getting a lot of signals.""

That's how Lane navigated multiple career pivots. After starting her career as a software developer, Lane moved to program management and then later on transitioned to leading AI ethics and society at Microsoft.

After nearly two decades at Microsoft, Lane saw an opportunity for companies to engage more directly in conversations about the tools they were developing. That inspired her to build a team of creative strategists, philosophers, and researchers focused on discussing technology at Google.

""I don't like when technology is built, and then people have to deal with decisions that were made that weren't really intentional,"" Lane, who is also a visual artist, told BI.

Lane said when she was at Microsoft and was ""poking around"" for a new role, she met the person who would eventually become her boss at Google. She said he asked her what she wanted to do with her life and caught her off guard, so she asked if she could get back to him.

Even though she had an idea of her interests at the time, Lane said it was important to pause and think about what she really wanted.

""I wasn't prepared to just answer that on the fly,"" Lane said. ""I thought, 'if someone's asking me, let me, reflect on it.'""

After some thought, Lane prepared a one-page pitch about the lab she wanted to create, which ended up becoming a reality.

Lane said once you get enough signals about what you like or don't like, you should listen to what ""lights you up."" If you find yourself following a path that doesn't make you excited, maybe it's not the right one.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Walmart salary data reveals some tech leaders can make as much as $416,000","https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-salary-data-revealed-how-much-tech-workers-make-2025-7","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:46:00 GMT","

Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.

The 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades, and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the last several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.

Salary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.

Company filings with the US Department of Labor show Walmart sought to hire around 1,750 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the first half of this reporting year, largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up substantially from about 1,100 for the same period two years before.

This publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — only refers to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.

A Walmart spokesperson said the company's compensation packages include salary, bonus opportunities, and stock awards, and that it invests in employees' career growth.

Still, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in certain roles, and where the company is looking to grow.

Walmart boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.

More than two-thirds of the company's 45,000 open positions worldwide as of July 23 are for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 550 openings are tech and analyst roles.

The company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new EVP of AI acceleration, product and design who reports directly into the CEO and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.

Other employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.

Most of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.

Here's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:

Software Engineer III: $99,244 to $234,000

Senior Software Engineer: $115,167 to $234,000

Staff, Software Engineer: $127,292 to $286,000

What superhero fatigue?

Twice in one month, a comic book film has rocketed to the top of the box office, debuting with more than $100 million in ticket sales.

Two weeks ago, it was ""Superman,"" the first theatrical release from James Gunn and Peter Safran as co-heads of DC Studios at Warner Bros. Discovery. This weekend, Disney and Marvel's ""Fantastic Four: First Steps"" fueled an estimated $118 million in ticket sales during its first three days in theaters.

""The lesson is that if you build great movies, audiences will head to the multiplex,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.

Internationally, ""Fantastic Four: First Steps"" snared an estimated $100 million, bringing its global weekend haul to $218 million.

""Marvel bet big releasing their long-awaited introduction of the Fantastic Four as the last MCU film to hit theaters for at least another year, and it's paying off,"" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. ""The franchise has had its share of hiccups in recent years, but Marvel's First Family is winning over fans and spurring the kind of enthusiasm that could bring back casual viewers who sat out some post-'Endgame' chapters.""

Marvel has struggled in the wake of the record-breaking ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the culmination of more than a decade of interconnected storytelling. While films like ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3"" enticed moviegoers to theaters, others like ""Captain America: Brave New World,"" ""The Marvels"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" failed to drum up the same enthusiasm.

Box office hauls haven't been the only hit-or-miss for the studio. Marvel films have experienced significant fluctuations since the release of 2019's ""Endgame."" Previously, no MCU film had a Rotten Tomatoes score below 67%, meaning each had earned the title of ""Fresh,"" indicating that critics had a generally positive view of the film.

Since then, five films from the franchise have been below that metric and three of those were considered ""Rotten,"" earning less than 50% positive reviews.

This year, ""Captain America: Brave New World"" tallied $413 million globally and earned a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But ""Thunderbolts*"" generated just $382 million globally — one of only five titles under the Marvel Cinematic Universe banner to tally less than $400 million worldwide — it secured an 88% ""Fresh"" rating.

Its newest theatrical entry, ""Fantastic Four: First Steps,"" also has an 88% ""Fresh"" rating from the site.

""For Disney, this has truly been a magical summer and for Marvel a reaffirmation that their strategy to revamp the brand is certainly working,"" Dergarabedian said. ""With 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' following in the footsteps of 'Thunderbolts*' Marvel is showing that a focus on quality rather than quantity is a recipe for success.""

In this article

Warner Bros. Discovery had a bountiful weekend at the global box office.

The studio had two films cross the $500 million mark worldwide — ""Superman"" soared to $502 million and Apple's ""F1,"" which Warner Bros. distributed, topped $509 million in ticket sales.

The benchmark is a boon for Warner Bros.' DC Studios, as ""Superman"" is the first theatrical debut of James Gunn and Peter Safran since they became co-heads of the film and TV unit in late 2022. The pair has developed a 10-year plan to reinvigorate the studio's franchises across TV and film, including fresh spins on Superman and Batman.

At present, 2025's ""Superman"" is the fourth-highest-grossing film featuring Superman. Zack Snyder's 2016 ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is the highest with $874 million in global ticket sales, while 2013's ""Man of Steel"" is second-highest with $669 million and 2017's ""Justice League"" with $661 million, according to data from Comscore.

""Superman"" debuted in theaters just two weeks ago and continues to drive weekend moviegoing as well as weekday trips.

As for Apple's ""F1,"" passing the $500 million mark is just another feather in the cap for the studio. Earlier this month, the film became Apple's best film release ever, surpassing Ridley Scott's ""Napoleon,"" which generated $221 million during its 2023 run, to become Apple's then-highest-grossing theatrical release.

The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" tallied $158 million worldwide, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" took in just $42 million and ""Argylle"" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally.

""F1"" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX. Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology but also a three-week release in its theaters.

Fast Money Live Event | June 5

The market may be trading around record highs, but the Verdence Capital Advisors CIO is worried trouble is lurking.

Megan Horneman, who oversees $4.1 billion in assets under management, thinks there's too much complacency around the Aug. 1 U.S. trade deadline.

""This market is pricing in the perfect situation,"" she told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Monday.

In addition to tariff concerns, she lists uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy and overbought conditions from a technical perspective as potential issues.

""Once we see that [rate cuts] might be priced off the table, coinciding with the fact that we're not quite sure what's going to happen with the tariff perspective, I think you can see a bit of a valuation correction,"" said Horneman, who's a former Deutsche Bank senior investment strategist.

Horneman is particularly concerned that technical levels are signaling overbought conditions in growth stocks — including Big Tech.

""These are things that we think might upset the rally that we're seeing here,"" she said.

Despite her short-term caution, Horneman considers herself a long-term bull and views pullbacks as opportunities. She lists international stocks among her top plays on market weakness.

""I'd warn that right now, they're expensive from a valuation perspective [but] cheap compared to the U.S.,"" she said. ""They've been underloved for way too long, and I think you're seeing some of that rotation just begin. I think that can continue.""

To navigate the uncertainty, her key advice to investors right now: Make sure you're allocated appropriately.

""Fast Money"" trader Guy Adami also sees concerns, citing the number of retail investors driving recent market gains.""Just in terms of valuation, things have gotten a tad frothy here,"" he said on Monday's show.

The S&P 500 closed at record highs every day last week. As of Friday's close, the index is 16% higher over the past three months while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 21% over the same period.

Ethereum is rapidly emerging as the institutional favorite, with new ETF inflow data suggesting a seismic shift in investor focus away from Bitcoin.

According to figures shared by SosoValue and highlighted by market analysts like Crypto Rover, Ethereum spot ETFs attracted an eye-popping $1.85 billion in net inflows during the week ending July 25, 2025. In stark contrast, Bitcoin ETFs drew just $72.06 million in the same period.

The data paints a clear picture: investors are piling into Ethereum-based products at an accelerating pace. Over the last three weeks, ETH spot ETFs have collectively pulled in $4.94 billion in net inflows. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs brought in just over $5.83 billion across the entire month of July—but the inflows have been decelerating week over week.

Ethereum's strong ETF performance also boosted its total net assets to $20.66 billion, up from $18.37 billion the previous week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's total net assets held steady around $151 billion, but with sharply lower weekly momentum.

The latest spike in ETH ETF flows adds fuel to the rising “Utility Season” narrative, where investors shift their attention from Bitcoin's store-of-value status to more functional Layer 1 ecosystems like Ethereum. This shift is partly driven by Ethereum's diverse use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to enterprise blockchain adoption.

Analysts see the trend as a sign that institutional investors are now more interested in yield-bearing, smart contract-capable assets. The sustained flow into Ethereum may also be signaling growing confidence in the long-term roadmap of ETH, especially with its upcoming scaling upgrades and L2 growth.

While Bitcoin still dominates in total ETF AUM, Ethereum's rapid inflow growth could tilt the narrative if the pattern continues.

If ETH continues to outpace BTC in weekly flows, it may prompt a broader asset reallocation across crypto portfolios—one that favors utility and programmability over digital gold.

For now, all signs point to Ethereum taking the spotlight as institutional capital repositions for the next leg of crypto market evolution.







Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a breakout phase eerily reminiscent of its historic 2017 rally—but this time, the move is backed by deep institutional support and ETF inflows.

SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, is drawing attention following a major breakout on the charts—driven by surging total value locked (TVL) and growing anticipation around Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (BTCFi) infrastructure.

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently outlined his bullish stance on Ethereum, linking it directly to the rapid growth of the stablecoin sector.

Ethereum (ETH) has just triggered a golden cross against Bitcoin (BTC)—a technical pattern that has historically preceded massive altcoin rallies.

Key Points

Can the number 2 crypto catch up to Bitcoin?

Seemingly out of nowhere, Ethereum (ETH 2.07%) has become one of the hottest cryptocurrencies on the planet. It's now up 65% over the past 30 days, and analysts are busy ratcheting up their price targets for just how high Ethereum might go in 2025 and beyond.

Ethereum's rapid rise over the past few months could have important implications for your investment portfolio. Here are three reasons why investors should be paying attention.

Ethereum's rise has been so meteoric that it is now outpacing Bitcoin (BTC 0.99%), which is only up 15% over the past 30 days. This isn't supposed to happen. Historically, there has been a very tight correlation between price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

As a result, some investors are already starting to suggest that Ethereum's decoupling from Bitcoin could signal the arrival of ""altcoin season."" This is the time of the year when investors shift away from Bitcoin and into riskier, more speculative cryptocurrencies (such as viral meme coins) in search of higher returns.

Image source: Getty Images.

Typically, the first tell-tale sign of ""altcoin season"" is when Ethereum starts to overheat. This is then followed by money flowing into riskier and riskier cryptocurrencies, until a vast speculative bubble starts to form. If history is any guide, this is what could be happening now.

Already, investors are starting to talk up the types of cryptos that might ""pop"" during this altcoin season. So, any vacation you might have planned during August could be the perfect time to think about ways you can diversify your portfolio away from Bitcoin in order to capture some of this potential upside.

Two new pieces of crypto legislation -- the Genius Act and the Clarity Act -- are now passing through Congress, and hopes are already building about what this could mean for Ethereum. The thinking here is that the combination of the Genius Act (which governs stablecoins) and the Clarity Act (which provides a regulatory framework for all digital assets) might create a sort of ""perfect storm"" for Ethereum's future development.

That's because Ethereum is a powerhouse when it comes to both stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi), and these are exactly the two areas of the crypto market that this new legislation is designed to help.

With that in mind, investors need to keep their eyes open for new investment opportunities that involve DeFi, and especially those that involve stablecoins. The hype around stablecoins might be a bit overblown, but even the most cynical investor has to admit that something huge is happening here. Stablecoins have grown from a sleepy $20 billion industry in 2020 to a $250 billion industry today. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thinks stablecoins could hit $2 trillion within just a few years.

Finally, keep your eyes open for new ways to invest in Ethereum. Arguably, the most exciting of these opportunities are the new Ethereum Treasury Companies that have been appearing ever since the end of May. There are now three publicly traded companies -- Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR -4.91%), Bit Digital (BTBT -2.48%), and SharpLink Gaming (SBET -5.70%) -- that have ditched their old business models and gone all-in on Ethereum. And one more -- The Ether Machine -- is on its way.

The goal of these companies is to become ""the Strategy (MSTR -2.08%) of Ethereum."" Strategy has become one of the top-performing publicly traded companies in the world by building up a massive Bitcoin position on its balance sheet. In a similar way, companies are now racing to amass Ethereum on their balance sheets, in the hopes of delivering similar types of performance.

For investors, this opens up new possibilities. It might be the case, for example, that you can earn higher returns by investing in these Ethereum Treasury Companies than by investing in Ethereum itself.

Does all this sound too good to be true? Maybe it is. After all, even though Ethereum has turned in some blistering performance of late, it's still only up 10% for the year. If you look at a chart for Ethereum for 2025, you'll see that it's been a roller coaster ride. Ethereum was on a rapid downward path for the first five months of the year, and is now rising nearly as fast on the upside.

As a result, some of the updated price forecasts for Ethereum might be overly optimistic. The all-time high for Ethereum is under $5,000, but some are already predicting that Ethereum could hit $15,000 soon. That just doesn't seem to be realistic. So before you invest in Ethereum, make sure you do your due diligence.

Not all low-cost cryptos are equal. This month, a handful of coins trading under $1 are showing real traction, through product rollouts, exchange listings, and strong trading activity. Whether it's a presale breaking records like BlockDAG, or listed coins like DOGE and HBAR pushing through key levels, these aren't just cheap entries, they're loaded with catalysts.

For anyone scanning the market for top altcoins under $1, this list is a solid place to start. Prices are still affordable, momentum is visible, and fundamentals are holding up across the board. These aren't just names with history, they're pushing for serious moves in the weeks ahead. And BlockDAG is right at the front of that push.

BlockDAG is one of the few presales still under a penny that's actually delivering. Its current price is locked at $0.0016, with the Beat Vesting Pass extended until August 4, giving users full liquidity at launch, no lockups, no delays. This makes it a unique entry point for anyone looking at high-upside altcoins. The presale has already raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, with a confirmed listing price of $0.05, putting early buyers in position for 3,025% gains from day one.

What sets BlockDAG apart is the real product rollout. Its X1 mobile mining app now has over 2.5 million users, and the X10 miner demo is live. The testnet includes a working explorer, no-code token and NFT creator, and staking tools. Over 4,500 developers are already building and testing apps in the ecosystem. The network uses a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work structure, allowing parallel transaction confirmation, EVM compatibility, and low energy use, features not common in projects at this stage.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG offers unmatched momentum, a clear timeline, and actual working infrastructure. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release ending on August 11 and liquidity tools already in place, it's not just another low-cost coin, it's one with real weight behind it.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.2358, following a sharp 11% drop earlier in the week. That pullback came after institutional players offloaded over 2.26 billion DOGE, triggering high sell volume and market-wide liquidations. Prior to that, the coin had broken above $0.26 and touched $0.28 briefly. Support is now at $0.23, while resistance sits near $0.28.

The drop has opened up a lower entry point, and long-term forecasts are still intact. Analysts see DOGE pushing back toward $0.33 this year, with $0.75 not out of the question by 2030 if retail interest returns in force. As one of the most traded meme tokens with massive liquidity, DOGE remains one of the top altcoins under $1 that market watchers are still keeping on their radar, especially when volatility cools down.

Hedera (HBAR) has made one of the strongest moves this month. It surged to $0.29 following a successful mainnet upgrade and a high-profile listing on Robinhood on July 25. That combo triggered retail buying and pushed trading volume past $700 million, with HBAR now hovering around $0.27–$0.29. It's gained more than 100% since earlier this month when it traded around $0.15.

Analysts say that a breakout past $0.47 could push the coin toward $1. However, resistance remains tight, and a failure to hold momentum could lead to a pullback toward the $0.21–$0.23 zone. Still, with technical upgrades live and retail entry easier through Robinhood, HBAR is one of the top altcoins under $1 that's riding a real growth narrative this quarter.

Stellar's XLM has more than doubled in price since early July, now trading between $0.44 and $0.47 after rising from just $0.22. The main catalyst behind the move is the launch of Protocol 23, which boosted interest from developers and institutions alike. The volume shot up alongside this growth, with institutional flow topping 400 million XLM during the run.

Right now, support is sitting near $0.44. If that breaks, $0.40 and $0.33 are key fallback levels. On the flip side, if XLM manages a close above $0.52, analysts expect a stronger rally toward its 2021 highs. Technical indicators show some signs of exhaustion, but the broader trend is still intact. For buyers looking at high-volume movers with strong network upgrades, XLM makes the list of top altcoins under $1 to track this summer.

Each of these four coins offers a different angle, DOGE is dipping from meme highs, HBAR is climbing on new access, and XLM is riding a network upgrade. But BlockDAG is the only one where the price is still nearly free, with $0.0016 unlocking over 3,000% upside if listing hits $0.05. And unlike most low-cap presales, the team has already rolled out mining apps, testnets, and dApp tools.

Among the top altcoins under $1, BlockDAG gives the most complete combo: full liquidity from launch, working infrastructure, 2.5 million miners, and a ticking deadline. For anyone looking at entry-level cryptos right now, this one is leading the pack on momentum, value, and actual delivery.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ripple (XRP) has emerged as a focal point in discussions about systemic solutions to global financial instability, with recent academic research and institutional analysis highlighting its potential role in addressing post-crisis challenges. A presentation at the IV International Scientific and Practical Conference hosted by the Russian Academy of Sciences' Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations underscored Ripple's integration into cross-border interbank transfer systems as part of broader fintech modernization efforts [1]. Dr. I.A. Kopytin, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Center, outlined how the 2008 financial crisis catalyzed the development of blockchain-based alternatives to traditional infrastructures like SWIFT. Ripple was explicitly cited as one of several innovations aimed at mitigating systemic risks through real-time settlements and reduced transaction complexity [1].  

The academic materials emphasized Ripple's role in reshaping trade finance, arguing that its blockchain technology offers transparency and programmability to counter the opacity that contributed to the 2008 crisis. By leveraging digital ledgers, Ripple's system purportedly enables granular visibility into financial exposures, reducing the likelihood of over-derivatisation—a key factor in the pre-crisis collapse. The presentation positioned Ripple alongside initiatives like IBM's Blockchain World Wire and JP Morgan Chase's Interbank Information Network, framing these technologies as part of a broader effort to modernize financial infrastructure [1].  

Crypto researcher SMQKE amplified these findings, noting that Ripple's academic citations were not isolated but appeared twice in formal economic literature. The first reference highlighted Ripple as a response to pre-crisis financial architecture failures, while the second emphasized its utility in ensuring stability through blockchain-driven transparency [1]. SMQKE's analysis also challenged perceptions of XRP as a speculative asset, pointing to its adoption by major institutions for cross-border payments. Partnerships with entities like American Express and Santander were cited as evidence of XRP's practical application in streamlining liquidity challenges [1].  

While the conference materials did not claim Ripple alone could prevent future crises, they framed its technology as a component of a systemic overhaul. The debate over XRP's role extends beyond academia, with institutional adoption metrics such as $133 million in tokenized assets on Ripple's chain reflecting incremental progress [4]. Analysts like Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered have projected XRP's price could reach $12.25 by 2029, though such forecasts remain speculative [2]. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously suggested the token could capture 14% of SWIFT's transaction volume, a benchmark that remains aspirational [3].  

The discourse underscores a broader tension in the crypto ecosystem between consumer-facing narratives and infrastructure-driven value. While XRP may not feature in everyday transactions, its backend utility for financial institutions—enabling real-time gross settlements and reducing costs—has garnered significant traction. This dynamic challenges critics who dismiss XRP's real-world relevance, particularly as blockchain solutions continue to address inefficiencies in global remittance flows [1].

Translated by: Felix, PANews

The NFT market is showing real signs of recovery. 

After months of sideways trading, we are finally seeing momentum: floor prices are rising, market caps are rebounding, and some familiar names are surpassing established NFTs. From Pudgy Penguins surpassing BAYC to Art Blocks' unexpected return, the market atmosphere is changing. 

This article will parse the latest data, highlight the best performing categories and series, and explore whether this is a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a larger trend. 

Key Takeaways:

The NFT market is showing strong signs of recovery. Since the beginning of the month, market capitalization has risen 94% to $6.6 billion, the highest level since early 2025. 

Weekly trading volume jumped 51% to $136 million, on track to make July one of the best performing months since February. 



Sales increased by 7% month-on-month, but the overall sales this month will not exceed that of June. Last month's sales exceeded 5 million, and July just broke the 3 million mark. What's the reason? ETH is rising, and NFT is also rising. In just 7 days, the average price of NFT soared 40% to $146. 



Trading volume decreased, prices rose, the market is changing. The blue chip stock boom is back. 

With the apparent return of the blue chip craze, this article focuses on the best performing NFT categories over the past week, and as expected, PFP leads the way, accounting for 37% of total trading volume. RWA NFTs follow closely behind, accounting for 11%, indicating that the tokenization narrative still has vitality. 



But not all categories have joined the rise. NFTs in the sports, music and fashion sectors have not seen an upward trend. Although game NFTs performed steadily in the second quarter, their popularity has cooled slightly, with sales falling significantly this week. 

Nevertheless, PFP's dominance is in line with current market sentiment. Whenever the NFT market heats up, PFP always takes the lead, just like in previous bull cycles. Some things don't change easily. 

This week's market focus is on the big moves of the top NFTs, the return of popularity, and a series of floor price activities. 

Pudgy Penguins: The new heavyweight collectible

Pudgy Penguins' market value has officially surpassed Bored Ape Yacht Club and is now second only to CryptoPunks. The floor price has risen by 539% since its release, and it has risen by another 7% in the past 7 days. 

How did Pudgy Penguins do it? Simple: they were released during the bear market. From IRL benefits to connecting Web2 and Web3, and now expanding in Asia through plush toys, the brand's emergence is at the right time, especially now that collectibles hype is hot. 



CryptoPunks: Back in the spotlight

The punk era never really ended, but it seems to have regained its luster. This week alone, the floor price has risen by 53%, and the series is still one of the most actively traded collections. 

Don't forget, this was a free mint in 2017. Whenever there is new vitality in the market, the punk series will return to the spotlight. They remain the gold standard for Web3 influence. For some, owning a punk collectible is more than just about making money — it's a status symbol, pure and simple. And now, that status is becoming increasingly popular. 



Moonbirds: Surprise rebound

Moonbirds is back again, and to be honest, it's a bit surprising. After fading from blue chip status, Moonbirds staged a strong rebound: 

What caused this? Following its acquisition by Orange Cap Games in May, the company announced a partnership with Towns on July 19. Holders can now access a private on-chain space and increase points ahead of the airdrop. 

It's worth mentioning that Moonbirds is still down 64% in USD value since launch, so there's still a long way to go. That said, momentum is building. 



Art Blocks: Quietly Return

If anything can release the energy of a bull market, it is the return of Art Blocks. This week, it ranked among the most traded collections, with an average selling price soaring 156%. 

On July 10, the platform announced a major change, launching collector profiles, wallet aggregation, achievement systems, and providing a better user experience for ordinary collectors. 

The market has noticed this too. Top projects like Fidenza have rekindled interest, and Feels like Art is starting to come back into the NFT discussion. 



PFP and art are accelerating, and if history is any indication, this combination will kick off the next NFT bull run. No conclusion has been drawn yet, but the signal has emerged. Looking forward to next week's trend. 

The past week has given us a glimpse of the possible resurgence of NFT: the floor price has climbed, PFP has regained its dominance, and Art has quietly returned with strength. Pudgy Penguins surpassed BAYC, CryptoPunks heated up again, and Moonbirds spread its wings, all of which hint at one thing: the market is shifting and attention is refocusing on NFT.

The crypto industry's effort for a more supportive regulatory environment in the US has paid off throughout the year, as evidenced by a recent report from The Hill highlighting the rapid expansion of crypto lobbying efforts. 

According to a recent report by The Hill, at least 27 crypto companies and advocates have submitted their first lobbying disclosures over the past months, reflecting a growing desire to influence legislation that could shape the future of digital assets.

Per the report, these called “newcomers” represent a diverse array of interests within the industry, from betting platforms like Polymarket to gaming companies creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to high-profile events. 

Together, these entities have invested nearly $2.8 million between April and June to lobby for legislation promoting digital assets, targeting key regulatory bodies such as the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

This legislative effort has already yielded results. The recently signed GENIUS Act, which received bipartisan support, is regarded as a significant endorsement for the industry, with the aim of providing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins. 

The House has also advanced several other key bills, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC bill, during a dedicated “crypto week,” featuring creative lobbying tactics.

A total of 73 companies and associations reportedly engaged in federal lobbying activities related to cryptocurrency, spending about $11.4 million. 

Among the new entrants, KuCoin, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, led lobbying expenditures with $1 million, despite being barred from operating in the US market for at least two years due to regulatory violations.

Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Solana Policy Institute, emphasized that the industry has struggled not with innovation, but with understanding how emerging technologies fit within existing legal frameworks. 

While some companies like Bitdeer Technologies, which focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, continue to address currency-related issues, many firms are leveraging blockchain technology for a broader range of financial products. 

Polymarket, operating under the name Blockratize, allows users to place bets on various events using cryptocurrencies, while Gala Games sponsored the White House's Easter Egg Roll, promoting their online gaming platform that rewards players with crypto tokens.

Looking forward, the crypto industry is keen to see the Senate advance the CLARITY Act, which aims to provide a regulatory blueprint for federal oversight of crypto firms. 

Additionally, a bill banning the Federal Reserve (Fed) from issuing its own digital asset or central bank digital currency (CBDC) has garnered interest from within the sector.

However, Whitehouse-Levine expressed concerns about the potential for regulatory shifts, fearing a return to the cautious stance that characterized previous administrations. 

“The pendulum has swung from one extreme to another,” he noted, highlighting the need for consistent and stable regulatory conditions to foster growth and innovation in the industry.

Divine Research, a San Francisco-based startup, has issued 30,000 uncollateralized crypto loans—primarily under $1,000 in USDC—to borrowers in underserved regions since late 2024. The platform uses biometric verification via World ID, an iris-scanning technology developed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, to authenticate borrowers as unique individuals, reducing fraud and repeat defaults [1]. By bypassing traditional banking systems, Divine targets gig workers, vendors, and teachers excluded from conventional credit channels. Founder Diego Estevez noted that interest rates of 20% to 30% offset a 40% default rate on first-time loans, while reclaimable Worldcoin tokens help borrowers mitigate repayment shortfalls. Unlike traditional lenders, Divine's capital is sourced from everyday users seeking high-yield opportunities, creating a peer-to-peer model that balances risk absorption with returns for lenders.  

The uncollateralized crypto lending sector is expanding beyond Divine. Ethereum-based startup 3Jane, backed by Paradigm, is developing AI systems to automate lending decisions and streamline debt collection for defaults. Institutional-focused platforms like Wildcat are also exploring undercollateralized loans with flexible terms, relying on collaborative recourse mechanisms among lenders in case of nonpayment. These innovations reflect a shift toward algorithmic risk assessment and decentralized governance in lending. Meanwhile, traditional financial institutions are showing interest in crypto-backed alternatives. JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to offer loans backed by assets like Bitcoin and Ether, signaling growing institutional confidence in digital assets as collateral.  

The sector, however, remains shadowed by past failures. The 2022 collapses of Celsius and Genesis—and associated criminal convictions—highlight regulatory and operational vulnerabilities. Divine and similar platforms aim to address these risks by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) with digital identity tools, creating hybrid models that prioritize accountability. The broader trend leverages blockchain and biometric technologies to democratize financial services, replacing traditional credit scores with on-chain data and biometric verification. Yet scalability and regulatory scrutiny remain critical hurdles. Estevez's model, while promising, relies on user trust in both the platform's technology and the broader crypto ecosystem.  

As the industry evolves, sustainability questions persist. Can decentralized lending models withstand macroeconomic shocks, or will they face liquidity crises akin to earlier crypto lenders? The answer likely hinges on balancing innovation with robust risk management. Divine's approach, alongside competitors like 3Jane and Wildcat, underscores fintech's potential to redefine access to credit in underserved markets. However, long-term success will depend on addressing systemic challenges, including regulatory compliance and user education, while maintaining technological integrity.

The Indian government is intensifying its efforts to combat tax evasion in the cryptocurrency sector through a combination of advanced technology and regulatory measures. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digital forensics, tax authorities aim to identify suspicious transaction patterns and improve compliance with virtual digital asset (VDA) taxation rules. These initiatives, coupled with specialized training programs for tax officers, underscore a strategic push to close loopholes and enhance revenue collection from crypto-related earnings.  

Under the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), tax enforcement agencies have prioritized capacity-building for officers, including blockchain forensics training delivered through collaborations with institutions like the National Forensic Science University in Goa. These programs focus on equipping officials with expertise in digital evidence handling and blockchain analysis, enabling more effective tracking of VDA transactions. However, challenges persist in real-time matching of crypto transaction data reported in tax returns with information from Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Instead, discrepancies are currently flagged by comparing Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) returns from VASPs with individual tax filings [1].  

To address underreporting, the CBDT launched the NUDGE campaign, which targets taxpayers who failed to disclose VDA transactions exceeding 1 lakh rupees. Communications are being sent to these individuals, urging compliance with tax obligations. Meanwhile, legislative frameworks such as the 2022-23 tax year's Section 115BBH impose a flat 30% income tax on crypto profits, with no deductions permitted except the cost of acquisition. A 1% TDS also applies to certain transactions. During FY 2022-23, these measures generated 437 crore rupees in tax collections from VDA-related incomes, marking a significant increase compared to previous years [2].  

Technology remains central to enforcement. AI and machine learning tools are being deployed to detect anomalies in transaction patterns, while data analytics platforms like the Non-Filer Monitoring System (NMS) and Project Insight aggregate information to flag inconsistencies. These systems help cross-reference data from multiple databases, improving the accuracy of compliance checks. However, the absence of real-time VASP data integration highlights ongoing gaps in the system, particularly for cross-border transactions [1].  

The government's efforts have also prompted global crypto exchanges to align with Indian regulations. For instance, Bybit, a major international exchange, announced an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on services for Indian users, effective July 2025. This includes trading fees, staking rewards, and withdrawals, reflecting a broader shift toward compliance with local tax mandates [1].  

The combination of technological innovation, regulatory rigor, and international cooperation signals a decisive shift in India's approach to crypto taxation. While challenges remain, such as refining real-time data matching and addressing cross-border complexities, the government's proactive stance demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability in the digital asset space. For investors and exchanges, the message is clear: tax compliance in crypto transactions is no longer optional [2].

Strategy (MSTR) is pulling off some form of financial alchemy: using bitcoin, historically a volatile asset, to create something that looks a lot like stability.

That's the firm's $2 billion “Stretch” Preferred Stock (STRC) offering offers a variable 9% dividend and is designed to keep the share price hovering near $100.

The offering doesn't give investors direct bitcoin exposure, yet it's backed by the asset in spirit and structure, according to a recent NYDIG report.

Strategy holds $71.7 billion in bitcoin and just $11 billion in liabilities, giving it room to deliver income even if crypto prices dip, the report notes.

Historically, bitcoin has returned at least 3%–4% annually over any five-year stretch, while average returns have been significantly higher.

Strategy is betting it can use this return profile to sustain high payouts without touching its crypto stash, essentially turning long-term bitcoin appreciation into monthly cash flow.

“STRC looks to us like a high-yield, bitcoin-backed, money-market-style vehicle, designed to trade near $100 par while offering a far higher yield than traditional short-term instruments, albeit with a different liquidity profile,” NYDIG wrote.

That premise has proven popular. Investor interest drove Strategy to quadruple the offering size from $500 million to $2 billion.

STRC may not just be a yield vehicle, but rather bitcoin, reworked for traditional finance income investors. A kind of money-market fund, remixed with crypto under the hood.

 Divine Research has issued 30,000 unbacked USDC loans using Sam Altman's World ID to verify borrowers, targeting underserved users. 

San Francisco-based lender Divine Research has issued around 30,000 unbacked short-term crypto loans since December, using OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's iris-scanning platform World ID to verify borrowers.

Divine offers loans under $1,000 in the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, mainly to overseas borrowers underserved by traditional finance. It uses World ID to ensure users cannot open multiple accounts after defaulting.

“We're loaning to average folks like high-school teachers, fruit vendors . . . basically anyone with access to the internet can get access to our funds,” Divine founder Diego Estevez told the Financial Times. “This is microfinance on steroids.”

Interest rates range from 20% to 30%, with a reported first-loan default rate of around 40%. “High interest rates compensate for these losses,” Estevez said, adding that free World tokens issued to borrowers can be “partially” reclaimed.

Estevez said Divine's lenders are everyday individuals seeking solid returns. “Anyone can provide liquidity. We've engineered the system such that after accounting for default rates and the [interest] rates on offer, providers will always make a profit.”

Divine is part of a growing group of high-risk crypto lenders capitalizing on renewed market momentum and political tailwinds, including support from former US President Donald Trump.

Another startup, 3Jane, recently raised $5.2 million from Paradigm and offers uncollateralized credit lines on Ethereum. Unlike Divine, 3Jane requires “verifiable proofs” of assets or income, but still no collateral.

3Jane plans to introduce AI agents that follow lending rules automatically, aiming to lower rates while enforcing repayment. Defaulted loans on its platform are sold to US debt collectors.

Other players like Wildcat cater to market makers and trading firms, offering undercollateralized loans with customizable terms. According to Wildcat adviser Evgeny Gaevoy, “In the event of a default, lenders co-ordinate directly among themselves to seek recourse.”

Lending remains a small slice of the crypto market but attracts growing attention as institutional players reenter the space. Last week, reports revealed that JPMorgan Chase is looking into crypto-backed loans, planning to lend directly against crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

However, the shadow of 2022 looms large, when major crypto lenders like Celsius and Genesis collapsed. Celsius's CEO Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years for fraud, and Genesis settled a $2 billion lawsuit.

 Bitcoin suddenly ups the volatility into Sunday's weekly close, with key liquidation zones on the radar and predictions of bigger BTC ""price swings"" to come. 

Key points:

Bitcoin stages a late comeback into the weekly close as price approaches important liquidation zones.

Traders and analysts emphasize various key price points to reclaim next.

Volatility is expected based on large-volume trading behavior, analysis reports.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $119,000 Sunday as bulls extended a rebound from two-week lows.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD approaching a key reclaim area.

Now attempting a daily close above its 10-day simple moving average, the pair held onto a rebound from near $114,500 as the market forgot one of the largest-ever BTC sales.

The uptick came amid news that the US and China had agreed to further delay the introduction of reciprocal trade tariffs.

Market participants thus focused on the key levels to look for going into the new week.

“$BTC needs to break above $119.5K for a big move. If that doesn't happen, this consolidation will continue,” crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows summarized in a post on X. 

Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a slightly higher range ceiling just below the $120,000 mark.

“Bitcoin has Daily Closed above the blue Range Low, kickstarting a break back into the very briefly lost Range,” he told X followers alongside a print of the daily BTC/USD chart.

Others warned that price could still fill the daily downside wick left by the trip to $114,500.

In an X thread on the topic, fellow trader CrypNuevo identified a downside target confluent with an area of exchange order-book liquidity.

Liquidation clusters: we're in-between 2 liquidation clusters located at:• $121k - $120k• $114.5k - $113.6kBased on similarities with previous cases, we could go for the cluster above first, and then reverse again to the bottom one. It's a range-bound environment. pic.twitter.com/Z6XjzsVaKg

“If we zoom out, we can see that the main liquidation level is at $113.8k,” he commented. 

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass meanwhile puts the “max pain” for BTC shorts at around $119,650.

Should Bitcoin return to challenge all-time highs near $123,000, short liquidations would total over $1.1 billion.

“Strong resistance forming around 119,000–120,000, indicated by dense liquidation clusters,” crypto analysis platform Coinank agreed while examining its own liquidity data.

Analyst TheKingfisher additionally warned of heightened volatility on short timeframes.

“Seeing predominantly red on the BTC GEX+ chart. This indicates dealers are heavily short gamma, suggesting they may amplify volatility to hedge their positions,” he reported on X Sunday.

The massive Las Vegas venue known as Sphere will be screening its first classic movie, “The Wizard of Oz,” starting on August 28. And as detailed in a segment on CBS Sunday Morning, this isn't just a matter of taking the existing movie and projecting it on Sphere's 160,000 square foot, wraparound LED screen.

Instead, Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan said a 2,000-person team is creating a new experience. That includes using AI to both increase the resolution of the existing film and expand the footage beyond the frame of what was actually shot.

For example, Turner Classic Movie presenter Ben Mankiewicz said that through the use of AI, “a grainy close-up of Dorothy becomes richly detailed, and then through a process called outpainting — though it seems like magic — we see the rest of the Scarecrow, the Yellow Brick Road, and the mountains of Oz.”

In other cases, expanding the frame means creating new performances from the existing actors.

Despite these changes, Dolan said, “Our standard on this was not to modify the film at all but to try and bring you into the film, as if you were in the studio when it was shot.”

Indie video game marketplace Itch.io announced this week that it has “deindexed” adult and not-safe-for-work games, removing them from its browse and search pages.

The move, the company said, was in response to a campaign by Collective Shout (an advocacy group that has previously criticized video games, rap music, and lingerie commercials) targeting both Itch.io and Steam for selling “No Mercy,” a game that depicts rape and incest.

In an open letter addressed to executives at PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and other payment processors, Collective Shout said that games “endorsing men's sexualised abuse and torture of women and girls fly in the face of efforts to address violence against women.”

“We do not see how facilitating payment transactions and deriving financial benefit from these violent and unethical games, is consistent with your corporate values and mission statements,” the organization added.

The campaign appears to have worked, with Steam saying earlier this month that it would ban games that “may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers.”

Similarly, itch.io said, “To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.”

It also said that “No Mercy” had been “temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April,” and that “the situation developed rapidly,” forcing the company to “act urgently to protect the platform's core payment infrastructure,” without providing advanced notice to creators.

The company said it's now conducting a “comprehensive audit” to ensure that games available on the marketplace meet “the requirements of our payment processors,” with adult content remaining deindexed until the audit is complete. After the audit, itch.io said NSFW game creators will be required to confirm that their content is allowed under the policies of their payment processors linked to their account.

On social media, users criticizing itch.io's decision noted that its current terms declare that adult content violations are “permanent with no chance of appeal” and that any funds in an offending account “will not be eligible for payout” — or as one developer put it, “If you violate the rules, we take all your money. Not just the money from that work, ALL your money from EVERYTHING you've ever made.”

This is far from the first time that payment companies appear to have pressured online platforms over adult content — for example, last year Gumroad pointed to restrictions from payment processors when it implemented stricter rules around NSFW art, and OnlyFans also blamed “banking partners and payment providers” when it banned explicit content (a decision that it subsequently reversed).

A Change.org petition with more than 137,000 verified signatures criticizes Mastercard and Visa for their role in these types of decisions. Among other things, the petition demands that the payment companies “stop censoring legal fictional content that complies with the law and platform standards” and “reject influence from activist groups that promote moral panic or misrepresent fiction as harm.”

Setting aside the specific case of Google, while I think the author makes a strong argument for the value of negation, particularly for institutions, there's also something enervating as an individual about trying to do nothing wrong, rather trying to do good. It's so easy to self criticize, to second guess oneself, and ultimately let anxiety and fear of ""doing the wrong thing"" take hold. I think most people would be better served by seeking to do the right thing, rather than merely not being evil.

(Added:)
Allegations of Google's manipulating the search results to influence voting behavior are much more interesting.

The most remarkable difference was that you can make incremental A/B styles on an Adsense campaign but you can't do that with SEO not least because Google has patented methods to cause your rankings to go haywire whenever you change anything about your site -- one reason why sites like Reddit can go a decade without a major design refresh,  if you've got a site which does well you want to keep growing it but whatever you do don't change the link structure.SEO is a matter of investing in content and link building to get traffic,  since Google is in the business of selling traffic,  they don't want you to invest in anything other than Adsense.  It's like how Facebook doesn't give commercial entities a lot of visibility unless the pay up.  I remember when Zynga games got huge with games that would spam you about everything your friends were doing so you'd want to play and back then Zynga was making big $$ and Facebook nothing but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg but a stop to that.

Most people are so accustomed to ""free"" services from google, that they don't even see it as transactional, but rather as exploitive. ""I'm trying to watch my youtube videos, and google keeps shoving these ads in my face. Google, please fuck off!"" or ""I'm trying to organize my business expenses but Google sheets won't load. Where is your god damn support!?!""Google put themselves in a position where they can only be evil, because the vast majority of people (the author here included), just will not be able to step back and see what google is, and weigh it against alternates. Google is bad for leeching off my right to a private gmail account, but they are not good for saving me $5/mo for email...e-mail is free. Everyone knows that.Even worse, if Google were to turn into a paid services company, they would be even more evil for cutting off the millions, sorry, billions of poor users who don't have the money to pay for all that google offers. The backlash against youtube red was immense (that was its unfortunate launch name) and even today people still see youtube premium as an evil thing.So sure, google does evil things, but it should be stated within the framework of their business model, rather than being unaware or ignoring it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","We Just Saw 10 Jaw-Dropping Minutes of ‘It: Welcome to Derry'","https://gizmodo.com/it-welcome-to-derry-footage-description-2000631642","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 15:06:48 GMT","

We were already on edge anticipating it: Welcome to Derry, the HBO prequel series laying the groundwork for Stephen King's tale of a small town with a sizable demonic clown problem. But the new peek just shared in-room at San Diego Comic-Con—building off that evocative teaser from a few months back—signals it's going to be a show that interrupts your sleep on a regular basis.

We saw the opening of the very first episode. It's 1962 in Derry, Maine—near Christmas, going by the snow and the decorations—and people are watching The Music Man at the local movie theater. The camera shifts from the screen (surely not by coincidence, it's the number where Howard Hill is warning the people of River City they've “got trouble!”) to the audience, and we see a kid of about 12 sitting by himself, sucking on a pacifier.

He's too old for a pacifier, but that detail recedes for a bit when an usher appears and tells him to leave. “Pity is not going to keep the lights on, Hank!” the usher snaps at the projectionist when he urges him to go easy on the pint-sized freeloader. The projectionist's daughter, who's about the same age as the pacifier kid, helps him sneak away, and he makes his way outside to the dark, frozen road.

A family—dad, pregnant mom, two kids—pulls over and warmly offers to give him a ride; when they ask where “home” is, he says, “Anywhere but Derry.” They say they're going to Portland, and he's welcome to come along.

But this is Welcome to Derry, not Escape from Derry. The kid starts to notice that there's something very off about the people who've picked him up. The little boy brags about what a great speller he is, but the words his mother flings at him to show off with keep getting creepier (“necrosis,” “kidnapping,” “strangulation”). Meanwhile, his sister opens a plastic container marked “liver” and starts snacking on it… raw. Then she sticks her bloody hand in the pacifier kid's face.

The kid starts frantically jiggling the door handle, but it's no use. The freakiness rapidly escalates inside the car—and outside, as the car cruises by the same “Welcome to Derry” sign for the second time—but nothing prepares you for what comes next. The mom goes into labor, and there's a grotesque shot of her belly pulsating in such a way that you know what's coming out isn't human.

And, yes, there's a gruesome birth in the front seat; it produces a monstrous infant with wings and a truly awful face. After it chaotically zooms around the inside of the car with its umbilical cord still attached, it clamps its terrible gaze on the kid and pounces on him.

The car window breaks, and we see the pacifier soaring through the air and into the water near the road… then drifting into a sewer tunnel, exactly the kind of place our friend Pennywise the clown likes to hang out.

It's a deeply unsettling sequence, and it sets up so many elements that It: Welcome to Derry will explore. While good people do live in Derry, like the projectionist and his daughter, there's also something festering just below the surface—a force capable of supernatural illusions and expert mindfuckery that takes special delight in tormenting children. This may be the small screen, but the frights will not be diminished.

After the footage, Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti—the sibling team behind the recent It movies and the co-developers of this new spin-off, with Andy directing several episodes—came out to talk more about the series.

The genesis of Welcome to Derry came when the Muschiettis were working on the movies. They were exhausted, as was star Bill Skarsgård, when they were done—but as Andy recalled, “We always fantasized about doing the origin story, how ‘It' becomes Pennywise, which is one of the big mysteries in the book … We loved [the idea of a] TV series because of the opportunities that gives you: a larger canvas to tell the story, more characters, more nuances, and more complicated arcs.”

Barbara added that when they took the idea to Stephen King, it was his idea to go back in time, following Pennywise's 27-year cycle, to 1962. “There's a reason why it goes back in time, but we can't let you know yet,” Andy teased.

“At the end of the book, nobody knows what the hell ‘It' is. What does ‘It' want? Who is Bob Gray [Pennywise's real name]? How did it all happen? We are going to ruin this,” he joked, but noted that while Welcome to Derry will answer some of the book's long-standing questions, it will raise new mysteries too.

A second teaser trailer was also shown in the room at SDCC. It expands on the first teaser with more distressing imagery—”missing” posters, a Shawshank State Prison bus, a red balloon, people behaving in unfriendly ways, the tiniest glimpse of Pennywise—and will be released to the public, though a date wasn't given. (Update: you can watch it now below!)

It: Welcome to Derry debuts this October on HBO and HBO Max. It will run nine episodes and stars Taylour Paige, Jovan Adepo, Chris Chalk (playing Dick Halloran, a character who appears in the It novel but is best known for The Shining), James Remar, Stephen Rider, Madeleine Stowe, Rudy Mancuso, and—of course—Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.

Behind the scenes, it was developed by Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti (It and It Chapter Two) and Jason Fuchs (It Chapter Two), with Andy Muschietti handling directing duties on multiple episodes.

Nearly five full years after Marvel Studios first planted its flag and announced it was coming, the Fantastic Four finally made their MCU debut this weekend. Given the last tries at bringing these heroes to the big screen, and how Marvel treated those characters back when it didn't own them, it seemed there wasn't really anywhere for the Four to go but up. But things have changed in the past five years, and now there's more pressure than ever for them to stick the landing, particularly since this is our first Phase Six movie and a key building block of the soon-to-end Multiverse Saga.

Early reactions to the film were pretty glowing, with plenty of praise heaped onto the cast, director Matt Shakman, and the film's retrofuturist look. That praise has cooled off just a little in more official reviews, but the general vibe is still fairly high for the movie, which is just as well since we're going to be getting more of these characters in Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars, and the larger MCU down the line.

As with previous major superhero movies, we want to know what you, the audience, thought of First Steps now that you've seen it. Was it the Fantastic Four movie of your dreams, was Galactus better here than as a cloud, how good was Sue—share your opinions down in the comments below.

The material reminds us of wattle and daub, a home building material harking back 6,000 years.

Japanese company Lib Work has outlined its 3D house building technology, which relies on soil as its primary constituent. The company's Lib Earth House Construction (machine translation) process uses a massive 3D printing assembly, rather like others we have seen used for building coffee shops, bus stops, and so on. However, instead of relying on cement to create concrete, Lib Earth dwelling utilize a patent pending mix of earth, slaked lime, and natural fibers.

The materials mix outlined above reminds us somewhat of wattle and daub, a building material and technique that has been around perhaps 6,000 years. Wattle and daub buildings have been known to remain serviceable for as long as 700 years. So there should be no real worries about living in a ‘mud' house, as long as the construction has been finished correctly. Actually, Lib Work notes that its structures “have a strength equivalent to earthquake resistance grade 3, making it a safe home to live in even in Japan, a country prone to earthquakes.” Indeed, grade 3 is the highest rating for such architectural durability in Japan.



Another attraction of the 3D printed house is that it opens up the flexibility of free form design. Structures which would be a challenge to fabricate from traditional building sheet materials don't phase 3D printers. Lib Work unveiled their first Lib Earth construction a year ago, but that was basically just a small hut. The Lib Earth model B, unveiled recently, with its cluster arrangement, is far more sophisticated and home-like, as you can see from the imagery.

Lib Work's charts indicate that its 3D printing mix for homes is made from 65% soil and sand, the with the next largest chunk consisting of slaked lime binding material, finished off with a few percent of natural fibers and ‘other' stuff.

The firm has done some CO2 emissions calculations / measurements. According to these figures, the new material's reliance on “soil, lime, and natural fibers that are abundantly available on Earth,” and eschewing of cement, means far lower CO2 generated per residence.

The Lib Work figures show that building a typical house of this stature might cause about 45,000kg of CO2 emissions. This figure is reduced by more than half, to 22,434kg of CO2, when using the new 3D printing construction tech and sustainable materials. That's even better than a ‘wooden house,' it goes on to claim.



If you think the above Lib Earth project is pretty ambitious, moving further down the linked page, you will find some eyebrow-raising information about the firm's Mars Building Project.

Naturally, on Mars, the planned major component of buildings from Lib Work would be Martian dirt.

Soil and dirt are generally regarded as lowly materials, even extending to being insults. However, common earth's status might improve by becoming a valued building material for modern, sustainable 3D printed dwellings.

Soil is actually one of the key ingredients of Hikaru Dorodando shiny balls. Numerous YouTube videos provide evidence that it is possible to polish dirt. Whether this technique could be used in the finishing of your 3D printed soil house, for marble effect features, remains to be seen.

So much for optimizations.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has endured a rocky launch, with widespread reports of poor performance overshadowing its otherwise positive critical reception. Despite favorable reviews, subpar optimization has sparked significant furor among players. In response to the backlash, publisher 505 Games has rolled out a series of patches aimed at improving performance, something that's become customary for modern AAA releases.

Unfortunately, in their rush to ""fix"" the Soulslike title, the developers may have crossed a line by misleading players about the game's graphics settings. Acting on community reports, popular hardware analyst Daniel Owen tested the game's performance, comparing the launch build with the latest 1.4 patch, only to discover that the internal rendering resolution is now clamped below native, even when the resolution scaling slider is set to 100%.

For context, a game at 100% resolution scaling is supposed to render natively — meaning it outputs frames at the same resolution as your display without relying on upscalers like DLSS or FSR. Upscaling only comes into play when the internal resolution is lowered to gain performance, but in this case, the game is apparently using hidden upscaling while falsely reporting a native resolution.

In his testing, Owen compared Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' launch version with the 1.4 patch that just came out, using an RTX 3060 at 1440p Ultra settings. This distinction is important because lower-end GPUs are the ones that can show the discrepancy the best, as more peformant cards will simply produce more FPS from the get-go.

In the launch version, at 100% resolution scaling, TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) delivered 29 FPS, serving as the baseline for native performance. Lowering the scaling to 67%, 59%, and 50% progressively increased performance to 45 FPS, 50 FPS, and 58 FPS respectively, as would be normal for upscaling. These are modest improvements that make sense.

However, once the game was updated to patch 1.4, the results became quite suspicious. At 100% TSR, performance suddenly jumped from 29 FPS to 37 FPS — a 28% increase that far exceeds typical optimization gains from a minor patch. Meanwhile, at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling, the performance boost was a modest 2–3 FPS, suggesting that the ""native"" 100% setting was no longer truly native.



The behavior with DLSS and FSR confirmed Owen's suspicions. On the launch version, DLSS at 100% (labeled as “DLAA,” or native-resolution antialiasing) delivered 28 FPS, with predictable gains as the resolution was lowered. But on the 1.4 patch, DLSS at 100% suddenly matched the performance of DLSS Quality mode from the original build — roughly 45 FPS — even though the menu still displayed 100% resolution and told that DLAA was active.

Moreover, FSR showed similar behavior. At 100%, it reported 39 FPS post-patch, compared to 28 FPS at launch. Yet, again, the performance at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling improved only slightly, pointing to a hidden resolution cap at what seems to be 80–85% of native resolution, even when players think they are running fully native.

According to Owen, this behavior is a direct manipulation of the resolution scaling slider: “I'm absolutely not on board with a game lying about being at native rendering resolution. Players who have hardware powerful enough to run natively simply can't anymore. It's just making the game look worse.”

What's more, patch notes for version 1.3 included a vague line about “adjustments to super sampling resolution limits on select GPU models,” which may have been a quiet attempt to hide this change. In reality, the update seems less like a performance optimization and more like a forced upscaling placebo to artificially boost frame rates.

While upscaling has become an industry standard — most modern games encourage using DLSS, FSR, or TSR for better performance, one would at least expect the game to run at native if they choose to do so. By clamping resolution and mislabeling settings, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is going beyond just blatantly lying about the image quality, rather they're robbing players of control over their graphics fidelity.

Hahaha this game is the gift that keeps on giving. After people ceaselessly complained about bad perf, the dev patched it so that the internal resolution slider in the gfx settings never gets to 100%, despite setting it to 100%. Thankfully AMDaniel Owen caught them red-handed. https://t.co/QSzCWFMc2D pic.twitter.com/0SPw2c7NeIJuly 26, 2025

For players, this means the game looks softer or more pixelated even when maxed out. What's funny is that there is a clear 2-3 FPS improvement with the optimization patch at non-native scaling, meaning that actual work has been done to extract more juice out of the game. But instead of laser-focusing on that, the devs took a strange shortcut and shot themselves in the foot.

This discovery is likely to cause further backlash unless 505 Games issues a statement or reverts these changes. As the host pointed out, the difference between launch and patched builds suggests that the ""performance improvements"" were mostly achieved by lowering visual quality... without telling the players.

Until then, users with sharp eyes (and sharp GPUs) may find Wuchang: Fallen Feathers looking worse than ever, despite what the settings menu claims.

A transitional step for manufacturing and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Kioxia and SanDisk have begun sample shipments of their ninth-generation BiCS FLASH, a NAND flash technology that blends legacy architectures with modern enhancements to create a bridge between the current BiCS8 generation and the forthcoming BiCS10. While BiCS10 is expected to deliver higher capacities through a cutting-edge 332-layer design, BiCS9 takes a more cost-optimized approach, targeting enterprise SSDs built for AI workloads and mid-tier storage solutions where efficiency and performance balance are key.

What sets BiCS9 apart is its hybrid construction, achieved through CMOS directly Bonded to Array (CBA) technology. In this process, the logic and memory cell wafers are fabricated separately under optimized conditions before being bonded into a single, high-performance package. This innovation allows Kioxia to mix and match mature cell structures—such as a 112-layer BiCS5 or a 218-layer BiCS8—with a modern I/O interface. The result is a chip capable of delivering Toggle DDR 6.0 speeds of up to 3.6 Gb/s, with peak speeds reaching 4.8 Gb/s under controlled testing conditions.

Despite employing fewer layers than BiCS8 or the next-gen BiCS10, BiCS9 still brings meaningful upgrades. Write performance is up by 61%, read speeds improve by 12%, and power efficiency rises by 36% during writes and 27% during reads compared to previous 512 GB TLC designs. An 8% increase in bit density further underscores the careful engineering that allows BiCS9 to deliver strong performance without inflating costs.

Kioxia's roadmap positions BiCS9 as a transitional step, enabling the company to refine manufacturing techniques and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture. This strategy is particularly relevant as AI-driven data workloads demand faster, power-conscious storage solutions capable of feeding GPUs with minimal latency, especially with the extreme ambition associated with the AI boom.

Kioxia's approach with BiCS9 contrasts with rivals like Samsung and Micron, who are betting on aggressively scaling layer counts to achieve capacity gains. While competitors push beyond 300 layers, Kioxia is focusing on hybrid architectures that offer faster time-to-market and better cost efficiency. Working with a consumer-facing industry veteran like SanDisk ensures Kioxia, who invented NAND flash, stays highly competitive through mixed R&D efforts.

Therefore, the company's long-standing partnership with SanDisk has been instrumental in shaping the BiCS series, combining Japanese manufacturing expertise with SanDisk's deep storage market presence. Since their joint venture began in 2006, the two companies have co-developed multiple generations of 3D NAND technology, pushing the limits of scaling and performance. BiCS9 serves as their new marquee offering, alongside Kioxia's own efforts to set new industry standards.

≡ FIFPRO vs. FIFA HEATS UP ≡

It's nasty now. The player union FIFPRO, working with 72 players unions worldwide, and the worldwide governing body FIFA are now in an open fight, hurling insults in competing interviews and news releases.

● On Wednesday, FIFPRO head Sergio Marchi (ARG) told The Athletic in a striking interview:

“The biggest obstacle to FIFPro today is the autocracy of FIFA's president. [Gianni] Infantino lives in his own world, the only thing that matters to him are these grand spectacles.”

Marchi has been campaigning for better defined player rest periods between club play, national team matches and exhibitions and most recently, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Multiple matches were played in hot conditions in outdoor stadiums, with Marchi complaining:

“It's perverse to schedule matches at noon in that kind of heat. What are they waiting for? A tragedy? A collapse on the field?”

In a FIFPRO statement, Marchi added:

“We're in the 21st century and thousands of players still go unpaid. Meanwhile, FIFA celebrates record ticket sales. Let them have their party, but the people who built the game should be paid too.

“Football is deeply inequitable. It's unjust. And we're in a profession that ends at 35, with a whole life still ahead.

“It was announced that tickets for the World Cup are now going on sale, millions will surely be sold, according to the [FIFA] president, who says it will generate over three billion dollars in revenue. And it's incredible. Yet I'll say it again: There are still footballers who haven't been paid their salaries for two, three, even four years.

“Most of the time players are afraid speaking up could hurt their careers. But it's up to us, their representatives, to speak for them.”

● On Friday, FIFPRO held a meeting with 58 player unions in Amsterdam (NED) and added a statement that included:

“FIFPRO expressed its deepening concern over the way FIFA is currently managing global football.

“At the same time, FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players – rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance.

“The overloaded match calendar, the lack of adequate physical and mental recovery periods, extreme playing conditions, the absence of meaningful dialogue, and the ongoing disregard for players' social rights have regrettably become pillars of FIFA's business model; this is a model that puts the health of players at risk and sidelines those at the heart of the game.”

FIFA was hardly silent, responding with an exceedingly blunt statement, that included:

● “FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPRO leadership as this approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles – which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests.”

● “On Saturday, 12 July 2025, following a protracted period of unsuccessful efforts to bring FIFPRO to the table in an environment of non-hostility and respectful, progressive dialogue, FIFA convened with multiple player unions in New York, United States, to announce and reaffirm concrete, progressive measures designed specifically to protect the physical and mental wellbeing of players worldwide.”

Among the announced changes are to be a minimum of 72 hours between matches and a minimum, 21-day rest period between seasons.

● “These concrete measures go beyond what FIFPRO has been pretending to be asking for, and FIFA is extremely surprised by their leadership's reaction.

“Instead of welcoming these unprecedented announcements that benefit players all around the world, FIFPRO has responded with a series of personal and disrespectful attacks.

“This approach reveals a lot about FIFPRO priorities. It suggests that their leadership does not really care about the players, but rather about internal political fights and their image. FIFA's proposed reforms are about impacting genuine change to support players and are far more important than preserving FIFPRO's perceived image.”

At the end, the statement challenged FIFPRO:

“FIFA invites FIFPRO to return to the negotiating table, once they have stopped their blackmail and withdrawn their complaints, and once they have published their statutes, their full financial reports (including all their sources of income, the detailed intellectual property rights of the players they claim to own, and the funding one of their regional divisions receives from some football organisations), and the full list of individual members they claim to represent.”

Observed: Both sides are dug in and frustrated, with the conditions at the Club World Cup a flash point for multiple players, clubs and leagues which had issues with FIFA's expansion of the tournament.

FIFPRO filed a claim against FIFA related to the expanded Club World Cup in June 2024, “asking the Brussels Court of Commerce to refer the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) with four questions for a preliminary ruling.”

That filing, based on the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, is still pending and there might not be any movement until that case moves forward or is stopped.

FIFA's meeting with other player groups outside of FIFPRO and the criticism of the conditions of the Club World Cup in the U.S. are pressure points for the federation, which weathered the human-rights angst with the Qatar World Cup in 2022, but has since handed the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia, reigniting the debate.

No calm seas in sight.

Spain won the Women's World Cup for the first time in 2023

The BBC and ITV have secured the broadcasting rights to the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, ensuring the biggest tournament in women's football remains free-to-air for UK audiences.

The broadcasters will split games evenly between them in the group and knockout stages but will both show the final.

""Extending our partnership with Fifa alongside ITV ensures that the drama and spectacle of the Women's World Cup remains free-to-air,"" said BBC director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski.

""BBC Sport has been a longstanding champion of women's football, helping to elevate the game to where it is today – a sport experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and reach across BBC Sport platforms.

""From domestic leagues to major international tournaments, we've brought the defining moments to millions across the UK already, including this summer's Women's Euro tournament.""

BBC Sport will show live coverage on TV and iPlayer as well as bringing coverage to the website and across radio and social media platforms.

ITV will also have live games on TV as well as coverage on social media and ITVX. In addition, the broadcaster will show all of England's qualifying matches and friendlies.

""The Fifa Women's World Cup 2027 is sure to be another standout tournament and we look forward to continuing our relationship with both Fifa and the BBC,"" said Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport.

The 32-team tournament will start on 24 June 2027 and conclude on 27 July.

Spain are the defending world champions after beating England 1-0 in the final in 2023.

The pair will go head-to-head again in Sunday's Euro 25 final.

You can follow that game from 17:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, and follow live text on the BBC Sport website and app.

Tomé became the first woman to take the Spain job following the sacking of Jorge Vilda, who won the 2023 Women's World Cup. 

Monste Tomé, the head coach of Spain's women's national team, has continued where predecessor Jorge Vilda left off in her two years in the job, leading La Roja to the final of Euro 2025 less than two years after their 2023 FIFA World Cup victory. 

Tomé, formerly the team's assistant coach, took over from Vilda in unusual circumstances in September 2023, just after La Roja had won the FIFA Women's World Cup for the very first time. 

Vilda was relieved of his duties amid an unsavory episode involving former Spanish Soccer Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales, who kissed striker Jenni Hermoso on the lips following Spain's World Cup final victory over England. 

Rubiales was applauded by Vilda after initially refusing to resign from his post, with the connection between the two ultimately costing the World Cup-winning coach his job. 

Tomé, who had been Vilda's assistant coach since earning her UEFA Pro licence in 2018, had been the clear candidate to take the reins.

A former player with Oviedo Moderno, Barcelona and Levante, she was a Spanish league champion on two occasions and was capped four times by Spain.

After hanging up her boots in 2013, Tomé initially carved out a career as a primary-school PE teacher. However, she could not resist the lure of her lifelong passion and, after securing her coaching badges, she returned to soccer as Vilda's Spain assistant.

In January 2020, in the wake of Toña Is' departure as head coach of Spain's Under-17s, Tomé took charge of the team in combination with her duties with the senior side. The demands of job sharing proved too great, though, and she later made way for Kenio Gonzalo as Under-17s boss, allowing her to focus on the top team.

As Vilda's chief assistant, Tomé's analytical abilities made her a key part of his coaching staff.

What's more, despite her connection to the highly unpopular former head coach, she has an excellent relationship with the players. Indeed, she was among the Spain assistants who had the closest and best rapport with the squad.

The choice of Tomé as Vilda's successor persuaded several Spain players to return to the international fold. After the World Cup victory, a number of Spanish players said in a joint statement that they would no longer play for La Roja unless structural changes were made.

Tomé took charge of the Spanish women's national team for the first time in September 2023 and has managed 36 games, winning on 28 occasions.

Although Spain finished fourth in the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024, they won their first UEFA Nations League in 2023-24 and could add a maiden European Championship to their trophy haul at Euro 2025.

Having made several major signings this summer, Liverpool FC are now ready to make a major sale with Luis Diaz reportedly set for a Bayern Munich move. The Colombian international is keen on a new adventure, and Bayern look to be the best place for him this summer.

After making major purchases such as Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, and Hugo Ekitike, the Reds start to make some important sales.

According to media reports (via Fabrizio Romano), Bayern have agreed a deal worth about 75 million euros with Liverpool for Diaz's transfer. The Colombian's move is pending medical and contract signing, which could happen on Monday or Tuesday.

Diaz's departure could also unlock the Reds' transfer plan of signing Newcastle United's star Alexander Isak this summer. Despite being an important part of Liverpool's success, the former Porto man seems eager to experience a new chapter in his footballing career.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

French players Gael Monfils and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard are among the names to watch on the first main draw day of the National Bank Open, ATP Toronto. Our panelists offer all their predictions for the matches.

The former NCAA player Smith is well on his way to the top 100 and a breakout run on the US Open Series. Smith qualified for Washington, and did the same in Toronto. He has two Challenger finals this year and he won one of them. The teenager Tien won two matches in D.C. and at 13-16 on the season, he's well on his way to being a credible ATP player. These are two young guns, but Tien is further along the ATP learning curve despite being younger, so in the All-American matchup I'll give him the edge. Prediction: Tien in 3

Fearnley is 14-14 at tour level this year, he struggled a bit on the grass court swing and is looking to find form again. Ficovich is ranked outside the top 100 but did come through qualifying after reaching the quarters in Los Cabos. The 28 year old has reached two Challenger finals this year, he prefers clay, but he's playing excellent tennis right now and this is a test for Fearnley, that he should survive. Prediction: Fearnley in 2

Perricard is a mercurial player, he's just 6-15 at tour level this year, the 22 year old Japanese player Mochizuki is approaching the top 100 in the rankings. Twice a challenger finalist, he's bound to cause Perricard problems if GMP is not serving lights out. I'll go with an upset based on ranking, but no on form. Prediction: Mochizuki in 3

At 38 and 17-13 on the season, Monfils is still capable of magic, he hasn't posted a losing record on the tour his entire career (dating back to 2004). His trouble has been fitness and consistency. The qualifier from Chile, Barrios Vera hasn't won a tour match this year (0-7) but is 22-10 on the Challenger Tour. Given all of his recent finals have been clay Challengers, he's unlikely to pull off an upset in this one, but Monfils is not playing his best. Prediction: Monfils in 3

The journeyman Blanchet is 11-13 on the year, he qualified for this tournament, and did win a Challenger in January. Safiullin is an awful 4-13 on the season and really trying to turn things around. Blanchet is the kind of opponent he should still be capable of beating though. Prediction: Safiullin in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer: 6 men with best Grand Slam win streaks","https://www.tennis365.com/facts-stats/men-longest-grand-slam-win-streaks-novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-roger-federer","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 19:34:19 GMT","

Six male players have amassed winning streaks of at least 25 matches at Grand Slams, while just one man has registered 30 successive wins at majors.

Here are the nine players with the longest win streaks in Grand Slam men's singles matches in the Open Era (including only the longest streak for each player).

Rafael Nadal‘s best Grand Slam streak began at the 2010 French Open, where he steamrolled Gianna Mina, Horacio Zeballos, Lleyton Hewitt, Thomaz Bellucci, Nicolas Almagro, Jurgen Melzer and Robin Soderling without losing a set to secure the trophy.

At Wimbledon, Nadal completed the Channel Slam by defeating Kei Nishikori, Robin Haase, Philipp Petzschner, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Soderling, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych.

Nadal then achieved the Career Grand Slam at the 2010 US Open as he saw off Teymuraz Gabashvili, Denis Istomin, Gilles Simon, Feliciano Lopez, Fernando Verdasco, Mikhail Youzhny and Novak Djokovic.

The Spaniard took his run to 25 straight wins by beating Marcos Daniel, Ryan Sweeting, Bernard Tomic and Marin Cilic at the 2011 Australian Open before he lost to David Ferrer in the last eight.

Pete Sampras won the 1993 Wimbledon Championships to start his best-ever Grand Slam run, earning wins over Neil Borwick, Jamie Morgan, Byron Black, Andrew Foster, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker and Jim Courier.

The American then overcame Fabrice Santoro, Daniel Vacek, Arnaud Boetsch, Tomas Enqvist, Michael Chang, Alexander Volkov and Cedric Pioline to win the 1993 US Open.

At the 1994 Australian Open, Sampras triumphed against Joshua Eagle, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Stephane Simian, Ivan Lendl, Magnus Gustafsson, Jim Courier and Todd Martin to win a third straight Slam.

Sampras added four more wins at the 1994 French Open — against Albert Costa, Marcelo Rios, Paul Haarhuis and Mikael Tillstrom — before falling to Courier in the quarter-finals.

Jimmy Connors started his 25-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1974 Australian Open, where he defeated Jean-Louis Haillet, Graeme Thomson, Syd Ball, Vladimir Zednik, John Alexander and Phil Dent for the trophy.

After missing the French Open, Connors resumed his run at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships as he downed Ove Bengtson, Dent, Adriano Panatta, Jaime Fillol, Jan Kodes, Dick Stockton and Ken Rosewall to secure the title.

Connors then claimed the 1974 US Open crown by beating Jeff Borowiak, Ove Bengtson, Alexander, Kodes, Alex Metreveli, Roscoe Tanner and Rosewall.

The American narrowly missed out on defending his crown at the 1975 Australian Open, where he lost the final to John Newcombe after seeing off Chris Kachel, Ulrich Pinner, Raz Reid, Kim Warwick and Dick Crealy.

The 7 men with the highest Canadian Open win percentage: Djokovic 4th, Nadal 82.61%

Roger Federer‘s best major streak started with his triumph at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships, where he overcame Paul-Henri Mathieu, Ivo Minar, Nicholas Kiefer, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Fernando Gonzalez, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick.

The Swiss then beat Minar, Fabrice Santoro, Olivier Rochus, Kiefer, David Nalbandian, Hewitt and Andre Agassi to win the 2005 US Open.

At the 2006 Australian Open, Federer extended his run with a third straight Grand Slam title as he saw off Istomin, Florian Mayer, Max Mirnyi, Tommy Haas, Nikolay Davydenko, Kiefer and Marcos Baghdatis.

Federer took his run to 27 straight wins at majors with victories over Diego Hartfield, Alejandro Falla, Nicolas Massu, Berdych, Mario Ancic and David Nalbandian at the 2006 French Open. He fell one win short of a non-calendar Grand Slam as he fell to Rafael Nadal in the Roland Garros final.

Rod Laver began his 29-match Grand Slam win streak at the 1969 Australian Open, where he downed Massimo Di Domenico, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, Tony Roche and Andres Gimeno for the title.

The Australian continued his run with victory at the 1969 French Open as he defeated Koji Watanabe, Richard Crealy, Pietro Marzano, Stan Smith, Gimeno, Tom Okker and Ken Rosewall.

Laver then added the 1969 Wimbledon title as he claimed wins against Nicola Pietrangeli, Premjit Lall, Jan Leschly, Smith, Cliff Drysdale, Arthur Ashe and John Newcombe.

At the 1969 US Open, Laver overcame Luis-Augusto Garcia, Jaime Pinto Bravo, Jaime Fillol, Dennis Ralston, Emerson, Ashe and Roche to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam.

Laver's next major appearance came at Wimbledon in 1970, where he beat Butch Seewagen, John Alexander and Frew McMillan before his streak was snapped by a fourth round defeat to Roger Taylor.

Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most consecutive Grand Slam victories having gone 30 matches without defeat at majors between 2015 and 2016.

The Serbian's run started at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, where he saw off Philipp Kohlschreiber, Jarkko Nieminen, Bernard Tomic, Kevin Anderson, Cilic, Richard Gasquet and Federer for the title.

Djokovic then beat Joao Souza, Andreas Haider-Maurer, Andreas Seppi, Roberto Bautista Agut, Feliciano Lopez, Cilic and Federer to win the 2015 US Open.

At the 2016 Australian Open, Djokovic earned wins over Hyeon Chung, Quentin Halys, Seppi, Gilles Simon, Kei Nishikori, Federer and Murray to lift the title.

He then lifted his maiden French Open title as he beat Lu Yen-hsun, Steve Darcis, Aljaz Bedene, Bautista Agut, Berdych, Dominic Thiem and Murray.

This triumph saw Djokovic complete the Career Grand Slam and made him just the second man to win four successive majors in the Open Era.

Djokovic took his Grand Slam win streak to 30 by defeating James Ward and Adrian Mannarino at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, before his run ended with a shock third round loss to Sam Querrey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","She became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time when she won a Wimbledon title aged just 15","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/throwbacks/she-became-the-youngest-grand-slam-champion-of-all-time-when-she-won-a-wimbledon-title-aged-just-15/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 20:00:00 GMT","

Tennis is one of the most gruelling sports there is, commanding both physical and mental toughness on an unparalleled scale.

Players are thrown out onto a court, either alone or with a sole partner, and expected to do battle for hours and hours in swirling wind or baking sunshine. Unless they are winning tournaments, they are always losing, and when one tournament ends, another immediately begins.

It's relentless, and not everybody can compete at the apex of the sport for a decade and beyond. As such, careers within tennis can be cut short in an instant.

However, for some, like Martina Hingis, there is little that can stop them from coming back to tennis time and time again.

Hingis was the quintessential wonderkid when she burst onto the scene in the mid to late 90s, turning professional in 1994 at just 14 years old.

Many were likely stunned by this Swiss youngster who sprang into the limelight, but that decision was vindicated just two years later when she became the youngest-ever Grand Slam champion, winning the doubles title in 1996.

Then, less than a year later, she had begun hoovering up major titles in singles as well.

First came the Australian Open in 1997, before she was beaten in the final of the French Open. This loss proved costly, as Hingis won every other major that year, meaning she was just one win from completing the calendar Grand Slam.

She would defend her title in Melbourne for two more years, but failed to win at any of the other events in singles.

However, her doubles prowess remained sharp, with 1998 marking her standout year. There, she managed what she had failed to do in 1997, and completed the calendar slam by winning all four majors.

These made up a chunk of the 13 titles she won at this level, added to the five singles majors she won too.

Hingis was, during this period, the true dominant force on the tour, and naturally set a number of ‘youngest-ever' records that will likely never be broken. 

Alas, one player on the WTA has been compared to Hingis recently…

Hingis' glittering career was strangely offset by a string of retirements, brought about by various reasons.

Her first retirement came in 2003, aged just 22 at the time, citing chronic pain and unrelenting injuries as the reason.

The tennis world stood still, but this hiatus only ended up being two years long as she slowly began her comeback in 2005. She insisted it would not be a permanent return, but 2006 marked her full-fledged comeback on the WTA Tour.

Then, in 2007, came Hingis' second retirement, after being handed a suspension following a drugs test. Admittedly, the ITF ended up changing the rules because of her, allowing for future flexibility in cases of unintentional or unexplained ingestion.

She would make small forays back into the sport, but 2010 marked her true return after that second retirement.

And finally, Hingis' very last retirement came in 2017, officially bringing her tumultuous, magical career to a complete end.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Scattered thunderstorms early, then partly cloudy after midnight. Storms could contain damaging winds. Low 71F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 50%.

 Updated: July 27, 2025 @ 5:33 pm





Naomi Osaka of Japan leaves the court after losing to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova during a third round women's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday, July 4, 2025.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Naomi Osaka and coach Patrick Mouratoglou are done working together after less than a year, the four-time Grand Slam champion announced Sunday on social media.

“Merci Patrick,” Osaka began her post, with a photo of her hitting a practice serve while he stands nearby. “It was such a great experience learning from you. Wishing you nothing but the best. You are one of the coolest people I've ever met and I'm sure I'll see you around.”

The news comes three days after Osaka lost her second match at the D.C. Open and just before she begins competing in Toronto. The U.S. Open, the year's last major tournament and an event Osaka won twice, begins in New York on Aug. 24.

Osaka hired Mouratoglou — who was the longtime coach of Serena Williams — when she fired Wim Fissette shortly after her second-round exit at last year's U.S. Open.

Osaka, a former No. 1, is currently ranked 51st and has a 21-11 record this season.

She hasn't been past the third round at a Grand Slam tournament since winning the 2021 Australian Open.

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

With the weather set to play a part in proceedings, Chris Medland picks out what to watch out for in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.

From another chapter of the title fight to some big midfield points on offer – and from a weather forecast that could add jeopardy to Lewis Hamilton fighting back through the field – here are a few areas to keep an eye on during Sunday's race at Spa-Francorchamps...

Qualifying has been a tale of two McLaren drivers so far this weekend, with Oscar Piastri dominant in Sprint Qualifying and then Lando Norris turning the tables with his fourth pole position of the season.

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Sprint and Qualifying at Spa-Francorchamps ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix.

Piastri made a good start to the Sprint but was powerless to prevent Verstappen flying past down the Kemmel Straight once the Dutchman got into the slipstream. Leclerc pulled off a similar move on Norris. But Norris was able to fight back and overtake Leclerc, then closing in on the front two. Verstappen made no mistakes in the closing stages, so gave no opportunities to Piastri or Norris, who just did not have enough straight-line speed to challenge the Red Bull for the win.

The good news for McLaren is that their one-lap pace was still superior to the rest of the field, as their drivers locked-out the front row for the Grand Prix. Piastri made the smallest of errors on his final flying run, which made all the difference as Norris bagged his fourth pole of the season.

Lando Norris, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 1st, 1:40.562

“It was a decent lap and I'm very happy. I was confident after yesterday and confident coming into today and it's nice to see that I could get back to the top. The car has been flying all weekend and I feel good. Oscar's been doing a good job all weekend too, we're pushing each other a lot. It's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute.

“The weather looks interesting for tomorrow. I don't mind if we have sun, rain or a bit of both. It's normal here at Spa and I'm looking forward to a fun race whatever we get.”

Oscar Piastri, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:40.647

“Starting P2 tomorrow. I'm a little bit disappointed as I didn't put the lap together in the final run of Q3, losing time at Turn 14, but it's incredibly fine margins out there, and it felt like the car was in a really good place again. The weather tomorrow means it's tricky to predict what will happen, but starting on the front row is always a good thing. We'll work through it all overnight and be ready to go racing tomorrow.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“The team and drivers did a great job today to come away with a double podium in this morning's Sprint and a 1-2 result in Qualifying for tomorrow's Grand Prix, with both Lando and Oscar delivering superb pace.

""This morning's Sprint race didn't deliver quite the result we wanted with Oscar taking second and Lando third, but it has put us in good condition to make some improvements ahead of tomorrow's race.

""The weather will certainly play its part on race day, as is so often the case here in Spa, and both Red Bull and Ferrari have made improvements today which will put us under pressure from the start. The whole team will make sure we are in the best position possible to finish the weekend with a victory and more valuable points in both championships.”

Red Bull had opted for a skinny rear wing for the Sprint, and it proved a masterstroke. With better straight line speed than McLaren, Verstappen was able to overtake Piastri on the opening lap. From there, the Dutchman drove perfectly to keep the arguably faster McLarens at bay as he took the Sprint win here as he did in 2023. Tsunoda came home down the order, unable to make much of an impact in the tight midfield.

But the Japanese racer did much better come Qualifying, making Q3 for the first time since Miami and going on to grab his best Qualifying performance since he joined Red Bull. Verstappen was a touch more disappointed, unable to split the McLarens again after adding some downforce to his car with a view to tomorrow's weather forecast.

Max Verstappen, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 4th, 1:40.903

“It was amazing to get the Sprint win here today and finishing P1 at my favourite track is always great. It was good for us to have the top speed advantage that we had; I wasn't sure if we could keep the McLarens behind but we didn't make many mistakes and had really good battery management. It was a nice surprise, we worked really well as a Team and it was a good boost for everyone today going into the rest of the weekend. For Qualifying, honestly, I was hoping for a little bit more. For some reason in Q3 I just didn't have the same grip and feeling in the car. I was hoping that the set up that we had would help the driving feeling, but this wasn't the case and the balance wasn't where we wanted it to be. I felt like I couldn't push the car to the limit and attack the corners how I like, which you really need to do here in Spa. I had a wheel spin on the last corner of the first lap and, on the second lap, I was down on my lap time already on turn one which wasn't ideal. We were pretty close to the McLarens, so it was a shame to finish P4 as we were at least hoping to be P3. Fighting for the win will be tough as both McLarens will still be fast in the wet, so we don't expect any miracles. We want to fight back for a podium and lot could happen in the race with the weather.""

Yuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:41.284

“The Sprint wasn't the start to the day that we were wanting and my pace really didn't stack up against my management of the car but the Team really turned things around very quickly ahead of Qualifying. P7 for my 100th start tomorrow is so exciting, it feels like yesterday that I had my first ever race in Bahrain and it really has been an interesting journey these past five years. The F1 environment can be hard but all you can do is keep pushing which is what we did today. It is a great feeling being back to the place where I should be, but I would like to say a huge thank you to my mechanics who managed to make the upgrade to the floor ahead of Qualifying. The upgrade allowed me to really push and drive much closer to the limit than has been possible previously, the car is sliding less and is a lot more forgiving, really it's a huge credit to the Team. I really enjoyed the drive today and am feeling more confident going into race day tomorrow, we know that it is likely to rain but our hybrid set up means that we are prepared for the wet or the dry but obviously I would prefer the dry. My main focus now is on scoring points tomorrow and extracting as much performance as possible from the car. Seeing Laurent at the end of Qualifying gave me flashbacks from when we worked together at Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, he smiled directly at me as soon as I pulled in today and it really boosted my confidence.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""It was a very positive start to the day with a win in the Sprint. This was down to the enormous effort from everyone in the factory to deliver key upgrades, and from there it was an incredible job from Max. He had only one shot to make the move on Oscar and he nailed it, after that it was a masterclass of defence and tyre management, well supported by the Team. Qualifying was a smooth session but nowhere near perfect and it was certainly a little bit more difficult to extract everything from the car for Max. This is something for us as a Team to look at. The gap to McLaren is probably fair, it is reflecting the reality and it is still a bit frustrating to miss out. For Yuki it was a really positive step forward this weekend and it is good to see him in Q3. He progressed very well, and his best Qualifying result for the Team should give him a good boost of confidence. We upgraded his car just before Qualifying, giving him the same updated floor as Max, although not the same front wing. A big thank you for the huge effort from the crew to get that car ready on time. We will fight from P4 and P7 tomorrow and everything is to play for. We will see what the weather is like, we are not desperate for rain but we have made choices on the car to prepare for variable weather. The rain is probably the best chance to mix up the cards and to get closer to McLaren but if it's a drier day we will still take the fight and it will be down to how we play the game and tyre management.""

Leclerc managed to pick off Norris on the opening lap, but soon lost out to the McLaren man. He then wound up a lonely fourth, well off the pace of the front three. Hamilton could not make up many places after a poor Sprint Qualifying, but he did at least learn plenty about the new rear suspension upgrades.

Hamilton's day did not improve come Qualifying, when his last lap time in Q1 was deleted for exceeding track limits through Raidillon. That dropped him out in Q1, on what has been a disappointing weekend so far. Leclerc did make Q3, and managed to extract absolutely everything on his final flying run to grab third, winding up just 0.003s ahead of Verstappen's Red Bull.

Charles Leclerc, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:40.900

""I'm very happy today, despite us still being three tenths off pole. We put it all together and it feels good to look back at qualifying knowing that we haven't left anything on the table with the potential we had today. I've felt comfortable in the car since FP1 and we've learned a lot about our upgrades. Our competitors in the front look strong but with the small changes we've made to the car with the race in mind, I hope we can put up a good fight tomorrow.""

Lewis Hamilton, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:41.939

""It's not been a great day but we got some valuable insight into the new suspension and upgrades during the Sprint.

""The team made further adjustments ahead of qualifying based on what we learned. Unfortunately, my lap time was deleted for track limits, and I take full responsibility for that. Tomorrow's race will be challenging, with overtaking being quite difficult here, but I'm fully focused on making up ground and fighting for points to reward the hard work everyone's done back at the factory to bring these updates.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""Charles did a very good lap at the end. Currently we are still working on getting the most out of the new package we brought here and there was real improvement over the course of the weekend from the start all the way to the final lap in qualifying. We learned more about the car from session to session. Rain is expected tomorrow that will also allow us to see how these upgrades work in all conditions. We are still a couple of tenths behind McLaren but we are on the pace of Verstappen. We will continue to work on improving still further for Budapest.

""As for Lewis, he was unable to put everything together but the field is so close, a matter of just hundredths or even thousandths of a second between the cars. His pace was good, he was just one place behind Charles but the track limits put him out and it is what it is. It's true that it's been a tough weekend for him so far and, at this track, you need to build up confidence lap after lap and with the problems yesterday and today that was made difficult for him.""

After a difficult Sprint Qualifying session, it was always going to be hard for the Mercedes drivers to make much progress in the Sprint. Russell made up one place at least, with the team hopefully learning plenty ahead of tomorrow's Grand Prix. Russell made Q3 in Qualifying too as his weekend started to improve, although he did admit afterwards to a slightly compromised set-up for the race – especially if it rains.

Antonelli could not join him there, the youngster once again exiting at the first time of asking. Like his predecessor Hamilton, he is having what can only be described as a very difficult weekend.

George Russell, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 6th, 1:41.260

""Today was a better day than Friday in terms of the result but, if you take out yesterday, then this was one of our worst Qualifying performances of the year. We are struggling here in Spa this weekend and we are working hard to understand why. We were potentially slightly light on rear wing level, given we were fastest in sectors one and three, but that is really just a compromise of where you gain lap time across the circuit.

""Starting P6 tomorrow still gives us a chance of fighting for decent points for tomorrow. We set the car up today so we could maximise Qualifying, so we will have to see what the weather does tomorrow. If it does rain, we may be slightly compromised but I'd much rather be starting in P6 with that than outside of the top 10. Let's see what happens on Sunday.""

Kimi Antonelli, Sprint: 17th, Qualifying: 18th, 1:42.139

""That was another difficult day in what has been a tricky period for us over the past few races. I was struggling with the car balance on Friday and that continued into Qualifying today. The confidence wasn't there and that showed in the lap time. It is frustrating as we know we have more pace than we showed today.

""We are working hard to improve so we can get back on track and putting in good results. Whilst Qualifying didn't go the way we want, we have a chance to do that tomorrow. The weather forecast is changeable, and we may have rain. That would give us a chance to make up more positions than may be possible in a standard dry race.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""As a team, this weekend has fallen far below our standards so far. It has been our weakest performance this year and we need to quickly understand why. We have struggled with a car facing several balance limitations, losing the vast majority of our lap time in the middle sector. We knew we would struggle to get into the points in the Sprint given our starting positions, so focused on improving these balance issues for Qualifying. Unfortunately, we couldn't make sufficient headway and suffered as a result.

""With a mixed weather forecast for tomorrow's race, we will be looking to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way. We are not fooling ourselves though; the pace of our car has not been sufficient this weekend to challenge at the front and that is unlikely to change tomorrow. We will race hard to maximise our result but must ensure we start the weekend in a much stronger position in Budapest next week.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""That was another disappointing day for us here in Spa. We were looking to bounce back from a tough Friday, knowing that the big points were still on offer ahead of us. Starting from outside the top 10 in the Sprint, we knew that progress would be difficult to achieve. The low wing levels being run here result in a modest DRS effect and other than Kimi making one pass, we were unable to make any further overtakes.

""We made quite significant changes to our car for Qualifying but the underlying limitations were still there and neither driver had good confidence in the rear end. Kimi was eliminated in the first cut; George did a good job to get as far as P6 but it's clear we have to get to the bottom of the issues with the car as it simply wasn't quick. We're expecting some rain for the race tomorrow. Considering our starting positions that's a good thing, and hopefully both drivers can move forward if we operate well, but our bigger focus is to understand why our pace has been so poor at this track.""

Sainz started sixth in the Sprint and finished sixth, picking up three points for his team – his first score since Canada, and biggest points haul since Imola. He came close to getting Ocon too but just did not have enough straight-line speed to chase down the Haas.

The Spaniard's Qualifying did not go to plan, as he could not find much pace in Q2 and exited in P15. But Albon took the opportunity to shine instead, as he made Q3 and once there grabbed a season's best P5 on the grid. His car looks to be there on merit too, so the Thai driver will certainly be hunting a good haul of points tomorrow.

Alex Albon, Sprint: 16th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:41.201

""I'm really happy. We fixed the issue we had on Friday, which made the biggest difference. The lap felt tricky, and it was difficult to see where I could find the lap time, so I wasn't expecting to make such a big step forward in Q3. The working window for the tyres is very narrow and we did a good job to find that sweet spot to pull it all together. Our race pace feels strong, so I'm hoping for a relatively straightforward race tomorrow.""

Carlos Sainz, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:41.758

""Disappointed with this result. I had a strong lap in Q1 but didn't manage to go any faster in Q2, as I didn't manage to find grip. We've tried different directions with car balance and experimented a bit with set-up throughout the weekend, but obviously today didn't go our way and we need to analyse it. Hopefully tomorrow there will be opportunities as it could be wet, so let's keep focused as the weekend is not over yet.""

_James Vowles, Team Principal

""What a fantastic day all-round. This morning, with Carlos finishing P6 in the Sprint Race, demonstrating good performance across the two days, and this afternoon with Alex securing P5, our best Qualifying result since Vegas last year.

""We made some improvements to the car since yesterday, working mostly well. I think with Carlos, there's an interesting quirk with Sprint Qualifying sessions in that you must use a set of Soft tyres in SQ3. This meant that in Q2 today, we had to use one used and one new set of tyres. Then, as the track warmed up, he struggled to find the same lap time as we had previously.

""I'm optimistic for tomorrow and look forward to it. I think the weather conditions could play a part but we're in a strong position with two strong drivers.""

Hadjar moved up a slot to eighth when Gasly did not take the start, and was able to hold that position to the finish to grab the final point on offer. It could have been more though, Hadjar stuck right behind Bearman's Haas for lap after lap – but he could not find a way past, despite a few attempts.

The Frenchman's day continued to look good on paper but be frustrating in reality, when he qualified eighth – believing more was possible when the margins were incredibly tight. Lawson was ninth, just 0.018s behind his team mate as Racing Bulls look poised for more points tomorrow.

Isack Hadjar, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:41.310

""It was a good Sprint for us this morning. We showed a really good pace and we managed to score a point. In Qualifying, both Liam and I got into the rhythm very quickly. I'm very satisfied, but I just expected a bit more than a P8, as we started the session really strong and Alex in P5 is just a tenth away from us, so I feel like I could have done a better job. Overall, we have a stable car, which has worked really well, and it gave me confidence from the beginning, so I'm definitely proud of the team. We have a strong pace and we also start within the points tomorrow. We know that there's a chance for a wet race but I'm happy with our car setup, so the aim is obviously to be in the fight to try and get some points.”

Liam Lawson, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 9th, 1:41.328

""It was a good session for the team having both cars reach Q3, but it's tough when you see P5 was so close. The speed was building and we were learning throughout the session, but a moment at the end of the lap meant we lost some time, so with such close margins it's frustrating. Regardless of the conditions tomorrow, we need to try and have a clean race while extracting everything out of the car.”

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance

“A good day for us today. The pace in the Sprint race was good, but with everybody on the same tyre, it was extremely difficult to overtake. Nevertheless, Isack scored a point, which rewarded the good work done by the team. Qualifying was great with both cars in Q3, which puts us in a strong position for the race tomorrow. The weather may play a big part, with rain expected, but our car has worked really well in the more technical middle sector today giving us confidence for tomorrow and a target to score points with both cars.”

Haas, like Red Bull, opted for a skinny rear wing and a low downforce set-up for the Sprint. That paid dividends, with Ocon and Bearman both able to finish in the points. Ocon was able to hold Sainz at bay for a ‘best of the rest' P5 while Bearman somehow kept Hadjar behind, despite the Frenchman being within half a second for nearly the entire Sprint.

They added some downforce for Qualifying, and lost some of their raw pace as a result. But considering Qualifying has been their Achilles' Heel this season, getting both cars to the fringes of the top 10 is still a handy result, especially considering their race pace is often better than their one-lap prowess.

Esteban Ocon, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:41.525

“I'm super pleased with the Sprint, six points for the team today is a really good result. We can be satisfied with that as the cars in front were out of reach, so we finished on top of our race, so to speak. It was very close out there in qualifying this afternoon, but there are some positives as we've fixed some issues with the balance of the car. It's still a decent starting position and we're only one place away from a point which is pretty good, so we need to maximise the potential there.”

Oliver Bearman, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:41.617

“I lost three tenths in Turn 1 as my tyres were just not ready. After that, I managed to bring it back and do a very good lap, but it was a big shame as we really had the pace to be in Q3. We added a lot of downforce so hopefully that plays into our hands tomorrow. The Sprint was good, and it was nice to score some points – getting both cars into the points in a Sprint is no mean feat.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“The Sprint was very good; we wanted to convert our starting positions of P5 and P7 into results, and we finished exactly there. Six points is an amazing result. For qualifying, we had to consider the weather for tomorrow as there's a high chance it's going to rain. It's tricky to decide direction, so we split listening to driver feedback to cover the widest range as a team. It's frustrating and a bit deflating right now because we have speed. We lost out getting to Q3 by a tiny margin to Albon and he qualified P5, so I feel that's where our potential is. The good thing is, with Ollie's set-up especially, he's very confident and our target is double points again.”

Bortoleto inherited an effective P9 on the grid after Gasly failed to start, but he just could not chase down Hadjar ahead for the final point. Finishing ninth is still an encouraging result for the rookie, especially considering Hulkenberg wound up way down the order. The Brazilian continued his strong form in Qualifying, making the top 10 yet again. He had no fresh tyres for Q3, but qualifying 10th is still a very handy result. Hulkenberg was further down the order after a messy session where his front wing was broken in the pit lane.

The German attempted to edge into the fast lane, only to collide with Stroll's Aston Martin. The stewards had a look at the incident, and opted to give Kick Sauber a reprimand for the incident.

Nico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:41.707

“Qualifying didn't quite go our way today – I was lacking a bit too much on the straights, and without a proper tow, we left a couple of tenths on the table, which made the difference in the end. On the positive side, the car felt much better today compared to Friday. We already made a step forward in the Sprint this morning, which gave me more confidence heading into qualifying. Sprint weekends are always a bit of a challenge – limited track time, and if you're out early in SQ1, you miss out on valuable laps. We approached the Sprint more like an extended practice session: with the data we gathered we made solid progress and I found a better rhythm on this particular track layout. In terms of setup, we also factored in the possibility of rain tomorrow – probably like everyone else. Now let's see what the race brings.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 10th, 1:42.387

""I am happy to have made it back into Q3! I think it's safe to say sometimes you do need a little bit of luck in this sport, and today it was my turn: Hamilton's lap got deleted, and that allowed me to make it into Q2. I hadn't given my best in Q1 – I was honestly pretty frustrated about it – and I knew I had to reset and focus on improving in Q2, giving everything I had: I am glad it worked out. Looking back at this morning, it was a rather uneventful Sprint from my end, although it still allowed me to get some more track time. Sprint weekends can pose some extra challenges, but also a chance to learn something more, too. Overall, I am feeling more comfortable in the car every weekend: I would like to thank the team – both trackside and back home in Hinwil - for this. Looking at tomorrow – rain or dry – we'll be ready and give it our best.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“The day started with the 15-lap sprint, which turned out to be a largely uneventful race overall. Unfortunately for Nico, the race did not go the way we hoped, first struggling to balance the car and, secondly, due to a combination of being overtaken and then sitting in traffic. For Gabi, he once again executed a very mature drive, starting in P10 and finishing in P9.

“The team then regrouped for qualifying and what proved to be a dramatic session here in Spa. Gabi originally qualified in P16, just 0.024 seconds off progressing into Q2. However, Hamilton's time was then deleted and Gabi found himself through to the second period of qualifying where he did a great lap, qualified P9, and put himself into Q3 for the second time this season. By Q3 we had run out of new tyres and, after two runs, he ended up qualifying in P10 for the race. It was great to see the garage busy throughout qualifying and Gabi's P10 marked Sauber's highest starting position at Spa in a decade.

""Nico, on the other hand, started off with damage in the pit lane following the incident with Stroll, which meant we had to change the nose of the car. Solid runs in Q1 got Nico into Q2 and ultimately a starting position of P14, just two tenths off getting into Q3. Sprint weekends are always a test of team endurance and once again we came together, enabling both cars to be in Q2 for the first time this season. The energy in the team is great going into Sunday and, with two good starting positions secured, we are ready for whatever surprises Spa might throw at us.”

Alpine had a torrid start to the day, with Gasly's car springing a water leak before the Sprint had even started. They tried and failed to fix that on the grid, so the Frenchman did not manage to start the Sprint. He did briefly come out three laps down to test out a few things, before retiring after a few more laps. Colapinto had started from the pit lane anyway after the team opted to change his car under parc ferme regulations – and he could not make an impact, finishing last.

Gasly's day improved slightly come Qualifying, as he made it to Q2 at least, Colapinto could not join him there though, exiting in Q1 for the second straight race.

Pierre Gasly, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 13th, 1:41.633

“It has been a tricky day with the Sprint Race and Qualifying. Frustratingly, the Sprint was over before it started as we had a water leak on the car on the way to the grid. The team managed to repair it so we did some laps – almost like a Free Practice 3 for us – but not anything meaningful in the end. These things happen and the team did a great job to even turn things around to have some track time. For Qualifying, everything felt quite good. We progressed through Q1 and then in Q2 the final lap was decent. We probably just needed someone in front of us for a tow but we were the first car on track so missed out. A tenth or two would have been enough to reach Q3, and we know all the little details count. We will see what we can do tomorrow. We know some teams have opted for different set-ups but we will focus on ourselves and give it everything to come away with the best possible result.”

Franco Colapinto, Sprint: 19th, Qualifying: 17th, 1:42.022

“Taking the day as a whole it has been a frustrating one, but with the work we've done as a team since yesterday, the car has improved a lot and felt like a good step forward. It felt more alive today, particularly in Qualifying but the margins are so tight that we unfortunately narrowly missed out on getting to Q2 by a tenth of a second. It's a pity as that's something you can find over a lap, but I think ultimately, we're still lacking a little bit of pace compared to the others and, with such a condensed field, it shows. Starting from the Pit Lane in the Sprint, it turned into more of a practice session for us, which gave us some useful insight and data for tomorrow. We now turn our attention to the Grand Prix tomorrow and will see what we can get out of it. With rain forecast hopefully we'll be a bit stronger and more competitive, and here at Spa anything can happen. So, we'll prepare for all eventualities.”

The two Aston Martin drivers managed to trade places in the Sprint, Stroll picking off Alonso and chasing Russell hard in the closing stages. The suspicion was that they have a much better race car than their pace in Sprint Qualifying suggested. Whether that is the case tomorrow remains to be seen, but the team will have a very tough job to show any pace from the back row of the grid. Neither Alonso nor Stroll could extract any pace whatsoever in Qualifying – the Canadian not helped by a pit lane collision with Hulkenberg which broke his endplate.

Fernando Alonso, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:42.385

""This weekend hasn't gone our way so far. We made some set-up changes for the rain, but we just lacked pace today. We need to go back and understand why our package isn't performing here. Starting near the back is never easy, and this performance doesn't reflect where we are as a team this season. I still feel quick in the car, and we'll keep pushing to see what we can do tomorrow.""

Lance Stroll, Sprint: 13th, Qualifying: 20th, 1:42.502

""We simply didn't have the pace today and qualified in P20. I'm not too surprised about the result as we've been struggling with pace all weekend. We'll look into it and see what we can learn. It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow so anything can happen.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""A challenging day here in Spa. We knew heading into the Sprint it would be difficult to score points as both Lance and Fernando started further down the field. Unfortunately, the race then didn't offer any opportunities to move forward.

""In Qualifying, both cars sadly didn't make it out of Q1. While we made slight adjustments to the set-up in anticipation of rain tomorrow, fundamentally we just didn't have the pace today. With a wet race forecast, there's still a lot to play for. We'll make the most of any opportunities that come our way and fight hard to score points.""

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“A very busy Saturday as is always the case on a Sprint weekend. From the short race, we were able to gather plenty of useful information on how the Medium tyre, used by the great majority of drivers, behaved. Degradation was a factor, obviously as this track is very hard on tyres, but it definitely wasn't dramatic, especially as there was no graining, something we had already realised in yesterday's free practice.

“As for strategy, the first thing to take into consideration is that the forecast is for a high chance of rain. Therefore the hypothetical scenarios are many, in every sense of the word. If it's a dry race with track temperatures significantly lower than today's or yesterday's, the Soft and Medium compounds will be the most competitive.

""As there is not that big a difference between a one-stop and a two-stop, any combination of Soft and Medium is possible. That doesn't mean the decision to bring a very hard Hard here was a mistake: if we had kept the same trio as last year, the one-stop would have been significantly quicker. One must also bear in mind that overtaking at this track is not that easy, as could be seen in all today's Sprint races, in F1, F2 and F3, when trains of cars were formed despite or indeed because of the DRS. This means that the start, and especially the first sector on the opening lap, should make the difference and slipstreaming could play an important role.

“If the race starts in the dry, but with the threat of rain, one can easily imagine the Medium would be the favourite compound so as to have greater flexibility in managing the moment to switch to rain tyres or to extend the first stint as much as possible.”

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in a wet-dry Belgian Grand Prix, extending his Drivers' Championship lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in the Belgian Grand Prix, holding off McLaren team mate and title rival Lando Norris in a wet-dry affair at Spa-Francorchamps to extend his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Heavy rain ahead of the 44-lap race delayed proceedings by almost 80 minutes but once racing got underway on Lap 5, the crucial moment came immediately as Piastri got a better run on his team mate and polesitter through Eau Rouge.

The Australian's run was so great he completed the pass along the Kemmel Straight well before the braking zone of Les Combes and thereafter managed a margin of roughly one second in the early running.

With the circuit having substantially dried and with track position, Piastri pitted on Lap 12 for the medium tyres with Norris forced to complete another lap, and after making his own stop the following tour for hard rubber, the Briton found himself nine seconds adrift.

Despite having to manage his softer compound, Piastri maintained a healthy gap which only reduced in the final laps to as much as 3.1s, but a small mistake from Norris at La Source on the penultimate lap meant the margin extended to 3.4s at the chequered flag.

The two title challengers were well clear of Charles Leclerc in third, the Ferrari driver finishing 20s behind Piastri but having held Saturday's Sprint winner Max Verstappen at bay throughout, the Red Bull man just 1.5s away from another rostrum.

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Mercedes' George Russell enjoyed a lonely race for P5, having passed Alex Albon early on, with the Williams driver surviving constant pressure from Lewis Hamilton in the second half of proceedings to claim sixth.

Hamilton had climbed 11 places in his Ferrari after a pit lane start and was one of the first to switch from the intermediate tyres at the crossover point to eventually finish seventh.

Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto claimed 8th and 9th respectively, with Pierre Gasly's Alpine taking the final point on offer in P10 after heading a DRS train for much of the race.

This was headed by Haas' Oliver Bearman, with Nico Hulkenberg P12 after making a second stop having been running in the points, while Yuki Tsunoda lost two places in the closing stages.

The Red Bull driver finished ahead of Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Esteban Ocon (Haas), Kimi Antonelli, Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz - the Mercedes, Aston Martin and Williams drivers all starting from the pit lane.

Alpine's Franco Colapinto and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the order as all drivers reached the chequered flag as there was no caution period once racing had got underway after the delayed start.

With Saturday's Sprint having been held in sunshine and optimal conditions, drivers and teams were thrown a huge curveball on Sunday afternoon as heavy rain hit the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit less than 30 minutes before the start of the scheduled 44-lap race.

Unsurprisingly, the race started behind the Safety Car with polesitter Norris leading the field away from McLaren team mate Piastri with all drivers on the intermediate Pirelli tyre and searching for grip amongst the standing water.

Several drivers started from the pit lane after power unit and set-up changes, including Sainz, Hamilton, Antonelli and Alonso, with the quartet joining the back of the Safety Car queue as the formation lap got underway.

But with less than a lap completed, Race Control took the decision to red flag proceedings due to the large amounts of spray with Norris reporting, “I can't see a lot behind the Safety Car”, as all drivers entered the pit lane.

After nearly an 80-minute delay and suspension of the starting procedure following another heavy spell of rain, the field took to the track again behind the Safety Car under bright skies and the race officially got underway.

After four laps behind the Safety Car and with standing water at a minimum, racing finally commenced on Lap 5 with Norris leading Piastri, Leclerc and Verstappen into La Source at the rolling start.

Up Eau Rouge Piastri was nailed to the back of his team mate and comfortably moved ahead along the Kemmel Straight, completing the move well before the braking zone into Les Combes.

The Australian pulled a margin of one second by the end of the lap, while further behind, Russell moved up to fifth at the expense of Albon and Stroll dropped behind both Sainz and Hamilton down to 18th.

As the two McLarens began to clear out at the head of the field, Verstappen started to mount pressure on Leclerc for P3, while the second Ferrari of Hamilton passed Sainz for 16th into the final chicane on Lap 7 as Antonelli ran deep behind.

Hamilton's charge continued, passing Colapinto around the outside into Les Combes and Hulkenberg at the final chicane on Lap 8, with Gasly his next victim on the following tour into Stavelot.

By Lap 10, Piastri's margin to Norris sat at 1.7s, the race leader reporting that slick tyres would be needed soon, with Leclerc 5.5s adrift in his battle with Verstappen as the Ferrari driver struggled for rear grip.

But having added downforce compared with the Sprint, Verstappen struggled to gain a run on Leclerc along the Kemmel Straight despite much better exits from La Source.

Hamilton became the first driver to take the plunge for slick tyres, pitting at the end of Lap 11 from P13 and the Briton was joined by Gasly, Hulkenberg and Alonso as all drivers switched to the medium compound.

The following lap, Piastri pitted from the lead for the medium tyre as Norris continued on another lap, but behind the majority of drivers also stopped, only Tsunoda, Hadjar and Ocon staying out on their used intermediates.

Ocon soon became a roadblock for Leclerc, Verstappen and Russell, the trio passing the Haas driver at high speed through Blanchimont as Norris pitted at the end of the lap.

The decision was made to switch to the hard tyre in the hope of running to the end of the race, but the Briton lost time with a small problem fitting the front-left tyre and found himself 9.1s adrift of Piastri once up to speed.

Behind, Leclerc still headed Verstappen, Russell and Albon, with Hamilton now up to P7 as less than four seconds covered the group, with Lawson, Hulkenberg and Bortoleto completing the top 10.

The two Kick Saubers swapped positions on Lap 20 at the end of the Kemmel Straight, while behind, Antonelli demoted Colapinto for P15 as Hadjar made a second stop on Lap 21, swapping the medium tyre for hards.

At the halfway point, Piastri led Norris by 8.1s but was unsure whether he could manage his medium tyres without stopping again, claiming over the radio “I think it will be tough to get to the end”.

Outside the top 10, Gasly was several seconds away from the points but had a DRS train behind him in P11 consisting of Tsunoda, Bearman, Alonso and Antonelli.

Norris lost a further second in his pursuit of Piastri, running wide at Pouhon on Lap 26, while Antonelli moved ahead of Alonso for P14 into Les Combes the next lap as Sainz in P19 received a black and white flag for track limits at Eau Rouge.

Sainz had recently pitted for a set of hard tyres along with Colapinto, as the pair joined Hadjar at the back of the field as the only drivers to have made two pit stops.

Alonso was the next to stop at the end of Lap 29, with drivers struggling to manage the medium tyres on an almost completely dry circuit, with Antonelli and Hulkenberg also feeling the need to come into the pits over the following laps.

Hulkenberg, who had pitted from P10, moved up to 14th at the expense of Ocon along the Kemmel Straight and quickly closed a gap of more than six seconds to Stroll in front.

Antonelli was next to challenge Ocon after sweeping around the outside at Les Combes, but the Frenchman was able to move back ahead through the following bend as Alonso came to challenge the pair behind.

Out front, the gap between the leading pair began to close rapidly as Norris reduced the gap to just 5.5s at the start of Lap 38, and which came down to 3.8s on Lap 41, with Piastri told to potentially expect drops of rain at La Source over the remaining laps.

A deep moment into La Source on the penultimate lap all but ended Norris' charge having brought the gap down to 3.1s, eventually finishing 3.4s behind Piastri who extends his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Leclerc was 20s adrift in third but having held off Verstappen, with Russell a lonely fifth from Albon and Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion having moved up 11 places.

Lawson, Bortoleto and Gasly completed the top 10, with Bearman just missing out on the points after passing Tsunoda, who also lost a further position to the charging Hulkenberg on fresh rubber.

Stroll, Ocon, Antonelli, Alonso, Sainz, Colapinto and Hadjar completed the order as all drivers finished in a race which featured no further cautions after the delayed start.

""I knew that Lap 1 was going to be probably my best chance of winning the race, and I got a good exit out of Turn 1 and lifted as little as I dared through Eau Rouge and then it was enough,"" said Piastri.

""The rest of the race we managed really well, struggling a little bit at the end, maybe the medium wasn't the best for the last five or six laps through last laps but we had it mostly under control, which is what I wanted. I was pretty disappointed with myself after yesterday, but turns out starting second at Spa is not too bad after all.""

F1 will travel directly from Spa-Francorchamps to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix over the weekend of August 1-3. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Piastri 'very very happy' to win at Spa after Turn 1 overtake on Norris

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc report back after Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Nico Rosberg)

Q: Wow. Charles Leclerc P3. Did you see that coming? I mean, I think you absolutely maximised it at the end there.

Charles LECLERC: Not really [I did not see it coming]. I mean, I'm very happy today. It's strange to say that because it's still three tenths and it's only a third place, but I did not expect it. We thought we were quite a lot more back. We knew that we had something more in the car obviously with the upgrade this weekend, but we still struggled yesterday. But that was a really, really good lap. I'm very happy with the lap, very happy how the car felt. So, it's good that we put everything together for quali.

Q: What'd you put it down to? Did you make some big changes or just found a better rhythm?

CL: No. I mean, obviously it takes a little bit of time to maximise those upgrades that we put on the car. So, there were a few things that we've changed, but nothing major. It was all about putting everything together and I felt comfortable with the car since FP1. So, it's good to have a qualifying where you look back and you know you haven't left anything on the table.

Q: I'm sure a podium then is your objective also for tomorrow, but you have Max Verstappen right behind you in fourth. Do you think you're going to be able to hold him behind?

CL: I don't know yet. For sure the race pace looked very strong this morning. I couldn't keep up with them. But again, with the small changes we've done, I hope that this gives us the upper hand tomorrow in the main race.

Q: Oscar, after yesterday's dominant qualifying, P1 yesterday in Sprint qualifying, today you can only manage second. Are you okay with that, or is that disappointing?

Oscar PIASTRI: A bit disappointing, yes. The second lap was coming together really well and just made a little mistake into 14 and lost a lot of time. So yeah, disappointed. Felt like the car was very good again, but it's fine margins out there. Obviously not a bad place to be starting, but I think there was more in it which is always disappointing.

Q: You're surprised also by how Lando was actually able to improve now throughout the weekend? Was he maybe learning stuff from you and looking at the data there?

OP: I don't know. I mean, I think we're a good team-mate pairing and we learn a lot from each other every weekend. That's what makes us such a good team but it also makes it difficult when you're trying to fight each other. So, I don't know. I feel like I did an okay job today, just didn't quite execute when it mattered and yeah, a bit of a shame.

Q: Being P2 on the grid then, are you actually happy that tomorrow it's looking very mixed on the weather? That could open things up and increase your chances to get one back on Lando tomorrow in the race?

OP: Yeah. I mean after the Sprint I was aiming for P2. I don't know what the weather's going to hold tomorrow. I think it's going to be quite different. So, we'll wait and see what we get. But yeah, try and have a good race.

Q: Lando, what an amazing job you did there. Great recovery also and great progress from earlier in the weekend. And that middle sector, how insane was that?

Lando NORRIS: Which one?

Q: The middle sector you put in.

LN: Oh, I don't know. Can't remember. I mean it was a decent lap, of course. So yeah, happy. I don't know. Everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple little issues that we had. So, I was confident after yesterday and confident coming into today. It's nice to see that I could get back to the top.

Q: Is there one thing you can point towards? Like yesterday you were almost five tenths off and now you're like one and a half tenths up. Where'd the improvement come from?

LN: Three tenths is just slipstream and not being first out the pit lane. So yeah, it was nothing to worry about. People like to make a lot of things up but no, I felt good. The car has been flying all weekend. Oscar's been doing a good job all weekend. So, we're pushing each other a lot like you said. It's tough because you kind of see where your strengths and weaknesses are easily and you learn from each other quickly. So, it's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute.

Q: You're the rain master from Silverstone. It's looking wet again tomorrow. You're confident though for the rain, even if it rains tomorrow?

LN: I mean I prefer it to stay dry honestly. Even for the fans. I think it's rained here for like the last ten years or something. So, it'd be nice to have a dry Sunday. But I don't mind whether it's dry or rain or whatever it is or somewhere in the middle. It's normal here and I look forward to a fun race.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Many congratulations, Lando. A wonderful lap in Q3 gave you that pole. Just talk us through it. How good was it?

LN: Yeah. Obviously, good enough for pole. I felt like my second one, I improved, just the lap time didn't. So maybe a little bit more out there, but I think nice improvement from yesterday. Just nice to be in a better position in the pack and be out there again. So, a good day. The car's been feeling great all weekend, so it's nice to have a one-two.

Q: You say the second lap in Q3 felt better. Why do you think it wasn't faster? Is it down to track temperatures?

LN: No. I just think there were a couple of corners that I must have gone slower, I guess. I don't know why. I don't see if I'm going quicker or not on my lap. Maybe Turn 1, I hit the kerb a little bit, and it's a long run after Turn 1, so probably cost myself a little bit there. And the last corner, a bit too much kerb in both of them, and I probably lost, I mean, we're talking half a tenth, touch more, and I go slower. We're talking small margins, but yeah, that's it.

Q: Lando, it's your first time in the top three on the grid here at Spa. You've just averaged 156 miles an hour. Can you describe a pole lap around here? How does it feel? Is the rhythm different to other racetracks?

LN: I think what feels nice here quite often is just when you put a new set of tyres on, it's a good step of grip. There's not more pressure it just feels like you can push that 1-2% more, and that's always a good feeling. You have Turn 9, 5-6-7, you have Pouhon, 12-13, all corners which are pretty damn quick. You try to get that balance perfect with the car, getting the lifts right. A lot of it's about timings and just getting things nailed in terms of timing. It's a fun track. No matter how good you do, you always go into the last chicane and think, ‘Okay, just get this bit right'. It's a fun track in any car. I've driven here since Formula 4, quite a bit slower in that, but in Formula 1, it's good fun. It always puts a smile on your face during qualifying, especially when you can be on top.

Q: Thank you for that. Let's throw it ahead to tomorrow, Lando. How do you think it's going to play out?

LN: It's probably going to rain. I don't know much more than that. We'll wait and see. It's Spa, so high chance of rain, but that can also mean it just sometimes hits half the track and the other half stays dry. Could be in for a Silverstone-esque chaotic race, similar to Australia or Silverstone, the ones that are sometimes a bit in the middle. Most likely some rain and drizzle. Hard to know. We're going off the front, so hopefully, I can make an advantage of that and clean air and go from there.

Q: Do you think you've got a setup on the car that will help you rain or shine?

LN: I think we have the best car, so that's the most important thing.

SPA, BELGIUM - JULY 26: Pole position qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren celebrates in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Belgium at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps on July 26, 2025 in Spa, Belgium. (Photo by Mark Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)

Q: Very well done. Thank you for that, Lando. Oscar, very well done to you as well. You said a moment ago that you lost some time at Turn 14 on that second run. What did that cost you, do you think?

OP: A lot. Enough.

Q: Enough for pole?

OP: I think so, yeah. The lap until that point was strong, but it doesn't really matter if you could have done it. I didn't. A bit disappointing. I think both laps in Q3 were a little bit like that, but that's how it goes sometimes. A bit of a shame, but the car was great again. I felt like I was in a reasonably good flow. Just didn't quite happen on the second lap.

Q: Did the car feel different to Sprint Quali yesterday?

OP: Not really, no. In all honesty, it felt very similar. You get a few more laps on softs, you
explore the limits a bit more, you push the limit a bit more maybe, and today that probably bit. But it still felt very good. I had just as much confidence as yesterday, so it definitely wasn't that.

Q: What about the race then? Hoping that Lando will cut a nice hole in the air for you on the run up to Turn 5 on that opening lap?

OP: Let's see. If it's dry, then yes. If it's wet, then it obviously adds in some other challenges, but we'll have to wait and see what the weather does first. I know what I'm hoping for.

Q: Alright, Oscar. Thank you very much. Very well done to you. Charles, great job by you as well. Just how much of a surprise is it to be in the top three for quali here?

CL: Quite big. I think we expected to be P4, but with a significant gap in front. At the end, the gap is still significant, but a little bit less than what we initially expected, so that's positive. We brought upgrades this weekend which have been working since the beginning, but we had to do some fine tunings from yesterday to today. It's going in the right direction, so I'm very happy. I think it was also a really good lap. I don't think I left much on the table with the potential we had today, so for that, I'm happy as well. However, it's only P3, so now we'll see what we can do tomorrow.

Q: You say the upgrades are going in the right direction. How different does the car feel with them?

CL: A little bit. But then I think as always, especially for our team, everything is hyped up a lot. Yes, it's an upgrade and it's a step in the right direction, but we are still speaking about very fine differences over a whole lap. So, it feels a little bit different, and it's going in the right direction. Again, that's thanks to the hard work that the whole team has done back at the factory. Unfortunately for us, McLaren has also brought a few things this weekend and seem to have done a small step in the right direction as well. So, it's very difficult to close the gap. But I think we are doing a good job as a team and we just need to keep working.

Q: And Charles, where's your battle tomorrow? Do you think you can do anything about the guys sat next to you if it's wet? Or are you going to be looking in your mirrors?

CL: Wet weather, we were speaking about it in the last race weekend. I don't think it's a strength for our car at the moment. We are really struggling. But having said that, every weekend is different. We'll learn from the past and see what's possible tomorrow. I will only be able to tell after the first few laps to see where we are. But I'll try to look forward before looking in mirrors.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Question to all three of you. It was quite obvious that Red Bull changed the setup quite a lot because of the weather forecast for tomorrow. They put on a much bigger wing. How about you three? Did you change the car setup quite a lot for tomorrow?

LN: No.

OP: Didn't change it either.

Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) One for you, Charles. As you said, the upgrade was a step in the right direction, but I'm not trying to hype it too much. Does it at least give you confidence that the second half of the year can be a little bit better than the first and perhaps that some of the limitations you've been stuck with are at least being chipped away at so that things should continue to improve?

CL: Yes and no. I think it's definitely going in the right direction once again as I was saying. However, compared to the McLaren, I think we are probably on average three or four tenths behind in qualifying. We'll do a step forward. I don't think though that we'll find those three or four tenths in that upgrade. But it will help us to get closer. The more we use it, the more we'll be able to maximize this and there'll be some more potential to gain. But no, I don't think it's enough to be able to challenge the McLaren consistently from now on.

Q: (Ian Parkes – Racing News 365) Lando, primarily, but if either of the other two, Charles or Oscar, wish to chip in, please do. After the two Turn 5 overtakes in the Sprint race, there was one overtake for the remainder of the 15 laps, and that was yours on Charles. If the race is dry, if the forecast is wrong, can we expect something similar tomorrow – just a real struggle to make a pass? Because that's the way it looked. Obviously, today the DRS just wasn't working.

LN: No. I think as soon as you start to bring in some strategy and tyre differences, especially with the C1 to the C3, C4 jump, I definitely expect more racing if it was to be dry tomorrow. The tricky thing is you're talking about the field being more compact than ever, which puts on a good show in qualifying and things are tight and thrilling and great to watch. But that often just makes it trickier at times for the racing. The gaps are smaller, you can make smaller differences from car to car and driver to driver. So, there are pros and cons in everything. The more we develop these cars, generally the trickier it becomes to overtake and to follow as well. It's never an easy one to get right. But I'm sure if it was a dry race tomorrow, I'd expect more racing. I don't expect it to be dry, so I expect just more racing and more chaos anyway. But I think sometimes there are some Sprints every now and then that are like that because everyone's pushing a bit more flat out through the race. You're thinking less of strategy. You're not thinking of doing a one or two-stop. So, we'll wait and find out.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Charles, another one for you on the upgrade. You've talked earlier this year about needing to do quite extreme things with the setup to get into a good window. Has this helped at all with that? Are you still having to go to those lengths? And what kind of comfort has this update given you?

CL: It's a little bit better. I think that's what helped me also a little bit this weekend to be a bit more consistent. The lap times in qualifying, both yesterday in Sprint Qualifying and today, came together a bit easier. That's been my strength normally, but this year I've been struggling a little bit more to put everything together in qualifying. This weekend seems to be better, but we just need to prove that over multiple race weekends because it's also… I mean, the grip this weekend here is incredible. There's so much grip – but that's not only for us, but I also think for everybody. Generally, this makes it easier. So, we'll have to prove that on a track that is a bit trickier.

Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil). Question to Oscar. Considering what we saw today in the Sprint race, can we say that Spa-Francorchamps has kind of two pole positions because in the front row you have a very strong chance to attack in Turn 3?

OP: In the dry, potentially. But there have also been times where pole has maintained the lead – unfortunately, not this morning. It's probably the hardest track to maintain the lead on the calendar from the start. If the weather is wet though, I think pole position is an advantage, but it also depends on how wet it is. Whether Eau Rouge is flat or not makes a big difference.

Plus: Alex Warren, Ozzy Osbourne, Jessie Murph and BTS shake-up the top 10.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



Tyler, The Creator scores his fourth No. 1, all earned consecutively, on the Billboard 200 albums chart as his latest album, DON'T TAP THE GLASS, debuts atop the tally (dated Aug. 2). The set launches with 197,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending July 24, according to Luminate.

	











	After teasing a new project on social media, the artist announced the album on Friday, July 18, with a release date slated for an off-cycle Monday, July 21. In turn, the album arrives on the Billboard 200 with only four days of activity in its first tracking week toward the chart. Most albums are released on Friday of each week; Luminate's tracking week for the chart runs Friday through Thursday. (It's the second off-cycle release in a row to debut at No. 1, following the JACKBOYS 2 project a week ago, which dropped on a Sunday.)


	More than half of DON'T TAP THE GLASS' first-week activity is owed to album sales (it's the top-selling album of the week with 128,000 sold). Those sales are largely from five physical offerings exclusively sold via the artist's official webstore (a vinyl LP, CD and three deluxe boxed sets containing a piece of branded clothing and a copy of the CD). The five physical sets went up for sale in the webstore shortly after the album's announcement. All physical versions of the album contained one bonus track as compared to the standard 10-song widely available digital download and streaming edition of the album.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Tyler, The Creator previously topped the chart with CHROMAKOPIA (2024), CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST (2021) and IGOR (2019). In total, GLASS is Tyler, The Creator's eighth top 10-charted effort, the entirety of his charting titles on the Billboard 200.


	Elsewhere in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Alex Warren hits the top 10 for the first time with You'll Be Alright, Kid; the late Ozzy Osbourne is remembered as The Essential Ozzy Osbourne jumps 134-7 (marking his 10th top 10); Jessie Murph collects her first top 10 with the arrival of Sex Hysteria; and BTS notches its eighth top 10 with the bow of PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE (LIVE). 


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 2, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 29. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Of DON'T TAP THE GLASS' 197,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 24, album sales comprise 128,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart), SEA units comprise 69,000 (equaling 93.34 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 4 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.

	











	Morgan Wallen's chart-topping I'm the Problem bumps 3-2 on the latest Billboard 200, earning 142,000 equivalent album units (down 4% — though it returns to No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums for a ninth nonconsecutive week on top). The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack rises 5-3 (89,000; up 5%) and JACKBOYS and Travis Scott's JACKBOYS 2 falls 1-4 in its second week (78,000; down 66%).


	Alex Warren hits the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the first time as You'll Be Alright, Kid jumps 19-5 after it was expanded with 10 added songs. The set earned 73,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week (up 207%). Of that sum, SEA units comprise 59,000 (up 157%, equaling 80.19 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it moves 15-5 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 13,000 (up 9,483% — it debuts at No. 7 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 71%).


You'll Be Alright, Kid includes Warren's smash single “Ordinary,” which has spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart (through the most recently published list, dated July 26). The expanded album's sales got a boost from its availability across five vinyl variants (including a signed editions) and two CD editions (one of them signed).


	Justin Bieber's SWAG shifts 2-6 in its second week on the Billboard 200, earning 72,000 equivalent album units (down 55%).


The Essential Ozzy Osbourne vaults 134-7 the Billboard 200, following Osbourne's death on July 22. The best-of collection reaches the top 10 for the first time (it previously peaked at No. 81 in 2003, the year it was released) and marks the 10th top 10-charted set for the late metal god. Essential earned nearly 44,000 equivalent album units in the July 18-24 tracking week (up 309%). Of that sum, SEA units comprise 35,000 (up 287%, equaling 48.70 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 9 on Top Streaming Albums), TEA units comprise 6,000 (up 888%) and album sales comprise 3,000 (up 197% — it re-enters at No. 30 on Top Album Sales).

	











	Osbourne previously hit the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with Patient Number 9 (No. 3 in 2022), Ordinary Man (No. 3, 2020), Scream (No. 4, 2010), Black Rain (No. 3, 2007), Down to Earth (No. 4, 2001), Ozzmosis (No. 4, 1995), No More Tears (No. 7, 1991), Tribute (with Randy Rhoads, No. 6 in 1987) and The Ultimate Sin (No. 6, 1986). Osbourne was also the longtime frontman for Black Sabbath, which claimed two top 10s: 13 (No. 1 in 2013) and Master of Reality (No. 8, 1971).


	Jessie Murph achieves her first top 10 on the Billboard 200 as Sex Hysteria debuts at No. 8 with 44,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that figure, SEA units comprise 35,000 (equaling 48.23 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 10 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 9,000 (it debuts at No. 10 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


Sex Hysteria is the third-charted project for Murph on the Billboard 200, following That Ain't No Man That's the Devil (No. 24 in 2024) and Drowning (No. 162 in 2023). The new album was preceded by a pair of Hot 100 hits in “Blue Strips” (her highest-charted song and first top 20, hitting No. 15 in May) and “Touch Me Like a Gangster” (No. 56 in June).


Sex Hysteria was issued as a 13-song widely available digital download album, a 15-song version (widely available as a download and on streamers; it includes two additional tracks: “Donuts” with Gucci Mane and “Ain't But a Thing”) and a 15-song physical version (on CD and vinyl, with two additional tracks: “Ur a Bitch” and “No Chance”).

Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and lucky fans to unveil her tracklist.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Sabrina Carpenter has taken the notion of “man's best friend” quite literally in the weeks leading up to her seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend. 


	Set for release on Aug. 29 via Island Records, the LP's rollout has been anything but ordinary: Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and a pair of lucky fans to unveil her tracklist, two songs at a time, in a series of Instagram and Twitter posts that combined star power with canine cuteness.

	











	About a month after announcing the album, Carpenter began the tracklist reveal on July 23 by introducing track 12, “Goodbye,” alongside a photo of fan Mariah cradling the puppy in her arms. In her caption she wrote, “track #12 is ‘Goodbye' but mariah is helping us say hello to our tracklist reveal.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Two days later, Carpenter returned to the pup brigade to share track 11 — “House Tour” — featuring fan Neriah in a similar snapshot, captioned “neriah & a golden = home sweet home. track #11 is ‘House Tour.'” Both posts drew hundreds of thousands of likes, with fans applauding the innovative, heartwarming approach.


	Carpenter then took to X to amplify the moment, reposting excited reactions from @overdosedontun (“omggg sabrina asked me to reveal track 11 ‘House Tour' from Man's Best Friend !!!”) and urging fellow fans to rally: “Track 11 stans rise.” Beyond the puppy reveals, Carpenter has maintained momentum for Man's Best Friend by leaning into playful fan interaction and capitalizing on her comedic timing — qualities that have earned her more than 5 million Instagram followers and built genuine community around her music.

	











	In the days that followed, titles “Don't Worry I'll Make You Happy” (track 10), “Go Go Juice” (track 9) and “When Did You Get Hot?” (track 8), and “Never Getting Laid” (track 7) were unveiled, with the countdown expected to continue.


	The forthcoming album follows 2024's Short n' Sweet and arrives amid Carpenter's latest lead single, “Manchild,” released on June 5. Man's Best Friend will drop almost exactly a year after Carpenter released breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. So far, fans have gotten to hear only one song from the new record — “Manchild,” which dropped in June and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking Carpenter's second-ever No. 1 song.


	In keeping with the album's canine theme, Man's Best Friend is available to preorder in multiple formats, including a Jacob Rochester–painted picture disc that depicts Carpenter in a surreal tableau beside a suited figure.

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Vanessa Kirby, much to her surprise, had no trouble committing to the sprawling MCU as she was cast in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, where she portrays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in Marvel Studios‘ official launch of Phase Six.


	During a recent interview with Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast, The Crown alumna talked about falling in love with the famed comic book character and what it's been like reprising the role for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.


	“When this one came around, I was so genuinely moved by the fact that this was a woman who was pregnant and was a new mother, and also has these superpowers,” Kirby said. “It helped me ground it in something — to try and understand what it would be like to have both those things happening at the same time was a challenge, but I was grateful for that because it rooted it in this kind of domesticity, in this family and home, which made it easier.”

	For the role, Kirby did not audition, first meeting with helmer Matt Shakman over lunch and later on top brass Kevin Feige. The actress said she was excited to mine the “counterculture and super meaningful” '60s comic book era to bring the character to life, adding that because of Sue Storm's expansive journey she didn't have any trepidation agreeing to future MCU pipeline projects.

	“With this, I actually didn't have that, and I'm surprised to say that,” the Pieces of a Woman star explained. “I think it was because I really liked her so much and because I'd read so many of the comics and she goes through so many different iterations. She becomes Malice, this really dark version of herself for quite a long time, and then she renames herself Invisible Woman having been called Invisible Girl and she goes off with Psycho-Man, like her history is incredible, so I felt like there's so much there to even [explore] psychologically. I mean, she has a stillborn, and people don't know that. She's gone through a lot.”

	











	More importantly, Kirby said she felt confident continuing her collaboration with the superhero studio alongside her fellow First Steps co-stars Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach: “I knew I wouldn't be without these three actors, and these three actors have genuinely become family, and I admired them so much, and I knew that we're a four and the four in the comics are never separated, so I assumed that we'd be together, and that really helped 'cause then you're not a lone ranger going to new, daunting environments.”


	Speaking to the much-hyped Doomsday, Kirby said more shoots are on the way: “I'm loving it, absolutely loving it. It's been a complete privilege,” she said of filming, which she is doing while pregnant, adding that it's the “coolest” experience.


	Shakman previously spoke to Deadline about how his MCU entry is able to “pass the baton” to the Joe and Anthony Russo-directed 2026 movie. Though plot details are currently tightly under wraps, audiences can expect the tentpole to center on supervillain and Fantastic Four arch nemesis Dr. Doom (Robert Downey Jr.).


	“[The Russo Brothers] describe it like they're making a recipe of different ingredients, and it's unbelievable that these Avengers movies work in such a beautiful way,” Kirby said. “You look at Infinity War and you've got all these different energies but somehow they all fuse together, and I remember them saying the first one they had no idea if any of them would go together, and it just works. It's quite exciting to be a part of something and go, ‘OK, this is my flavor, I don't know.' It's in their hands to work out what flavors go with what and how and where and there's a surrender in that.”


	Lauding Downey Jr.'s leadership onscreen, Kirby said: “He's the most incredible human being, soulful, deep, kind — he's been an amazing leader to us considering we're the newbies, and a lot of the others have known this world for a really long time, and he's been a phenomenal leader, and also he's just doing the most amazing work.”


	In addition to the quartet from First Steps and Downey Jr., confirmed cast members include Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Letitia Wright, Florence Pugh, Simu Liu, Tom Hiddleston, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Danny Ramirez, Hannah John-Kamen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Channing Tatum, Tenoch Huerta Mejía and Lewis Pullman.

	Following the animated return of Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s Dutch to the Predator franchise, the actor could soon reprise the role in a live-action capacity.


	During Friday's Predator: Badlands panel at Comic-Con, director Dan Trachtenberg teased the Hall H audience that he's planning to “cook up stuff for that guy” after a recent breakfast meeting with the Golden Globe-winning actor and former governor of California.


	Schwarzenegger starred in the original John McTiernan-helmed Predator (1987) as Major Alan ‘Dutch' Schaefer, who encounters the titular extraterrestrial with his paramilitary team during a rescue mission in a Central American rainforest.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Although the franchise has expanded to nine movies over the years—including two crossovers with the Alien franchise and the upcoming Badlands, premiering Nov. 7 in theaters—Schwarzenegger has yet to reprise his role.


	Following the release last month of the franchise's first animated installment, Predator: Killer of Killers, Trachtenberg debuted an epilogue scene from a new cut now streaming on Hulu, featuring Schwarzenegger's Dutch, Danny Glover‘s Lt. Mike Harrigan from Predator 2 (1990) and Amber Midthunder‘s Naru from Prey (2022), each in a floating coffin being carried by Predator warriors.


	Trachtenberg noted that he got Schwarzenegger's approval to use his likeness in the scene during their breakfast meeting.


	Marking Trachtenberg's third installment in the franchise after Prey and Killer of Killers, Predator: Badlands stars Elle Fanning in a story said to examine an unlikely allyship between her character, Thia, and a young Predator outcast from his clan on a remote planet.

So many iterations of Predator and the only good movie to this day is the first one.

No, dude, Predator 2 is awesome. 

“You can't see the eyes of da demon…until him come calling. This is dread, man. Truly dread.”

Most of them aren't great, but Prey absolutely rocked.

	Despite a stacked list of celeb cameos, one of Saturday Night Live‘s original ‘Not Ready for Primetime Players' opted to skip the show's 50th anniversary.


	After the comedian was notably absent from SNL50: The Anniversary Special, Dan Aykroyd revealed why he missed out on the milestone celebration with his fellow NBC sketch comedy alums in February.


	“I wanted to be at home and I wanted to watch the show beginning to end,” he recently explained to Entertainment Weekly.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I knew if i was there, I'd be in a dressing room, I'd be working. I wanted to see it live,” added Aykroyd. “I'm a fan of the show today, and I watch it all the time. I love these new players; I think they're just great. I just wanted to see and live nostalgically with my family in my own home, eating my own popcorn.”

	











	Aykroyd previously praised Lorne Michaels' programming as “triumphant” after watching the anniversary special and SNL50: The Homecoming Concert.


	“All Heads up toasting triumphant SNL 50th,” wrote Aykroyd on X at the time. “Advantage of not attending – got to see every second of concert and show on TV. Quote from my children: ‘Look at daddy's smile!' Had it from start to finish. Congratulations Lorne. Well done as usual.”


	Aykroyd — who appeared on SNL from its inaugural season in 1975 to 1979 and also originated such characters as the Coneheads and the Festrunk Brothers — was referenced several times during the anniversary weekend.

	











	Sans Aykroyd, the OG SNL cast members took a bow with Michaels during February's special, which saw 14.8 million viewers across Peacock and NBC.

	While many in the late-night community are standing by Stephen Colbert, one veteran host has a different perspective.


Jay Leno recently commented on the political comedy of today's late-night hosts after The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was unceremoniously canceled at CBS, amid the network's dealings with Donald Trump.


	“I like to think that people come to a comedy show to kind of get away from the things, you know, the pressures of life, whatever it might be,” he told David Trulio, president and CEO of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. “I love political humor, don't get me wrong, but it's just what happens when people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Noting that he “never discussed” politics with close friend and frequent guest Rodney Dangerfield, Leno said, “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture. When I was with Rodney, it was always in the economy of words — get to the joke as quickly as possible.”


	Leno added, “Well, why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole [audience]? I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group, you know, or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support or whatever, but just do what's funny.”


	Meanwhile, Paramount is under fire for canceling The Late Show on the heels of the company's $16M settlement with Trump, which has been scrutinized as potential bribery by some lawmakers. Following Colbert's ongoing jokes at the president's expense, Trump has celebrated the talk show's demise.


	Leno hosted NBC's The Tonight Show from 1992 to 2014, with the exception of when he left to film his short-lived primetime talk show The Jay Leno Show from 2009 to 2010.

Ok Boomer

…get to the joke as quickly as possible.”

That explains why he was never funny. I watched a handful of episodes of his Tonight Show and couldn't stand it. Every time he asked a question of his guests, you could see it on his face, he had the joke written and was just waiting for them to stop talking so he could say some unfunny, obvious, banal quip to get a cheap laugh. Watch clips, you'll see. 

And yes, he made plenty of Clinton jokes but call out HIS president and, “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture…” Hypocrite. He was a magat mouthpiece before maga was a thing. Now he's just a tired old hack.

is he kidding? the dude ONLY mocked democrats. EVER. and he did it every night.

“…it was in the economy of words…getnto the joken as soon as possible.” (cue the dancing Judge Itos)

Nobody asked him. He's irrelevant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Nintendo denies Mario and Peach are hooking up, basically daring internet to prove otherwise","https://www.avclub.com/nintendo-denies-mario-and-peach-are-hooking-up","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 01:18:00 GMT","

Nintendo has always been weirdly cagey about the personal details of its most iconic characters—to the point that you have to catch one of the company's executives on a very good day if you want them to confirm something as simple as whether Mario is Italian, a plumber, or has the last name “Mario.” When it comes to actual romantic connections between its characters, the Japanese firm is even more uptight, something it displayed aggressively this week, when it reminded fans that its iconic turtle-killing problem solver and his favorite unelected head of state, Princess Peach, are just friends—all but daring the wider internet to go “Oh, yeah?”

Nintendo made the announcement through the normal public relations outlets, which is to say that it came as a daily tooltip on the company's weird Nintendo Today! digital calendar app that it launched back in March. Users were informed recently that “Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can,” which, when received in a normal brain, probably feels like a fairly anodyne statement. But we're talking about a fanbase that has done anatomical analyses on things like Mario's briefly glimpsed nipples, so suffice it to say historians were quick to comb through the evidence to try to refute this “good friends” slander. (Nintendo put out a Valentine's Day tweet a scant 15 years ago featuring the pair together, for instance, and referred to them as “Cutest Couple” in Mario Party 5. Also, Peach kisses Mario on the cheek or nose quite a lot, usually as a transactional reward for having rescued her—although it's worth noting that Super Mario Odyssey ends with her rejecting a marriage proposal from him and stranding him on the moon. So, y'know, mixed signals.)

Honestly, we get it: The folks in the Mario group of characters are, by design, pretty blank slates, designed to have little in the way of history or personality traits that would stop them from being dropped into new games and scenarios sans baggage. Establishing a canonical romance, even for its most obvious pairing, would get in the way of the characters' mix-and-match nature, and maybe screw with some of Nintendo's cherished “identify as the character” mentality. That being said, the only Nintendo fans who seem especially happy about the no-hook-ups ruling are the ones who were already ‘shipping these characters with someone else—the Peach/Daisy people have been eating well this weekend, from what we've seen on Bluesky—at least partly because it seems kind of disingenuous, given how much the pair have been depicted in such close proximity for so long. (It also feels weirdly timed, at a moment when video game marketplaces Steam and itch.io both announced that they were clamping down on games with sexual content or themes in order to appease credit card companies; Nintendo's never been at the forefront of sexuality in gaming, but there's still a mild vibe of “Hold our beer, our characters have never even kissed on the mouth” to the whole thing.)

We did, in our capacity as journalists, run a quick tags search on internet fan-fiction archive A03—kind of the “checking the dipstick” of gauging internet horniness for character pairings—this evening, and will note that Mario/Peach massively outranks any other duo we could think of. (And some we wish we hadn't; shout out to the 129 Luigi/Mario fics in the pile, and their let's say controversial definitions of brotherly love.) So there is at least some clear indication that a lot of people naturally slot the pair into coupledom. Anyway: Here's your regular reminder that Nintendo can never touch the erotic mindscapes inside your own head; if you want Mario and Peach to have been long-term monogamous for the last 40 years, drive yourself wild, friend.

Emma Heming Willis is once again using her voice to protect her family. As speculation around “The Sixth Sense” star Bruce Willis continues to spread online, she is making sure to let fans know that certain reports are not fact. 

In a strongly worded Instagram Story, Heming Willis urged her followers to avoid stories that begin with phrases like “sources close to the family say.” She followed that with a direct message to the press, writing, “To any outlet that runs with those kinds of stories, do better. Giving a platform to anonymous speculation is not only careless, it's harmful.”

She ended the post with a single inspirational word: “Onward.”

The message comes as gossip headlines about “Die Hard” actor Bruce Willis continue to circulate. Since his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in 2023, tabloids and entertainment sites have regularly published stories citing unnamed insiders, often without confirmation from the family. Heming Willis has now made it clear where she stands on that kind of reporting.

A post shared by The Open Field (@openfieldbooks)

This is not the first time Heming Willis has spoken out. Over the past year, she has used her platform to raise awareness about frontotemporal dementia and to advocate for respect and accuracy in coverage. Her latest comments continue that mission.

Supporters quickly responded to her message, praising her for standing up for her family's privacy. Many fans also echoed her call for higher standards in celebrity reporting.

Bruce Willis, known for his iconic roles in “Die Hard,” “Pulp Fiction,” and “The Sixth Sense,” stepped away from acting in 2022. He and Emma share two daughters. He also has three daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore, who has remained actively supportive of the entire family.

Emma Heming Willis did not just post a warning. She drew a clear line between fact and fiction, and reminded readers to think twice before believing what anonymous voices have to say.

George Lucas might be more responsible for the kind of fandom found at San Diego Comic-Con than any other single filmmaker. In the 48 years since “Star Wars,” film franchises have been folded into the SDCC vibes, taking the event far beyond the comic books for which it was established. “Star Wars” itself has very quickly ventured into the comic realm after its 1977 release, and the big-time fans that the film birthed are the kind that buy tickets to the cascade of con panels annually.

So, suffice to say, Lucas' very first ever appearance at Comic-Con was a hot ticket, though he appeared not to discuss his career or the legacy of “Star Wars” nor his thoughts on the Disney spin-offs or his early classic “American Graffiti” or producing “Indiana Jones.” Instead, Lucas was previewing his long in development museum, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which is set to open next year — a one-year delay from its original schedule. At the panel, held on July 27 and moderated by Queen Latifah, Lucas called the museum “a temple to the people's art.”

“I think it's more about a connection — an emotional connection — with the work, not how much it cost or what celebrity did it or whatever,” Lucas said at the panel.” It's more a personal thing, and I don't think it's anything that anybody else can tell you, ‘That's art, that's not.' It doesn't work that way. If you have an emotional connection, then that's art.”

The museum, located in Los Angeles' Exposition Park — will be — according to its website — “an 11-acre campus with extensive new green space” that will feature a 300,000-square-foot building with “expansive galleries, two state-of-the-art theaters, and dedicated spaces for learning and engagement, dining, retail, and events.” At the panel, Lucas showcased several pieces that will be part of the opening exhibits (via DiscussingFilm), including drawings from the original “Iron Man” comic, a “Black Panther” ink splash, vintage “Peanuts” sketches, the first 1934 drawing of the character Flash Gordon, concept art for Indiana Jones, Frida Kahlo paintings, and a life-size Naboo starfighter, among many other items.

“I've been collecting art since I was in college and when I was in college which was sort of near the Stone Age, I couldn't really afford real art,” Lucas explained, appearing alongside fellow storytellers, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and film designer Doug Chiang. “I love all art no matter what it is. But I could afford comic art because in those days it was underground.”

The museum will also have two theaters, a library, an event space, and 33 galleries, including one of exhibit that will include the earliest forms of narrative art: the mythological Greek, Roman, and Egyptian gods. 

 










The new venture is the kind of bold swing that only a true original, like Lucas, would make  — highlighting, he said, the unsung storytellers. As he explained, “Just from my experience of making movies and things, that other people's opinions don't mean much,” he explained. “The only thing that really means something is what you do and what you feel about it.”

Last week on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Steve Buscemi — from… well, everything — revealed that long before he was famous, he often found himself in rooms with casting agents and directors unable to connect at all.

“I was always hot and cold,” Buscemi explained. “I never knew if I should wing it, cause sometimes I'd be good if I went in the room and I didn't really prepare. And then, the next time I'd do it, I would fail.”

And Buscemi has auditioned for the best of the best — including “Rain Man” filmmaker Barry Levinson when he was working on the 1987 movie “Tin Men.” He decided he had to “really prepare” for the meeting. “And I studied the sides, the script, and went in there and did my reading… did my audition, and he looked at me and went, ‘That was really good. That's really good, Steve. Alright. Let's do it again, but this time try it…' and he gave me a very specific note.”

Buscemi listen and took the note. He was ready for another try. “And then I read it again the exact same way I just did,” he chuckled. “There was this silence and we both just looked at each other. I think I even said, ‘That was the same, wasn't it?' And he said, ‘Yeah, it's OK, it's OK.' Needless to say, I did not get that part.”

 










Another time he auditioned for EGOT-winner Mike Nichols and casting director Juliet Taylor, even though he knew he had a conflict. “My agent at the time said, ‘No, no, no. Just go. When are you gonna have an opportunity to meet these people?” So off Bescemi went, and he killed it… but when he revealed he couldn't make the shooting dates, Taylor stared at him and said, “What is wrong with you?”

Of course, Buscemi has proven himself several times over — enough to impress the Emmys (he has one on eight nominations) — in such diverse projects as “Fargo,” “30 Rock,” “Reservoir Dogs,” and “Boardwalk Empire.” It's a resume that doesn't need regurgitating. He's become such a recognizable face, in fact, he can play himself on “The Studio” in a season that also had cameos from legends like Martin Scorsese and Charlize Theron, also playing themselves.

Buscemi is far from the only famous actor to struggle with an audition — even a now-A-lister like Hugh Jackman, who has since gone from Wolverine to “The Music Man,” bungled what might've been his big break: the Benjamin Bratt role in “Miss Congeniality” — an experienced he described as “humiliating.”

“No one knew X-Men yet. I was a nobody,” Jackson once told Variety, though in spite of his unknown status he had the opportunity to shoot his audition with Sandra Bullock. He recalled thinking, “‘Holy shit! She's amazing! And so quick and fast. I'm not even vaguely up to speed here.' I was pedaling as fast as I could, but I didn't know the script well enough.”

 










Years before her own series “Girls” made her a household name, Lena Dunham auditioned for Penny Marshall's 2001 film “Riding in Cars With Boys,” and it did not go well… though not in a traumatic way.

“When I was 12, I met Penny Marshall in a failed audition for a film, ‘Riding in Cars With Boys.' And that was really big for me,” Dunham related on “The Jess Cagle Show.” “I was treated actually really well. There was no cruelty. The only thing I'll say is I understand why I didn't get the role.

Dunham explained that Marshall asked each of the young performers to tell her their names, heights, where they were from, and… then… to smile. “And I said, I'm Lena, I'm from New York, and I don't smile on command.' And Penny Marshall said, ‘It's called acting, honey.'”

Dunham, now an experienced director (whose “Good Sex” is filming now with Natalie Portman, Meg Ryan, and Mark Ruffalo), now sees things Marshall's way. “The thing is, she was right,” Dunham said. “Would you hire an actor who is like I'm sorry, I can't smile on command?' The thing is, I'm with Penny on this one.”

You win some. You lose some. You learn some.

The writers and executives producers of “And Just Like That…” Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky were not exactly expecting the audience reaction when Lisa Todd Wexley's (Nicole Ari Parker) father died… for seemingly the second time. After all in the first season, Lisa literally said, “I was exactly the same when my father died last year.” In the current season, years later, her father (Billy Dee Williams) died again, and she attended the funeral. HBO quickly explained this time her real father died and before it was her stepfather, and Rottenberg and Zuritsky told THR that it was a sign of just how lower the viewers are.

“That was surprising to me,” Zuritsky said. “It's the close viewing, but that comes back to the relationship that people have with the show.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






“You want close viewers,” Rottenberg added. “We know our viewers are smart and paying attention, and you want that. Then sometimes, the thing that you wish people would pay attention to, they don't. You just never know. It's sort of like being a parent. You bring these children into the world and then you hope for the best. And then you're lucky enough, as we are, to have a big audience, a very passionate and expressive audience who is not afraid to express their feelings.”

 










It's funny to think that a couple decades ago, before social media drove a flutter of easily accessible and highly public discourse around any given series, that a slip-up (or an assumed slip-up) might not have even been noticed. Or, if it was noticed, few fans would've bothered to write a letter to the network.

As any true binge-watcher of classic television knows — and I guess TV‘s classical period is now just simply defined as pre-streaming — inconsistencies once happened the regular. Continuity, particular in episodic television, wasn't that important —especially it retconning helped facilitate a good guest spot or a new regular when a show goes south.

“The Golden Girls” is probably one of the worst offenders of the top tier of TV. Consider this: Dorothy and Stan had to get married right out of high school because Dorothy got pregnant with their daughter Kate, who appears to be 30-ish when we meet her in a 1985 episode. But Dorothy and Stan have been divorced for several years and were married for 38 years. Make that math work.

And how many kids did Blanche have? She lists five at one point, we do meet a couple (including one who gets recast on her second appearance). But how did she raise all those kids to then be an empty nester by the time the show started in 1985… and still have caused a supposed ruckus as a single woman at the 1964 Democratic Convention only 21 years prior?

 










But we can't just pick on our favorite Miami ladies. There's also “Family Matters,” who stole a page from the “Happy Days” playbook and deleted a child from the family after multiple seasons (Judy and Chuck, respectively). It's also extremely unclear as to when Tom and Lynette moved to Wisteria Lane in “Desperate Housewives.” Why did Topanga's parents keep getting recast on “Boy Meets World?” The “That 70's Show” timeline makes no sense. And on the dad subject, Dr. Frasier Crane's father was dead on “Cheers,” and very clearly alive on “Frasier.”

“Sex and the City” itself was inconsistent — I mean, why doesn't Carrie break the fourth wall like she did in the beginning?

The point is, if it matters, that even if “And Just Like That” really intended a retcon, there is plenty of precedent to rewrite a story point mid-series. We just didn't have the vast resources to notice in the olden days.

And what's a continuity error between friends? Or even on “Friends” (don't get me started on their shifting birthdays or the number of times Rachel met Chandler in flashback episodes).

	Peter Wade



Donald Trump turned a press availability in Scotland that was supposed to be focused on a trade deal with the European Union into a long list of his personal grudges against windmills, the Jeffrey Epstein case, Democrats, and Gaza.


	Appearing alongside E.U. President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said the U.S. and E.U. have a “good chance” of reaching a trade deal. But he also addressed a wide range of topics, ranting so much that one reporter asked “why” he was in a “bad mood.”


	“Can I ask why you're in a bad mood? Was it a bad morning of golf?” the reporter asked.


	“No,” Trump said. “The golf was beautiful.”


	But while playing his round of golf at his Turnberry course (during which it appears he may have cheated), Trump caught sight of windmills he has long hated, having fought and lost a battle against their installation in the waters off his Scotland course. That could explain why he went on an extended anti-windmill rant on Sunday.


	“Today, I'm playing the best course I think in the world, Turnberry,” he said. “Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world. And I look over the horizon and I see nine windmills at the end of the 18th [hole]. I say, isn't that a shame?”

	Trump also resurfaced one of his false claims: that windmills cause whales to go crazy and die.


	“You have a certain place in the Massachusetts area that over the last 20 years had one or two whales wash ashore,” Trump said. “And over the last short period of time they had 18. OK? Because it's driving them loco. No, windmills will not happen in the United States.”

	











	“The other thing I say to Europe: We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They are killing us,” he said.


	In April 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy dispelled that misinformation. “As of now, there is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys,” the  agency wrote.

	Trump, who launched his political career on the unfounded conspiracy theory that former president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., also accused the Democrats of promoting “conspiracy theories and nonsense.”


	“One year ago, our country was dead… because of an incompetent president and incompetent Democrats,” he said, “All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense. If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer, so much easier — be very successful.”

	Trump at first tried to avoid the topic of Gaza. When asked, “What do the images of starving kids in Gaza make you feel?” he responded, “Well, it's terrible. People are stealing the food. I think Iran is acting up. Venezuela is acting up in a different way. They continue to send people that we rebuff to our border.”


	Asked again about food for Gaza and whether Israel should allow more food across the border, Trump whined that the U.S. has not been thanked for sending aid. 


	“You really want to at least have somebody say ‘Thank you!'” Trump said. “We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food to Gaza. And nobody acknowledged it. Nobody talks about it. And it makes you feel a little bad when you do that… Nobody gave but us, and nobody said, ‘Gee, thank you very much.' It'd be nice to at least have a thank you.”

	Israel has recently begun allowing food parcels to be air dropped into Gaza, but a recent drop injured at least 11 Palestinians when those aid pallets fell on top of tents where displaced people are living. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned last week that “conditions on the ground in Gaza are already catastrophic and deteriorating fast — with death, displacement and destruction continuing to be reported as a result of ongoing Israeli military operations. The starvation crisis is deepening across the Strip. Hunger and malnutrition increase the risk of illnesses that weaken the immune system, especially among women, children, older people, and those with disabilities or chronic diseases. The consequences can turn deadly fast.”

	











	But Trump appeared more worried about who hasn't thanked him for millions in food aid than starving Gazans.

	Trump claimed the U.S. sent $60 million in food aid a couple weeks ago, although the details are not clear. According to The Guardian, the U.S. sent a $30 million grant to the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has been associated with food distribution sites where the Israeli military has shot and killed hundreds of people seeking aid.


	“It was pushed through over the technical and ethical objections of career staff,” a source told the publication. Sources told The Guardian that GHF may be receiving $30 million per month from the U.S. to fund its operations in Gaza.


	When asked about the topic he is in Europe to address — tariffs — he said he would not budge on the proposed rate of 15 percent.

	Call me crazy, but I have certain expectations of any establishment calling itself a “diner.” In general, I shouldn't have to wait for a seat. The interior ambiance should be warm and welcoming, with comfortable booths — perhaps with their padding slightly worn from years of visits from loyal customers. I should be able to order off a laminated menu, from a waiter or waitress with an easy tableside manner. The food should not be overthought or trendy, just a spread of classic American fare, with a few specialties particular to the region. And I should leave with the sense that I have been well fed at a reasonable price.


	The new Tesla Diner on the western edge of Hollywood, the long-delayed realization of a whim from CEO Elon Musk, does not meet these basic criteria. In some ways, of course, that can't be helped: When I showed up at 1 p.m. on Thursday, the restaurant's fourth day of supposedly 24/7 operation, there was line of families, tourists, and Tesla enthusiasts eager to check the place out wrapping all the way around the block. People circled the building recording videos with their phones mounted on selfie sticks. One fellow wore a Back to the Future shirt that featured a Cybertruck in place of the iconic DeLorean, and Musk as Marty McFly.

	











	“Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA,” Musk tweeted in 2018, long before his transformation into a misinformation superspreader and Trump megadonor. Just ahead of the launch seven years later, the Tesla CEO declared the finished restaurant to be “one of the coolest spots in LA!” He also posted on X that Tesla aimed to open up other diners in “major cities around the world,” and that the company's Optimus robots would be serving food to customers in their Teslas by next year — though he soon deleted that last and most dubious claim. Nonetheless, a grand opening demo of an Optimus serving popcorn led many to believe that the bots would have customer-facing jobs, despite engineers on site confirming that this one was remotely operated by a person, not moving independently. As usual, Musk's hype had driven expectations to unreasonable highs.

	Earlier in the week, I had seen a lone protester outside the diner with a sign that said “Workers Should Have the Power — Not the Billionaires.” On Thursday afternoon, there was no anti-oligarch activism afoot, only excitement and anticipation. A friend who, like me, grew up in the fine diner culture of New Jersey, joined me at the end of the queue, which lasted an hour and a half. Periodically, an employee came through and asked if anyone waiting was currently charging their Teslas in the parking lot; the few who were received complicated instructions on how to order from their cars, either for delivery to the vehicle or to pick up inside when the food was ready. I was supposed to have my own Tesla for this visit, but because Hertz does not feel bound to honor its rental reservations — that's a review for another time — we were, like so many others, lowly walk-ins unable to accelerate service. In the meantime, we were advised that we could see the menu at TeslaDiner.com. The URL led to a blank webpage.


	The two-story diner is clearly meant to give the impression of an alien spacecraft, though it's an awfully generic one — not up to Disneyland standards, anyway. Outside, it's flanked by a pair of four-story movie screens (unbelievably, one of them totally blocks the windows and balconies of a neighboring apartment building, where residents must be furious) that play space-themed Looney Tunes cartoons, old sci-fi movies, Cybertruck ads, SpaceX launches, and abstract laser patterns, usually at low resolution and with the wrong aspect ratio. Very few of the parking spaces face either screen, as they would in the traditional drive-in theater Musk had apparently envisioned. Noise concerns had been downplayed with promises that sound would beam directly into parked Tesla vehicles, but an episode of The Jetsons blared in the summer air as we turned the corner toward the diner entrance.

	Once inside, you immediately place your order not with the cashiers at the registers but on one of the touchscreens right in front them. Much of the mixed seating (stools, booths, and outside tables upstairs) sat empty, presumably as the kitchen would've been unable to contend with a full house, which also explained the staggered entry. The space was loud and chaotic anyway, with much of the staff squeezed into a narrow aisle between the kitchen and the counter and having a difficult time moving past one another. We opted for some uncomfortable counter stools while we waited for our food so we could watch them scurry about as celebrity chef Eric Greenspan, who has competed on TV shows like Iron Chef and Guy's Grocery Games and developed MrBeast Burger, stood at the kitchen window, shouting out items missing from orders. When not managing workflow problems, he was vexed by a quirk of the menu: People were ordering the “lettuce burger,” not realizing it came without a bun, then asking for a bun. Greenspan pulled over an employee who was evidently on site for tech troubleshooting and demanded that he edit the menu to say “no bun” to prevent any further confusion.

	











	We had decided to sample the imaginatively named Tesla burgers, as well as fries (made in tallow, to conform with the recent right-wing craze) and sides of “Epic Bacon.” The food took about 20 minutes, and my companion initially received a burger heaped with chili and a fried egg instead of what she had ordered. Although we'd given our phone numbers and been informed that a text would alert us when our orders were ready, neither of us got one; instead, the staff was just calling out receipts. After fetching our meals, we sat back down to appraise them. My burger was missing half of its bottom bun, and the attempt to deliver the advertised “smashed, crunchy edges” had left the meat fairly scorched throughout. This and the fries were no competition for many fine alternatives around Los Angeles.


	The bacon was a sadder affair, and I accidentally went viral on X by posting a picture comparing mine to the far more appetizing image on the menu. It was chewy, not crunchy — despite being partly charred — with a sickly-sweet maple glaze. A properly sized carton may help with presentation, but charging $12 for four slices of this stuff will never be justifiable. The condiments like “Electric Sauce” were the usual relabeled chipotle mayo and similar stuff. A “charged” lime rickey with “natural caffeine,” whether or not it gave me a noticeable buzz, tasted fine — I was puzzled, however, by a line on the ticket attached to my plain white cup that said “#tesla,” as if I might forget who sold me the soda. Any leftovers could be ferried home in a cardboard Cybertruck box, naturally.


	All told, none of this was worth the time or the expense. The heavy cuisine left us both a little queasy, and I was mildly nauseated again the following day to learn that someone had snapped photos of boxes of frozen products and milk that were apparently sitting behind the restaurant in the July heat. If only there were a couple of helpful humanoid robots that could move them! Alas, despite Tesla's misleading marketing, the only Optimus models we saw were behind glass, posed like museum exhibits.


	The bots, which can be found on your way up to the second level, constitute almost the entirety of the restaurant's decor. In the absence of better chow, you'd hope for at least an interesting setting, yet when you look around the ground floor, there isn't much that catches the eye. The sleek walls offer only Tesla propaganda slogans such as “Accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.” It was less like being in the future than in a drably minimalist McMansion. The “Skypad” rooftop is a bit nicer, and feels like it takes more inspiration from Googie architecture of the Space Age. Still, it seems to go underutilized while people congregate downstairs and would be far more suitable for a cocktail bar. Moving between the different parts of the property was awkward. An attendant stood at the top of the staircase, and for some unexplained reason stopped everyone who tried to walk back down the same way, saying they had to wait for the (hot, cramped) elevator. One wonders if this was as necessary as, say, maintaining the restrooms, one of which had a floor covered in piss and empty soap dispensers. Oh, and there were only three single-use bathrooms for an eatery that seats 250.


	The Tesla Diner, like so many of Musk's ideas for the company, is intended to make a statement. And, as always, that statement is no more nuanced or groundbreaking than: “Tesla is cool.” The problem is that this mission overrides every practical consideration — in this case, how a diner normally functions and what keeps one in business. In that sense, you can regard Musk's silver eyesore on Santa Monica Boulevard as a culinary equivalent of the Cybertruck. Though a lovely staff did their best under tough conditions during the opening week, the design is ill-considered, the atmosphere is an afterthought, the system is disorganized, and the food is disappointing. True, while the Cybertruck has been widely mocked as a lemon and sold poorly, it has its ardent fans, and no doubt the Tesla Diner can count on the support of a similar customer base while continuing to draw crowds as a tourist trap, no matter the quality of the experience. But can it really hope to expand into a robust chain, as Musk has said it will?

	It's no more likely than Tesla suddenly selling off all its surplus Cybertrucks. Musk has a way of not delivering on his many confident predictions and promises. Once the novelty factor has worn off, there won't be anything to entice the average Angeleno, living in a city of outrageously diverse cuisine and plenty of storied diners, to come back a second time, except maybe for the supercharger stations. (My friend joked that it could well be converted to a luxury cannabis store if it fails in the months to come.)   Some diehard Tesla believers had complaints as well, griping about disorderly management and the diner shutting down at night, turning away guests who had been assured it was open around the clock. The unmindful construction planning, noise and light pollution, and Tesla traffic jams have meanwhile done nothing to endear the diner to those living nearby — the lifeblood of most successful restaurants — and anti-Musk demonstrators are organizing a series of protests at the location.


	As the world's richest man, Musk simply doesn't have access to the realities of the service industry, or, for that matter, taking the family out to get burgers and milkshakes. When you leave this spot, you'll have to ask yourself: When's the last time this guy ate in an actual diner? As ever, his out-of-touch vision for what the 21st century can and should be is so hopelessly distant from human needs and habits that he has delivered a garish, soulless spectacle. One can scarcely imagine the amount of input he must have ignored from the industry veterans brought aboard for this project, indifferent to everything but his half-baked daydream of a Tesla charging lot where Tesla robots on roller skates bring you Tesla fast food while you watch towering footage of Teslas, a kind of living commercial for his trillion-dollar brand and pure antithesis of the humble neighborhood joint. The worst part is that he's not even embarrassed.

Donald Trump‘s “One Big Beautiful Bill” doesn't look so beautiful to American voters. According to a new Wall Street Journal poll, more than half of respondents oppose the president's landmark legislation.


	Considering the bill gives huge tax breaks to the rich, kicks up to 15 million people off Medicaid and cuts its funding by $1 trillion, sends tons of money to immigration enforcement, and gives away billions to the fossil fuel industry and its wealthy executives, it's no wonder it is unpopular. And those aspects of the law haven't even taken effect yet.


	Overall, 52 percent of poll respondents — 1500 registered voters — opposed the bill, while only 42 percent supported it. Almost all Democrats (94 percent) and the majority of independents (54 percent) were against it, compared to only 12 percent of Republicans who were opposed. Most respondents — 70 percent — agreed the legislation will help the wealthy, and more than half said it would hurt poor people and the working class, people collecting Social Security, the U.S. economy, the federal deficit, and recipients of Medicaid and nutrition assistance.

	“Cutting Medicaid is unpopular. Cutting food assistance is unpopular,” Sen. Brian Schatz told the Journal. “Cutting those things in order to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy is unpopular, so it's like it was designed in a lab to be unpopular.”


	While respondents supported work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, the majority did not approve of taking away benefits from those who don't comply.

	











	In crafting the bill, Republicans designed it so the hardest hits will come after the midterm elections, an attempt to stave off a blue wave in 2026 that could put Democrats in power in one or more houses of Congress.


	Some aspects of the bill polled positively, such as no taxes on tips or overtime pay, with majorities of respondents saying they were in favor.

	Republicans, who literally wrote the legislation, meanwhile, are blaming the bill's overall unpopularity on — you guessed it — the Democrats. 


	“Any of the negative polling is because of Democrats' lies,” GOP Rep. Jason Smith, who leads the House Ways and Means Committee, told the paper.

Tom Lehrer, the influential song satirist whose darkly comic lyrics gained a cult following decades after he stopped making music, has died at the age of 97.


	Lehrer died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his longtime friend David Herder told the Associated Press. No cause of death was provided.


	The New York City-born, Harvard-educated Lehrer began making music while studying mathematics in college, applying his humor to song to tackle issues ranging from racism to militarism to religion to nuclear war in the Fifties and early Sixties.


	Among Lehrer's best-known songs include “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,” “It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier,” “The Vatican Rag,” “The Masochism Tango,” and “The Old Dope Peddler,” the latter of which was sampled by 2 Chainz decades later.


	While Lehrer only recorded about three-dozen songs during his musical lifetime — he refocused on teaching mathematics in the Seventies — his work had an enormous impact on future generations, inspiring songwriters like Randy Newman, Steely Dan's Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, and “Weird Al” Yankovic, who heard Lehrer's songs frequently on Dr. Demento's radio show.

	











	“My last living musical hero is still my hero but unfortunately no longer living. RIP to the great, great Mr. Tom Lehrer,” Yankovic wrote on social media Sunday.

	











Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe was also an admirer of Lehrer — “the cleverest and funniest man of the 20th century, and kind of my hero,” Radcliffe said — and once delivered the satirist's complex “The Elements” on British late-night television; Radcliffe's impromptu performance of the elemental table was in part responsible for the actor later landing the role of “Weird Al” in Yankovic's quasi-biopic.


	“I used to sing that song in college at coffeehouses,” Yankovic said of “The Elements” and Radcliffe's performance. “Singing that song is an extremely nerdy thing to do. It's off-the-charts nerdy. And I thought, ‘OK, this guy gets it. This guy's a kindred spirit. He can embody me onscreen.'”

	In 2020, Lehrer placed his entire catalog in the public domain, ensuring future generations could freely discover and use his music. “All copyrights to lyrics or music written or composed by me have been permanently and irrevocably relinquished, and therefore such songs are now in the public domain. All of my songs that have never been copyrighted, having been available for free for so long, are now also in the public domain. In other words, I have abandoned, surrendered and disclaimed all right, title and interest in and to my work and have injected any and all copyrights into the public domain,” Lehrer wrote on a still-active website containing all his songs and lyriccs.


	“In short, I no longer retain any rights to any of my songs. So help yourselves, and don't send me any money.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","I'm a top UK cop-turned UFO hunter","https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/35980583/donald-trump-must-come-clean-about-ufos/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 21:01:13 GMT","

DONALD Trump should come clean on UFOs before a ""catastrophic event"", a former British detective has warned.

Gary Heseltine believes the US president should disclose the truth before a sighting causes mass panic.

Gary, who probed the 7/7 London bombings for the British Transport Police, is now a leading UFO detective, giving lectures around the world.

The 65-year-old, who took early retirement in 2013 to launch his own UFO magazine after 24 years in the force, says it's only a matter of time before an incident would go viral over the internet sparking alarm.

And he believes the pressure is growing to reveal the truth after several whistleblowers have come forward to give evidence before the US Congress and a new documentary featuring 34 high level military and government officials - including Senator Marco Rubio - has been released.

He said: ""With the arrival of President Trump for a second term in the White House many people wondered if he would become the ‘Disclosure' President.

""This was after many others who would go on to become senior officials in the administration had openly and publicly stated their views on the need for transparency on the UAP issue prior to taking office.

""People like Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel, the Director of the FBI and John Ratcliffe, the Director of the CIA. 

""These people have openly advocated UAP transparency but in the first four months of the administration they have said nothing on the issue publicly. Why not?""

With wars waging in Ukraine and the Middle East, Gary believes now would be the right time to admit we are being visited by non human intelligence (NHI) to unite the planet.

He adds: ""While the new President has walked into several major world issues like the Ukraine/Russia conflict and tensions in the Middle-East with the war with Israel/Palestine and further activity in Yemen, Iran, Syria and Lebanon etc., some might argue that it might be an appropriate time to announce Disclosure. 

""Such a revelation might galvanise nations away from the polarisation we see currently.

""This may sound fanciful but no-one doubts that as and when Disclosure occurs, that it will be the most profound moment in human history.

""UAP are the Elephant in the room, no-one is talking about Non Human Intelligence because there hasn't been a Disclosure announcement, yet, we know from fast developing events in the U.S. that it is seemingly just around the corner. 

""Whether it is this year or next, the reality is that such an announcement is likely to occur soon and when it does and the reality of NHI sinks in, nothing in politics, the military and life in general will ever quite be the same.

""We know that the Five Eyes countries (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand) have been briefed on UAP activity in May 2023 and perhaps several more countries have been too, but the question is to what level are our military and political leaders informed. 

While the new President has walked into several major world issues like the Ukraine/Russia conflict and tensions in the Middle-East with the war with Israel/Palestine and further activity in Yemen, Iran, Syria and Lebanon etc., some might argue that it might be an appropriate time to announce Disclosure. Such a revelation might galvanise nations away from the polarisation we see currently.

""It remains a big question, just how much do our political leaders know about the reality of UAP? 

""I fear that they are vastly under informed and under prepared for an NHI Disclosure world.""

Gary, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who edits UFO Truth Magazine, is hopeful about a new documentary called Age Of Disclosure - featuring dozens of top officials including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio - could bring about ""a new dawn in mankind's history.""

The retired cop said: ""After giving it much thought I think 2025 could be a crucial year for the Disclosure issue.

By Sayan Bose

DONALD Trump vowed last year to reveal exclusive UFO footage if he was elected back to the White House.

The Republican presidential candidate said he would push the Pentagon to declassify the alleged UFO sighting videos in a sensational interview.

Trump, who went on to trounce Democratic rival Kamla Harris in the presidential elections in November 2024, is known to have a decade-long fascination with aliens and unexplainable sightings.

He told popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would ""surely"" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.

During the chat, Fridman asked Trump: ""Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?""

To which Trump readily agreed and said: ""Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.""

The Republican leader also claimed he had faced pressure to declassify previous records of alien encounters as he admitted ""there could be life on other planets"".

He added: ""People begged me not to do it but I'll be doing that very early on.""

""Clearly the Trump administration is not going anywhere near the NHI topic at the moment, so when will the issue be broached? It's a good question. 

""The Federal Secrets Task Force under the stewardship of Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was given only a six-month mandate to look at the likes of the JFK, RFK assassinations etc, but it was also supposed to look at UFO/UAP/USOs yet, the latter dates to discuss that have been put back until no-one knows.

""If things don't develop soon on that front, then the six months mandate may soon expire. What then?

""Approximately two months ago a major new UAP documentary film, ‘The Age of Disclosure' premiered at a mid-west film festival and it received very favourable reviews in the mainstream media yet, the roll-out of the film nationwide/worldwide did not follow and has been put on hold. 

""Why? My guess it is all about timing.

""I suspect the volatile situations in Europe and the Middle-East have put paid to addressing the UAP issue for the time being. 

""I think it will be interesting to see when the film is released, and indeed how it is rolled out. 

""Some people think it may get a national cinema run which would be very interesting if that occurs.

""I believe the documentary may hold the key to a ‘Disclosure' moment as it is meant to usher in a new dawn in mankind's history. 

""Senator Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State for the United States is featured in the film and he is seen as third only to the President and the Vice President in terms of his place in the administration.

""His appearance in the film is bound to be a major talking point for the media. 

""Whilst I have not seen the film the excellent trailer states that 34 key people appear in it, including several current politicians.

""In the film trailer, Jay Stratton, the former head of the UAP Task Force states openly that he has seen NHI craft and Non-Human bodies. That in itself is highly noteworthy. He's never said anything like that publicly before.

""In recent months two eminent scientists involved in UAP research for decades have finally revealed things in public for the very first time.

""Hal Puthoff, arguably the most important scientist ever to work on the UAP issue, said recently on the Joe Rogan podcast, that the U.S. has 10 NHI craft in its possession. 

""And only in just the last few weeks, Eric Davis, a scientist who has worked with Puthoff for many years said at a UAP Disclosure Fund event in Congress, that there are four different types of NHI, the Greys, Reptilians, Mantids and Nordics! 

""What has long been suspected has now been confirmed by one of the world's leading scientists on the UAP issue. His public statement is something of a wow moment for me.""

Back in March 1997, thousands of people, including Hollywood actor Kurt Russell and a former US governor, witnessed the so-called Phoenix Lights. 

Some people managed to film the lights using camcorders as camera phones were not available.

But smartphones are everywhere now and Gary believes another major event could not be easily hushed up or dismissed by the powers that be like they did before.

He said: ""I think we are truly at a crossroads on the Disclosure issue. 

""There is a real chance this year that things will come together and the film ‘Age of Disclosure' will be used to support an announcement by President Trump of the reality of NHI.

""However, if that does not happen this year then the moment we have all hoped for so long may have been lost for who knows how long and the prospect of ‘Catastrophic Disclosure', a term coined by Colonel Karl Nell, may be the only way that the NHI story finally breaks into the mainstream world.

The Phoenix Lights were a series of widely sighted unidentified flying objects (UFOs) observed over Arizona and Nevada on March 13, 1997. 

Thousands of people reported seeing a V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the sky, and stationary lights in the Phoenix area. 

While some believe it was a UFO sighting, the official explanation is that they were flares dropped during military exercises.

The lights were observed between 7.30 pm and 10.30pm MST, spanning a distance of about 300 miles, from the Nevada border through Phoenix to Tucson.

The Air Force stated the lights were flares dropped during military exercises at the Barry M. Goldwater Range near Phoenix.

Despite the official explanation, many people believe the lights were a genuine UFO sighting, and the incident has become a significant event in UFO lore.

The Phoenix Lights remain a subject of debate and fascination, with many still questioning the official explanation.

""Yet ‘Catastrophic Disclosure' should be a last resort measure because of the uncertainty such an event may cause.

""For decades the forces that have controlled the UAP narrative have risked such an event but were half prepared to combat such a scenario, the risk for panic and alarm is now much higher because of the internet, new technology and the use of social media.

""Think about it, everyone carries a smartphone with high quality video cameras and applications that offer immediate ‘live streaming'.

""I've been saying it for several years that if the 1997 Phoenix Lights event took place now that it would likely cause a ‘Catastrophic Disclosure' moment. 

""Back then the authorities were able to cast doubt on grainy poor quality videos of lights in the sky above the city and they just about managed to ‘control' of the media and officials but it was a close shave.

""But here is the kicker, I believe that if that same event happened today and was seen by over 50,000 people, and was captured in 4k, 8k video and ‘live streamed' within minutes of it occurring the authorities would not have time to contain it. 

""Such an event would likely go viral across the world on social media in minutes …. and the cat would be out of the bag. 

""A mile wide craft of unknown origin captured in stark reality over the city of Phoenix and with it ‘Catastrophic Disclosure' on an unprepared world.

""So this is a choice for our political leaders. I would urge President Trump to inform the world about the reality of NHI soon or risk causing major public panic with a ‘Catastrophic Disclosure' event. 



""The clock is ticking like never before.""

The series finale of Supernatural was divisive for many reasons, ranging from Dean's anticlimactic death via rebar to a shortage of familiar faces in the very last episode ever. Even as the 2025 TV schedule continues with Jensen Ackles starring in Prime Video's Countdown and Jared Padalecki set to appear in the upcoming season of The Boys, fans of their CW show surely still want to know: who was the blurry woman who Sam married and had a son with in the finale flash-forward? Showrunner Andrew Dabb shared his thoughts, nearly five years later, and they don't quite match what Padalecki has said.

Short of Supernatural getting a Buffy-esque revival, we may never have a canonical answer, but I was among the viewers back in late 2020 who just wanted to know if the woman who was Sam's wife was supposed to be Eileen, played by Shoshannah Stern. Was she a random brunette who we'd never met before but Sam met and married after Dean's death? Or was she supposed to be Eileen, but the show just couldn't get her back to film the finale under 2020 COVID-19 guidelines? Well, showrunner Andrew Dabb weighed in, with Swooon reporting his comments:

We wanted someone there, so it wasn't like there was no female presence at all. But at the same time, do you cast someone totally brand new that the audience will have not seen before? Or do you keep it a little vague and people can imply whatever they want to imply?

While that initial answer was just about as vague as the face of Sam's blurry wife in the Season 15 finale, Dabb went on to note that the “logistical challenge of bringing a lot of people in, being the first show up during COVID, was just not feasible on our end.” Considering that Supernatural didn't even bring in Misha Collins – arguably the third lead of the series – for the finale, I can understand why even some of the most important guest stars couldn't make the cut. I don't love it, but I get it!

Dabb had even shared the original vision for Sam and Dean's endings that would have featured a lot of familiar faces. Still, he has a take of his own, even if the episode will never deliver the answers fans want about Eileen as Sam's wife (or not). He said:

People can fill in whatever they want, and they're free to. But certainly in my mind, that's what we were building toward.

Andrew Dabb's take? That blurry woman who married Sam and became the mother to young Dean was Eileen, as a natural extension of where Season 15 had been leading with them. Jared Padalecki just had a different take when asked about his character's wife.

The Supernatural co-lead was asked about the identity of Sam's spouse a few months after the finale aired, so the mystery was a lot fresher to the episode than Andrew Dabb weighing in circa 2025. Padalecki told Variety that no version of the script included an identity of who Sam ended up with after Dean's death, so he had no more details than what we saw: a brunette woman blurred out from a distance. He said:

I think it was very, very purposely ambiguous and strangely I agreed with that. I feel like a lot of what Sam did after Dean died was almost in honor of what Dean would have wanted, and Dean would not have wanted his little brother to marry Eileen, Ruby, someone in the life.

I feel comfortable saying that Dean definitely wouldn't have wanted Sam to marry Ruby even if she was still around, but it's a little harder to swallow the idea of him objecting to Eileen just because she was still in “the life.” Sam's feelings for her in Season 15 were very real and apparent, and Dean would have wanted his brother to be happy.

Still, Padalecki is the man who played Sam Winchester for more than 300 episodes over fifteen seasons, so he obviously knows his character. Plus, his speculation is no more canonical than Andrew Dabb saying that he believed in an endgame for Sam and Eileen. Besides, who's to say whether or not Padalecki still feels the same way these days?

I'd say that the gist is that fans can believe what they want to believe. And really, is that anything new for the Supernatural fandom? Surely I'm not the only one who just overlooks certain episodes for the sake of enjoying the whole! If you want to revisit the finale or any of the other 300+ episodes, you can find the full run of Supernatural streaming with a Netflix subscription now.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Home'}","other"

The cancellation of The Winchesters after only one season highlights the one big mistake Supernatural season 16 must avoid. Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons on the CW, following the cross-country adventures of monster-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester.

Finally coming to a conclusion in 2020, Supernatural's devastating finale that left fans divided. Not long after the show ended, fans began speculating about how the story of the Winchester brothers could continue. Before long, news broke about a prequel spin-off titled The Winchesters, executive produced by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danneel.

The Winchesters was set to tell the story of John (Drake Rodger) and Mary (Meg Donnelly) Winchester, chronicling how they met and fell in love. Based on the trailers, the show initially appeared to contradict what Supernatural had already revealed about the Winchester parents, which didn't exactly set the show up for success.

 The Winchesters season 1 finale revealed that the entire season had taken place in an alternate universe, but many viewers had already given up on the series. Without Sam and Dean, The Winchesters simply didn't click with audiences, and a future continuation or spin-off of Supernatural must avoid this mistake.

Fans have been hoping that Supernatural season 16 will happen for a long time, and this unexpected plot twist in a spinoff series could be the key.

While I enjoyed The Winchesters for what it was, the show never captured the same magic that kept Supernatural on the air for 15 seasons. The Winchesters' failure to connect with audiences proves that a Supernatural spin-off or reboot won't work without Sam and Dean Winchester.

Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki became so great at portraying the Winchester brothers that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the roles. Thankfully, both actors have expressed an interest in returning, as has Misha Collins as Castiel.

Whether Sam and Dean were hunting ghosts or taking on the Devil himself, they almost always did it together. Their dynamic made even the weakest episodes of Supernatural worth watching, and that absence was sorely felt on The Winchesters. While many of the spin-off's characters were interesting, they did not have the same presence as Sam and Dean.

The failure of The Winchesters (as well as the earlier attempted Supernatural spin-off, Bloodlines) proves that a future Supernatural reboot cannot focus on new characters. If Supernatural ever continues, and I sincerely hope that it does, it simply must have Sam and Dean at its center.

With its killer soundtrack of classic rock hits, Supernatural provided the perfect background music for the epic saga of Sam and Dean Winchester.

Supernatural developed a complex and compelling mythology throughout its fifteen seasons, but it always kept the focus on the Winchester brothers. While a Supernatural reboot would certainly introduce some new characters, the series must, at its heart, be about Sam and Dean.

The few Supernatural episodes that focus on other, previously unknown characters, like ""Bitten"" and ""Bloodlines,"" are often regarded as some of the series' worst (or at least most polarizing) episodes.

Jared Padalecki as Sam, Jensen Ackles as Dean, and Misha Collins as Castiel are the main reasons Supernatural developed such a passionate fan base throughout its 15 seasons. Even if a future series managed to capture Supernatural's unique blend of horror, humor, and heart, I cannot help thinking it would all feel empty without Sam and Dean Winchester.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","What is $8 billion merger's psychic cost to Paramount Global?","https://www.columbian.com/news/2025/jul/27/what-is-8-billion-mergers-psychic-cost-to-paramount-global/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 21:18:21 GMT","

With last week's OK from the Federal Communications Commission, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher.

It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show have led critics to suggest that corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump.

Following the FCC's approval Thursday, one of the current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders.

Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president.

After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal.

The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens last week was seen as positive by people at “60 Minutes.”

Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance wrote in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.

The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said.

Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said.

Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” But Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists.

“They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.”

Complaint comes as Trump administration faces pressure over Epstein files scandal

Donald Trump, who has regularly indulged in conspiracy theories alongside his supporters during his rise to power, complained on Sunday that it's Democrats that are too focused on conspiracy theories.

Trump, whose administration is under scrutiny over its handling of Jeffrey Epstein investigations, claimed that “all they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense.”

“If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer,” the president said during a meeting in Scotland on Sunday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump himself has long employed conspiracies as a candidate and then president, from becoming one of the leading proponents of the Obama birther conspiracy to playing into his supporters' fixation with the QAnon movement. 

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump continued this trend, latching onto a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets.

Now, after years of courting conspiracy theories about his opponents, the spotlight has turned on Trump over Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a federal trial on sex trafficking charges 

The administration's handling of materials related to Epstein investigations — disclosing an initial tranche of information that was mostly already public earlier this year, then suggesting it would not provide further releases, even as recent reporting further highlighted Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier — has driven a rare wedge between Trump and his base.

The Epstein scandal has also provided ammunition to Democrats to scrutinize the president.

Pressure reached such a fever pitch that House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress off to its summer recess early, temporarily averting a bipartisan push to release more Epstein files.

Despite Trump's protests, the issue doesn't look set to settle anytime soon, after Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, was subpoenaed to testify in Congress and gave an interview to the Department of Justice.

Amid continued furor over the Epstein case, the Trump administration has asked a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the alleged trafficker while opposing Maxwell's bid at the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. 

The Epstein saga appears set to continue, as does Trump and his allies' insistence that conspiracies are at work to thwart the MAGA movement.

The president has taken to describing the 2016 investigations into whether Russia collaborated with this presidential campaign as a “coup” orchestrated by Barack Obama, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the former president to face criminal charges for the “treasonous conspiracy.”

Obama's office has called the claims a “ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”

CIA Director John Ratcliffe suggested that statute of limitations protection would not affect the Trump administration in their effort to prosecute those involved in investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. 

Ratcliffe claimed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper could be prosecuted for their role, claiming that they were still involved in a criminal conspiracy against Trump. 

He said there was “no doubt in my mind” that Clinton, Brennan, and Clapper “conspired.”

“They conspired against President Trump, they conspired against the American people. So, I'll leave it to Pam Bondi and our DOJ and Kash Patel and our FBI to investigate the conspiracy to do what, and what charges that they're capable of bringing,” Ratcliffe said on Fox News.

“I don't think statute of limitations are going to impact, because in a conspiracy, Maria, the statute of limitations doesn't start to run until the last act in the furtherance of that conspiracy,” Ratcliffe said. “Part of why this is so important is that the people behind this are still furthering the conspiracy.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents earlier this month that she claimed provided evidence that the Obama administration's intelligence officials “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork” for the FBI's later investigation into Russian ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Gabbard has said she has “the evidence” to prosecute Obama administration officials and that she was referring to documents from Obama administration officials to the Justice Department in a “criminal matter.” 

The recently declassified documents prove that Obama and top White House officials at the time directed investigators to advance narratives tying Trump to Russia with little evidence, according to Gabbard. 

Special Counsel John Durham's 2023 report found the FBI's handling of the probe into Trump's ties to Russia was “seriously deficient” in spots. 

SENATORS STAND BY 2016 RUSSIA ELECTION MEDDLING REPORT DESPITE GABBARD'S CLAIMS

Some Senators are standing by the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2020 findings of Russian collusion in the 2016 election. At the time the report was released, then-committee Chairman Marco Rubio said “then-candidate Trump was not complicit” in the collusion.

Democrats have additionally criticized Gabbard's release and prosecution suggestion. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Gabbard's threat to refer Obama administration officials to federal law enforcement for prosecution “dangerous” and said there was “absolutely” no legal basis for their prosecution.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Ethereum has rallied to more than $3,800 this week, gaining roughly 60% over the past month, according to data provider CoinGecko—a sign that “ETH season” is finally nigh. 

But as the altcoin rises from the doldrums, one question remains foremost for the token's holders: Will this ETH revival last? 

Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin programmer who worked on the blockchain alongside its creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than a decade ago, said Ethereum and its native token will thrive, largely due to the usefulness and ubiquity of its technology. 

“I'm not bearish on Ethereum because everybody is building on EVM,” Garzik told Decrypt, referring to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a decentralized computation engine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. 

The Bitcoin OG's endorsement of Ethereum comes as the layer-1 appears to recover from a crisis of confidence that coincided with ETH's plunge to $1,410 on April 7— its lowest price since March 2023.

The Ethereum Foundation also underwent leadership changes earlier this year amid fears the layer-1 was losing ground to rival blockchains such as Solana, with some investors raising concerns over the Foundation's roadmap for the project. 

But Ethereum's fortunes have improved recently. ETH sailed to $3,844 on July 21 and popped even higher earlier Sunday, and has remained roughly $1,000 below its all-time high of $4,878 set in November 2021, according to CoinGecko, buoyed by institutional and corporate investments into the altcoin.

Spot Ethereum ETFs notched $2.12 billion worth of inflows the week before last, nearly doubling their previous record, according to Farside Investors data—and then flipped Bitcoin ETF flows last week.

Meanwhile, a spate of Ethereum treasury companies—including Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink—have added billions of dollars in ETH to their coffers over the past few weeks.

However, Garzik believes it is Ethereum's technological contributions—not recent investor interest in its token—that signal the project's chances for long-term success. Garzik has tapped the EVM tech for Hemi Network, a layer-2 network that is compatible with both Bitcoin and Ethereum, that launched its mainnet in March.

“I look at it maybe from a different perspective than price,” the developer said. “What's going to be here 10 years from now, 20 years from now? I think it's unquestionably Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

Declining to offer a price prediction for ETH, Garzik noted that much of the crypto ecosystem is largely undergirded by Ethereum's technology. 

“The default choice for programmability…[and] for smart contracts is to be building on Ethereum tech,” the developer said. “Everybody wants to, whether it's an L1 or an L2.” 

EVM is used across many popular blockchains, including Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum. 

Asked about so-called Ethereum killers such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos, which use their own nodes and programming languages instead of the EVM, Garzik said: “You've got a lot of people saying, 'I've got this latest whizbang technology. It's gonna smoke Ethereum, [and] Ethereum is like yesterday's news.' [But] none of them have time in the market.”

Speaking about the rivalry between newer blockchains and Ethereum, Garzik recalled a joke about Microsoft and the browser wars in the late 1990s. 

“The joke goes, if Microsoft made a car, it'd go 1000 miles an hour, it'd randomly crash, turn left, and explode when you least expect it,” he said. “Some of the newer blockchains are like that.”

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

18 first-round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP National Bank Open in Toronto, and fans will get exciting action all day long. This article features Fabian Marozsan and Arthur Rinderknech alongside some other solid players. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

These two players are very close in their current rankings, but there is a significant difference in their level on hard courts. Vit Kopriva is a clay court specialist and has won just two tour-level matches in hard. Meanwhile, Yunchaokete Bu has won all his tour-level matches on hard courts, and his game excels on this surface. He hits hard and will dictate the points here. Kopriva will retrieve a lot of balls, but I expect the Chinese to come out on top.

Prediction: Bu in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Since reaching the semifinals in Marrakech, Roberto Carballes Baena has won just one tour-level match, and this form won't help him on hard courts, which is not his favourite surface. However, he has shown some promise on this surface earlier in the season and will look to imitate that level. Camilo Ugo Carabelli is in much better form coming into this match, but this is not his preferred surface either. With just two tour-level wins on this surface, Carabelli could be vulnerable here, and the Spaniard should take advantage.

Prediction: Baena in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

After a horrible first half of the season, Arthur Rinderknech is moving in the right direction and looks confident in his game. He has notched some impressive wins in the last couple of months and will be looking to start his North American hard-court swing on a high. He will face local wildcard Alexis Galarneau, who has never won an ATP Tour match. Galarneau is making his third appearance at the Canada Masters. Rinderknech's big serve and aggressive playstyle should help him dominate this match.

Prediction: Rinderknech in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Fabian Marozsan is going through a rough patch in the last couple of months, but his first-round record has been good. His record at the Masters is also impressive, and Hugo Dellien, who is primarily a clay courter, shouldn't present a lot of difficulties for Marozsan here. Marozsan has the clear advantage here due to his comfort on this surface. It would be an upset if Dellien wins this.

Prediction: Marozsan in 2

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","He was just one point away from winning Roland Garros but never managed to win a Grand Slam title before he retired","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/features/he-was-just-one-point-away-from-winning-roland-garros-but-never-managed-to-win-a-grand-slam-title-before-he-retired/","Sun, 27 Jul 2025 22:00:00 GMT","

Having a championship point at Roland Garros without winning the title is something that Jannik Sinner experienced earlier this year.

Sinner had three championship points against Carlos Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final that he lost in five sets.

This defeat was crushing for the Italian, with Sinner needing time to get over his heartbreaking defeat in Paris.

Sinner is now a four-time Grand Slam champion after winning Wimbledon, but another ATP player who experienced something similar was never able to recover.

Guillermo Coria was one of the big favourites for the Roland Garros title as the third seed in 2004.

The Argentinian was coming into the Paris major that year in impressive form, having won the Monte Carlo Masters and reached the final of the Hamburg Masters in the weeks leading up to Roland Garros.

Coria continued this form into Roland Garros, where he reached his first Grand Slam final by dropping just one set.

In the final, Coria would play an unlikely opponent in the 2004 Roland Garros final in his Argentine compatriot Gaston Gaudio, who was unseeded.

Gaudio had never reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal before Roland Garros in 2004, leaving Coria as the big favourite to win the title.

This was especially prevalent, as Coria had won three of his four previous matches against Gaudio, all of which were on clay.

The expected outcome of the match appeared to be playing out, as Coria dropped just three games to take a two-set-to-love lead.

Despite Coria leading the third set 4-4 40-0, Gaudio started to make a comeback and won the third and fourth sets to take it to a decider.

Coria would regain authority in this fifth set, taking a 4-2 lead, and looked to be on his way to an elusive Grand Slam title.

The then 22-year-old served for the match on two occasions, and had two championship points at 6-5 40-15, but Coria could just not get over the line.

After hitting the ball wide on those two championship points, Gaudio would fight back to beat Coria, 0-6 3-6 6-4 6-1 8-6.

In his press conference after the match, an emotional Coria suggested that nerves got the better of him.

“I think I was thinking too much at that stage,” Coria said after the match. “There was one very long rally at 40-15. I was thinking that if I had won that point, I could have won the match. He won the game, unfortunately for me.

“Then I was under pressure. I was thinking too much. What happened, happened. I have no words to describe it.”

Coria was the first man to lose a Grand Slam singles final in the Open Era after having championship points, with there now three players who have lost a major final from match point up.

The other two players who lost Grand Slam finals after having a championship point are Roger Federer and Sinner.

However, both Federer and Sinner have won multiple major titles, while Coria took a big decline after this heartbreaking loss.

While Coria would still enjoy some positive results after Roland Garros in 2004, he would never reach a Grand Slam semifinal ever again.

The Argentinian only won one more title in his career at the Croatia Open in 2005, and only made two more appearances at Roland Garros.

After struggling with injury, Coria only played at Roland Garros again in 2005 and 2008, losing in the fourth round and first round, respectively.

Coria suffered a dramatic fall down the rankings after playing just two matches in 2007, and was never able to return to form in his comeback from a shoulder injury.

At just 27 years old, Coria would retire from tennis in April, 2009, and would never win a Grand Slam title despite having two championship points to do so.

Although Guillermo Coria no longer plays on the ATP Tour, his younger brother Federico Coria has been an active player since 2010 and has a career-high ranking of world number 49.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

One game away from defeat, Leylah Fernandez battled all the way back to win a 3-hour and 12-minute, three-tiebreak epic over Elena Rybakina in the Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals. In the final, she will meet Anna Kalinskaya, who boasts a 9-2 main-draw record in Washington.

Leylah Fernandez was a single game away from defeat in Saturday's Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals, but she battled all the way back to pull off a grueling, three-tiebreak victory and reach her first final in over a year.

On another toasty day in the American capital city of Washington, D.C., Canada's Fernandez overcame No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-6(3) in a 3-hour and 12-minute marathon.

Washington, D.C.: Draws | Scores | Order of play

There was nearly a rematch of the memorable 2021 US Open final on Sunday, but it was not to be. Instead, Fernandez will face Anna Kalinskaya, who eased past 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu 6-4, 6-3 in the day's second semifinal.

Sunday is a huge chance for World No. 36 Fernandez and World No. 48 Kalinskaya, both of whom have previously been ranked inside the Top 20. This WTA 500 trophy would be the biggest career title for either of them -- in fact, Kalinskaya has yet to win a WTA singles title at all.

Fernandez narrowly defeated Kalinskaya in their only previous meeting, which was over four years ago. On the hard courts of Guadalajara in 2021, Fernandez squeaked past Kalinskaya 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.

The final is at 2:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon local time (7:30 p.m. BST). Let's break down the cases for the two unseeded finalists:

In Saturday's first semifinal, Elena Rybakina had not lost serve through 7-6(2), 5-4, where she served for the match. Naturally, Leylah Fernandez had her exactly where she wanted her.

""When I first started playing tennis, there was like a mini camp and they were doing a physical test, kind of a straight-line sprint,"" Fernandez said after her quarterfinal win on Friday. ""I was probably the slowest out of all of the girls there.

""The coaches were concerned, like 'She's not very good physically.' They talked to my parents, and my parents said, 'Yeah, but if you put a tennis ball in front of her and you ask her to run for every ball, she's gonna do it. Her heart and her belief in herself is much bigger than most of the girls in that camp.'""

Heart and belief continue to pull Fernandez into and through bigtime matches. Toting a water bottle emblazoned with the words ""hard work"" and ""fight,"" Fernandez never lets a match go.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

That came to pass in her epic win over Rybakina. Staring down match game at 5-4 in the second set, Fernandez's cracking returns helped the Canadian earn her first service break of the day when she needed it most. 

Once the third set hit, Fernandez was the sturdier player in rallies down the stretch. Bolstered by her never-say-die attitude, these returns and rally groundstrokes could lead Fernandez to her fourth career title, and her first since 2023 Hong Kong. All of her three career WTA singles titles have come on hard court.

""We're doing things right,"" Fernandez said on Saturday. ""The results are going to come. [I'll] keep enjoying it, and to not focus too much on results but focus on how my game is improving.""

On paper, Anna Kalinskaya has ""upset"" three players ranked ahead of her in her last three rounds. However, Washington is starting to feel like a home-field event for the former World No. 11.

The Mubadala Citi DC Open is arguably Anna Kalinskaya's best stop on tour. She holds a 9-2 main-draw win-loss record at the event and has never lost before the quarterfinals here, including a semifinal showing in 2019 as a qualifier ranked No. 160.

Kalinskaya went one further this year and is into her second career WTA singles final, following WTA 1000 Dubai and WTA 500 Berlin, both last year. After narrow losses in both of those finals, she has another opportunity to join the club of WTA singles titlists.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

These hard courts suit Kalinskaya's unfussy groundstrokes and placid demeanor. Dominating with her forehand, Kalinskaya had 19 winners to Raducanu's 13 in their opening set.

Proving she is lethal from both wings, Kalinskaya fired consecutive backhand winners to break Raducanu in the opening game of the second set, and she was off to the races from there.

""I always like to be aggressive,"" Kalinskaya said on Saturday night. ""I like that style of the game. Yeah, I guess the fast court fits me very well, but you need to be fast at making decisions. It's also very challenging.

""But I guess when I serve good, return fast, that's what I like the most, and to try to be aggressive as much as I can, and the fast court helps.""

If she can find the holes to power past speedy Fernandez on Sunday, Kalinskaya could be hoisting the champion's trophy for the very first time at tour level.

One game away from defeat, Leylah Fernandez battled all the way back to win a 3-hour and 12-minute, three-tiebreak epic over Elena Rybakina in the Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinals. In the final, she will meet Anna Kalinskaya, who boasts a 9-2 main-draw record in Washington.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne looks at the heart-stopping crash that inspired the backstory of Brad Pitt's Sonny Hayes in F1 The Movie.

At the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix weekend, Martin Donnelly crashed into the barrier at an estimated 160mph, throwing him out of his Lotus 102 and leaving him motionless on track. The devastating accident cut short his F1 career and changed his life forever.

Thirty-five years later Donnelly's journey helped inspire the team behind F1 The Movie, with the backstory of Brad Pitt's character Sonny Hayes based on the Northern Irishman's experience. Hall of Fame Journalist David Tremayne remembers the day that changed Donnelly's life...

There is an ugliness to violence. Not what you see in the movies, but the real stuff. When something so far beyond the norm of everyday life happens right in front of you.

We're all used to seeing cars spin, or even crash, either when we're watching the TV coverage or spectating at a race. But this real-time stuff, that happens right before you when something really goes wrong, with all of its horror and brutal soundtrack… That's something else. And it never really leaves you.

Romijn is set to reprise her role as Mystique, a character she originated in 2000's ‘X-Men.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Rebecca Romijn is sharing an update on her return as Mystique in the highly-anticipated Avengers: Doomsday. 


	At The Hollywood Reporter's San Diego Comic-Con suite, the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds star admitted that she wasn't sure if she's finished filming for the forthcoming Marvel film because the script isn't fully complete.  




	“[I'm] not quite sure,” she said when asked if she was done shooting her scenes. “The script hasn't — they haven't finished writing it. It's been very, very fun, and we don't know yet. They keep everything very close to the vest themselves in an effort to keep everything under wraps.”

	Romijn kept her lips sealed when asked if she's read the entire script, noting, “I cannot confirm nor deny that I have read the entire script.” She also admitted she “can't say” who she's filmed scenes alongside, but it was a “surreal” experience shooting with some of her original X-Men co-stars with a new, blended cast.

	“It was very surreal to be with my old cast as well as a new cast. I had crazy dreams while I was there for a large chunk of shooting. Like, really kind of regressive dreams,” she shared. “It was very strange, my brain was really trying to organize. Like, wow, this is a character I played 25 years ago, 20 years ago. Yeah, [it was] very surreal.”

	











	The actress also shared what it was like revisiting the role of Mystique after nearly 20 years since she last portrayed the character in 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand. (Romijn made a brief cameo in 2011's X-Men: First Class.)


	“Oh, I know her very well. I went back in with full ownership of her. It was very nice to go back and play that character, ‘cause I had imposter syndrome in the very beginning,” she said. “I thought, maybe at the very beginning, I was just cast because I happened to be the model who was available to play Mystique at that moment. I mean, I auditioned and I got the role, because when you're very young, you're like, Do I deserve to be here? And I did not have that going back this time. It was a very different experience.” 


	Marvel revealed the Avengers: Doomsday cast in late March, which notably includes a string of actors from 20th Century Fox's X-Men universe. Joining Romijn from the inaugural 2000 film include Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto and James Marsden as Cyclops. The Traitors host Alan Cumming also returns as Nightcrawler, whom he played in X2: X-Men United, and Kelsey Grammer as Beast, from X-Men: The Last Stand.

Weekend Editor


Vanessa Kirby, much to her surprise, had no trouble committing to the sprawling MCU as she was cast in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, where she portrays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in Marvel Studios‘ official launch of Phase Six.


	During a recent interview with Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast, The Crown alumna talked about falling in love with the famed comic book character and what it's been like reprising the role for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.


	“When this one came around, I was so genuinely moved by the fact that this was a woman who was pregnant and was a new mother, and also has these superpowers,” Kirby said. “It helped me ground it in something — to try and understand what it would be like to have both those things happening at the same time was a challenge, but I was grateful for that because it rooted it in this kind of domesticity, in this family and home, which made it easier.”

	For the role, Kirby did not audition, first meeting with helmer Matt Shakman over lunch and later on top brass Kevin Feige. The actress said she was excited to mine the “counterculture and super meaningful” '60s comic book era to bring the character to life, adding that because of Sue Storm's expansive journey she didn't have any trepidation agreeing to future MCU pipeline projects.

	“With this, I actually didn't have that, and I'm surprised to say that,” the Pieces of a Woman star explained. “I think it was because I really liked her so much and because I'd read so many of the comics and she goes through so many different iterations. She becomes Malice, this really dark version of herself for quite a long time, and then she renames herself Invisible Woman having been called Invisible Girl and she goes off with Psycho-Man, like her history is incredible, so I felt like there's so much there to even [explore] psychologically. I mean, she has a stillborn, and people don't know that. She's gone through a lot.”


	More importantly, Kirby said she felt confident continuing her collaboration with the superhero studio alongside her fellow First Steps co-stars Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach: “I knew I wouldn't be without these three actors, and these three actors have genuinely become family, and I admired them so much, and I knew that we're a four and the four in the comics are never separated, so I assumed that we'd be together, and that really helped 'cause then you're not a lone ranger going to new, daunting environments.”

	











	Speaking to the much-hyped Doomsday, Kirby said more shoots are on the way: “I'm loving it, absolutely loving it. It's been a complete privilege,” she said of filming, which she is doing while pregnant, adding that it's the “coolest” experience.


	Shakman previously spoke to Deadline about how his MCU entry is able to “pass the baton” to the Joe and Anthony Russo-directed 2026 movie. Though plot details are currently tightly under wraps, audiences can expect the tentpole to center on supervillain and Fantastic Four arch nemesis Dr. Doom (Robert Downey Jr.).


	“[The Russo Brothers] describe it like they're making a recipe of different ingredients, and it's unbelievable that these Avengers movies work in such a beautiful way,” Kirby said. “You look at Infinity War and you've got all these different energies but somehow they all fuse together, and I remember them saying the first one they had no idea if any of them would go together, and it just works. It's quite exciting to be a part of something and go, ‘OK, this is my flavor, I don't know.' It's in their hands to work out what flavors go with what and how and where and there's a surrender in that.”


	Lauding Downey Jr.'s leadership onscreen, Kirby said: “He's the most incredible human being, soulful, deep, kind — he's been an amazing leader to us considering we're the newbies, and a lot of the others have known this world for a really long time, and he's been a phenomenal leader, and also he's just doing the most amazing work.”


	In addition to the quartet from First Steps and Downey Jr., confirmed cast members include Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Letitia Wright, Florence Pugh, Simu Liu, Tom Hiddleston, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Danny Ramirez, Hannah John-Kamen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Channing Tatum, Tenoch Huerta Mejía and Lewis Pullman.

It was only a matter of time until Jay Leno had something to say — although, whether he said anything actually in response to the dust up at “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” is a little less clear. In an interview posted last week by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, taped two weeks ago, Leno took the current slate of late night hosts to task.

“I got hate letters [when hosting ‘The Tonight Show'] saying, ‘You and your Republican friends,' and another saying, ‘I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,” Leno related (via THR). “That's how you get a whole audience. Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.”

Leno continued to explain how, in his day, friends didn't talk about their political positions — even those in the comedic realm. “Rodney Dangerfield and I were friends. I knew Rodney 40 years and I have no idea if he was a Democrat or Republican. We never discussed politics, we just discussed jokes. I like to think that people come to a comedy show to get away from the pressures of life. I love political humor — don't get me wrong. But people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other,” he said.

 










No matter when it was filmed, the timing of its release would seem deliberate, considering that Stephen Colbert‘s series has been the subject of “was it cancelled because of its politics?” rumors since the news broke on July 17 — especially considering the timing of the CBS/Paramount-Skydance merger approval by the Trump Administration's Justice Department. If Leno still stands by this opinion two weeks later, it would put him on a lonely late night island. Virtually every other figure in the mainstream — from Jimmy Fallon to Jimmy Kimmel to Jon Stewart to previous “Late Show” host David Letterman — have expressed support for Colbert and lambasted the series' parent company.

“I don't think it was money… it was pure cowardice,” Letterman said on his YouTube channel July 25. “What the fuck is Skydance, honest to Christ? Is it a discount airline? Is that what it is? I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS, who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed because this is this is gutless. I only wish this could happen to me… Fighting with network television management was number one in the playbook.”

But Leno maintains a diverting approach — even in these unusual Trumpian times — from the style adopted by Colbert. “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group — or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what's funny,” he concluded.

 










Last year on “The Talk,” Leno said something similar, but seemed to indicate that his style didn't work in the present era. “Now you kind of have to take a side,” he said (via THR). “It's a little bit different, but the nice thing about this election is, it was fair. I was not a fan [of Trump], but that's OK. It's the president of the United States. Let's all get together, thank you very much.”
