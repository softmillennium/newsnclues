TEL AVIV, July 27. /TASS/. Israel is determined to achieve all of its goals in the Gaza Strip and eliminate Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

"We will continue to fight, we will continue to act until we achieve all of our war goals — until complete victory," he said in a vide address while visiting the Ramon Air Force Base in the Negev Desert. "We will eliminate Hamas."

"In order to complete this goal (Hamas elimination - TASS), and also the release of our hostages, we are making progress in fighting and negotiating," he said.

"In any path we choose, we will have to continue to allow the entry of minimal humanitarian supplies [to the Gaza Strip]. We have done this until now," Netanyahu said, adding that the United Nations is lying about Israel by saying that it is "not allowing humanitarian supplies to enter." "It is allowed. There are secured convoys," he stressed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet in Stockholm on Monday to tackle longstanding economic disputes at the centre of the countries' trade war, aiming to extend a truce keeping sharply higher tariffs at bay. China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with President Donald Trump's administration, after Beijing and Washington reached a preliminary deal in June to end weeks of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs. Without an agreement, global supply chains could face renewed turmoil from duties exceeding 100 per cent. The Stockholm talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, take place a day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meets Trump at his golf course in Scotland to try to clinch a deal that would likely see a 15 per cent baseline tariff on most EU goods. Trade analysts on both sides of the Pacific say the discussions in the Swedish capital are unlikely to produce any breakthroughs but could prevent further escalation and help create conditions for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet later this year. U.S. to discuss tariff deadline extension with China as Trump, Philippines reach deal So far, the talks have not delved into broader economic issues. They include U.S. complaints that China's state-led, export-driven model is flooding world markets with cheap goods, and Beijing's complaints that U.S. national security export controls on tech goods seek to stunt Chinese growth. “Stockholm will be the first meaningful round of U.S.-China trade talks,” said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at China consultancy firm Plenum. Trump has been successful in pressuring some other trading partners, including Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, into deals accepting higher U.S. tariffs of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Two of Trump's top trade officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, will attend the Scotland talks and then travel to Stockholm. China's grip on the global market for rare earth minerals and magnets, used in everything from military hardware to car windshield wiper motors, has proved to be an effective leverage point on U.S. industries. Bessent has already said he wants to work out an extension of the August 12 deadline to prevent tariffs snapping back to 145 per cent on the U.S. side and 125 per cent on the Chinese side. Still, China will likely request a reduction of multi-layered U.S. tariffs totaling 55 per cent on most goods and further easing of U.S. high-tech export controls, analysts said. Beijing has argued that such purchases would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached US$295.5-billion in 2024. Bessent has also said he would discuss with He the need for China to rebalance its economy away from exports toward domestic consumer demand. That remains to be seen,” said Froman, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

"One thing is clear: neutrality alone cannot protect us," she said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "[Austria] is protected by investments in defense and partner relations. I am principally open to discussing the future of Austria's security and defense policy," she stated. "Although there is no majority in favor of the NATO membership either in parliament or among the population, such a discussion could be quite productive," she said. "I don't mean to say that we must join NATO triumphantly. But we cannot sit by saying: if we do no harm to anyone, no one will do any harm to us. It would be naive," she stressed, adding that the world has changed. "However, I want to make thig clear: we have a partner, the European Union, who will defend us in an emergency situation. At the same time, we are contributing much to European security," she noted, adding that the Austrian military is participating in numerous EU peacekeeping missions.</p>

Ke'Torrius Starkes Jr, who was in foster care, had been picked up in the late morning on Tuesday by the worker after a supervised visit with his father, the New York Times reported. He was supposed to be transported to a day care program by a worker for the department, which oversees child protection other social services. Instead the boy was left alone strapped in a vehicle with tinted windows on a hot day in Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham. The Birmingham police department said officers went to a private home in Bessemer to respond to a report of an unresponsive child at around 5.30pm and found that the boy was “accidentally left inside of a vehicle while in the care of a third-party contracted worker through the Department of Human Resources”. The chief deputy coroner of Jefferson county, Bill Yates, told the Times that “the child was found in a car that was ignition off, doors closed, windows up and it was hot in the car” and so far there was “no other competing cause of death”. “The provider has terminated their employee. Police are now investigating the incident to examine for any possible criminal charges in the case. “We need answers, and we may need to examine state law to make sure this never happens again,” said state senator Merika Coleman, a Democrat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The government is on track to launch the Build Canada Homes initiative this fall, according to Housing Minister Gregor Robertson's spokesperson Renée LeBlanc Proctor.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press His ambitions, announced during his campaign, were big: act as a developer to build affordable housing, spur innovation in the housing sector and offer low-cost financing to affordable-housing builders. However, trade turmoil has quickly overshadowed housing affordability in the political arena, creating a void of information on how the federal government plans to get more homes built. Renée LeBlanc Proctor, a spokesperson for Housing Minister Gregor Robertson, said in a statement that the government was on track to launch the initiative this fall and stakeholders would learn more soon. Mr. Carney promised the initiative would be a “lean, mission-driven organization” focused on building affordable housing by leveraging public lands and partnering with the private sector. Opinion: Ottawa must resist the temptation to fiddle with CMHC amid housing market slump Raymond Sullivan, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association, an organization that represents the social and non-profit housing sector, said he's encouraged to see affordable housing at the heart of Build Canada Homes' mission. But given how long it can take to set up a new bureaucracy, Mr. Sullivan said the government should roll out elements of Build Canada Homes as they become ready, rather than wait for the entire organization to be set up. So let's focus on the pieces that are already available to us,” he said. University of Toronto senior housing researcher Carolyn Whitzman said there are two versions of the initiative that are being discussed in policy circles: one that is limited in scope and focused primarily on partnering with developers to build affordable housing on public land, and one that also has a larger mandate encompassing financing and innovation programs. Figuring out what exactly Build Canada Homes will be responsible for and how it will distinguish itself from organizations such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation appear to be some of the details Ottawa is trying to hammer out, according to stakeholders consulted by the government. “We don't want to see any kind of interruption. Real estate is not a financial slam dunk, Canadians are learning the hard way Mr. Lee said building affordable housing on public lands also won't be enough to get the government to its goal of 500,000 housing starts a year. (The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts was 283,734 units in June.) “Having something like that that was promised not get turned into official policy has really thrown another wrench into the system,” said Mr. Lee. Proposed GST rebate for first-time homebuyers could offer average relief of $27,000, PBO says Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne introduced legislation in late May to provide the GST rebates. Polling by Abacus Data shows U.S. President Donald Trump is the second-most important issue to Canadians, with housing and the economy nearly tied for third. “The government would be doing itself favours if they do the legwork now, because if it becomes a big concern, or the primary concern for Canadians, again, it might be too late to really address that,” Mr. Moffatt said. “However, the trade war kind of put a damper on things and really affected confidence in most of Canada, and that's when we saw, through the winter and spring, a lot of potential home buyers saying, ‘might as well sit it out,'” he said. These three housing markets are bucking national trends, and Trump is one reason why “The challenge is to get more demand for new construction at a time when building costs have gone up and and you've got now more inventory in the existing home market, in many places around Canada.” For example, the government could expand its proposed GST rebate so that all homebuyers of a primary residence are eligible, he said. Prof. Whitzman said social-housing builders also are seeking information on a number of programs, including the affordable housing fund, which provided capital for the repair of existing affordable and community housing. That fund recently ran out of money, leaving its future in limbo. “I'm not saying Build Canada Homes is a bad idea,” she said.

A man and a woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park as police seek a white male suspect

Two people were found dead along a walking trail in a state park in Arkansas, authorities said Sunday.

A 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman were found dead at Devil's Den state park in Washington county, according to the Arkansas state police. Its criminal investigation unit is handling what it calls a “suspected homicide”.

The suspect is a white male wearing dark shorts, a dark tank top and weight-lifting type gloves. He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan whose license plate may have been covered by electrical or duct tape.

The vehicle may have been traveling on State Highway 170 or State Highway 220 near the park, police said.

The victims' bodies were being taken to the Arkansas state crime lab, where the manner and cause of death will be determined.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia wants to resolve its war in Ukraine through "diplomatic and political means" but would continue military operations until its "goals" are achieved, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on July 27. Responding to a question from Russian state-controlled news agency Tass, Peskov said that "the goals of (war) must be fulfilled before the principles of future relations with Ukraine can be determined." The Kremlin has also demanded constitutional changes in Ukraine, including recognition of four Ukrainian oblasts as Russian territory, along with the Crimean peninsula, which it seized in 2014. Peskov claimed Russia would "prefer" to resolve the conflict through dialogue, but said military operations continue because "opponents rejected the path of negotiations." Kyiv has consistently supported negotiations but refused to accept Russia's maximalist conditions, which are essentially capitulation. Ukraine has also consistently rejected all demands that involve ceding territory or weakening its military. President Volodymyr Zelensky and top officials have said any peace must begin with an unconditional ceasefire. Peskov's comments came days after the third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, where Ukraine reiterated its call for a full ceasefire and humanitarian agreements. Russia's delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, proposed creating three working groups to address political, military, and humanitarian issues. Moscow also offered to facilitate brief ceasefires to retrieve wounded soldiers and repatriate bodies and claimed it would return the remains of 3,000 Ukrainian servicemen through the Red Cross. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. The decision to cancel the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg, an event traditionally held on the last Sunday of July, was announced by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on July 27, who said it was made "for security reasons." "We assessed your attempt yesterday to hit all of us at once," Brovdi said in the Telegram post,  without offering further details. "I am very open to having a public debate about the future of Austria's security and defense policy," Austria's Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger said. "Although there are currently no majorities in parliament and in the population for joining NATO, such a debate can still be very fruitful." Protests sweep Ukraine in response to the new controversial law, which carries grim implications for integration into the European Union as peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations resume. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed Russia would prefer to resolve the conflict through dialogue, but said military operations continue because "opponents rejected the path of negotiations." "Despite having very good interactions with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and phone calls, it never leads to anything," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. As another sign of deepening bilateral relations, Russia is set to launch direct passenger flights from Moscow to Pyongyang on July 27, marking the first air connection between the two capitals in decades. Russian forces launched an overnight attack on Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast on July 26, targeting civilian infrastructure and leaving three people injured, local authorities reported. The Vatican confirmed that Pope Leo received Metropolitan Anthony, the senior Russian Orthodox Church cleric who chairs its department of external church relations, along with five other high-profile clerics, during a morning audience on July 26. According to operational data by Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, Colonel Lebedev was leading assault operations in the Velykyi Burluk area of Kharkiv Oblast.</p>

Hours later, President Donald Trump endorsed that same lawmaker, Joe Gruters, to become the next chairman of the Republican National Committee. For DeSantis, the episode reinforced a pattern: picking fights that come back to haunt him. Trump's inner circle was already full of people who have no love lost for the Florida governor — a reality that has isolated DeSantis within his home state ever since he ended his 2024 presidential campaign. Ron DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could find himself running in a presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned. Casey DeSantis, meanwhile, has taken steps toward succeeding her husband in Tallahassee next year in a race that would pit her against Rep. Byron Donalds, a Naples Republican backed by both Trump and Gruters. With Trump's support, Gruters had previously filed to run for chief financial officer of Florida in 2026, a statewide position, and the RNC reelected the current party chairman, Michael Whatley, to another term in January following the GOP's successes last fall. While Gruters was RNC treasurer, a promotion seemed unlikely anytime soon. It also appeared as though DeSantis and Trump had largely buried the hatchet after their contentious presidential primary last year. They stood side-by-side earlier this month for the opening of a new migrant detention center in the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” where they showered each other in compliments. “You are my friend, and you'll always be my friend, and we may have some skirmishes, even in the future. I doubt it, but I will always come back, because we have blood that seems to match pretty well,” Trump said. But the political playing field changed rapidly Thursday, when Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, decided not to run for Senate in North Carolina. Whatley, a former party chair in the Tar Heel State, then made clear that he would run instead with Trump's backing, leaving an opening atop the party. By then, DeSantis had spent weeks trying to take down Gruters. He appointed state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a close ally, to become the state's CFO and immediately backed him in the GOP primary against Gruters. In appearances around Florida, he shrugged off Trump's endorsement while bashing Gruters' conservative credentials. My response would be, ‘No,'” DeSantis said earlier this month. “I can't do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead this state in a conservative direction.” The criticism continued Thursday when DeSantis appeared just outside Gruters' district to pile on more attacks. But that evening, Trump threw his support behind Whatley for US Senate and Gruters for RNC chair in a post on social media. The ramifications of DeSantis' maneuvering against Gruters quickly crystalized. “The governor did not see this coming at all,” a person close to DeSantis acknowledged. A spokesperson for DeSantis' political operation did not respond to questions from CNN. In 2018, DeSantis flouted the party establishment by running for governor and knocking off the preferred Republican thanks to Trump's support. He then unceremoniously jettisoned the operatives who helped him win, including veteran Republican strategist Susie Wiles and top adviser James Blair. Chris LaCivita, Trump's other campaign manager who feuded with DeSantis during the presidential primary, is spearheading the GOP's midterm efforts. Other Floridians more loyal to Trump than DeSantis have been handed key roles, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. DeSantis has yet to course correct as he regroups in Florida. He continues to recruit candidates to go up against Donalds — one of those Republicans who endorsed Trump over the governor — if Casey DeSantis doesn't run. “His blind spot is he doesn't have a magnanimous bone in his body,” a veteran Republican fundraiser in Florida said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With her short hair and unshowy clothing, Fan Chunli looks every bit the middle-aged woman from rural China. Among a crowd of youngsters vying to become the next breakout star in one of China's most popular stand-up comedy contests, she stands out. Hailing from a place where simply knowing how to use the internet “makes me the Elon Musk of my village,” Fan is the latest sensation in China's booming scene for stand-up comedy, an artform that offers an outlet for pent-up grievances in a country that often stifles open discussion of politics or society. But Fan's acerbic takes on patriarchy and domestic abuse have alarmed some officials in China, where women's rights remain a sensitive issue. Trying to boost birth rates and thwart a looming demographic crisis, the ruling Communist Party is urging women to embrace traditional gender roles. “When men are involved in domestic violence, it's not shameful. When women demand a divorce, it's shameful,” she said, drawing cheers during her performance at The King of Stand-up Comedy, a popular contest streamed by online platform iQiyi. Fan's performance appears to have chagrined at least one local government. As footage of her routine went viral last week, officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang issued a warning saying such jokes are “catalysts that provoke” gender conflict. “The content of some talk shows is gradually deviating from its nature of humor, simplifying gender issues and repeatedly making a fuss about the ‘opposition between men and women,'” the local government's publicity department wrote on Chinese social media platform WeChat. Any discussion of gender issues, it said, should be “rational.” China's government has cracked down on feminist activism over the past decade. Most notably, a group of women who became known as the “Feminist Five” were arrested after planning protests on public transport against sexual harassment in 2015. Authorities have, however, allowed some mild-mannered discussion on social media, while movies featuring feminist themes continue to screen without a problem – as long as they do not amount to a call for action, experts say. But Fan's background – provincial, not well off or highly educated – may be contributing to official disquiet over her popularity, adding an extra layer of scrutiny. “And this seems to indicate that this kind of discontent and grievance related to gender issues and the traditional Confucian, patriarchal values is probably more widespread than they (the authorities) are willing to acknowledge,” she told CNN. Late last year, Chinese e-commerce giant JD faced a boycott by customers infuriated by its casting of trailblazing woman comedian Yang Li in a promotional live stream. Those leading the action were apparently still stung by Yang's signature quip from five years ago, chiding mediocre men: “How come he looks so average, yet still so confident?” Fan has never openly identified herself as a feminist. “But when I talk about my divorce outside, the audience applauds.” Growing up away from China's major cities, she didn't receive any formal education until the age of 8, she told Chinese state-owned Sanlian Lifeweek in an interview. Raised in an era when opportunities mostly went to men, she recalled picking up a job in a city before getting married, and her mother handing all the money she sent home to her brother. “Girls growing up in rural villages have no rights to inherit anything. But after getting married, she found out “family and marriage trapped women, making it impossible for them to make money.” For Fan, life before stand-up was a cleaning job at an obscure village in her home province of Shandong, in China's northeast. Her path to stardom started with an unlikely twist. In 2023, struggling to make ends meet, she recalled selling her jewelry to see a performance by her idol, a comedian named Li Bo, state-run media reported. She also poked fun at his uncouth manners, saying he ate congee – a popular Chinese rice porridge – directly from the ladle. She ran home to tell her parents that she wanted a divorce, only to be deterred by her mother, who told her to break up the relationship only if he was having an affair. “This time,” she recalled thinking, “I'm leaving without looking back.” During her viral performance, she moved from innocent self-mockery to full-throttled roasting of her ex-husband, who she calls a “corgi” because of his diminutive stature. Apart from her marriage, she also opened up about other taboo topics for Chinese women, such as oft-marginalized biological realities. Noting her newfound late-life stardom, she said that – unlike many women who retire when their periods stop – “my menopause will come with my debut.” Fans who CNN spoke to are rooting for the rising female comedy scene in China, pushing back against Zhejiang officials' warning against “gender opposition.” Zhang Yuanqi said she watched Fan's show with her mother, who similarly left an abusive home, a decade ago. She said comedians like Fan are “not trying to stir up ‘gender opposition'; they're just turning their life experiences into jokes.” “What we want to hear is our own lives,” she said. What's really behind the officials' thinking?” added Huang, who said she hopes to take her mother to see Fan perform in person. As of Sunday, Fan's Weibo account remains active (a deactivation would be one of the first signs a performer has fallen afoul of China's censorship apparatus) – though some posts railing against the veiled official warning have been removed. “The biggest change in me since I've started doing stand-up comedy is that I no longer get angry at my ex-husband's every move,” Fan told Sanlian.</p>
