Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has endured a rocky launch, with widespread reports of poor performance overshadowing its otherwise positive critical reception. Despite favorable reviews, subpar optimization has sparked significant furor among players. In response to the backlash, publisher 505 Games has rolled out a series of patches aimed at improving performance, something that's become customary for modern AAA releases. For context, a game at 100% resolution scaling is supposed to render natively — meaning it outputs frames at the same resolution as your display without relying on upscalers like DLSS or FSR. Upscaling only comes into play when the internal resolution is lowered to gain performance, but in this case, the game is apparently using hidden upscaling while falsely reporting a native resolution. In his testing, Owen compared Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' launch version with the 1.4 patch that just came out, using an RTX 3060 at 1440p Ultra settings. In the launch version, at 100% resolution scaling, TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) delivered 29 FPS, serving as the baseline for native performance. At 100% TSR, performance suddenly jumped from 29 FPS to 37 FPS — a 28% increase that far exceeds typical optimization gains from a minor patch. Meanwhile, at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling, the performance boost was a modest 2–3 FPS, suggesting that the "native" 100% setting was no longer truly native. The behavior with DLSS and FSR confirmed Owen's suspicions. On the launch version, DLSS at 100% (labeled as “DLAA,” or native-resolution antialiasing) delivered 28 FPS, with predictable gains as the resolution was lowered. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Yet, again, the performance at 67%, 59%, and 50% scaling improved only slightly, pointing to a hidden resolution cap at what seems to be 80–85% of native resolution, even when players think they are running fully native. According to Owen, this behavior is a direct manipulation of the resolution scaling slider: “I'm absolutely not on board with a game lying about being at native rendering resolution. Players who have hardware powerful enough to run natively simply can't anymore. What's more, patch notes for version 1.3 included a vague line about “adjustments to super sampling resolution limits on select GPU models,” which may have been a quiet attempt to hide this change. In reality, the update seems less like a performance optimization and more like a forced upscaling placebo to artificially boost frame rates. While upscaling has become an industry standard — most modern games encourage using DLSS, FSR, or TSR for better performance, one would at least expect the game to run at native if they choose to do so. By clamping resolution and mislabeling settings, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is going beyond just blatantly lying about the image quality, rather they're robbing players of control over their graphics fidelity. Hahaha this game is the gift that keeps on giving. For players, this means the game looks softer or more pixelated even when maxed out. What's funny is that there is a clear 2-3 FPS improvement with the optimization patch at non-native scaling, meaning that actual work has been done to extract more juice out of the game. This discovery is likely to cause further backlash unless 505 Games issues a statement or reverts these changes. Until then, users with sharp eyes (and sharp GPUs) may find Wuchang: Fallen Feathers looking worse than ever, despite what the settings menu claims.

The company's Lib Earth House Construction (machine translation) process uses a massive 3D printing assembly, rather like others we have seen used for building coffee shops, bus stops, and so on. However, instead of relying on cement to create concrete, Lib Earth dwelling utilize a patent pending mix of earth, slaked lime, and natural fibers. The materials mix outlined above reminds us somewhat of wattle and daub, a building material and technique that has been around perhaps 6,000 years. So there should be no real worries about living in a ‘mud' house, as long as the construction has been finished correctly. Actually, Lib Work notes that its structures “have a strength equivalent to earthquake resistance grade 3, making it a safe home to live in even in Japan, a country prone to earthquakes.” Indeed, grade 3 is the highest rating for such architectural durability in Japan. Structures which would be a challenge to fabricate from traditional building sheet materials don't phase 3D printers. The Lib Earth model B, unveiled recently, with its cluster arrangement, is far more sophisticated and home-like, as you can see from the imagery. Lib Work's charts indicate that its 3D printing mix for homes is made from 65% soil and sand, the with the next largest chunk consisting of slaked lime binding material, finished off with a few percent of natural fibers and ‘other' stuff. According to these figures, the new material's reliance on “soil, lime, and natural fibers that are abundantly available on Earth,” and eschewing of cement, means far lower CO2 generated per residence. This figure is reduced by more than half, to 22,434kg of CO2, when using the new 3D printing construction tech and sustainable materials. That's even better than a ‘wooden house,' it goes on to claim. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Naturally, on Mars, the planned major component of buildings from Lib Work would be Martian dirt. Soil and dirt are generally regarded as lowly materials, even extending to being insults. However, common earth's status might improve by becoming a valued building material for modern, sustainable 3D printed dwellings. Numerous YouTube videos provide evidence that it is possible to polish dirt. Whether this technique could be used in the finishing of your 3D printed soil house, for marble effect features, remains to be seen. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

But the title says it all.

"Nuclear modernization" refers to the development of the Sentinel missile to replace the Minuteman III missile. It is arguably not a modernization at all. It is a spectacular example of spreading seemingly endless money around for political ends. It's a $140+ billion boondoggle that has somehow escaped the attention of DOGE while they were hunting down what they claim is $170 billion in fraud and waste in places like the national parks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A transitional step for manufacturing and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Kioxia and SanDisk have begun sample shipments of their ninth-generation BiCS FLASH, a NAND flash technology that blends legacy architectures with modern enhancements to create a bridge between the current BiCS8 generation and the forthcoming BiCS10. While BiCS10 is expected to deliver higher capacities through a cutting-edge 332-layer design, BiCS9 takes a more cost-optimized approach, targeting enterprise SSDs built for AI workloads and mid-tier storage solutions where efficiency and performance balance are key. What sets BiCS9 apart is its hybrid construction, achieved through CMOS directly Bonded to Array (CBA) technology. In this process, the logic and memory cell wafers are fabricated separately under optimized conditions before being bonded into a single, high-performance package. Despite employing fewer layers than BiCS8 or the next-gen BiCS10, BiCS9 still brings meaningful upgrades. An 8% increase in bit density further underscores the careful engineering that allows BiCS9 to deliver strong performance without inflating costs. Kioxia's roadmap positions BiCS9 as a transitional step, enabling the company to refine manufacturing techniques and performance tuning ahead of BiCS10's more complex, high-density architecture. While competitors push beyond 300 layers, Kioxia is focusing on hybrid architectures that offer faster time-to-market and better cost efficiency. Working with a consumer-facing industry veteran like SanDisk ensures Kioxia, who invented NAND flash, stays highly competitive through mixed R&D efforts. Therefore, the company's long-standing partnership with SanDisk has been instrumental in shaping the BiCS series, combining Japanese manufacturing expertise with SanDisk's deep storage market presence. Since their joint venture began in 2006, the two companies have co-developed multiple generations of 3D NAND technology, pushing the limits of scaling and performance.

Popular bleach brand Clorox filed a case against Cognizant, its IT provider, after the company discovered that the latter had simply given away access credentials to hackers posing as employees. According to an NBC News Report, this breach allowed Scattered Spider, a hacking group that targets company service desks, to infect Clorox with ransomware in August 2023. This IT support gaffe allegedly resulted in around $380 million worth of damage and disruption for Clorox. Cognizant manages Clorox's internal networks, and employees who have issues with their passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and VPNs must coordinate with the IT provider to regain access to their system. Such action would contradict the policies that have been set in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access, which Ars Technica says include an internal verification and self-reset password tool. This would reset their password, but it will also email the employee and their supervisor to help ensure some level of security. One partial call transcript provides evidence of this, with the alleged hacker telling the Cognizant employee, “I don't have a password, so I can't connect.” They then replied without hesitation, “Oh, ok. Ok. So, let me provide the password to you, okay?” Assuming the identity of authorized personnel is one of the most basic social engineering attacks, which is why many IT companies deploy several measures against it. However, it seems that Cognizant's employees were too trusting and violated protocol, potentially leading to millions of dollars in losses for Clorox. This goes to show that no matter how robust and sophisticated your cybersecurity is, it can always be breached at its weakest point. “Cognizant was not duped by any elaborate ploy or sophisticated hacking techniques,” the lawsuit asserts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Intel's transformation under CEO Lip-Bu Tan is entering a ruthless new phase. The company, which only days ago revealed $2.9 billion in quarterly losses and the slashing of 15% of its workforce (something it already planned since last year), is now spinning off its Network and Edge Group (NEX) as a standalone business. It's the latest move in a "sweeping effort" to streamline Intel's core operations while divesting anything that doesn't fit Tan's new, AI-first strategy. The plan, confirmed through a customer memo first reported by CRN and later corroborated by The Register, outlines Intel's intention to find strategic investors for NEX. The NEX business, which covers networking silicon, Ethernet, and communications infrastructure, will now chart its own course. During its Q2 earnings call, Tan described Intel as being “overextended and inefficient,” citing a workforce reduction to 75,000 employees—a drop of over 30,000 from early 2025—and a pivot away from its once all-consuming foundry expansion plans. Even Intel's crown jewel, its process technology roadmap, is on the chopping block. Tan warned that Intel's next-generation 14A (1.4nm-class) node could be canceled entirely if the company fails to secure a major external customer, effectively surrendering the cutting-edge process race to TSMC and Samsung. Intel's core CPU roadmap remains on track, at least for now. On the server side, Granite Rapids is progressing, but AMD's EPYC dominance continues to challenge Intel's position in hyperscale workloads. With the NEX division spun out, Intel hopes to tighten its focus on these critical markets while cutting off segments that dilute margins. Like Altera, which Intel sold a 51% stake in to Silver Lake earlier this year, NEX could thrive as an independent entity free from Intel's corporate bureaucracy. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has already admitted to having fallen way behind in a previous memo as well. Whether these bold moves will pay off depends on Intel's ability to execute on its AI roadmap, deliver competitive x86 products, and—perhaps most critically—find the partners it needs to keep its process technology ambitions alive.

Two years later, the fracture grew so large that a gigantic iceberg almost twice the size of New York City broke free in a process called calving, sending scientists scrambling to investigate the icy chunk, which they named iceberg A-81. By devising a mathematical model to account for natural forces affecting ice shelves, the researchers found that iceberg A-81—and most other icebergs, for that matter—likely snapped off from tidal forces buffeting the ice shelves in spring, when the currents are strongest. The paper, published in Nature Communications on July 24, supports common-sense assumptions about environmental forces playing a major role in driving calving events, but the proposed model could also improve prediction models for calving events, a historically challenging task. “Understanding what controls the timing of these events is crucial, because calving not only affects the shape and melt rate of ice shelves but also their long-term stability,” said study lead author Oliver Marsh, in a statement. Next, they tested their predictions against GPS and radar data, paying close attention to the subtle movements and stresses that appeared within the ice shelf over time. The model, however, is a simplified interpretation of real-life dynamics in Antarctica, the study authors admitted, and it better explains smaller, gradual changes in crack behavior. This means that more dramatic events—like extreme temperatures from climate change—will cause even bigger rifts in the ice. “Tides and wind are key to the timing of small individual rift growth events here,” the authors wrote in the paper, “but it is notable that an iceberg collision in 2021 caused more substantial rift growth in a single event than throughout 2020.” Large icebergs also influence ocean circulation and local ecosystems, so the new model could serve as a useful tool for structuring research projects in Antarctica, Marsh explained. “Icebergs like A-81 can be thousands of square kilometers in size and account for roughly half of all ice lost from Antarctica each year,” Marsh said. “This kind of insight brings us closer to forecasting major ice loss events and their impact on sea level with far greater precision.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hi, we're Shraman and Shreyas Kar, brothers and founders of Golpo: the most powerful AI video generator for explainer videos. Golpo turns your documents, internal workflows (PDFs, Jira boards, GitHub repos, Google Calendars, etc.) into fully produced, customizable explainer videos through our platform or API in any language. Our videos can be used for anything from creating complex workflows, product demos, technical papers, or even stories starring your baby cousin and Captain Underpants in Bengali. Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc… But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is exactly why governments should step in and regulate Visa and MasterCard, to prevent them from banning porn or other adult services.If this kind of banning goes too far, there will come a point when even Joe Blow and his dog start using cryptocurrency. And once (truly private and anonymous) cryptocurrency becomes widely circulated, people will no longer need to exchange it back into fiat currency. Joe might start paying other people directly with crypto and eventually, perhaps even his rent, utilities, groceries...?And then what?

I know, I know, crypto bad, but when censorship comes for [insert your thing/country here], it kind of becomes obvious why people talked about crypto before btc was six digits. Anyone who knows how tech works and also any history about how authoritarian states work should probably see why crypto got so big in the first place, long before [insert scam that makes otherwise sensible people disregard an entire class of technology here]. I've tried a couple times looking up address/wallet history and of course nothing comes up and every time I have that "oh yeah" moment. Game of Thrones, both the books and the show, contain content much, much more explicit than many of these games. Yet Itch and Steam have to pull stuff or their very existence is threatened. One of the slippery slopes here would be that initially they go after smaller players and then work their way up. Would they ultimately go after Amazon or Warner Bros? It's not totally clear to me that they wouldn't. I don't have strong feelings around wether steam or itch sell adult content, but its the fact that a duopoly and using their power to exert political influence.

That's the low hanging fruit for a massive power grab The problem is that card companies can/will/did blackmail multiple companies into changing, and in some small cases shut-down their entire businesses.In a post-cash world, this is completely unacceptable, and a blatant power grab. If the payment processors are allowed to set this precedent, then there will be nothing to stop these for-profit companies from blocking anybody, anywhere from buying anything - for any or no reason.People are blaming a specific protest group. And honestly if a tiny group from a tiny economy are so easily able to control international macroeconomics, then the root cause is still that the card services are vulnerable to such an attack.The only appropriate response is swift and severe regulation of these critically necessary card and banking services, up to and including the dissolution of both Visa and MasterCard - and in the US strict caps on card fees, as well as an amendment to the Constitution ensure that our right to own property permanently includes the right to buy property.Are the payment providers going to weaponize their de facto control over all purchases to target guns next? Is a company called "MasterCard" for or against letting people with your skin color buy food? Nobody should have to know.It doesn't matter where you land politically, the point is that these companies cannot be allowed to wield this kind of control. ...Because we can't go back to cash anymore, and they very much know it.

There are legitimate issues with even the biggest and most respected porn sites being very lax with taking down underage and nonconsensual content. The card companies AFAICT aren't being pressured to reform because of this kind of content, but more the LGBT content which is harming nobody. Credit has become ubiquitous, in a manner that belies its supposed purpose, at least as was originally practiced before consumers were offered and employed credit for absolutely everything.Then again, governments and "regulated" entities are also capable of blackmail. I'm not sure these private companies would ever have an incentive to care about what you spend their money on unless governments gave them a reason to - which is why this is happening.

It's not complicated to realise that this achieves none of the stated objectives In the US at least the classier vibrators have been starting to be sold first at shops like Sharper Image, and now, indeed, grocery stores. The packaging of course would not raise any questions from kids, and they are sold in the same aisles as condoms and lubricant. I'd be more interested in questioning these than why porn is available on Steam. I mean, Disney is essentially an anti-porn product, so I get that, but Netflix is a perfectly reasonable platform for porn. This doesn't seem like a grassroots movement. This doesn't seem like a grassroots movement. This doesn't seem like a grassroots movement. Collective Shout, the group behind this latest censorship push, also wanted Detroit Become Human to be banned because the story depicted someone abusing a child. If we're banning that, why not ban memoirs of child abuse survivors or "James and the Giant Peach"?You suggest it would be easy for Steam and Itch to run alternative storefronts. To say nothing of the technical work involved,  those high-risk payment processors certainly charge more for their services. That'd raise the already high 30% that Valve takes on most transaction.Additionally, if a games journalism website also has relationships with payment processors, are they allowed to review adult games even if those reviews don't include pictures? Or are they going to be equally punished for giving adult content a positive rating?This all limits the options available of responsible adult consumers and costs creators of LEGAL content revenue.===†Here's a longer look at your examples:Define adult toys.

I'm no prude, but it's really weird to me. Personally I think this is a good thing. On their presence in the first place, I'd say if a shop is going to sell condoms and lubricant, also holding basic sex tools isn't a big stretch. One shouldn't confuse games with real life. They also sell magazines with nudity.ESPN did The Body Issue magazine in stores for a decade [1]If a kid has access to steam, do they not have access to the internet?

If you are parental blocking the internet, then why not steam? If you are parental blocking the internet, then why not steam? Because the payment processing is unreliable and prohibitively expensive. For all the whining about "moral pearl clutching", the reality is that adult oriented businesses deal with massively higher rates of fraud and charge-backs. Visa and Mastercard couldn't care less about the ethical issues, it's simply a risk calculation for their business. The answer is, I think, monopoly environments: they contain poor incentive structures for competitive differentiation, and encourage extreme risk aversion by the monopolists. This gets repeated, but it's not the real reason. If it were, Visa/MasterCard would be fine with a store like Steam offering those games as e.g. crypto-only purchases. This is the same problem dating sites, gambling, etc. Any sufficiently large adult oriented business becomes a de-facto payment processor, where their entire core business function is in managing this risk, not whatever they actually do for the end user. Which makes sense - you have buyers and sellers who insist on anonymity, services that leave no trace once rendered, buyers and sellers lying to family and friends about what they're doing, etc.There's often no "normal" amount of consumption, for example, some sellers receive million dollar tips.Money laundering is a massive problem, and it enables some really terrible things.I suspect the fact that American banks are so anti-porn comes from the fact that the American financial sector has such strong anti-money laundering regs (as opposed to, say, the American real estate sector, or the UK financial sector).One of the reasons OF is doing well is because they insist on following know your customer laws. Not many porn platforms could function that way.

At this point, nearly all key purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be fraud-sourced. As a result we have decided that newly purchased keys will not be tradeable or marketable.Many users still suspect it happens, although it's hard to prove. The initial regulation also didn't suppress content, it just made you have to go through age verification, which everyone knows doesn't work. There have been several scandals related to payment processing and money laundering, and some of them connected to companies that do a lot of business with porn. Usually, you will see banks breaking away when those scandals break to the public.However, banks do not break away just because they don't like the transactions they're seeing. What they actually do is to enforce stricter rules by financially penalizing those who make them lose money. Your transactions are getting canceled a lot (by having to be flagged/undone/paid back etc.)? You'll have to pay higher fees, and if it keeps happening, you will lose your license.You know when they do often break immediately, however? When there are campaigns by special interests groups, usually connected to conservative groups, to paint companies as having illegal content, even when they don't have this problem any more than any social media platform. In those cases, they don't wait for any tribunal. What they actually do is to enforce stricter rules by financially penalizing those who make them lose money.

Last Tuesday we got a notice that one of our merchant accounts was shutting us down. Feels like we really need something like India's UPI that doesn't have a central company imposing beyond-the-law level rules. And besides, why do payment processors even know/care what their customers use their money for as long as it's legal?If you want to ban porn, fine, but do it through the law, and don't let every company make their own laws. Especially if they are a quasi monopoly (have power). If you want to ban porn, fine, but do it through the law, and don't let every company make their own laws.

Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. Bonus: it also aims to eliminate sex ed. eliminate central promotion of abortion; comprehensive sexuality education; and the new woke gender ideology eliminate central promotion of abortion; comprehensive sexuality education; and the new woke gender ideology This way, abusers can disagree about what constitutes abuse in private, but can form a bloc in public, unifying around the common ground that the boss's whims should be respected in matters where the bandying about of facts is taboo. They seem totally fine with the age checks many states are enacting for porn sites. The Republican Party loves slagging pedophiles (real or imagined) and hating on LGBTQIA+ people or trying to make their lives as difficult/horrible as possible.Yeah some games delisted were horrible. One of the main offenders had already been pulled as soon as Steam (or was it Itch) was notified. The platforms were policing themselves well.But not only did gratuitous porn games and abuse games get delisted, lots of games on related to inclusiveness of LGBTQIA+ did too from what I'm seeing from developers on social media.I suspect if anything the administration would be happy to let people use this as yet another hammer in their culture war against such people existing.That's why.

Sure you can use a payment processor, but look it's someone to pressure to prevent you from taking money again.Maybe Crypto? That's an institution to pressure to block you again.If your new system interacts with the old system at all there is an attack point. The only solution to this is regulation, and I don't see that happening.

Currently the issue is that these two payment systems - both credit/debit card networks - (1) have the power to decide with impunity, because they have critical mass. )For example, right now a bank would have a VERY hard time preventing you from paying for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT with crypto. Nobody in there has both visibility and power.For example, right now some vendors accept gift cards as payment. Buy a Home Depot gift card in cash at your local store and use it to pay for $OBJECTIONABLE_CONTENT. Obviously this is not a very efficient payment infrastructure but it exists.But yes of course, imposing to credit card networks to be content-blind would be helpful and soooo much more efficient.

The problem with alternatives to things like OnlyFans is that the performers who work through OnlyFans want to go where people can find them. More cumbersome payment method, but better than outright banning them.If the payment processors try to dictate what content these sites may host even when it  involves competing processors that sounds quite anti-competitive practice. If the payment processors try to dictate what content these sites may host even when it  involves competing processors that sounds quite anti-competitive practice. Probably the only way around it is to spin up a completely different corporate entity which only allows for payments via wire transfer, ACH, or perhaps some of the various payment apps available. Pretty soon (in the U.S.) all porn and sexual-adjacent content is going to be illegal. > (For anyone thinking crypto: we have a different idea of what it means to be either "realistically viable" or to "compete with Steam")Wow, not crypto, but GP fucking nailed it. Wow, not crypto, but GP fucking nailed it. > Bezos: We got an order from somebody in Bulgaria, and this person sent us cash through the mail to pay for their order. And they put these two $100 bills inside a floppy disk. And then they put a note on the cover of the floppy disk, and they mailed this whole thing to us. It shows you the effort that some people will go to be able to buy things if they also don't have good alternatives.But if we're talking about a hypothetical Steam competitor, then Steam still exists and takes credit cards. Yes, a small business in the 90s may have been able to make it work, but it's not the 90s anymore. Fix those problems and the payment processors won't have a reason anymore to ban porn (or anything). What's the point of a capitalist economy if not for startups to target market needs like these? This is commonly repeated, but doesn't hold up. Chargeback fees (especially for card-not-present transactions) are paid by the merchant and are simply increased (with reserves required) for high-risk accounts. It also wouldn't make sense to target hyper-specific niches if it were really about chargebacks, they would go after all of it, and go after things like the CS marketplace.But the biggest giveaway IMO is that they do not allow, e.g., Steam selling these games crypto-only. If it was really about specific titles having high fraud/chargeback rates, selling them some other way would be fine. But the biggest giveaway IMO is that they do not allow, e.g., Steam selling these games crypto-only. If it was really about specific titles having high fraud/chargeback rates, selling them some other way would be fine. Charge backs, etc... can be effectively solved by appropriately pricing in such risks (or not offering those services at all).This isn't a payment processor issue, it's a political choice. The problem is that they aren't being told "we won't let people buy this through us", they're told "this needs to go entirely or no more credit cards for you". The problem isn't just "the Payment Processor doesn't want to support this game" but also "this game shows Guilt-By-Association that your platform's money might go to 'criminals' or 'sinners'. "Guilt-By-Association is real gross, but a large part of the current fight, too, especially looking at itch.io's payment processor-required actions, not just Steam's. Guilt-By-Association is real gross, but a large part of the current fight, too, especially looking at itch.io's payment processor-required actions, not just Steam's. All of those are still prone to censorship if the attacking group is motivated enough. Even crypto, which should be the ideal solution to this problem, is not ideal because most transactions are performed through centralized exchanges which can easily blacklist whatever transactions they want. You can't even realistically have a F2P game that requires a high spec machine because of how the market works. Instead, you become the hub for that kind of material — and that reputation drives away more mainstream creators who won't want their work associated with it. See also: Kick, Parlor, etc.Rather than building a principled broad competitor to something like Steam, you end up cornering yourself into a narrow, highly specific market segment.

Not everyone cares about financial censorship, but the few that do will be your customers. He is also a streamer on kick, and actually talks in the way I demonstrated. There are the FedNow tokens and ACH which could help but it still requires quite a bit of cost to begin even that route. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point> Operation Choke Point was an initiative of the United States Department of Justice beginning in 2013 which investigated banks in the United States and the business they did with firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other companies that, while operating legally, were said to be at a high risk for fraud and money laundering.There's a whole list on the Wikipedia article of the kinds of legal businesses that were targeted by this. Some of them make sense, but others look like very serious 1A and 2A violations. > Operation Choke Point was an initiative of the United States Department of Justice beginning in 2013 which investigated banks in the United States and the business they did with firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other companies that, while operating legally, were said to be at a high risk for fraud and money laundering.There's a whole list on the Wikipedia article of the kinds of legal businesses that were targeted by this.

Had to look into it a bit.From looking at the text of the bill, it looks like the sponsor did not like Operation Choke Point [0], which was specifically targeting banks that did business with Payday Lenders, Ponzi Schemes, and other shady vendors.This also included pornography, but I'm willing to bet that's not what Sen. Cramer was upset about. More likely, he's simply serving the interest of his donors.He also might have extremist "small business" constituents that are perhaps selling racist/sexist/homophobic merch, and they don't like being told that their bank/credit card processors are refusing to process payments on that swag.

It seems to me like if you thought something was good and then switched to thinking it was bad based just on who proposed it, you need to stop being prejudiced. Evaluate ideas (or bills) for their merits, not based on who originated them. If they are easy to sway in one direction, why not the other? Simply do what Collective Shout did, but in the opposite direction? But you're doing this with credit cards already? Different amounts, but still supporting everyone in a chain. Polygon (and USDT/USDC on Polygon) fees are near zero, Ethereum is lately very cheap, and even Bitcoin fees are no longer outrageous. If you can't use the payment processor, who cares what their fees are? (not saying they are cheaper or more expensive than crypto - I don't know) A lot of p0rn payment processing is done in crypto for exactly the censorship reasons. If you can't use the payment processor, who cares what their fees are? (not saying they are cheaper or more expensive than crypto - I don't know) Between that and someone actually creating a viable Steam competitor, I will say the government breaking them up and rolling out their own solution would be even less likely. You'd have fights on both sides of the isle and from privacy groups. Not that we have much privacy now under the current scheme, but there's at least a tiny bit of separation between V/MC and the government.What should happen instead is regulation. When I used to kill cops in GTA Vice City as a kid, 20 years ago, I wasn't killing actual cops(duh!). Has society lost their collective marbles since then, and can't differentiate what's a real crime and what's manufactured fiction anymore? If we banned those games for being too erotic, we should also ban those books then, because in those books, women subject themselves to a lot of degenerate smut and they love reading that shit, yet nobody judges them or asks for that to be censored.So then why is society and the private sector bowing down to some screeching harpies activist group who just want to ban all stuff they dislike, even though it's all legal to the T and nobody is being hurt?Why isn't this activist group putting pressure to release the Epstein files, since actual kids have been harmed there? Are they going undercover with police officers into human trafficking orgs to fight child abuse? NOOO, of course not, it's much easier to claim you scored a victory for child abuse by going after people's video games for having computer generated pixels of kids. None of the games banned by Valve in the Visa/Mastercard scandal had any CSAM related stuff in them, they were just weird/degenerate for puritans, however they were not illegal.BTW, has anyone seen the female erotica book section in Barns & Noble?

There is a checkered history of Visa/Mastercard dropping legitimate causes because it's hot politically. Unfortunately Visa/Mastercard have a monopoly on the market and they use it regularly to keep out competition. Bitcoin/crypto was supposed to be the way around this kind of censorship, but that's basically a ponzi scheme so that's not the way forward.

It's already difficult to moderate content on a somewhat serious online forum like Hacker News.

Deviations from that default veer into "telling other people how to live their lives" territory. Sometimes it's right and proper to actively interfere in the lives of others. It is occasionally even extremely important to do this. But -the majority of the time- the folks doing this are nothing more than busybodies sticking their noses in other people's business.You might think that US-based businesses should not be permitted to accept payments tendered by the two major credit and debit card processors for the sale of more-extreme pornographic content. I think it's none of those processors' business what legal goods consenting adults purchase using their systems.Given Visa and MasterCard's enormous size, I think it's absolutely essential that they not be permitted to refuse any legal purchase for any reason other than credible suspicion of fraud.

The point I'm more interested in here is the "Why do you people always presume they know what is best for other people?". Often it's rooted in extensive experience and literature. I don't think it's a good notion to outright disregard everyone who seems to have a better idea on how people should live. Among other things, not everyone needs to make the same mistakes over and over again, like falling into an addiction, just because "they can't tell me to not fall into this addiction".And yeah, there will be a lot of busybodies as well.

If anything, it's actually the other way around. Morals are what people think makes society better, and their absence worse.There's lots of other ways to dislike something besides morals.For example, I don't like spectator sports. It's not a moral issue, just taste, so me not watching sport is genuinely sufficient.Conversely, I think analytics tracking is harmful to society even though I also find it interesting to see the results, and should be banned.

That's inferiority complex pushed into moral superiority feeling. All just emotions of unbalanced/uneducated people who should know better but clearly don't. No place for such behavior in truly democratic society, their rights to decide what should be happening and what shouldn't generally end at the door of their house (and even that just within legal framework).Otherwise lets give some room for neonazis too for example, they certainly have a vision about how the society should look like and behave. They are at the end just bunch of folks who want to change society for what they consider a better one, right?

In the US, there were concerted attempts (like the First Amendment to the Constitution) to prevent that from being the government's job, because of the fear that government would use that job to suppress dissent and coerce opinions.If payment processors are picking up that job, and doing so in a coordinated manner that doesn't allow porn companies to simply say "use these payment rails to do business with us, not those ones," it is not unreasonable to suspect that they are doing so not for their own business interests but as a proxy for powers that the government is denied.

Thank baby jebus that this sort of thing never happens. Can you imagine if our government were to, for instance, threaten to deport our own citizens, publicly, for disagreeing with the government. The real censorship here is that a system has been constructed where payments must be funnelled through a small number of blessed companies and it has been set up that way to ... promote censorship. If it wasn't for anticompetitive regulations one of these game devs could just branch into banking. We've actually seen that dynamic play out in most of our lifetimes - in the early phase of crypto it was mtgox.com [0] that triggered the transition from cool nerd curio in the internet backwaters to a billion dollar market. In Europe they regulated exchange fees down to something like 0.3%. They just said the fees shall be low and lo, they were low.They could also easily regulate that credit card networks can't block obscene content. They could also easily regulate that credit card networks can't block obscene content. Anyway, some people wouldn't even call it censorship if private businesses disagree and decide not to do business, for any reason, even if it's public pressure. Should private payment processors be free to choose whose money they process? They also still have the right to use other payment processors, and/or create their own.I'd be willing to bet the payment processors in question would rather not be forced to cut off business, and do not care whether people pay for porn. They are simply trying to avoid public backlash and avoid being blacklisted by a large number of people who happen to believe porn is damaging.

I don't really the ultimate purpose of the position taken by either side here, but it does seem to me that there's a path by which both can coexist, even if difficult. Some network connectivity is needed (Alice, Bob, and Charlie all on the same network) but it still works if the internet partitions. We incentivize Bob to keep his device available for this by creating a new debt when the transaction settles: this time it's one where Alice and Charlie owe Bob for having been the transaction processor.If Bob didn't want to act in this capacity, he wouldn't have trusted Alice and Charlie to begin with. That's a desirable outcome, if we must have something like censorship, it should not depend on the feeling of some guy who owns a bank but is otherwise unconnected with the parties of the transaction. It should be decided by the people who are near to Alice and Bob on the trust graph and therefore have to deal with the real world consequences of Alice and Bob's behavior. If they want to collectively prevent those two from doing business, that's their right since it's their community that that business is happening in.One imagines this featuring in cases where some rich foreigner wants to set up mining operations that would poison the drinking water.

Instead, they develop through a complex interaction of psychological, developmental, neurological, and cultural factors.One theory is that, if a person repeatedly experiences sexual arousal in the presence of a specific object or situation (even coincidentally), the brain may begin to link that stimulus with arousal (classical conditioning). In both cases, the fetish can be considered “latent” in the sense that it existed prior to one's encounter with porn related to that fetish. There is not one person who fits that median in all respects. Even if you can't find a partner who finds your specific fetish “appealing”, there are plenty of women out there who won't specifically judge you for it either. But I'd disqualify any potential partner who thought less of me for liking tacos.

Now imagine if this was done for different proclivities: alcoholics, speadfreaks, over-eaters, game-addicts. Do you want the government limiting those activities for everyone because a minority lacks self-control? I am writing this from the tail end of a 4-day techno music festival. Porn might involve large media files which gives it an up-front advantage re: "more", but it doesn't create shockwaves the way censorship does. Remove a porn video and the world stays largely unchanged. They delete opposing comments, shadowban users, harsh language usually gets automatically deleted by the platform  - and all that shouting-down is actually just counted as "engagement" which algorithmically boosts and spreads the bad idea further. The argument just directly profits the person with the bad idea, and incentivizes them to come up with even worse ideas to make everybody even madder.This kind of censorship is causing a whole lot of problems right now. Still, I have to admit that porn can be extremely destructive. [citation needed]I'll grant that there is sex trafficking going on at least in the fringes of the porn industry - but that's at least in part because of censorship. If porn production was widely legal and appropriately regulated, there'd be significantly less market for the edgy stuff filmed in Eastern European basements (i.e. the exact same argument as for marijuana legalisation).There are also a bunch of regimes around the world who love censorship, and also engage in a bunch of human trafficking.

From my perspective a lot of consenting adults are making a lot of money by willingly participating in the industry. It's not an excuse to shut down commerce between consenting adults. You only need to type any random sexual thing and find any explicit subreddit you want, that's how pervasive the porn is on even an allegedly non-porn platform. Every other game has basically stripper-level female characters now days.

I have news for you my friend, the Christian right is fucking people up way more than porn.So is the NoFap/incel movement.There are some pretty fucked up people who see women as breeding machines. This is tied pretty closely to the great replacement conspiracy theory and similar white nationalist conspiracy theories.People who believe this junk promote the idea that porn is bad because they want young men desperately horny so they breed with women either with or without their consent.

If people feel incomplete and try to fill that gap with a porn habit, the porn is an indicator of a problem, not the problem itself. Filling that gap with right wing propaganda doesn't address the problem, it just changes it into something that can be used for political advantage.You're missing the root causes here.

The reality is that they're religious zealots who feel the need to prevent other people from making their own choices about something their religious leaders have told them is evil. They can't admit their real goal though, or people will realize it's just westernized Sharia law and stop taking them seriously.

If the things being criticised appear in many areas, it is hard not to draw the conclusion that they chose their target because it involves sex, and that is what they have a problem with. If we are to talk about exploitation, then capitalism itself is subject to be attacked and prohibited.If we work for a living, we sell our bodies to someone else for a time (40h a week or more). Some owner is who collects the surplus.So if exploitation is the problem, then its time to start looking at worker cooperatives, unions, banning shows like Shark Tank, and all the capitalist propaganda.But no, its just 'sex icky'. We won't actually look at the root of exploitation.

Porn is way easier to define than obscenity, so I don't see that being a problem. It's not uncommon for them to be anti-screens, social media, etc. The movement is often as much an attempt to get kids outsides and reduce the influence of smartphones and the internet on society as it is an attempt to ban porn. That said, I don't agree with censorship and especially by payment processors of all groups. The slippery slope is very concerning for adults who would enjoy any other category of content that are targeted by activist groups. Collective Shout has a history attacking media falling outside the porn bubble. In general though outside protected classes business can, and should IMHO, have a lot of discretion over who they choose to do business with and how they do business.Unless we want a carve out for payment processors. Sounds like an interesting idea TBH.To me it's critical though that society has room to moderate itself where the government can not and should not. Unless we want a carve out for payment processors.

To me it's critical though that society has room to moderate itself where the government can not and should not. Given that there are two payment processors that have about 90% global market share (excluding China) and your bank chooses the payment processor for the most part, yes we should regulate them and force them to process payment for any legal business.They have the ability to effectively determine what we can spend our money on when we can't get cash to the vendor in person, and almost every alternative processor has to deal with them and is also subject to their rules.The only way around this is via informal networks. Cryptocurrency isn't an option for many as it's very hard to obtain, due to the duopoly coercing banks and governments to keep people on their systems.I don't live in the US, and where I live has a local electronic non-credit card payment system which has been around since the 80s. It's less popular now because only the card networks support contactless payments instead of swipe/chip and pin.

There is actually a bipartisan bill proposing precisely that: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/987 So, women, drawing and writing stuff they like, being banned and losing an income stream.I don't think drawing or writing porn is exploitative at all. I don't think drawing or writing porn is exploitative at all. If somehow the puritanical mob banned stuff like that, I'd be genuinely sad. I'm genuinely curious to see how this plays out in the American partisan landscape. The real motivations seemingly have nothing to do with protecting women, which appears to simply be a palatable facade for the true intention to suppress all depictions of sexuality, including the depictions that offer good-faith representation of historically marginalized groups. Conservatives around the world talk to each other. I ran an online porn website for almost 20 years. For 15 years it was my primary source of income.I'm in Canada which, compared to the USA is extremely progressive.In 2022, after a decade of doing business with a certain bank as this business, never having hidden anything about what we did,  my wife and I received an urgent, signature required, overnighted letter from our bank informing us that they were terminating our accounts and that we had one month until we would no longer have access to any funds.The way this played out was that we had an incoming wire transfer get flagged and they phoned us to ask us questions about the wire. We answered everything on the phone honestly and transparently. We were doing nothing wrong.A few months later we get another phone call from our branch asking us to come in in person, urgently, and do an "extreme due diligence" check. During this process we had to answer an insane amount of questions about our business activities. They saw a credit card transaction from JetBrains, for example, and asked us to explain who JetBrains was and why we were doing business with them etc.A couple of weeks later we were informed about the termination with a brief letter explaining that we fell outside of their "risk appetite. "We managed to get an extension on the closure, and for two months we tried in vain to find any banking in Canada that would take us... and we ultimately ended up shutting down a business that represented two decades of our lives.During that time we reached out to industry insiders, some of which we happened to know were in Canada. They all told us that they bank in the USA.One branch manager at a bank we met with was extremely empathetic but obviously couldn't put her own job on the line, and she explained exactly what was going on.The issue is "Know Your Customer" regulations that are coming into effect that are meant to target things like money laundering. These regulations force banks to ask questions that they never really cared about before. This branch manager explained that a local strip club used to say they were a "banquet hall", and everyone at the branch knew exactly what they were but it was "don't ask / don't tell.

And the policies exist because they're afraid of things like human trafficking and other things.And our major banks have foreign investors from all around the world.

But when it comes to basic deposit services where nobody is asking them to risk their own money, they should be forced to allow any customer who isn't breaking any laws, such as in your case. If you take that statement at face value (not sure if you should), it's fascinating to think that your business was able to operate for two decades with what I assume are the standard problems people in the porn industry face (e.g. chargebacks from customers unwilling to admit they subscribed in their SO's presence and so pretending it was a scam, etc. )And yet seemingly none of the bank's risk heuristics based on actual transaction profiling ever went off.Wouldn't that mean that, in practice, being in the porn industry isn't as high-risk as banks / payment processors think it is?And would this not then suggest a gap in the market, for an (ideally vertically-integrated) bank + payment processor + card issuer + KYC provider, who is willing to1. evaluate risk on a customer-by-customer basis (through e.g. continuous dynamic network analysis of transaction flow, with txs annotated with their KYC info) rather than by actuarial categorization; and2.

Here is an article from the Reykjavik Grapevine that deep dives on it better than I could: https://grapevine.is/mag/2021/05/07/ask-an-expert-why-is-por...And for a broader overview, see "Pornography laws by region" on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_laws_by_region And for a broader overview, see "Pornography laws by region" on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_laws_by_region There are ongoing debates about how this applies to Onlyfans etc, with one faction claiming all sex work is abuse even if you're doing it solo in the privacy of your own home, so payments to Onlyfans should be banned. Like, "insert this object and take a photo, insert this larger object and take a photo, insert this uncomfortably large object and take a photo, insert this painfully large object and take a photo, insert this clearly damaging object and take a photo". But let's be real here, they were a bunch of jerks. There's a reason it took no time flat for Rhode Island to exist. There's a tendency for social liberals to see their view as the only legitimate one. But this is an area where there is lots of international push back from undeveloped, developing, and even many developed socially liberal countries. Then I realized that it was all wrong, countries accept western liberal democracy only as long as the free aid keeps flowing. And the libdems were in for a rude awakening if they ever ran out of kibble. I've discussed it with a lot of people from non-Western countries, and they find this behavior extremely confusing.

In the context of this thread it's merely the observation that attributing this to "puritans" or "christianity" or "US history" is rather misguided. It's one thing to recognize that it happens, another to recognize the practice as legitimate, virtuous, or even desirable.To be clear, I'm not accusing you of promoting these practices, just asking you to clarify your position.

Humans engaged in tribalistic groupthink committing moral atrocities is a tale as old as time.It is never wise to accept a majority or status quo position reflexively without thoroughly interrogating the ideas held within. A great deal of majority positions are morally reprehensible and ethically indefensible, and that has always been the case throughout human history.Human sacrifices of the innocent were not a "different culture", they were barbaric murders that were always wrong. They were also normative in much of the world for much of human history.The values espoused (but not always upheld) by western societies that many of us take for granted today are the exception to the rules throughout human history - rules that promoted needless bloodshed, widespread suffering, and persecution of the innocent.It is not arrogant to assert that loss of innocent human life is reprehensible and the societies that normalize it should be condemned. To assert otherwise isn't simply innocuously defending pluralism, it's defending atrocities.All life is inherently valuable and I will not apologize for asserting that, no matter how many billions of people disagree for tribalistic, persecutory reasons.

Perhaps the fact that you made a claim without bothering to explain this supposed "extensive, careful, and deliberate thought" of yours? Also the fact that your tone generally comes across as ideologically charged; in my experience zealots rarely engage in patient critical thinking.Certainly I don't suggest that one should blindly favor the status quo when given the chance to think things through. There is nearly always a reason that things are done the way they are done although often the particulars will be quite convoluted.> It is not arrogant to assert that loss of innocent human life is reprehensible and the societies that normalize it should be condemned.Is it really your intent to imply that I have called for such?

This wasn't an attempt to attack you or your character, but it did come out looking like that, and that was my fault. However that isn't a free standing view on my part. Continually eroding civil liberties in a doomed attempt to regain some imagined ideal of the past strikes me as nothing more than an obscene parallel to the war on drugs.Given that we clearly recognize that certain activities are detrimental to society when flaunted in public surely we could apply the same principle to various forms of expression? It's not much of a leap - you'll already land yourself in trouble if you go around shouting your head off or intimidating people for example. Analogous to alcohol consumption, I'd much prefer a clear distinction between standards for public displays, secluded public business establishments, and private gatherings than the bizarre scenarios that the current obscenity laws inevitably give rise to.

We live in a world where technology made everyone live in their own bubbles, only consume and reinforce what they already believe, create narrow identities with strict rules enforced by groupthink, and lose track of the things and people that we actually interact and have to deal with on a day-to-day basis.Yet, people think this small stuff that has been around forever, that are tiny parts of our society or lives, that this stuff is the problem with everything today. Chevron hired a private prosecutor who had him locked up on house arrest for years.Similar to this porn case, the censorship and suppression is coming from market interests rather than government, but they're nearly equally untouchable and even more difficult to hold accountable.

I used Steven as an example if private prosecution, where a private organization can take away your freedom outside of public prosecutors.Steven did similar work to an investigative journalist at a high level, he brought attention to, and fought for a marginalized group.

Religion and taboo often exist for a reason, because endless self gratification does not lead to flourishing.You don't have to agree that it should be banned, but you can at least concede it's not entirely arbitrary content like say a sitcom. You don't have to agree that it should be banned, but you can at least concede it's not entirely arbitrary content like say a sitcom. So I only see "this hurts certain people" as a scapegoat. Stairs probably hurt more people in any given day than many activities, we don't base law purely on harm and potential harm. The issue with GGP is that in context it appears to be an argument in favor of increasing restrictions (ie in favor of the events that the article is talking about) despite disclaiming that "You don't have to agree that it should be banned". Expressing agreement with the literal wording of GGP seems to also carry an implication of agreement with some rather different things as well. It's perfectly fine to say "I think porn is generally unhealthy and would suggest people not partake, but I think they ought to be able if they'd like". It's also reasonable to say "I think things like porn, alcohol, cigarettes, violence, and/or gambling should be accessible to adults, but they should not be able to advertise in spaces where children are likely to visit (like an online video game store), and stores should check ID to purchase those things, and 'paying via advertising' should not act as a loophole for those ID checks." There's a wide range of reasonable positions to debate that are entirely shut down by basically implying that people are unreasonable to disagree. I'd actually hypothesise that if you locked three sets of teenage boys in rooms, one with only porn games, one with only social media and one with only sitcoms, that the first group would likely emerge the healthiest of the three. I'm basing this on my bias towards activity and that nobody seems to have bothered with actually doing research on porn games, the organisation pushing for these bans included [1], instead proxying research on porn as a whole for this specific category. Serum cortisol.My assumption is someone actively participating in something, even something unhealthy, is going to maintain cognitive and executive function above someone simply observing. (To the degree these games may be destructive, I'd argue it's in its game mechanics. )We have no evidence pornography causes negative outcomes across population. We have lots of evidence for social media addiction causing broad psychological issues, particularly in children.

Or maybe put another way, if my child was at a neighbors house and one of the parents watched an adult movie with my child I would have a huge issue. If they watched Terminator or something similar, I would have much less of an issue.They're not even close to the same thing. They're not even close to the same thing. A better question would be if you would be more comfortable with your child being shown porn or snuff movies. For me the answer would be neither, in about an equal measure I think parent comment is asking you to consider why you think young children watching violent movies is way less of a problem. E.g. "Terminator or similar" - why draw the line there? What else should we arbitrarily ban based on this criteria? Maybe I'm weird but I would much rather prefer my son plays video games 8 hours a day than watches adult content 8 hours a day. Isn't it the end result that matters? Presumably you'd like your son to become a functional adult. Neither of the scenarios you describe there sound like that to me (excepting perhaps "professional competitive gamer" but somehow I suspect most parents don't really approve of that outcome either). It's no worse than reading a lot of books or watching a lot of TV shows, activities that are not disparaged as much. So then why aren't those activists going after Instagram, TicTok, X/Twitter, etc. you know, the OG spyware, brain rot and anxiety inducing companies, because that would actually benefit society and not too many people would mourn their loss.Why are they instead going after a dozen random horny video games nobody heard of? Oh that's right, because those random game devs don't have the power to fight back in court, unlike Meta/X, so it's an easy win for them to collect brownie points, for performative nonsense.

But small-time game devs probably don't care to fight unless they're making bank. Because it hasn't been discussed in the HN bubble? Maybe post some proof that they are if you wanna make this argument. Not assume it's true and ban everything.I have seen zero evidence that any of these games are harmful. If I had to hazard a guess, and this is again just a hypothesis, I'd actually suspect that a teenager exposed to porn games is less likely to suffer mental-health issues than one on algorithmic social media or forming intimate connections with chatbots.

For their moral compass or larger scale goals, n=1 is one too many.There will always be some people - teenagers or otherwise - that develop mental health issues from e.g. porn games. But there's people developing mental health issues from Farmville or ChatGPT supposedly turning sentient and sharing the infinite Truth of the universe too.

Of course, these things don't live in a vacuum; the manufacturers of e.g. pesticides have a vested financial interest in selling their product, because money. They pay for scientific studies in favor of their product, they schmooze (= bribe) with decision makers and politicians, they overwhelm the system, they take their product global and sell it to whoever is buying, etc.Same with cigarettes or asbestos or lead paint; it's part "we didn't know" because it's long-term effects or the science wasn't there yet, but part "shut up and buy my product" too.Anyway, proof that it's harmless is not easy to get in certain cases, not when the effects only show up long-term or when the science doesn't yet know how to test. Was science at a point where they could test for the presence and endocrine effects of microplastics in the human body?

With that framing, you would need evidence that something is harmful if you're going to exert power over other people to prevent them from doing it. If anybody at any point thinks that something might be bad, it should immediately and permanently be prohibited for everyone. We don't need a mechanism to check this because people are never mistaken or misled, and there is no such thing as a bad actor.Since the principle should always prevail, it applies to people as well.

I can't answer that, and I don't know if there's been any studies towards especially CSAM since it's such a taboo.

I mean, this seems to be a pattern people have seen in many cases?I seem to recall something about people in the military developing scat fetishes after repeatedly masturbating in restrooms that smell of feces, due to a lack of other private places?The phrase “fetish fuel” is a fairly standard phrase I think.Generally, it's pretty clear that some fetishes come from somewhere. Like, the “woman turns into a giant blueberry” one seems to pretty clearly trace back to someone's experience with the scene in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”.And, like, if someone starts out looking at/for breast expansion porn, they're probably going to be exposed to a far bit of lactation porn as well, and I think there's a fair chance that they'll start seeking that out as well?

End of page 3, the author does a litterature review and finds that current studies show that exposure to CSAM increases probability of offending for those with predispositions. They can at best hint at directions to pursue for studies that can infer causality.As a concrete example of the way that observational studies can go wrong despite good intentions: It was believed for a long time that paedophiles have lower average IQs than the general population. This was based on the observation that a larger fraction than would be expected of those caught and sentenced for sexual crimes involving children were of low IQ. Of course, a better explanation of this observation is that paedophiles with higher IQs are better at covering their tracks and evading suspicion.

Of course, a better explanation of this observation is that paedophiles with higher IQs are better at covering their tracks and evading suspicion. Until genuine evidence is available, either outcome seems plausible. It could be that consuming CSAM pushes people towards committing sex crimes, or it could be that it "magically" doesn't, the same way people playing violent video games are "magically" unaffected by doing so.ETA: An example of the inability of porn to influence sexual behavior is the plight of gay Western men in the 1950s-1980s. During this time homosexuality was absolutely demonised across essentially all of Western society, so there was ample interest from gay men in "correcting" their "errant" desires (this is not to say that all gay men felt this way). At the same time, heterosexual porn was widespread and easily available, though admittedly to a lesser extent than it is today. Given these forces at play, if it were possible for a gay man to develop an interest in having sex with women merely by looking at heterosexual porn, it does seem like there would have been large numbers of gay men who successfully "converted" to straight men. But AFAIK it is disputed that any such genuine conversion has ever taken place.

The first is that you're banning free expression, and banning free expression is inherently harmful.There's also the displacement theory - with the legal content being much more accessible and regulated to ensure minors aren't involved in production, it displaces illegal content that does harm minors. There's also the displacement theory - with the legal content being much more accessible and regulated to ensure minors aren't involved in production, it displaces illegal content that does harm minors. This seems to suggest that broad sexual preferences are remarkably stable. That doesn't mean the canyon was always there. In purely hypothetical terms, what would we if there was evidence for this? I can see some folks standing by their ideals and concluding that even if this was true, we shouldn't ban these games, while others would conclude that there is a moral obligation to future victims to ban them.How would you behave if you shared the belief that incest and sexual exploitation games influence people's real life behavior?

Let people make their own decisions, not the government. Nobody has any right to dictate other people's lives. For his view to be even considered, he should be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt, that whatever he is against is actually harmful. Similarly, society should be allowed to harm itself because not everything has to be a race to the bottom of productivity and strength.Do abortions lower the birth rate and are more populous societies stronger? Even _if_ the answers are yes to both, I don't see why any society should optimize this metric to the extreme. And theological arguments quickly fall apart in the first step of proving harm.

The reality is that this is a failed argument and it will continue to fail regardless of how often it's repeated. Are you, personally, harmed by someone watching porn?Maybe it makes society as a whole weaker compared to other societies but that doesn't mean your society actually loses anything. Countries have nuclear weapons and multi-national defense pacts now. Just because China has several times the population of the US and could win a conventional war, doesn't mean it's gonna invade.We don't live in tribes of a few hundred people who are constantly on the brink of starvation and/or genocide anymore.

A better example would be to consider that pre-op transgender people, namely MtF, can share the same spaces that were reserved to biological women. If I'm a woman and now I have to compete with a biological man in MMA because society chose that it's the new normal, yes, I'm going to suffer from it.If society decides that it's fair to feed Tiktok to toddlers who end up having their neurons fried, I'm going to suffer from it as well when they grew up as they won't be able to do their job well. If society decides that it's fair to allow CSAM everywhere, I guess that a few children are going to suffer as it becomes mainstream.We don't live in a vacuum. If society decides that it's fair to allow CSAM everywhere, I guess that a few children are going to suffer as it becomes mainstream.We don't live in a vacuum. I cannot agree with the toddlers example: 1) it's possible it does some damage but as I said, to even consider it, we need proof; 2) even if they are bad at life, it doesn't automatically harm another individual - don't hire incompetents and they won't harm your business. The balance might change if this was true and happened on such a scale that society measurably declined but then I am still of the opinion that we should have mechanisms how a group of people should be able to get together separate themselves from others. We have no right to force the Amish to start using modern tech, even if a few more able bodies would probably be beneficial on some scale. Similarly, if the majority feed TikTok to their toddlers and a minority does not, they should be able and allowed to form their own society with its own rules, as long as everyone participates willingly. According to your thinking, no one can "force" medical faculties to say that now anyone can buy a surgical doctor degree for 10$, that said if you have to get urgent surgery you'll pay for the consequences as the "doctor" who'll operate won't be qualified.This is why we need basic rules, norms and constraints that allows us to reach a better optimum than the free-for-all that you recommend. It's also a question of personal values: I value more living in a CSAM-free society, than one where pedos can watch it freely. Amishes value being in a highly religious and low-tech society than giving birth without pain or having air conditioning.I agree that leaving the society should be possible (emigration, for instance, as the Amishes did). But each society has its local optimum, so you'll have to choose with different constraints.

Amishes value being in a highly religious and low-tech society than giving birth without pain or having air conditioning.I agree that leaving the society should be possible (emigration, for instance, as the Amishes did). But each society has its local optimum, so you'll have to choose with different constraints. But each society has its local optimum, so you'll have to choose with different constraints. I have trouble parsing that sentence, did you mean "prevent" instead of "force"?If yes, then it doesn't follow from my thinking at all. Somebody claiming to be a doctor without fulfilling these expectations is clearly directly harming other people (whether actual harm is done - even if he somehow through sheer luck managed to perform one surgery successfully, the expected outcome is still harm and expected outcome should absolutely factor into his punishment).> This is why we need basic rules, norms and constraintsI never said we didn't.

I would prefer we have laws for what is legal and not let religious extremists decide what music we are allowed to listen, what type of books and games should we play, I guess there is no evidence they can bring to ban this content so they push their FUD around.So please either make it illegal or stop focusing on virtual crimes, maybe focus on real crimes  or use those money religious people  have on helping real people. The slippery slope was advertisers not wanting to advertise on porn sites and adult content. As the article points out, it is also very hard to accurately classify this information. I mean even on YouTube the other day I got a video in my shorts feed that was flagged for sensitive topic. There's not even options in the settings and YouTube definitely knows I'm in my 30's.... How do I even say "this was improperly flagged?" We wouldn't have Algospeak if we wanted it... Sure, covert speech has formed in the past but mostly under duress and the current form allows for a much more rapid iteration and I really don't think that's good for society. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. As much as it sucks to admit, a lot of "evil" is created by "good" people trying to do "good" things (quotes to let you define good and evil however you want)The reason I point out the argument is we can modify "Don't like porn? can be modified to "Don't like porn? "But I think payment systems should have a different regulation. I'm actually surprised this isn't already a rule (it has to be, right?). Anything else seems like it is actually holding your money ransomed.I'll admit I'm biased and I think payments should be private and we should try to make the system so that digital transactions are as similar to cash transactions as possible, but I'm not convinced either party is in favor of that, nor the banks themselves which would like to make money on that information. can be modified to "Don't like porn?

Granted, I've skimmed, but I'm genuinely not seeing it [1].The closest is this study [2], which counted how many times thirty-eight women "who self-identified as having experienced unwanted or non-consensual sexual experiences in relationships" and were "recruited via social media," when "given the opportunity to reflect on their experiences of [intimate partner sexual violence], with prompting to speculate about their partner's motivations or any underlying causes for the violence" mentioned pornography.

Perhaps form a collective to persuade others of that belief. You might argue that since they are wrong, their beliefs should be changed. Perhaps form a collective to persuade others of that belief. Perhaps form a collective to persuade others of that belief. They believe it is, and so as far as they are concerned, it's provenThere is a massive gap between someone having done something and their (wrongly) believing they've done it. Historically, my observation is that some of the most evil things ever perpetrated by humans were done in the name of trying to make society better. If they were acting in good faith, this would be sort of like a Black Lives Matter type of approach that is trying to raise public awareness around an issue. Instead, they are trying to go after the fulcrums of society and enforce their view using backroom deals. It's a transparent power play, and it's not in good faith: real good faith actors look at both sides of the issue, both the values and the harm, and they try to develop a balanced response. It goes even further.What was wrong with those people poisoning Socrates? Don't like what he says, do not listen to him.You know how in higher dimensional space everything is almost orthogonal? I think people are like that, some like porn, some are afraid of it, some want to be impregnated by aliens, some hate aliens.Through good intentions democracy can be just as tyrannical as any tyrant; a pinch of incompetence and good intentions and it can not be stopped.When should others "save" you? When it is absolutely obvious some people need saving. What was wrong with those people poisoning Socrates?

Porn is just the thin end of the wedge (as was "violence in video games" a generation ago) - porn is something society considers as distasteful, so politicians are less likely to go on record as supporting porn. Perhaps we could develop some form of secure digital currency that is not reliant on central authorities such as banks, payment processors, or governments? One would expect stablecoins to be more popular but I haven't seen them as valid payment options anywhere except crypto exchanges. The issue is that for now, and for a long time ahead, all these content providers feel that most of their clients would prefer to use a credit card. Even if some people do not use credit cards. Let's assume there is a payment processor where anything goes, the company utilizing it would still be punished by the other payment processors.I don't think Visa/Mastercard would care that you only sell the things they don't want through other payment processors, they still would threaten to cut you off entirely for having the content they don't like I don't think Visa/Mastercard would care that you only sell the things they don't want through other payment processors, they still would threaten to cut you off entirely for having the content they don't like like being legally oblidged to do business with South Africa during apartheid or working with a chocolate company that (allegedly) used child slave labor to farm it's cocoa? They do not have to host your game that they don't like and that doesn't make it censorship. run a for-pay pornsite, bleeding revenue from the other porn sites, which you will spend fighting porn; also, you'll have better targeted customer lists. Except we live in a society and what goes into it affects all of us. Obviously the government should make selling certain things illegal. And I think that many of the games sold their, should be made illegal.What should not happen is payment processors being the ones who decide what is okay to sell. If selling something is legal, payment processors should be forced to make that transaction.>I wish there was a payment processor who was brave enough to say a big fucking NO to censorship.I do not. I do not want legal financial transactions being dependent on the whims of how "brave" some company is.

I don't like the conservative angle which is to be "proper" or it's against god, but from the scientific side this stuff is bad.Now I also agree that censorship is bad too and on a moral level this stuff doesn't harm anyone morally.I'm still a staunch 90s liberal, but over time I'm starting to realize that there's an evolutionary reason why conservative values exist. Humans weren't designed to live in a world of only fans where every girl who's slightly hot can gain so much power over hundreds of men. We have no idea wtf is causing it. But we do know that the population issue correlates with so many changes in society, and it's a big freaking deal.Another thing is rising womens power. It's moral and right to give women equal rights and equal power, but humanity has never encountered such a scenario. Like if we satisfy every moral imperative in our primitive brains and build a utopia but human biology was never meant for utopia is it right?That's the problem.

Housing prices are through the roof and most young people can't even hope to be able to afford a house. Human population has doubled about 4 times in the last 100 years. If it doubles yet again there's going to be 16 billion of us. Do you think the world and humanity can sustain infinite exponential growth? First for context, when population grows, that growth is compounding usually. If anything, this suggests a reverse of the correlation. The older I get the more I start to believe that industrialization and pervasive technological adoption have come with a cost to humanity that maybe we don't want to bear. the point was that content is blocked almost by default nowadays Some of them even enter the morally grey areas imo. several Otome and BL content was hit by this as well. I don't think this is about protecting the women and children.>not that many talk about how objectification of women is still very common in it.It's not 2005 anymore.

Sure, games can be beneficial for living out fantasies, but how will it affect your view on women if you frequently consume highly sexist content? Violence is a primal instinct and studies on video games and violence only concluded short term increases in aggression. I don't see arousal as inherently dangerous.>how will it affect your view on women if you frequently consume highly sexist content?Do you feel that people just find "sexist content" from some algorithm, or that already sexist people seek out content to conform to their views? I have my criticisms of Steam, but I am glad they are one of the few bastions left that aren't driven by "engagment boosting" algorithms. Just a simple tag system recommending other content with similar tags and good ratings.I agree with the undertone that we need better sex education. Those early years where we don't sell content to 10 year olds should be used to talk about the dangers before sending them off.

Seriously, outside of special, clearly delineated cases with indisputable negative externalities (especially on the production side), when has [effectively] banning certain [types of] media been a net good? Seems to me that all it's good for is political repression and fueling moral panics. Also, I don't see how women in porn are any more objectified than men. In the porn that I've seen, men are 100% objectified and portrayed as only good for "one thing". Even though I'm against using payment processing restrictions, I do believe we need laws to prohibit this kind of content. There's data suggesting that it impacts real people's behavior during sex and shapes harmful social expectations. Seems like everyone is pro-censorship, when they disagree with those being targeted. So in most cases it really just comes down to how many people are anti-porn, rather than any stance on censorship in general.

Steam doesn't even want you using adult models in their games for this very reason; they don't want to need to verify ages.For the latter: I guess so?

So they want to censor far more than just porn. If it really is an example of a rare false positive, a manual fix for that one specific game is a reasonable thing to seek, without giving the pedos their heyday like most of the comments here suggest. Do you really think Visa and MasterCard should be making decisions what is acceptable for like everyone?Otherwise any random weirdos from UK or Australia will censor what are you allowed to watch or play in the US.And China can also put pretty good pressure on payment processors too.

And China can also put pretty good pressure on payment processors too. Another way to think of this is 'long tail risk'. Some subset of people out there will develop real life problems from: porn, sex work, alcohol, weed, drugs, gambling, other 'moral' issues. I think many of these slippery slopes are defined in hindsight. What all of these represent are simply struggles for power. Exhibit A - emotional: the government has outlawed violent crime and wants to outlaw intimidation. This is a bad slippery slope argument because (I'm assuming) intimidation should be outlawed. If the government votes in evil-gov or you encounter evil-cop, it's as easy for them to harass you for insults and criticism, as it would be had intimidation never been outlawed.Exhibit B - physical: the government wants to give every citizen a brain implant that can be remotely activated to stun them. However, it would also be a terrible idea, because now if you get evil-gov or evil-cop, it's significantly easier for them to remotely stun you for non-crime.The key is that in Exhibit A, evil-gov and evil-cop face equal resistance for punishing insults and criticism regardless of whether intimidation is outlawed, because either way, people understand that intimidation should be outlawed and insults and criticism should not. More generally, moving the Overton Window to contain a “good” thing doesn't make it contain a “bad” thing, at least not enough so that the “good” thing isn't worth it. But in Exhibit B, evil-gov and evil-cop face ineffective resistance for stunning people for insults and criticism, because people allowed good-gov and good-cop to give them stun implants for punishing crime; whereas if evil-gov or evil-cop stepped up and said “alright, we're going to give everyone stun implants to punish insults and criticism”, they would face effective resistance.—-Put into perspective: Visa and Mastercard using their Monopoly to effectively prevent payment for depictions of incest and rape, assuming you think that is OK, is Exhibit A. However, Visa and Mastercard having a monopoly in the first place is Exhibit B. My argument is “we should break the Visa and Mastercard monopoly (or popularize crypto) to prevent them from restricting LGBTQ and firearms etc. in the future” (this argument still applies if they're restricting some of that now). A counter-argument is “this will allow incest depictions, hate speech, and moreover actual drug and sex trafficking*, etc.” and my counter is “those things are bad, but are they bad enough to leave us vulnerable to power shifts restricting good content in the future?” I support free speech with a similar argument**.It's an argument that relies on the uncertain future, but nonetheless the change here clearly and significantly decreases the probability of a bad future, because bad-gov or bad-cop must acquire power then revert the monopoly breakup; whereas the emotional example can't even rely on the future, because if bad-gov or bad-cop acquire enough power to cause the bad thing, they would've just as likely acquired enough power had we not avoided causing the good thing. * Also note these things are already exchanged with real money, and breaking up the Visa/Mastercard monopoly won't make them legal nor stop law enforcement from tracking and prosecuting them. The more general argument is that it's better for society to make it hard for law enforcement to prosecute crime then give them the resources to do so, but also make it hard for them to prosecute non-crime; then make it easy for law-enforcement to prosecute crime so they need less resources, but also make it easy for them to prosecute non-crime. The justification is that we spend extra resources and let some crimes avoid prosecution, in exchange for decreased risk of non-crime prosecution now and in the future. ** and that speech is mild enough, sans confidential information etc., that it shouldn't be blocked simply to content whoever says it. But even confidential information doesn't warrant e.g. a universal backdoor and filter that could be stolen and exploited by a bad actor.

Money talks, and it's one of the few ways I have to show my opposition. It's sad, because itch is kinda one of the last few places for "indie" as a thing with the vibe of indies, at least (I mean they aren't Steam or the other big publishers). If itch didn't comply, they'd lose all their revenue, and we'd lose the website in its entirety, which is much more than just smut.Pushing back against the payment processors, rather than itch under duress, would have made money talk in the right direction.

Also if cryptocurrency were more popular and widespread, then banks would have less leverage to do this. My pro-fascist brother-in-law with massive social anxiety hated it for some reason.. You aren't the only one who seems to think this way though, we have more things than ever to pacify men and even increase estrogen and decrease testosterone probably because some believe that men are inherently dangerous. Now that we have Lightning and hyperfast micropayments, can we have a good plug-and-play payment processor that uses it? Even companies working in large amounts of cash end up hiring companies to handle the cash logistics and all the other complications in dealing with it. Bitcoin can be used as currency for occasional transactions between individuals. But you don't want your business to depend on it. It doesn't scale, not due to technological reasons, but because of legal issues and customer experience expectation. Bitcoin adoption is a chicken and egg problem. But my guess is that censoring porn creates a very big incentive for people to start using it. So even when companies own their own properties they often end up hiring a property management company to deal the the day to day operations of running a commercial property. Because in the end they don't want to have to worry about their janitorial contracts, handling elevator certifications, landscaping contracts, maintenance techs, etc. They want to focus on producing widgets.Same thing with hosting a digital storefront. If managing servers and software stacks and digital security isn't your main business competency, why get into it?Most companies won't want to deal the logistics of handling crypto. So they'll often outsource that work, because I'm the end they want to focus on selling widgets not handling payments. But in the end you will need to do that work though.I'm not the reason why people choose these big centralized services. Not everyone wants to be their own bank.

I don't really care about the censorship of porn, but it is a slippery slope to censorship in general. If you give them an inch they will take a mile.I think there is sometimes a business justification of putting your foot in the ground, even if the short term consequences are harsh. I think there is sometimes a business justification of putting your foot in the ground, even if the short term consequences are harsh. I'm quite sure there is not a lot of people paying for porn. The money people are making surely comes from ads and data hoarding. For all of the talk (hype) about how crypto has the potential to avoid the exact type of meddling and manipulation and pressuring we're seeing now, it surprises me that no equivalents to PayPal have really popped up - that best that can be done is apparently something along the lines of what Linux was on the desktop a decade or two ago. Basically, before Valve and others picked up the slack and worked on things your average person actually cares about - notably, gaming and simple(r) to use desktop environments and software stores.Where's the flagship platform for payments that's built on crypto but lets you ignore the technical details, that's trivial to implement as a merchant and is a download away on app stores? If there are a few of those, why would anyone bother with these puritan payment processors?

If there are a few of those, why would anyone bother with these puritan payment processors? I would argue it's worth investing infrastructure into it, for the same reason that valve has invested infrastructure into linux to gain leverage over microsoft. Without leverage, negotiations get ugly: see the Epic vs Apple saga. (Unaffiliated, I hold some pocket money on there not to run a Lightning node myself)The on-chain transaction is just to "fund" a channel between two parties. These two parties can then make unlimited trasnfers between each other instantaneously for free. That's where the Phoenix 1% fee comes from, as they deal with this exact problem for you, so you don't have to worry about it.

That's where the Phoenix 1% fee comes from, as they deal with this exact problem for you, so you don't have to worry about it. If you and I have a channel funded with 100 sat, we can move these around as many times as we wish, even on behalf of others, but if you need to transfer more than you have on your side, you need to fund the channel with another on-chain transaction. That's where the Phoenix 1% fee comes from, as they deal with this exact problem for you, so you don't have to worry about it. Sort of defeats the purpose then, doesn't it? Why not just make lightning payments directly from your bitcoin exchange? I personally worked in the crypto payment processing space and we had to say no to many very well known porn companies for this reason. * anything using proof-of-work is still gonna be a hard sell * good luck figuring out how to get the user experience on both ends appear to be in USD without ever having to give a shit about the constantly-fluctuating value of BTC * fun times ahead when you get big enough for the government to notice you and start requiring you to comply with all kinds of arcane regulations Government prohibition and restriction of our rights is a terrible problem and it's why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. It's a necessary fight if only to keep government power in check, unless one really believes the State is always right and always has our best interest in mind.

I think it works out fine with fixed/float exchanges. Every time someone insists on an escape hatch, it is immediately abused. They know this logic doesn't make sense. Somehow that didn't seem to happen either. Somehow that didn't seem to happen either. They are simply participating in the once-maligned "cancel culture" which was protected as "freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences". These kinds of escape hatches always have these results because one's enemies find a way to use them as well.0: Just for the sake of argument.

Trans people suffer a wildly higher rate of violent crime than either cis gender. I mean this sounds reasonable until you also consider that shows like Game of Thrones would then also be banned, and probably plenty of popular books.Hell, you could use the same reasoning to target most video games, since most video games use some level of violence.

It should be on an 18+ only store front at the very least.

The big issue of the internet is that we are all scattered very wide and that makes it harder to collect ourselvves under one goal.

And as of now, I'm a laid off tech worker (who doesn't live in SF) who has no real capital to contribute to such a cause. If none of us know, then the next alternative is "can we point to any existing organizations to throw support at"? Or at the very least, an adjacent organization who can tell us steps to take? The basic sequence is simple:Set up a Discord. Market it to attract a handful of early adopters. Run a book club using Organizing for Social Change[1] or Beautiful Trouble[2]. Along the way, you build shared language and alignment. People start to get a feel for tactics: collective letter campaigns, pressure targeting, framing, etc.By the time you wrap the first book, you'll have a core group with a working vocabulary and some trust. You'll know how to set up a continuous recruitment and onboarding loop. You'll be ready for a second round of action. From there, it's just iteration after iteration.The most important seed is a vision holder, someone whose primary job is building solid relationships and gradually offloading the core functions: facilitation, comms, outreach, tech, and education. You need consistency above all, social fluency, emotional and logistical endurance, and a bit of luck.Trust me when I say it's not easy, but the overhead is basically zero.

I dont care about porn but the platforms have done a piss poor job for the majority of people who are not looking for porn games but find games like cyberpunk totally acceptable. How can i see cyberpunk but not hentai?This is happening because it was too easy for someone to pull up the home page on said platforms and point to several incest porn games.

Many articles turn up that say they have an agreement, then a disagreement, then an agreement again, then a suspension, then they bring it back again etc.My point here is that their relationship with M/V seems to have failed to actually change them, so, the point "they're powerless to change Japan" stands.

They mentioned that marijuana businesses can't bank their money due to these considerations as it would make banks knowing accomplices to the federal crime of trafficking a controlled substance. This threat is material because cannabis, unlike adult content, is actually illegal, so I don't think it's a substantially similar example to what's mentioned in this thread. For the better part of a decade feminists have been wildly anti-objectification, not anti-sex. It's an important distinction.For example, most modern feminists are pro sex-work, but only under conditions that guarantee safety, autonomy, and health care for the sex workers. That's very different from how most sex work is done today. So a modern feminist might say that we should be doing more to protect the sex workers who are held in bondage by a pimp, and forced to walk the streets while simultaneously arguing in favor of well regulated, protected brothels or private sex work.

So a modern feminist might say that we should be doing more to protect the sex workers who are held in bondage by a pimp, and forced to walk the streets while simultaneously arguing in favor of well regulated, protected brothels or private sex work. Or, as in this case, it's not a feminist organization. Compare, for example, Sex and the City, where 4 women were regularly engaged in a variety of sexual encounters and say, background dancers in a music video or advert that exist to appeal as objects to a male audience. In a different context I might be more sympathetic to this specific formulation of the concept since it's not always clear how much agency the background dancers in a music video or advert have. In Kotor 2, there's a character called "The Handmaiden", who will join your party if the player character is a male. She's depicted as a chaste, virginal religious character. But one of the very first things you can do with her when she joins your party is spar with her. And she strips into black lingerie to do so. Then she stays in black lingerie on your ship while you go and do other stuff.She's clearly there as an object for the audience to drool over. It's given a very surface level justification ("we always spar with only our bodies"), but that justification is provided the instant before the player sees her in her undies. (Which, it's important to note, aren't like modest undergarments one might expect from a religious figure like this, but are specifically sexy underwear. )Compare this to another Star Wars game, Jedi: Fallen Order, where the Night Sister Mirrin can becomes romantically involved with the player character. She has a well developed culture, and is given space to articulate her personality, choices, and opinions in a cogent way. She can be a romantic interest without being an object. She is as complex as all the other characters, and we don't see her positioned in sexy lingerie suddenly out of the blue.I can come up with other examples if those aren't illustrative.

I can come up with other examples if those aren't illustrative. What I'm disputing is any application of objectification theory to media analysis wherein there are no actual agents involved. There is simply no moral valence in how one treats or regards them.The demand here is that they be treated as if they possessed agency. I see no reason or obligation to do so.

And 'sex robots' are seen as a horrifying prospect. And 'sex robots' are seen as a horrifying prospect. The specific organization we're discussing is not feminist. Yes, it is.Let me see: they seem to receive funding from evangelical organizations; the founder speaks/writes at Christian venues and is pro-life, anti-gay/trans; they are targeting games because that's what they happen to focus on right now. They've also campaigned against Rap music and artists in the past. They managed to get articles critical of them pulled from VICE, etc. Their modus operandi is typical of religious conservatives.

She's not a "feminist" by any reasonable and modern definition of the word. I meant that this person chooses Christian venues to voice her opinions, and shares with them non-feminist values such as being "pro life", etc.Hers is not a feminist organization, and Collective Shout is perceived by some as a right-wing group seeking to also ban LGTB+ depictions in videogames (which is not standard feminist agenda). Like another commenter mentioned, Collective Shout receives funding from evangelical organizations. And really, you have to ask yourself: since when exactly payment processors paid any attention to what genuine feminist organizations had to say about anything?At some point you cannot ignore the evidence anymore. At best you can point the non-empty intersection of conservative Christian groups and some sex-negative feminists who both seek to ban pornography, but this doesn't make them the same thing.TL;DR this is a variation of "will somebody think of the children!?" pearl-clutching, and everyone should know by now it doesn't lead to anything good.

I guess every publisher could just sell direct to customers on their own website, but that wouldn't address this issue at all (it would make it even easier for payment processors to abuse their duopoly), while also severely damaging the discoverability of games.And, considering that companies can already do this if they want but still choose to sell via a platform, I'm guessing there are several benefits beyond discoverability that I'm not thinking of. And, considering that companies can already do this if they want but still choose to sell via a platform, I'm guessing there are several benefits beyond discoverability that I'm not thinking of. The only solution is you download stuff and it remains runnable and usable without any connection or authorisation to any service. But being tied to a platform is utterly wrong.If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere. With Stream as the distributor, you can't. If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere. With Stream as the distributor, you can't. I agree, but that could still be done even when using a centralized distribution platform. I would say those are two separate issues. I think (not positive) that's the whole premise of GOG, isn't it?>If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere.Not really, though. Instead of pressuring steam or whoever, they just pressure you directly. >If the payment processor shuts your revenue down you can move elsewhere.Not really, though.

It takes a certain kind of person to stand up for pornography. And most are not that kind of person. But there has to be a line somewhere and even the most accepting countries have a line.Often the groups defending porn are defending the most egregious stuff which makes it hard for people to support. Often the groups defending porn are defending the most egregious stuff which makes it hard for people to support. DLSite is another good site but that was hit last year by this. If creators, platforms, and users all say, I would prefer to not see the content, it's pretty easy to make that happen. Let's say it openly: what's the problem with sex and nudity in games? Why is it so unacceptable -- that even people against the censorship must loudly proclaim it's not "their thing" -- but violence, guns, war, etc are not? Or not enough to pull from the stores, anyway?What I don't care about are the finer points of whether this technically counts as "censorship", because in pratice it is. There SHOULD be a place to buy games which depict nudity and sex. The quality of those games is not and should not be the focus of conversation (e.g. "they are AI slop" or "badly made", etc), because that's NOT what bothers the people doing the censorship -- they'd also be against the best, AAA made, high quality games with sex and nudity.Again, I ask: what is wrong with sex and nudity in games, that makes it worse than gore, violence and war? Why cannot whatever age-restriction measures taken for the purchase of violent games be also applied to sex games?Finally: we all know they are not going to stop at this, right?

People are just accustomed to being insulted for willingly associating themselves with it, on the basis of imputed perversion, bad taste etc. >must loudly proclaim it's not "their thing" -- but violence, guns, war, etc are not?I don't think war or violence is most people's thing to begin with.Guns, that's definitely a thorny issue. I'm personalyl fine with much stricter gun control>we all know they are not going to stop at this, right?indeed. Gotta do the same thing either way and push back.

Gotta do the same thing either way and push back. The other context is that global companies must cater to multiple countries cultures which conflict so they take the path of least resistance. I don't buy the "multiple countries' cultures" excuse because this seems to be spearheaded by conservative groups from the Christian anglosphere, the same culture that produces these same games to begin with; and also: other cultures forbid depictions of explicit violence, alcohol, women without their heads covered or publicly disagreeing with their husbands, etc. I don't see a push to ban games which depict alcohol consumption or independent women, do you?Let's call a spade a spade, and recognize this for what it is.Also: there's absolutely nothing wrong with erotica in games. Just place it behind the same safety checks as violent games. If those don't work, then they also don't work for violent games, in which case: shall we ban all games with violence? Let's call a spade a spade, and recognize this for what it is.Also: there's absolutely nothing wrong with erotica in games. Just place it behind the same safety checks as violent games.

Also additional context, before the 12th century priests were allowed to marry and have children. It was taken away, to consolidate the church's property. Some examples, like this one are for porn but the same approach could be used for anything even remotely controversial.Anyway, maybe Witcher 3 could be next. Great game, but it happens to have some sex scenes, so.... Great game, but it happens to have some sex scenes, so.... Anyway, are you not aware of the "vibe shift" from "woke" to "based" that took place in November 2024? It should be up to individual platforms to moderate this content on a case by case basis, not the payment processors. That said, there's a de facto duopoly on payment processing that gives these companies near government-level power to dictate terms. Realistic alternatives don't exist and would be insanely hard to start. For this specific topic in the US, it's necessary. Doesn't sound like you support free speech at all then if this is your red line. Criticism of politicians is needed to keep them in line. Being about to criticize the US government is true freedom. Ban all the games, I don't think videogames are very valuable.Ban all TV shows, I don't think TV shows are very valuable.Ban all televised sports, I think sports are very boring and not very valuable.In fact, ban all the things I don't particularly find valuable.

Prohibition of hard drugs has been a spectacular failure, directly resulting in increased rates of death, disease, and crime, and elevating drug cartels to enormous international influence.The danger of porn as an addictive substance - which is very real as you point out - is a great argument against its prohibition.

Visa and MasterCard are in the business of making money, they're not doing this for fun. If there was a law, Valve would happily de-list these things. I think one solution for Valve/Itch to continue with the 'no policing policy' is for governments to step in and say all video games needed classification like films do.I think a few of these video games that are sold would be found to breaking some law if anyone cared to test it.

Video games don't even involve actual human bodies like GoT does. It's crazy that "Collective Shout" thinks this is worth invoking violence and violating peoples volition for. Certainly not consistent with all other aspects of entertainment in society. Makes me think there are probably other fame, power and money motivations behind their behavior. But it doesn't explain people agreeing with them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USCSS Maginot, a Weyland Yutani research vessel, crashed into the large lawn next to Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con this weekend. Onlookers remarked they hoped there was nothing dangerous on board, as containers had spilled all over the surrounding area. That's both the tease for a very cool activation put together by FX for its new show, Alien: Earth, as well as the setup for Alien: Earth itself. One of them is a xenomorph, everyone's favorite killer alien with acid for blood. At Comic-Con, it was the main one, but there were teases of others. But even in the daylight, the amount of work and detail that's been put into this activation is impressive. You enter through an almost military installation surrounding the crashed ship. Containers with those classic Alien eggs are scattered about, as well as some new, odd, yellow eggs. You enter the MUTHUR computer room, just like out of the original film, and traverse two long hallways, both of which have been torn to pieces by… something. Finally, you enter a massive research facility, which offers a hint of just how many different species had been collected by the ship, only to, in the end, finally be greeted by the Xeno itself. The daytime experience will also be open Sunday from 11 a.m. to a.m.-3 p.m. Alien: Earth is on FX August 12, and we'll have more soon.

The trailer heavily features a very blonde Elizabeth McGovern doing her best to recruit Nicholas Denton's character (who has a rare talent, we're told) into the group.
