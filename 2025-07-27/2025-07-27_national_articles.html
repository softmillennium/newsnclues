The man imprisoned for kidnapping and murdering a six-year-old boy in New York City nearly 45 years ago has had his conviction overturned. Patz vanished on the first day he was allowed to walk to the school bus stop by himself on May 25, 1979. He was one of the first missing children to be pictured on milk cartons in a case that drew national attention. President Ronald Reagan later declared May 25, 1983, the first National Missing Children's Day in memory of Patz. A newspaper with a photograph of Etan Patz is seen on May 28, 2012, at a makeshift memorial in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, where Patz lived before his disappearance on May 25, 1979. At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez was working at a convenience shop as a teenager in the child's downtown Manhattan neighborhood. He initially spoke with authorities as they were canvassing for the child, but he did not become a suspect until police received a 2012 tip revealing that Hernandez had previously made remarks about killing a child in New York, but had not mentioned Patz by name. Hernandez was arrested in 2012 and ultimately confessed to the crime after seven hours of questioning, telling investigators he had lured Patz into the store's basement with the promise of giving him a soda. Once inside, Hernandez said he had choked the child because "something just took over me," before putting Patz – who Hernandez said was still alive – inside a box and leaving it alongside a pile of trash. However, Hernandez's lawyers insisted the confession was the result of a mental illness that caused their client to misinterpret his imagination from reality. The attorneys also pointed to Hernandez's very low IQ. "Several factors likely contributed to his confession, including low IQ, mental illness, and heightened suggestibility," Jonathan Alpert, psychotherapist and author of "Therapy Nation," told Fox News Digital. Etan Patz vanished in New York on May 25, 1979. At the time, prosecutors claimed that Hernandez was faking or exaggerating his illness, pointing to Hernandez reportedly admitting to the crimes before police read him his rights and began recording their interview in 2012. He went on to repeat his confession at least twice while being recorded. The confession ultimately led to questions from jurors during their nine days of deliberations, with their final inquiry revolving around whether they were required to rule out the two recorded confessions if they were to determine that the first one was invalid – with the judge telling them they were not. An appeals court later ruled the judge should have provided a better explanation to the jury regarding their options, which could have included not factoring in all three of Hernandez's confessions. The court's decision to overturn Hernandez's conviction and grant him a new trial raises questions regarding mental health and confessions in court cases, as Alpert points to the frequent susceptibility of individuals with mental health disorders to "have an intense need to gain approval from authority figures." "When interrogators suggest a narrative, these individuals can absorb and repeat it, not out of deceit, but out of compliance. Over time, they may even start to believe it themselves, especially when under stress or exhaustion." While a new trial could bring additional clarity for a case that has spanned decades, Alpert warns that it could also lead to misunderstandings regarding testimony and evidence years later. "A retrial has the potential to bring clarity, especially if new psychological insights or evidence are introduced," Alpert told Fox News Digital. "But it could just as easily create more confusion, particularly if the case continues to rely heavily on interpretation rather than hard facts." His parents spent decades in the same home and with the same phone number, in hopes of their son eventually returning to them. The child's family worked to help establish a national missing-children hotline and pioneered a new way for law enforcement agencies throughout the country to distribute information regarding such cases. "They waited and persevered for 35 years for justice for Etan, which today, sadly, may have been lost," former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. told The Associated Press after hearing about the reversal. "For more than 13 years, Pedro Hernandez has been in prison for a crime he did not commit and based on a conviction that the Second Circuit has now made clear was obtained in clear violation of law," Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We are grateful the Court has now given Pedro a chance to get his life back, and we call upon the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to drop these misguided charges and focus their efforts where they belong – on finding those actually responsible for the disappearance of Etan Patz." The Manhattan District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. "This case highlights a broader issue in the legal system," Alpert said. Mental illness, coercion or desperation can all lead someone to admit guilt falsely. Without physical evidence to support a confession, courts must proceed with extreme caution. Understanding the psychology behind a confession is essential before treating it as fact." You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ratcliffe claimed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper could be prosecuted for their role, claiming that they were still involved in a criminal conspiracy against Trump. He said there was “no doubt in my mind” that Clinton, Brennan, and Clapper “conspired.” “I don't think statute of limitations are going to impact, because in a conspiracy, Maria, the statute of limitations doesn't start to run until the last act in the furtherance of that conspiracy,” Ratcliffe said. “Part of why this is so important is that the people behind this are still furthering the conspiracy.” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents earlier this month that she claimed provided evidence that the Obama administration's intelligence officials “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork” for the FBI's later investigation into Russian ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Gabbard has said she has “the evidence” to prosecute Obama administration officials and that she was referring to documents from Obama administration officials to the Justice Department in a “criminal matter.” The recently declassified documents prove that Obama and top White House officials at the time directed investigators to advance narratives tying Trump to Russia with little evidence, according to Gabbard. Special Counsel John Durham's 2023 report found the FBI's handling of the probe into Trump's ties to Russia was “seriously deficient” in spots. Democrats have additionally criticized Gabbard's release and prosecution suggestion. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Gabbard's threat to refer Obama administration officials to federal law enforcement for prosecution “dangerous” and said there was “absolutely” no legal basis for their prosecution.</p>

President Donald Trump holds a conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Turnberry, Scotland. President Donald Trump blasted the European Union for not providing aid to Gaza on Sunday, adding that Israel must "make a decision" about how to handle the region with Hamas still holding hostages. Trump made the comments while meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland. He said that the U.S. has given millions in aid to Gazans, but claimed there has been no assistance from European countries. None of the European countries, by the way, gave – I mean, nobody gave but us and nobody said, gee, thank you very much. And it would be nice to have at least a thank you." Trump went on to note that a deal needs to be made between Israel and Hamas to end the war and return the last remaining hostages to Israel, despite many of them being dead. "But we have a lot of bodies, and the parents want those bodies as much as they would want their child if that child were alive," Trump said of the hostages and their families. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump Turnberry golf club on July 27, 2025 in Turnberry, Scotland. He suggested that Hamas is reluctant to make a deal for the final hostages because they feel it would be "the end for them" if they lose leverage against Israel. "You know, they had a routine discussion the other day and all of a sudden they hardened up. They don't want to give them back. Israel says it is airdropping aid into Gaza amid international criticism. Israel is now conducting airdrops for aid throughout the region, and the IDF says it conducted 28 drops in a matter of hours on Sunday. President Donald Trump says Israel's leaders must "make a decision" about how to end the war in Gaza. The IDF will continue to support the flow of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza," an IDF spokesperson said, claiming Israel transferred roughly 250 trucks full of aid into Gaza this week. The IDF argues the reports about starvation in Gaza were a false campaign promoted by Hamas, but hunger is spreading across the region after the United Nations and the IDF previously failed to reach an agreement about aid distribution, Fox News' Trey Yingst reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wildfires that have engulfed Turkey for weeks threatened the country's fourth-largest city early Sunday, causing more than 1,700 people to flee their homes and leaving a firefighter dead. Meanwhile, firefighters elsewhere in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro, were also battling blazes fed by unusually high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds. Dozens of severe wildfires have hit the country daily since late June, with the government declaring two western provinces, Izmir and Bilecik, disaster areas on Friday. Bursa governor's office said in a statement Sunday that 1,765 people had been safely evacuated from villages to the northeast as more than 1,900 firefighters battled the flames. However, TV footage revealed an ashen landscape where farms and pine forests had earlier stood. Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said fire crews across the country confronted 84 separate blazes Saturday. Unseasonably high temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds have been fueling the wildfires. The General Directorate of Meteorology said Turkey recorded its highest ever temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern Sirnak province on Friday. The highest temperatures for July were seen in 132 other locations, it said. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said late Saturday that prosecutors had investigated fires in 33 provinces since June 26, and that legal action had been taken against 97 suspects. In Greece, firefighters battled active wildfires in the country's southwest and on the island of Kythera on Sunday, following a blaze that scorched the northern Athens suburb of Kryoneri on Saturday. High temperatures, reaching 38°C (100°F) or more, persist across much of the country, though winds have eased slightly. In Kryoneri, 27 residents were evacuated overnight with police assistance after some initially ignored warnings. Authorities urged the public to comply with evacuation orders, warning that resistance puts both civilians and rescuers in danger. The fire service reported three people hospitalized with breathing issues and one firefighter treated for burns at a military hospital. On the island of Evia, where another fire is now under control, media reports indicate large numbers of animals perished in barns. National Fire Service chief Alexander Djartov told reporters that 236 wildfires were burning, many fanned by strong winds. The government had asked EU partners for help, he added, and aircraft were expected from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Hungary and Sweden later Sunday. In the southwestern Strumyani region, overnight blazes forced firefighters to retreat. Dozens of people fled their homes in the western Tran region as flames threatened villages near the Serbian border.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) claimed former President Barack Obama oversaw disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal when Epstein first came into legal trouble under former President George W. Bush. “In 2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made under the Obama administration with Epstein,” Mullin said, adding, “That sweetheart has not been exposed.” Mullin continued, however, to claim incorrectly that the case was handled in 2009 under Obama. In 2008, Epstein struck a plea deal with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who was appointed to that role and several others in the Bush administration. The deal allowed Epstein to avoid a harsher sentence on allegations that he sexually abused underage girls by pleading guilty to state charges in Florida. Epstein served 13 months in Palm Beach County jail and was given extensive work release during the day. Many have questioned Acosta for the lenient deal. Acosta later served in the first Trump administration before resigning from his post as secretary of labor in July 2019, when Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, after months of scrutiny over the deal. In his objection, Mullin said he was trying to “give him cover” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump. I'm sure this would be handled the exact same way. What we're simply wanting to do here is give him cover,” Mullin said. The Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo nearly three weeks ago that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino for years gave voice to conspiracies about Epstein's death and his so-called client list.</p>

"From supermarket manager to bright political star … populism has hit the shores of Japan like a tsunami," Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital about 47-year-old Kamiya's surprise achievement. Holding 15 of 248 Upper House seats is not sufficient for Kamiya's party to submit legislation. However, polling data shows Sanseitō's impact with younger voters, as Kyodo News reported that more than 20% of voters from 18 to 40 voted for his party. Japan's Sanseito Party leader Sohei Kamiya poses with his lawmakers during the party's rally in Tokyo on July 21, 2025, a day after the upper house election. Inspired by President Donald Trump's leadership style, Kamiya's rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to "blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported. Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump's MAGA motto, proclaiming "Japanese first" as his party promises to strengthen Japan's culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration. Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya's goals of "protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan" are "fairly populist," they do not represent "a radical move towards the right wing." In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, "are more right-wing than Sanseitō." Gatling described members of Kamiya's party as "pretty reasonable." Gaitlin said that Kamiya, formerly a reservist in the Self-Defense Forces and an English teacher, "doesn't appear to be playing." Kamiya "has been honing his message for some time," Gatling said. Japan's Sanseito Party leader Sohei Kamiya delivers a speech during the party's rally in Tokyo on July 21, 2025, a day after the upper house election. Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya's anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan "xenophobic" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. "You are meddling too much in our internal affairs." Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic "just doesn't ring true." He explained that the country has "one of the most astonishing cultures in history," formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create "a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world." Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%. President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 7, 2025. At present, imports of U.S. rice are set to increase by 75%, thanks to a $550 billion trade deal President Donald Trump signed with Japan on July 22. "I'm not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees." While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseitō in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not "interested in building a coalition government." Gatling believes the party's future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that "they have reasonable policies." Chang said Sanseitō's win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has "been adrift" since Abe's 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. While the political waves leave Japan "rudderless," Chang said to "expect Sanseitō to only get stronger, which means Japan will turn inward. Around the world, societies have had enough of large foreign populations that do not assimilate, so we should not be surprised that Kamiya will become even more influential. "Change occurs slowly in Japan until it happens all at once. Japan is now on the verge of an all-at-once moment," Chang said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday that Rep. James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, could question former first lady Jill Biden and the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Republican lawmakers have been rallying against former President Joe Biden for his use of an autopen to issue pardons. “Even though Anthony Fauci has been pardoned, there is some question whether it's a legitimate pardon. His pardon wasn't signed by President Biden,” Paul said during an appearance on the radio show Cats Roundtable on WABC 770 AM. “It's unclear whether President Biden is mentally cognizant enough of the situation to know who he pardoned. Biden's chief of staff until 2023, however, testified for several hours last week. Biden has argued that other presidents in previous administrations have used an autopen. “I think there is a question whether these pardons are valid. Interestingly, when he had to do the pardon for his son, he didn't take any chances by running it for the autopen,” Paul said. “The pardon for Hunter Biden for any crimes committed over the last 10 years, any crimes, was done by personal hand signature by Biden, not the autopen,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 21 people were killed on Sunday in an attack on church premises in eastern Congo by Islamic State-backed rebels, according to a civil society leader. Several houses and shops were also burnt. But the search is continuing,” Dieudonne Duranthabo, a civil society coordinator in Komanda, told The Associated Press. Earlier this month, the group killed dozens of people in Ituri in what a United Nations spokesperson described as a bloodbath. A spokesperson for the Congolese army in Ituri province, where Komanda is located, confirmed 10 dead. “What we know this morning is that there was an incursion by armed men with machetes into a church not far from Komanda, where about 10 people were killed and massacred and some shops were set on fire,” Lt. Jules Ngongo, the DRC Army's spokesperson in Ituri, said. The ADF, with ties with the Islamic State, is a rebel group that operates in the borderland between Uganda and Congo, has routinely conducted attacks against civilian populations. “We are truly disappointed because it is incredible that such a situation could occur in a town where all the security officials are present,” Duranthabo said. “Some citizens have started fleeing the area and are heading towards Bunia. “We demand military intervention as soon as possible, since we are told the enemy is still near our town.” The ADF was formed by disparate small groups in Uganda in the late 1990s following alleged discontent with Yoweri Museveni. In 2002, following military assaults by Ugandan forces, the group moved its activities to neighboring DRC and has since been responsible for the killings of thousands of civilians. In 2019, it pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.</p>

These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat. During a nasty summer heat wave — see: much of the US right now — water is a reliable source of relief. Where there are no rivers or lakes to swim in, we still might have swimming pools, sprinklers, and popsicles to keep ourselves cool. Bouts of extreme heat and drought — which are becoming more common and less predictable as global temperatures rise — can cause natural watering holes in many different types of ecosystems to dry up. And animals don't have a tap they can simply turn on. That leaves them with few places to hydrate and cool off, putting their lives, often already imperiled, at risk. But in some parts of the world, humans are offering help. They refill them regularly, providing a reliable source of fresh water that animals can drink from or splash in, even when there's no rain. And luckily for us, they also put motion-activated cameras nearby to see which animals were using them. The footage reveals a diverse cast of jungle characters, including those that are rarely seen, like jaguars and tapirs — large herbivores with distinct trunk-like noses. It also exposed some interesting animal behaviors, Ponce said. Researchers noticed that spider monkeys seemed to prefer drinking from raised water containers — perhaps so that they can quickly escape if predators approach, Ponce said. They don't have technologies like air conditioning and water purification to survive all the ways in which we're altering the planet, from heating it up to filling it with pollution. And when climate disasters hit, the impacts are often devastating to wild animals, too. But there are simple ways to help wildlife cope with the world we've created for them, like putting out (clean) hummingbird feeders and bird baths or extinguishing invasive mosquitos that are spreading avian malaria. “Artificial watering holes are not a permanent solution,” Rony García-Anleu, who leads biological research at Wildlife Conservation Society Guatemala, said in a press release. “But they are a vital tool in helping wildlife adapt to increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions.” What budget cuts mean for wildlife, climate monitoring — and surviving peak tourism. They were already on the edge of extinction. The Endangered Species Act has a major problem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Growing discontent within his own nation's borders, concerns about religious extremism, and a government report pushing for Palestinian state recognition point to the idea that his decision might have been motivated by self-interest. “France's recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state must be motivated by domestic French politics, because it certainly does nothing to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace,” Orde Kittrie, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and law professor at Arizona State University, speculated to the Washington Examiner. Kittrie, who also served for over a decade as an attorney at the United States's State Department, pointed to the tumultuous relationship between the French government and Islamic communities within its borders as a possible motivator. “France's Muslim population numbers over 6 million, the largest in Europe, and Macron has recently undertaken a crackdown on what he calls Islamic separatism in France, which has led to accusations that his government is making it harder for Muslims to express their identity.” She continued, “Macron's foreign policy move to throw Israel under the bus was evidently taken to appease Muslim critics of his domestic crackdown on Islamic separatism.” The French government itself has acknowledged that such a move could help appease Muslim citizens, who accuse their leaders of Islamophobia. The French Ministry of Interior released a report in May that noted a “tense climate prevailing in France following October 7 between Jewish and Muslim communities” and “deep unease within the latter, which perceives the French position as openly pro-Israel, in line with an alleged ‘state Islamophobia,' supporting Jewish Israelis against Muslim Palestinians.” The report claimed that this dichotomy is being weaponized by the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist groups operating clandestinely in France to radicalize Muslim citizens. Previous laws restricting religious expression in public spaces have been augmented by crackdowns on illicit Islamic homeschools, doctors providing “virginity certificates,” instances of clandestine polygamy, and reports of forced marriages. These measures have only inflamed tensions between Muslims and the rest of French society. If Macron was hoping for support in his decision from across the Atlantic, he is likely disappointed. Kittrie claims the French government's decision to appease Palestinian leaders is weakening U.S. negotiating positions, providing the illusion of a path forward outside previously established demands. France's decision is expected to be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you regularly make donations to tax-exempt charities and non-profits, you should be aware of upcoming rule changes governing how much of your contributions will be deductible. Some of the changes, which are in President Donald Trump's recently enacted federal tax-and-spending cuts packag﻿e, affect filers who take the standard deduction. Others affect filers who itemize — which you do when your individual deductions combined exceed the standard. Here's a rundown of some key changes that will take effect in 2026: In the first two years of the pandemic, if you took the standard deduction on your federal income tax return, you also were allowed to deduct an additional $300 ($600 for married couples filing jointly) for charitable cash gifts you made. But, starting in 2026 you will be allowed to deduct up to $1,000 in cash donations ($2,000 for joint filers). “This applies only to direct cash gifts to qualifying 501(c)(3) charities — not donor-advised funds or private foundations,” said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. Starting in 2026, those who itemize their deductions will — for the first time — be allowed to deduct their cash contributions ﻿only to the extent they exceed 0.5% of their adjusted gross income. Related article Here's who will — and won't — qualify for the new car loan interest deduction For example, say your adjusted gross income is $100,000. An existing rule that further limits itemizers will remain in effect: It sets a ceiling for how much you may deduct of your contributions to public charities in a given year. Specifically, you can't deduct the portion of your cash donations that exceed 60% of your AGI in the year you make them, O'Saben said. (The AGI limit is typically 30% for cash gifts made to donor-advised funds and private foundations, he added.) But you may be able to deduct any cash gifts you made outside the allowable limits in the next tax year. That's thanks to another existing rule that lets itemizers carry forward their “excess” contributions for five years and deduct them on future returns. The value of one's deductions for anyone whose taxable income puts them in the top tax bracket of 37% will be treated as if they were in the 35% bracket. Related article Who will — and won't — benefit from the bigger SALT deduction Here's how that will work: Say you itemize and are allowed to deduct $10,000 in cash donations after accounting for the new 0.5% of AGI rule above. You will reduce your tax liability by only $3,500 (35% x $10,000), O'Saben explained. If you itemize, any non-cash contributions you make – such as clothes, food or household goods – are also subject to the new 0.5%-of-AGI floor. If you're taking the standard deduction, you won't be able to deduct your non-cash contributions since the $1,000/$2,000 limit for non-itemizers applies only to cash gifts.

Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Ranger Suárez (55) throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the New York Yankees, Saturday, July 26, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge. Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series. Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said. New York fell a season-high 6 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break. Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season. Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half. Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup. New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.</p>
