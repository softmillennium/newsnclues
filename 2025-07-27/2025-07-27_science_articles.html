                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the same vein as weather forecast models that predict developing storms, researchers now have developed a method to predict the cell activity in tissues over time. The new software combines genomics technologies with computational modeling to predict cell changes in behavior, such as communication between cells that could cause cancer cells to flourish. It is the result of a multi-year, multi-lab project at the interface of software development with important collaborations between bench and clinical team science researchers. This research eventually could lead to computer programs that could help determine the best treatment for cancer patients by essentially creating a "digital twin" of the patient. "Although standard biomedical research has made immeasurable strides in characterizing cellular ecosystems with genomics technologies, the result is still a single snapshot in time -- rather than showing how diseases, like cancer, can arise from communication between the cells," said Jeanette Johnson, PhD, a Postdoc Fellow at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at UMSOM and co-first author of this study. "Cancer is controlled or enabled by the immune system, which is highly individualized; this complexity makes it difficult to make predictions from human cancer data to a specific patient." What makes this research unique is the use of a plain-language "hypothesis grammar" that uses common language as a bridge between biological systems and computational models and simulates how cells act in tissue. Paul Macklin, PhD, Professor of Intelligence Systems Engineering at Indiana University led a team of researchers who developed the grammar to describe cell behavior. Dr. Bergman and his colleagues at IGS then combined this grammar with genomic data from real patient samples to study breast and pancreatic cancer, with technologies such as spatial transcriptomics. In breast cancer, the IGS team modeled an effect where the immune system cannot curtail tumor cell growth and instead promotes invasion and cancer spread. They adapted this computational modeling framework to simulate a real-world immunotherapy clinical trial of pancreatic cancer. For example, pancreatic cancer is a difficult cancer to treat, in part, because it is often surrounded by a dense structure of non-cancerous cells called fibroblasts. "What makes these models so exciting to me as someone who studies immunology is that they can be informed, initialized, and built upon using both laboratory and human genomics data," said Dr. Johnson. So, for instance, we can take data and treat it as a snapshot of what the human immune system is doing, and this framework gives us a sandbox to freely investigate our hypotheses of what's happening there over time without extra costs or risk to patients." "Ever since my transitioning from my training in weather prediction at the University of Maryland, College Park into computation, I have believed that we could apply the same principles to work across biological systems to make predictive models in cancer. "Adapting this approach to genomics technologies gives us a virtual cell laboratory in which we can conduct experiments to test the implications of cellular rules entirely in silico." Dr. Fertig calls the research "a tapestry of team science" with additional validation of the computational models coming from clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University and Oregon Health Sciences University. The new grammar is open source so that all scientists can benefit from it. "By making this tool accessible to the scientific community, we are providing a path forward to standardize such models and make them generally accepted," said Dr. Bergman. The team of senior authors on this study include, Paul Macklin, PhD, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education and Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering at the Indiana School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University, Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, Bloomberg Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Assistant Director Single-Cell Training and Analysis Center (STAC) at Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Fertig are continuing efforts to disseminate this software and extend its integration with genomics data for automatic model formulation through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Informatics Technology in Cancer Research Consortium, who funded this study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UCSF scientists have discovered how microglia engulf and break down amyloid beta, a protein that builds up in Alzheimer's, with devastating consequences for the brain. In Alzheimer's disease, proteins like amyloid beta form clumps, known as plaques, that damage the brain. But in some people, immune cells called microglia break down these proteins before they can cause harm. Researchers at UC San Francisco identified a molecular receptor that enables microglia to gobble up and digest amyloid beta plaques. "We think this receptor helps microglia do their job of keeping the brain healthy over many years," said Xianhua Piao, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist in the UCSF Department of Pediatrics. This bodes well for a rapid translation of the discovery into new therapies. "Some people are lucky to have responsible microglia," Piao said. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New findings from studying over two decades of satellite observations reveal that the Earth's continents have experienced unprecedented freshwater loss since 2002, driven by climate change, unsustainable groundwater use and extreme droughts. The study, led by Arizona State University and published on July 25 in Science Advances, highlights the emergence of four continental-scale "mega-drying" regions, all located in the northern hemisphere, and warns of severe consequences for water security, agriculture, sea level rise and global stability. The research team reports that drying areas on land are expanding at a rate roughly twice the size of California every year. And, the rate at which dry areas are getting drier now outpaces the rate at which wet areas are getting wetter, reversing long-standing hydrological patterns. The negative implications of this for available freshwater are staggering. This is an 'all-hands-on-deck' moment -- we need immediate action on global water security." The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from the US-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. "It is striking how much non-renewable water we are losing," said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU. "Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy." In a previous study, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002 -- 2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized 'hotspots' for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected -- forming the four continental-scale mega drying regions. Southwestern North America and Central America: this region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities such as Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and Mexico City. Northern Russia: this region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate models -- sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios. "This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage," said Chandanpurkar. The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale," said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former Senior Water Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea level rise and help preserve water for future generations." The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis. The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from US-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. This research was funded by the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University, the GRACE Follow-On Science Team, and World Bank Global Water Monitoring.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new material developed by researchers from University of Toronto Engineering could offer a safer alternative to the non-stick chemicals commonly used in cookware and other applications. The new substance repels both water and grease about as well as standard non-stick coatings -- but it contains much lower amounts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of chemicals that have raised environmental and health concerns. "The research community has been trying to develop safer alternatives to PFAS for a long time," says Professor Kevin Golovin, who heads the Durable Repellent Engineered Advanced Materials (DREAM) Laboratory at U of T Engineering. Scientists had hit an upper limit to the performance of these alternative materials." Since its invention in the late 1930s, Teflon -- also known as polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE -- has become famous for its ability to repel water, oil and grease alike. However, this chemical inertness also causes PFAS to resist the normal processes that would break down other organic molecules over time. In addition to their persistence, PFAS are known to accumulate in biological tissues, and their concentrations can become amplified as they travel up the food chain. Various studies have linked exposure to high levels of PFAS to certain types of cancer, birth defects and other health problems, with the longer chain PFAS generally considered more harmful than the shorter ones. "The material we've been working with as an alternative to PFAS is called polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS," says Golovin. To overcome this problem, PhD student Samuel Au developed a new chemistry technique that the team is calling nanoscale fletching. "Unlike typical silicone, we bond short chains of PDMS to a base material -- you can think of them like bristles on a brush," says Au. "To improve their ability to repel oil, we have now added in the shortest possible PFAS molecule, consisting of a single carbon with three fluorines on it. Au and the team coated their new material on a piece of fabric, then placed drops of various oils on it to see how well it could repel them. On a scale developed by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, the new coating achieved a grade of 6, placing it on par with many standard PFAS-based coatings. "While we did use a PFAS molecule in this process, it is the shortest possible one and therefore does not bioaccumulate," says Golovin. Golovin says that the team is open to collaborating with manufacturers of non-stick coatings who might wish to scale up and commercialize the process. In the meantime, they will continue working on even more alternatives. "The holy grail of this field would be a substance that outperforms Teflon, but with no PFAS at all," says Golovin. "We're not quite there yet, but this is an important step in the right direction."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis of studies incorporating data from almost 30 million people has highlighted the role that air pollution - including that coming from car exhaust emissions - plays in increased risk of dementia. Air pollution has recently been identified as a risk factor for dementia, with several studies pointing the finger at a number of pollutants. However, the strength of evidence and ability to determine a causal effect has been varied. In a paper published on July 24 in The Lancet Planetary Health, a team led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature to examine this link further. This approach allowed them to bring together studies that on their own may not provide sufficient evidence, and which sometimes disagree with each other, to provide more robust overarching conclusions. For each 1 μg/m³ of soot as found in PM2.5, the relative risk increased by 13%. Senior author Dr Haneen Khreis from the MRC Epidemiology Unit said: "Epidemiological evidence plays a crucial role in allowing us to determine whether or not air pollution increases the risk of dementia and by how much. Our work provides further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults. "Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate, and economic benefits. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how air pollution may cause dementia, primarily involving inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress (a chemical process in the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins, and DNA). Air pollution is thought to trigger these processes through direct entry to the brain or via the same mechanisms underlying lung and cardiovascular diseases. Stricter limits for several pollutants are likely to be necessary targeting major contributors such as the transport and industry sectors. Given the extent of air pollution, there is an urgent need for regional, national, and international policy interventions to combat air pollution equitably." Further analysis revealed that while exposure to these pollutants increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the effect seemed stronger for vascular dementia, a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Around 180,000 people in the UK are thought to be affected by this type of dementia. However, as there were only a small number of studies that examined this difference, the researchers did not class it as statistically significant. Joint first author Dr Christiaan Bredell from the University of Cambridge and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust said: "These findings underscore the need for an interdisciplinary approach to dementia prevention. Preventing dementia is not just the responsibility of healthcare: this study strengthens the case that urban planning, transport policy, and environmental regulation all have a significant role to play."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000. A major new study led by the University of Sydney suggests that walking 7000 steps a day offers similar health benefits across several outcomes as walking 10,000. Led by Professor Melody Ding from the School of Public Health, the study was published in The Lancet Public Healthand analysed data from 57 studies from 2014 to 2025 that were conducted in more than ten countries including Australia, USA, UK and Japan. Professor Melody Ding says the findings offer a more achievable benchmark for people who struggle to meet traditional exercise guidelines. "Aiming for 7000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn't been looked at before," said Professor Ding. "However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2000 to 4000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain. "We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes -- including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms." Starting at 2000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes of people walking more steps a day at 1000 step increments to see whether there was any difference in the risk of early death or other major diseases. "For people who are already active, 10,000 steps a day is great," said Dr Katherine Owen, co-author and chief analyst of the study from the School of Public Health. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements," said Professor Ding.
