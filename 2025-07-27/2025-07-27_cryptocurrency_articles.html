                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is rapidly emerging as the institutional favorite, with new ETF inflow data suggesting a seismic shift in investor focus away from Bitcoin. According to figures shared by SosoValue and highlighted by market analysts like Crypto Rover, Ethereum spot ETFs attracted an eye-popping $1.85 billion in net inflows during the week ending July 25, 2025. The data paints a clear picture: investors are piling into Ethereum-based products at an accelerating pace. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs brought in just over $5.83 billion across the entire month of July—but the inflows have been decelerating week over week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's total net assets held steady around $151 billion, but with sharply lower weekly momentum. The latest spike in ETH ETF flows adds fuel to the rising “Utility Season” narrative, where investors shift their attention from Bitcoin's store-of-value status to more functional Layer 1 ecosystems like Ethereum. This shift is partly driven by Ethereum's diverse use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to enterprise blockchain adoption. Analysts see the trend as a sign that institutional investors are now more interested in yield-bearing, smart contract-capable assets. The sustained flow into Ethereum may also be signaling growing confidence in the long-term roadmap of ETH, especially with its upcoming scaling upgrades and L2 growth. If ETH continues to outpace BTC in weekly flows, it may prompt a broader asset reallocation across crypto portfolios—one that favors utility and programmability over digital gold. Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a breakout phase eerily reminiscent of its historic 2017 rally—but this time, the move is backed by deep institutional support and ETF inflows. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently outlined his bullish stance on Ethereum, linking it directly to the rapid growth of the stablecoin sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple (XRP) has emerged as a focal point in discussions about systemic solutions to global financial instability, with recent academic research and institutional analysis highlighting its potential role in addressing post-crisis challenges. Ripple was explicitly cited as one of several innovations aimed at mitigating systemic risks through real-time settlements and reduced transaction complexity [1]. The presentation positioned Ripple alongside initiatives like IBM's Blockchain World Wire and JP Morgan Chase's Interbank Information Network, framing these technologies as part of a broader effort to modernize financial infrastructure [1]. Crypto researcher SMQKE amplified these findings, noting that Ripple's academic citations were not isolated but appeared twice in formal economic literature. SMQKE's analysis also challenged perceptions of XRP as a speculative asset, pointing to its adoption by major institutions for cross-border payments. Partnerships with entities like American Express and Santander were cited as evidence of XRP's practical application in streamlining liquidity challenges [1]. The debate over XRP's role extends beyond academia, with institutional adoption metrics such as $133 million in tokenized assets on Ripple's chain reflecting incremental progress [4]. Analysts like Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered have projected XRP's price could reach $12.25 by 2029, though such forecasts remain speculative [2]. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously suggested the token could capture 14% of SWIFT's transaction volume, a benchmark that remains aspirational [3]. While XRP may not feature in everyday transactions, its backend utility for financial institutions—enabling real-time gross settlements and reducing costs—has garnered significant traction. This dynamic challenges critics who dismiss XRP's real-world relevance, particularly as blockchain solutions continue to address inefficiencies in global remittance flows [1].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has rallied to more than $3,800 this week, gaining roughly 60% over the past month, according to data provider CoinGecko—a sign that “ETH season” is finally nigh. Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin programmer who worked on the blockchain alongside its creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than a decade ago, said Ethereum and its native token will thrive, largely due to the usefulness and ubiquity of its technology. “I'm not bearish on Ethereum because everybody is building on EVM,” Garzik told Decrypt, referring to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a decentralized computation engine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The Bitcoin OG's endorsement of Ethereum comes as the layer-1 appears to recover from a crisis of confidence that coincided with ETH's plunge to $1,410 on April 7— its lowest price since March 2023. ETH sailed to $3,844 on July 21 and popped even higher earlier Sunday, and has remained roughly $1,000 below its all-time high of $4,878 set in November 2021, according to CoinGecko, buoyed by institutional and corporate investments into the altcoin. Spot Ethereum ETFs notched $2.12 billion worth of inflows the week before last, nearly doubling their previous record, according to Farside Investors data—and then flipped Bitcoin ETF flows last week. Meanwhile, a spate of Ethereum treasury companies—including Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink—have added billions of dollars in ETH to their coffers over the past few weeks. However, Garzik believes it is Ethereum's technological contributions—not recent investor interest in its token—that signal the project's chances for long-term success. Garzik has tapped the EVM tech for Hemi Network, a layer-2 network that is compatible with both Bitcoin and Ethereum, that launched its mainnet in March. “I look at it maybe from a different perspective than price,” the developer said. Declining to offer a price prediction for ETH, Garzik noted that much of the crypto ecosystem is largely undergirded by Ethereum's technology. EVM is used across many popular blockchains, including Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Asked about so-called Ethereum killers such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos, which use their own nodes and programming languages instead of the EVM, Garzik said: “You've got a lot of people saying, 'I've got this latest whizbang technology. [But] none of them have time in the market.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin suddenly ups the volatility into Sunday's weekly close, with key liquidation zones on the radar and predictions of bigger BTC "price swings" to come. Bitcoin stages a late comeback into the weekly close as price approaches important liquidation zones. Traders and analysts emphasize various key price points to reclaim next. Volatility is expected based on large-volume trading behavior, analysis reports. Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $119,000 Sunday as bulls extended a rebound from two-week lows. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD approaching a key reclaim area. 🇨🇳🇺🇸 JUST IN: China and the US have agreed to extend their pause on tariffs for another 90 days. “$BTC needs to break above $119.5K for a big move. If that doesn't happen, this consolidation will continue,” crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows summarized in a post on X. Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a slightly higher range ceiling just below the $120,000 mark. In an X thread on the topic, fellow trader CrypNuevo identified a downside target confluent with an area of exchange order-book liquidity. Liquidation clusters: we're in-between 2 liquidation clusters located at:• $121k - $120k• $114.5k - $113.6kBased on similarities with previous cases, we could go for the cluster above first, and then reverse again to the bottom one. Should Bitcoin return to challenge all-time highs near $123,000, short liquidations would total over $1.1 billion. “Strong resistance forming around 119,000–120,000, indicated by dense liquidation clusters,” crypto analysis platform Coinank agreed while examining its own liquidity data. Analyst TheKingfisher additionally warned of heightened volatility on short timeframes. This indicates dealers are heavily short gamma, suggesting they may amplify volatility to hedge their positions,” he reported on X Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR) is pulling off some form of financial alchemy: using bitcoin, historically a volatile asset, to create something that looks a lot like stability. The offering doesn't give investors direct bitcoin exposure, yet it's backed by the asset in spirit and structure, according to a recent NYDIG report. Strategy holds $71.7 billion in bitcoin and just $11 billion in liabilities, giving it room to deliver income even if crypto prices dip, the report notes. Historically, bitcoin has returned at least 3%–4% annually over any five-year stretch, while average returns have been significantly higher. Strategy is betting it can use this return profile to sustain high payouts without touching its crypto stash, essentially turning long-term bitcoin appreciation into monthly cash flow. STRC may not just be a yield vehicle, but rather bitcoin, reworked for traditional finance income investors. A kind of money-market fund, remixed with crypto under the hood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin issuer Circle's $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance. Even Jamie Dimon's getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America's largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019. It's the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money). The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance. The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years' imprisonment). Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog: “The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.” Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting: For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.” Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. “The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.” What's more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. “We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.” But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.” Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. “The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.” The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens. We're seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate. While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry's most vocal critics. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me: “Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.” “Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We're about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps', all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago. We're seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There's also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.” One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. If the Treasury Department's projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. “The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds. The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.” With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain's potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. “During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases. I don't see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms: This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed. We're entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that's precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.” As an industry OG, she's not phased by market volatility and frequently scrimps on Starbucks to BTFD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The non-fungible token (NFT) market has climbed with massive shifts in terms of collection rankings over the past seven days. This noteworthy progress of the NFT sector indicates the growing sentiment, ecosystem utility, and liquidity.

Apart from that, Pudgy Penguins has attained the 3rd spot, with its sales volume touching $8,346,811 after a 9.63% decrease. Following that, in the 4th position, Courtyard has reached $8,281,937 in terms of sales volume, denoting a 35.13% plunge. Subsequently, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) claims $5,862,545 when it comes to sales volume, underscoring a 62.33% upsurge. Additionally, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) occupies the 7th rank among the top-performing NFT collections of last week based on sales volume, reaching $4,874,728.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Bobby Ong, traders can efficiently monitor NFT floor prices, add preferred NFTs to their portfolios, and receive price alerts using the CoinGecko app. According to Bobby Ong, a prominent figure in the crypto space, users can now track NFT floor prices directly on the CoinGecko app, add their favorite NFTs to personal portfolios, and even set up price alerts to stay ahead of market movements. This reminder comes at a pivotal time when many anticipate the resurgence of 'NFT season,' a period characterized by heightened trading activity, soaring valuations, and innovative project launches. For traders, this functionality represents a game-changer, enabling real-time monitoring of NFT assets alongside traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), potentially uncovering arbitrage opportunities between digital collectibles and broader market trends. Building an effective NFT portfolio requires more than just collecting digital art or virtual real estate; it's about strategic positioning for volatility and growth. With tools like the CoinGecko app, traders can analyze floor price fluctuations— the minimum price at which an NFT from a collection can be purchased— to gauge market sentiment and predict rallies. For instance, historical data shows that during previous NFT booms, floor prices for blue-chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks surged by over 200% within weeks, correlating strongly with Ethereum's price movements due to gas fees and network activity. Traders should focus on on-chain metrics such as trading volume, unique holders, and minting rates to identify undervalued assets. By setting price alerts, you can capitalize on dips below key support levels, say a 10-15% drop from recent highs, turning potential losses into buying opportunities. Current market sentiment around NFTs is cautiously optimistic, influenced by broader economic factors including institutional interest in blockchain technology. While real-time data isn't specified here, traders should note that NFT trading volumes have shown resilience, with recent reports indicating a 20-30% uptick in monthly transactions across major marketplaces. For example, if AI-driven stocks rally, it might spill over to AI-themed NFTs, creating trading pairs worth monitoring. Risk management is crucial; diversify across categories like art, gaming, and utility NFTs to hedge against sector-specific downturns. As we approach what could be a vibrant NFT season, leveraging apps like CoinGecko for alerts ensures you're not caught off-guard by sudden pumps or dumps. Ultimately, this preparation enhances overall portfolio performance, bridging the gap between speculative NFT plays and stable crypto holdings for long-term gains. Institutional flows, such as venture capital pouring into Web3 projects, could drive floor prices higher, with metrics showing a 15% increase in funding rounds this quarter. Correlate this with stock indices; a Nasdaq uptrend often precedes NFT rallies due to tech synergies. For actionable insights, monitor pairs like ETH/NFT indices, where a 5% ETH gain has historically led to 8-12% NFT floor appreciations. By setting up your portfolio now, you're positioning for alpha in a market ripe with potential, emphasizing data-driven decisions over hype.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins are pulling heavy attention this week with some surprising price moves and major ecosystem updates. But the coin leading the narrative right now is BlockDAG, thanks to its extended BEAT VESTING PASS deadline, record-breaking presale, and a tech rollout that's hitting every milestone before launch. Whether it's speed, scale, or speculative upside, they're pushing forward in unique ways. These are the top trending altcoins making noise this week, and why they matter. BlockDAG has once again taken the spotlight after extending its BEAT VESTING PASS deadline until August 4. This extension lets users unlock 100% liquidity at launch, with zero lockups, something very few presales offer. With over $353 million raised and more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins sold, the project is setting up for a GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. BlockDAG isn't just talking about community, it's delivering tools. Its hybrid DAG + PoW architecture supports smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps, all while keeping energy costs low. With strategic deals signed with Inter Milan, Seattle Seawolves, and Seattle Orcas, and CEX listings ready to roll out post-launch, BlockDAG is being tracked as the leader among top trending altcoins right now. This is the final stretch to grab BDAG with full launch liquidity locked in. Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong near $3,770, showing about a 22% gain over the week. This kind of movement is putting Ethereum back into breakout territory, with $4,000 as the next target. Traders are watching to see if ETH can hold its momentum and push through that level soon. ETH is also outperforming both XRP and BTC over the last five days. Analysts have identified $3,300–$3,350 as strong support, with breakout potential above $3,850. XRP is currently trading around $3.19, retreating from a recent high of $3.45–$3.53. That ~6% pullback came after broad market liquidations and some whale profit-taking. Others look ahead to $10 or more in the long run, depending on regulatory moves. Ripple's XRPL now supports a new stablecoin (RLUSD), and real-world use cases are expanding in areas like healthcare through integrations with Wellgistics. While XRP has cooled slightly, it remains one of the top trending altcoins this week. Analysts are closely watching support levels at $3.10–$3.15 to see if the next leg up is coming soon. Solana (SOL) is trading around $187, down from a recent local high near $200. This correction is tied to overall market pressure and broad liquidations. Still, analysts are projecting a move to $250 if sentiment rebounds. That number isn't random, it reflects trading volume builds and ETF-related optimism that could re-center attention on SOL if ETH and BTC slow down. Despite the dip, Solana continues to draw attention from high-volume traders and smart contract developers. Some traders are reallocating profits from Ethereum into Solana and speculative tokens like Jupiter or Remittix. Even with short-term price dips, SOL is holding firm as one of the top trending altcoins, with real activity on-chain and developers continuing to deploy new projects. XRP is still showing solid upside after a temporary pullback. But BlockDAG isn't just catching up to these coins, it's outperforming on every metric right now: community size, user activity, presale performance, and real utility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a recent report by The Hill, at least 27 crypto companies and advocates have submitted their first lobbying disclosures over the past months, reflecting a growing desire to influence legislation that could shape the future of digital assets. Per the report, these called “newcomers” represent a diverse array of interests within the industry, from betting platforms like Polymarket to gaming companies creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to high-profile events. Together, these entities have invested nearly $2.8 million between April and June to lobby for legislation promoting digital assets, targeting key regulatory bodies such as the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A total of 73 companies and associations reportedly engaged in federal lobbying activities related to cryptocurrency, spending about $11.4 million. Among the new entrants, KuCoin, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, led lobbying expenditures with $1 million, despite being barred from operating in the US market for at least two years due to regulatory violations. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Solana Policy Institute, emphasized that the industry has struggled not with innovation, but with understanding how emerging technologies fit within existing legal frameworks. While some companies like Bitdeer Technologies, which focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, continue to address currency-related issues, many firms are leveraging blockchain technology for a broader range of financial products. Polymarket, operating under the name Blockratize, allows users to place bets on various events using cryptocurrencies, while Gala Games sponsored the White House's Easter Egg Roll, promoting their online gaming platform that rewards players with crypto tokens. Additionally, a bill banning the Federal Reserve (Fed) from issuing its own digital asset or central bank digital currency (CBDC) has garnered interest from within the sector. However, Whitehouse-Levine expressed concerns about the potential for regulatory shifts, fearing a return to the cautious stance that characterized previous administrations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT market is showing real signs of recovery. From Pudgy Penguins surpassing BAYC to Art Blocks' unexpected return, the market atmosphere is changing. The NFT market is showing strong signs of recovery. Weekly trading volume jumped 51% to $136 million, on track to make July one of the best performing months since February. In just 7 days, the average price of NFT soared 40% to $146. Trading volume decreased, prices rose, the market is changing. RWA NFTs follow closely behind, accounting for 11%, indicating that the tokenization narrative still has vitality. But not all categories have joined the rise. NFTs in the sports, music and fashion sectors have not seen an upward trend. Although game NFTs performed steadily in the second quarter, their popularity has cooled slightly, with sales falling significantly this week. Nevertheless, PFP's dominance is in line with current market sentiment. Pudgy Penguins' market value has officially surpassed Bored Ape Yacht Club and is now second only to CryptoPunks. The floor price has risen by 539% since its release, and it has risen by another 7% in the past 7 days. Simple: they were released during the bear market. From IRL benefits to connecting Web2 and Web3, and now expanding in Asia through plush toys, the brand's emergence is at the right time, especially now that collectibles hype is hot. The punk era never really ended, but it seems to have regained its luster. Don't forget, this was a free mint in 2017. For some, owning a punk collectible is more than just about making money — it's a status symbol, pure and simple. And now, that status is becoming increasingly popular. Moonbirds is back again, and to be honest, it's a bit surprising. After fading from blue chip status, Moonbirds staged a strong rebound: Following its acquisition by Orange Cap Games in May, the company announced a partnership with Towns on July 19. Holders can now access a private on-chain space and increase points ahead of the airdrop. It's worth mentioning that Moonbirds is still down 64% in USD value since launch, so there's still a long way to go. This week, it ranked among the most traded collections, with an average selling price soaring 156%. On July 10, the platform announced a major change, launching collector profiles, wallet aggregation, achievement systems, and providing a better user experience for ordinary collectors. Top projects like Fidenza have rekindled interest, and Feels like Art is starting to come back into the NFT discussion. PFP and art are accelerating, and if history is any indication, this combination will kick off the next NFT bull run. Pudgy Penguins surpassed BAYC, CryptoPunks heated up again, and Moonbirds spread its wings, all of which hint at one thing: the market is shifting and attention is refocusing on NFT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a bold move that places it among the global leaders in blockchain infrastructure, Vietnam has officially launched NDAChain, a Layer-1 blockchain platform designed to be the backbone of its digital data ecosystem. This marks a significant milestone in the country's journey toward decentralized data management and Web3 adoption. Read More: Vietnam Legalizes Crypto: Landmark Law to Regulate Digital Assets and Spark Web3 Boom Vietnam's digital economy is rapidly evolving, driven by an ambitious government roadmap that emphasizes national data sovereignty and secure infrastructure. Read More: Vietnam Moves National Crypto Exchange Pilot Forward with Bybit's Technical Support At launch, the system is operated by a consortium of 49 validator nodes, including by both government agencies and private companies Zalo, SunGroup, Masan, Sovico, VNVC, and MISA. Fundamentally, NDAChain utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus, which favors the speed and trust over decentralization. Each validator node holds a distributed ledger, can deploy smart contracts, and supports identity verification which are all integrated with Vietnam's national digital ID system (VNeID). One of the largest NDAChain use cases is NDA DID – Decentralized Identity for Vietnam. The entire solution is fully compatible with VNeID and other national-level databases. NDAKey enables citizens to verify in real-time claims about their identities, an important component of Vietnam's battle against fraud, impersonation and scams as the country's economy becomes increasingly digitized. This digital certificate traces a product's journey from production to consumption, enabling: By embedding these UIDs as QR codes or RFID chips, manufacturers can register tamper-proof records of a product's history directly on NDAChain. The NDAChain rollout is aligned with Vietnam's National Blockchain Strategy, formalized through Decision No. Unlike these, Vietnam has adopted a hybrid model: balancing control and performance with open architecture, allowing Layer 2 applications and private-sector innovation on top of a government-backed chain. These applications are being encouraged through incentives for startups and blockchain developers to build on NDAChain's infrastructure.
