Follow:


            The Supreme Court's decision Thursday to weigh in on transgender sports bans will put two conservative justices in the spotlight in coming months, both because of what they have said in past cases involving LGBTQ rights – and what they haven't.
    


            Only two justices have written majority opinions involving transgender Americans – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch – and both avoided revealing their thoughts about the sports cases last month when, in a blockbuster ruling, the Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth.
    


            For the second time in as many years the high court will wrestle with a heated legal dispute involving young transgender Americans at a time when they are facing severe political backlash driven in part by President Donald Trump and conservative states. The court agreed to hear appeals in two related cases challenging laws in West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender girls and women from competing on women's sports teams – including one that was filed by a middle school student at the time.
    


             While the court swerved around fundamental questions about trans rights in last month's decision in US v. Skrmetti, it will be far harder to do so in the sports cases.
    


            And that could put enormous focus on Roberts and Gorsuch.
    


            “Even though the court ruled against the transgender plaintiffs in Skrmetti, it did not decide the larger and more important question of whether discrimination based on transgender status triggers more searching judicial review,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            “Everything,” Vladeck predicted, “is going to come down to where Roberts and Gorsuch are.”
    


            In some ways, the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on June 18 upholding Tennessee's ban on certain transgender care was limited. That opinion, written by Roberts, explicitly declined to decide if the law discriminated against transgender youth. Tennessee's policy, Roberts reasoned, instead drew boundaries based on age and medical procedures that were well within a state's power to regulate.
    


            That logic avoided thorny questions about whether the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause if it specifically targeted transgender minors for different treatment.
    


            Tennessee's law, Roberts wrote, “classifies on the basis of age” and “classifies on the basis of medical use.”
    


            But it will be more difficult for the court to duck those broader questions in the sports cases, several experts said.
    


            “It is notable that the court seemed to go out of its way to avoid endorsing the idea that the law discriminated against transgender people and instead found that the Tennessee law had drawn lines based on age and medical diagnoses,” said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert on gender and sexuality law.
    


            “The new cases squarely present the discrimination questions in ways that will be hard to avoid,” she said.
    


            “It's important,” she said, “not to lose sight of the fact that these cases involve kids trying to make their way through school and life like every other kid.”
    


            Gorsuch, who was Trump's first nominee to the Supreme Court, joined the majority opinion in the Tennessee case but did not write separately to explain his position.
    


            His silence was significant given that one of the key arguments at stake was how – or whether – to apply the landmark 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County that he authored. In that decision, the court ruled that transgender workers are covered by federal protections against discrimination based on sex  because discrimination against a transgender person is, by extension, necessarily also discrimination based on sex.
    


            The Biden administration and transgender teenagers fighting Tennessee's law asserted that the same logic should apply when it comes to gender identity care bans. But the court has never extended its reasoning in Bostock beyond the workplace, and the decision drew immediate and sharp criticism from the right at the time.
    


            John Bursch, a veteran Supreme Court litigator and senior counsel at the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, predicted that both Roberts and Gorsuch will ultimately back the state bans on transgender people participating in sports that align with their gender identity given their votes in the Tennessee dispute.
    


            “If they were in agreement that Tennessee's law did not discriminate based on gender identity, I would assume that both of them would come to the same conclusion here when it comes to sports,” Bursch said. “But you never know for sure, and anytime that we go to the court, we assume that all nine justices are in play.”
    


            Alliance Defending Freedom is a co-counsel in both sports cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear.
    


            “Our hope is that we would get a unanimous ruling to protect women's sports in favor of both West Virginia and Idaho in their laws,” Bursch added.
    


            Other members of the court's six-justice conservative wing – including two who are often decisive votes – have more clearly signaled their thoughts on anti-trans laws.
    


            In the Tennessee case, Justice Amy Coney Barrett penned a concurring opinion making clear that she opposed granting transgender status the same anti-discrimination protections that race and sex have under the 14th Amendment. She also was the only member of the court's majority that day to raise sports in an opinion.
    


            “Beyond the treatment of gender dysphoria, transgender status implicates several other areas of legitimate regulatory policy – ranging from access to restrooms to eligibility for boys' and girls' sports teams,” Barrett wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. “If laws that classify based on transgender status necessarily trigger heightened scrutiny, then the courts will inevitably be in the business of ‘closely scrutiniz(ing) legislative choices' in all these domains.”
    


            Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence arguing against extending Bostock's reasoning to constitutional cases.
    


            During oral arguments over Tennessee's law in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh – another justice who is sometimes seen as a swing vote – mentioned sports as he peppered the lawyer for the Biden administration with skeptical questions about her position.
    


            “If you prevail here,” asked Kavanaugh, who has frequently noted that he coached his daughters' basketball teams, “what would that mean for women's and girls' sports in particular?”
    


            “Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women's and girls' sports, basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, et cetera, notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?” Kavanaugh pressed.
    


            In response, then-Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar attempted to distinguish the sports cases from Tennessee's law. She noted that some lower courts had already held that the sports bans triggered a higher level of judicial scrutiny.
    


            Kavanaugh also dissented from Gorsuch's decision in Bostock.
    


            The court's three liberals dissented in the Tennessee case, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the majority had pulled back from “meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most” and instead “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”
    


            In the West Virginia case, then Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, signed the “Save Women's Sports Act” in 2021, banning transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Becky Pepper-Jackson, a rising sixth grader at the time, who was “looking forward to trying out for the girls' cross-country team,” filed a lawsuit alleging that the ban violated federal law and the Constitution.
    


            The Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that West Virginia's ban violated Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. The court also revived her constitutional challenge of the law.
    


            Two years ago, the Supreme Court denied West Virginia's emergency docket request to let it fully enforce its ban. Alito and Thomas dissented from that decision, though the focus of their objection was that neither the Supreme Court nor the 4th Circuit had offered an explanation for their decisions.
    


            In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the state's sports ban in 2020. Lindsay Hecox, then a freshman at Boise State University, sued days later, saying that she intended to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams and alleging the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.
    


            A federal district court blocked the law's enforcement against Hecox months later and the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision last year. Idaho appealed to the Supreme Court in July.
    


            State officials in West Virginia and Idaho praised the court's decision to take up the cases.
    


            “Idaho was the first state to step out and ban boys and men from competing with girls and women in organized athletics,” Little said on Thursday, describing the law as a “common sense” policy intended to “protect the American way of life.”
    


            Lawyers for the transgender athletes described the laws as discriminatory and harmful.
    


            The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments in the cases later this year or in early 2026 and is expected to hand down a decision by the end of June.

            Spectators gathered on the cobblestone streets of Madrid's Chueca neighborhood this week to watch one of Spain's most curious races: the “Carrera de Tacones,” or heel race.
    


            Held annually as part of the city's Pride celebrations, the race sees competitors — mostly men in towering heels — pound Calle de Pelayo, as racers have done each year for decades.
    


            Whoops, cheers, and gasps were heard throughout the crowd as racers tried to outpace each other on Thursday — some stumbling ungracefully in unruly heels towards the finish line.
    


            Despite the frenzy, an event of this scale and importance to Spain's LGBTQ+ community takes careful planning. Especially when it's become increasingly popular.
    


            “There will be seven races in total, much more than in recent years,” explained David Bonillo, the event's manager since 2014, who started work early on the day of the event at LL Bar, the iconic drag establishment that founded the competition in the late 1990s.
    


            “Six qualification races at 6pm. Then, the winners will face-off in the grand finale.”
    


            The Carrera de Tacones has rules, and the organizers are strict. In the back room of a neighboring sportswear shop, where runners check-in before the race,﻿ one staff member was found taping participants' shoes tightly to their ankles with black duct tape to reduce the chances of sprains and breaks. Nearer to the store's entrance, another was charged with measuring the heels with well-worn tape.
    


            Runners face disqualification for any footwear under 10 cm high (about four inches).
    


            “I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to race,” the woman measuring told a visibly disappointed racer, Edson Escolar, who was cradling a pair of blue stilettoes. “(It's) two centimeters too short.”
    


            Escolar told CNN that he had travelled from Guatemala to join the race. “In Guatemala, we have Pride but it's nothing like this. People there still look at you funny if you wear feminine clothes. Here, I feel so free.”
    


            “Maybe they'll let me race if I ask again nicely,” he said hopefully with a smile.
    


            But Escolar was nowhere to be found at the starting line.
    


            “We have a couple of rules to keep the race fair,” said Bonillo. “It's important to maintain them so we can continue to organize this special tradition for years to come.”
    


            There are few in Spain who know more about the race's humble beginnings than the drag queen known as Chumina Power. The singer and comedian is one of the most well-known faces in Chueca. This year, she presented the race with a mix of singing, dancing and commentary from a small platform near the finish line.
    


            Power attended the event's first ever race and began working as a drag performer at LL Bar a few years later.
    


            “The high heel race has been going on for 30 years, but at first, it was a tiny event with just a few people,” she recalled. “Pride itself was also small. The first celebrations in this country took place across only two small streets here, and Calle de Pelayo was one of them.”
    


            “Most people didn't come to Pride to demonstrate because it was still frowned upon back then,” she said. “But the race grew with Madrid Pride, (which is) now one of the most important festivals in Spain.”
    


            Known as “Orgullo Gay de Madrid,” Madrid Pride began as a political demonstration in 1978. In 2019 it became Europe's largest Pride celebration, drawing around two million visitors annually.
    


            As Power returned to the stage, racers began their final stretches. Anticipation was growing in the crowd. People started to huddle closer to the edge of the makeshift running track.
    


            Each of the qualifying heats featured a mix of experience and youth. Some runners were anxious and quiet. Others joked together, drinks in hand.
    


            Brian Healy, originally from Ireland, has been living in Madrid for seven years. “I've competed every year since 2018 and I love it,” he said. “I bought these shoes online from China, and something felt different when I put them on,” he continued, easing himself down to the ground to stretch.
    


            “They were so cheap they didn't even have a left and right one! They were both the same, but I've kind of got used to it now,” he joked.
    


            For some like Pablo Lopez, who chose a long, loose pair of black leather boots, it was their first race. “I'm really scared,” Lopez said with a shy smile. “I practiced a little bit at home, walking and running slowly, but the ground is different here.”
    


            And before the final race, another problem emerged: shoe fatigue. At one point, a finalist lifted their leg to reveal their bloodied toes and the remains of a shredded shoe.
    


            For the rest of the finalists, there was a surprise in store.
    


            All six would have to make a stop to change into a long dress, don a wig, and carry a handbag filled with bricks to the finish line on Power's stage.
    


            The final race couldn't have been closer. The first and second place-winners were separated by less than a second.
    


            “This was so much fun, and I'm so pleased to have won it,” said Raul Prieto, who had travelled to Madrid for the race from his hometown of Bilbao. Clutching a large check for €350 (about $412), he added: “I want to run this race every year for the rest of time!”

Slovakia has blocked the EU's 18th round of sanctions targeting Russia for the second time due to concerns about the planned phase-out of Russian energy, Slovak media has reported, citing the Foreign Ministry.

According to TASR news agency, Bratislava vetoed the package on Friday during a vote by the EU's Committee of Permanent Representatives. The ministry said Slovakia will continue to oppose the package until it receives firm guarantees from Brussels that the phase-out will not harm its economy.

The dispute centers on the European Commission's RePowerEU plan, which aims to eliminate Russian energy imports by 2028. The plan is being discussed alongside the new sanctions package targeting Russia's energy and financial sectors. While Brussels reportedly plans to present the phase-out as trade legislation – requiring only a qualified majority – Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico insists it should be treated as sanctions, requiring unanimous approval.

The Foreign Ministry said the Slovak authorities, energy companies, and industry leaders consider the phase-out “a major challenge for the competitiveness of the economy, especially from the perspective of energy prices and energy security.” It added that while Bratislava is open to further talks, the current negotiations have not addressed its “fundamental concerns and reservations.” It stressed the need for a plan that “benefits citizens and businesses.”

A group of European Commission experts reportedly arrived in Slovakia this week for talks on energy.

Fico previously warned that the phase-out would jeopardize energy security and raise prices. He also cited the risk of arbitration with Russia's Gazprom if Slovakia breaks its long-term contract, which could cost up to €20 billion ($23 billion) in penalties.

Hungary also opposes the plan. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Budapest and Bratislava jointly blocked the package at last week's foreign ministers' meeting, warning that the energy cuts would “destroy Hungary's energy security” and cause sharp price hikes.

The European Commission unveiled its 18th sanctions package in early June, framing it as an attempt to pressure Russia to end the Ukraine conflict. The proposed measures include lowering the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $45 per barrel, banning the future use of the Nord Stream pipeline, restricting imports of refined products made from Russian crude, and sanctioning 77 vessels which the West claims are part of a so-called Russian ‘shadow fleet'. The bloc also extended existing sanctions for another six months earlier this week.

Moscow has condemned the sanctions, calling them illegal and counterproductive. Russian officials warned that the EU's rejection of Russian energy will force it to rely on costlier imports or rerouted Russian energy via intermediaries, driving up prices.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is “a professional” who has learned how to handle Western sanctions, but he understands that more could come if the Ukraine conflict is not settled, US President Donald Trump has said.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump confirmed that the two leaders discussed potential sanctions during Thursday's phone call. “I would say he [Putin] is not thrilled with it, but you know, he's been able to handle sanctions, but these are pretty biting sanctions.”

The Russian president, he added, is fully aware that the US could ramp up the pressure. “You know, he's a professional. It may be coming,” he added.

In a one-hour phone call, Putin and Trump discussed the Ukraine conflict, the volatile state of affairs in the Middle East, and Russia-US cooperation, according to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov.

Ushakov said Trump raised the issue of ending the hostilities as soon as possible, adding that while Moscow is open to finding a political solution, it will not back down from its goals, including addressing the root causes of the conflict. Later, Trump said he was “unhappy” with the lack of progress towards peace.

US lawmakers have introduced a bill that proposes a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue to purchase Russian oil and energy products. Introduced by US Senator Lindsey Graham and backed by at least 81 senators, it also proposes extending sanctions on Russia, including its sovereign debt. Last month, Graham claimed that Trump told him “it's time to move the bill” to a vote.

At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Graham's views are “well known to the whole world,” adding that “he belongs to a group of inveterate Russophobes,” and that he would have imposed new sanctions on Russia long ago if he were in charge.

“Would that have helped the [Ukraine] settlement? That is a question that those who initiate such events should ask themselves,” Peskov said.

The US imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 following the start of the Ukraine crisis. After the conflict escalated in 2022, they were drastically expanded to include financial and energy sanctions, as well as asset freezes. Russian officials have described the sanctions as “illegal,” while highlighting Russia's economic resilience, arguing that they have strengthened domestic production.

French President Emmanuel Macron has said his first phone conversation in nearly three years with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, focused mostly on nuclear non-proliferation, following a series of Israeli and US strikes against Iran.

Macron told journalists that the call centered on Iran's nuclear program and the need to preserve the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), according to a video broadcast by BFMTV on Friday.

“I called him first on the Iranian issue and the necessity of maintaining the non-proliferation treaty,” Macron explained. “It was very important to reach an agreement, because France also bears responsibility for ensuring stability.”

The French president described the conversation as “important for France,” noting that both nations, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, share obligations under the NPT.

Following a series of Israeli and US bombings of its nuclear and other strategic sites, Tehran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), accusing it of failing to condemn the attacks on facilities under its supervision. Iran also claimed that the UN agency colluded with its adversaries, alleging that it passed on the identities of nuclear scientists to Israel, several of whom were later assassinated.

According to the Kremlin's readout of the July 1 call, both Putin and Macron stressed the need to respect Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy while fulfilling its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. Moscow and Paris also agreed to continue diplomatic engagement to avoid further escalation in the Middle East.

Macron added that he could not report any progress on Ukraine in his discussion with Putin, echoing sentiments expressed by US President Donald Trump following his own call with the Russian leader on Thursday.

“We shared our disagreements,” Macron said, insisting that “there needs to be a ceasefire first, followed by the resumption of negotiations.” He added that Western sanctions, including those already imposed by the EU and new sanctions proposed by the US Congress, are essential to applying pressure.

The Kremlin confirmed that Putin reiterated Russia's view that the Ukraine conflict stems from years of Western disregard for its security concerns. The Russian president maintained that any settlement must be “comprehensive and long-term,” address the “root causes” of the crisis, and take into account what Moscow describes as the “new territorial realities.”

Russia and Ukraine resumed Türkiye-hosted talks earlier this year after nearly three years without direct diplomatic contact, following Kiev's withdrawal of its demand for an unconditional ceasefire as a precondition for negotiations.

Macron's outreach comes amid a shift in his stance on the conflict. While previously advocating the deployment of French and other NATO troops to Ukraine, the French president has more recently proposed that the EU begin considering a broader dialogue on regional security that includes Russia as part of a potential peace framework.

WASHINGTON, July 5. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump believes that the situation around Ukraine is very complicated.

""We talked about different things. We had a very good call, I think a very strategic one,"" the US leader told reporters, commenting on his July 4 telephone conversation with Vladimir Zelensky. ""It's a pretty tough situation,"" he told the White House press pool.

Trump also noted that he was ""very unhappy"" with his July 3 telephone conversation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ""He wants to go all the way,"" the US leader head of state said, expressing doubt about Moscow's willingness to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. ""[That's] not good,"" he emphasized.

On July 2, The New York Times reported, citing sources, that Washington would suspend the supply of several weapons to Kiev, including Patriot air defense missiles, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, and Stinger portable anti-aircraft missile systems. At the same time, Trump said on July 3 that Washington continues to provide military assistance to Kiev, but at the same time assumes that Washington itself needs weapons.

In a telephone conversation with Trump on July 3, Putin said that Moscow continues to await the dates for a new round of negotiations with the Kiev regime. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the issue of Washington's cessation of arms supplies to Kiev was not raised in the conversation between the leaders of Russia and the US.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LONDON, July 5. /TASS/. Israel has not disclosed information about Iran's successful strikes on five military targets, including a large airbase, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing an analysis of satellite data conducted by researchers at Oregon State University.

According to the newspaper, six Iranian missiles hit five targets in northern, southern, and central Israel, including an intelligence gathering center and a logistics base. The Daily Telegraph noted that Iran had struck more than 40 Israeli infrastructure targets as a result of the 12-day conflict.

The Israel Defense Forces did not comment on reports of hits on military bases. In turn, The Daily Telegraph said that Israeli and US air defense systems intercepted about 84% of the missiles.

In the early morning hours of June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran. Less than 24 hours later, Iran retaliated. Nine days later, on the morning of June 22, US jets attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, entering the conflict. The following evening, Tehran launched a missile strike on Al Udeid, the largest US military airbase in the region, located in Qatar. According to the US authorities, there were no casualties or significant damage.

On June 24, Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire. The Israeli authorities confirmed that they had accepted the US proposal and announced that they had completed all objectives in their operation against Iran. In turn, Tehran said that it had achieved a victory over Tel Aviv by forcing it to unilaterally halt its aggression. The ceasefire has been in effect since June 24.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The spiritual leader has said his inner circle of monks will find an heir, but China believes the choice is in its hands

Few celebrations have the hills of Dharamshala abuzz like the birthday of the Dalai Lama. But this year, as monks and devotees flooded into the mountainous Indian city before the Tibetan spiritual leader turns 90 on Sunday, the mood of anticipation has been palpable.

For years, the Dalai Lama had promised that around his 90th birthday he would make a long-awaited announcement about his reincarnation. Finally, in a video broadcast to Tibetan monks and leaders on Wednesday, he laid out what the future would hold. It came amid fears of a ruthless succession battle between the Tibetan community and the Chinese government, which for decades has sought to control the institution of the Dalai Lama, revered as the highest teacher in Tibetan Buddhism.

Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, confirmed he would remain in the role until he died. Then, as per centuries of tradition, he would be reincarnated, and only his inner circle – a trust of closely allied monks – would have the “sole authority” to locate his successor; an often lengthy process to track down a child in which his spirit has been reborn.

“No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,” the Dalai Lama told his monks.

The announcement ended years of speculation that, in an attempt to prevent Chinese interference, the Dalai Lama might put forward an alternative mode of reincarnation, such as transferring his spiritual essence to a successor who could be found while he was still alive. To the great worry of many in the Tibetan diaspora, he had even hinted that he may not reincarnate at all.

The Dalai Lama's latest statement was a clear defiance of the Communist party in China, which has long held the view that only it has the authority to decide the next Dalai Lama and has even enshrined the right into Chinese law.

However, Tansen Sen, a scholar of Indo-Chinese relations and Buddhism, noted that the Dalai Lama's message struck a more diplomatic tone than some of his previous statements. In earlier writings, he had said the 15th Dalai Lama would be born in the “free world” – taken to mean outside China – but this time he did not repeat that.

“I see this as a very strategically handled announcement which avoided ruffling China's feathers too much,” said Sen. “The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, he is also a shrewd thinker and I think he realises that there are larger issues at play, particularly that he is caught geopolitically between India and China.”

However, China's sensitivity over the issue was evident in the absence of the Dalai Lama's statement from all Chinese or Tibetan media. “China's propaganda managers seem very reticent for this news to reach Tibetans or even Chinese,” said Robert Barnett, a scholar of Tibetan history at Soas University of London. “Presumably that's because Chinese leaders fear a popular outpouring of support for the Dalai Lama, or they are struggling to agree on how to respond.”

China invaded and took control of the autonomous region of Tibet in 1950. After a failed uprising by Tibetans in 1959, China threatened to arrest the Dalai Lama – who acted as a religious and political leader – forcing him into exile in India.

After his perilous escape across the Himalayas, in April 1959 the Dalai Lama met the then-Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who declared – against much opposition within his own government – that the Tibetan spiritual leader “should be allowed to live in peace” in India.

Since then, the Dalai Lama, along with other Tibetan religious leaders, civilians and parliamentarians in exile, have established their political and religious headquarters in Dharamshala, high in the Himalayan mountains.

From his outpost, the Dalai Lama has been both a religious leader and a tireless and highly effective global advocate for the Tibetan cause and community over the past 66 years. He has vocally resisted calls by China for it to have any say over the institution of the Dalai Lama or to meddle in the succession process.

Within greater Tibet, home to 6 million people, Chinese authorities have imposed increasingly draconian measures and censorship to try to crush the influence of the Dalai Lama, including banning images of him.

Beijing has described the Dalai Lama as a “wolf in monk's clothing” and views him as a dissident and separatist, even as he advocated for greater Tibetan autonomy within China, rather than full independence.

Chinese efforts are widely seen to have failed, and as the Dalai Lama's international profile has grown – he has a Nobel peace prize and millions of devotees, including some of the world's biggest celebrities – he remains more revered than ever.

His presence as a constant thorn in the side of Chinese efforts to impose complete homogeneity over Tibet means officials have become increasingly determined to control what happens when he dies. In a statement after the Dalai Lama's announcement this week – which was only published in English – the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said his successor “must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn and approved by the central government”.

Analysts have widely agreed the most likely scenario after the death of the Dalai Lama is that two successors will be appointed; one located by Tibetan monks, as per tradition, probably outside China and recognised by the Tibetan community in exile, and another selected by the Chinese Communist party from within China.

Over the decades, the Dalai Lama's presence in Dharamshala and the free movement he is afforded by India has remained a source of tension in Indo-Chinese relations. Yet since 2020, when border tensions erupted into violent skirmishes, it appeared the Indian government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, began to see the Tibet issue as a direct form of leverage over China. China has emphasised that any country that interferes in the Dalai Lama reincarnation will be sanctioned – a message seen to be directed at India.

In a notable break from convention, this week India's minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, himself a Buddhist, said publicly that reincarnation of the Dalai Lama “is to be decided by the established convention and as per the wish of the Dalai Lama himself. Nobody else has the right to decide it except him.”

China's foreign ministry instantly called on India to “stop using Tibet issues to interfere in China's domestic affairs”.

Amitabh Mathur, a former adviser on Tibet to the Indian government, said it was highly likely that the Dalai Lama's office would have pre-informed New Delhi of the reincarnation announcement, and that Rijiju's statement would not have been made without consulting senior ministries. “It certainly goes above and beyond what has been said by India before,” said Mathur.

He suggested the geopolitical challenges over the Dalai Lama were likely to become more complicated after his death, particularly if the Tibetan officials located his reincarnation inside India, in defiance of China's own possible selection.

Tibetan officials have confirmed that unofficial back channels remained open with the Chinese and that the Dalai Lama was doing all he could to prevent the 600-year-old Tibetan Buddhist institution being hijacked by Chinese political interests. “He's viewing these things from a very practical lens,” said Mathur. “Don't forget, the Dalai Lama is as well versed in statecraft as he is in spiritual matters.”

Nonetheless, as he led prayers on the eve of his birthday, the Tibetan leader – who appeared in good health – emphasised that he did not foresee his death coming any time soon. “I hope,” he said, “to live another 30 or 40 years.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pressure grows on Pedro Sánchez to call snap election as latest resignation adds to corruption allegations

Pedro Sánchez's efforts to reset Spain's ruling socialist party after damaging corruption allegations that threatened to topple his coalition government have suffered a severe setback after a party official resigned over accusations of sexual harassment.

The prime minister had hoped this weekend's meeting of the federal committee of his Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) would help the party move past weeks of scandals that have undermined the ethical and anti-corruption pledges on which it came to power seven years ago.

But such hopes were flattened late on Friday night after the online newspaper elDiario published allegations from various female PSOE workers who said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by Francisco Salazar, who oversaw institutional coordination at the Moncloa palace, the office and official residence of the prime minister.

The accusations prompted Salazar to announce on Saturday that he was stepping down from that post and from his new role as a deputy in the PSOE's organisational secretariat.

He told elDiario he could not recall any inappropriate interactions. “I've racked my brains over it and it seems mind-boggling to me,” he said. “I keep wondering if I've screwed up and said something inappropriate to a workmate, and the truth is, I can't find [an example].”

Sources at Moncloa, in Madrid, said an investigation had been launched, but added that no official complaints had so far been made against Salazar.

On Saturday, Sánchez apologised again for what he called his misplaced confidence in those accused of wrongdoing, adding: “I was wrong to place my trust in people who didn't deserve it, but we won't fall short in a time of democratic regeneration.”

The prime minister, who is under growing pressure to call a snap election, said he had no intention of stepping down.

“The captain doesn't shirk his responsibility when the sea gets rough; he stays put to ride out the storm and guide the ship to port,” he said.

Salazar's resignation is the latest blow to the prime minister's authority and judgment.

On Monday, Santos Cerdán – who served as the PSOE's organisational secretary and was Sánchez' right-hand man – was remanded in custody after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts.

The investigation began after the Guardia Civil police anti-corruption unit handed material to the court that suggested Cerdán had discussed taking such kickbacks with the former PSOE transport minister José Luis Ábalos and one of the minister's aides, Koldo García. Ábalos and García are also under investigation and have denied wrongdoing. Cerdán, who stepped down from his party role and resigned his parliamentary seat shortly after the news broke, has vowed to clear his name.

Sánchez, who became prime minister in 2018 after using a motion of no confidence to turf the corruption-mired conservative People's party (PP) out of government, is already contending with graft investigations relating to his wife and his brother, who deny any wrongdoing. A former PSOE member was also recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil unit investigating the corruption allegations.

The PP said the latest allegations were further proof of the prime minister's poor judgment and his unfitness to lead the country.

“He has no credibility and his supposed fight against corruption and sexism is mere posturing,” PP sources said on Saturday. “Sánchez is as good at being prime minister as he is at talent-spotting. Either there aren't many decent people in his party or he's not very good at choosing people who deserve to be in Spanish politics.”

Calls for a fresh election are also beginning to bubble up within some sections of the socialist party. Emiliano García-Page, the PSOE president of the Castilla-La Mancha region, said the time had come to let parliament and the people have their say.

According to elDiario, García-Page used Saturday's party meeting to ask Sánchez to consider holding a confidence vote in parliament. “I don't know if we'll win it,” he said. “But if we don't, then don't rule out the option of calling an election.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Doctors say Israel is blocking deliveries of formula urgently needed as mothers are either dead or too malnourished to feed their babies

Doctors in Gaza have warned that hundreds of babies are at risk of death amid a critical shortage of baby milk, as Israel continues to restrict the humanitarian aid that can enter the beleaguered strip.

Dr Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said his ward had only about a week's worth of infant formula remaining. The doctor has already run out of specialised formula meant for premature babies and is forced to use regular formula, rationing it between the infants under his care.

“I can't begin to describe how bad things are. Right now, we have enough formula for about one week. But we also have infants outside the hospital without any access to milk. It's catastrophic,” al-Farra told the Guardian over the phone.

Stocks of infant formula have dwindled in Gaza as Israel has blocked all but a trickle of aid into the Palestinian territory. Food aid that comes through the controversial US-Israeli-backed private company Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) does not include infant formula, according to doctors.

Hanaa al-Taweel, a 27-year-old mother of five living at al-Nuseirat refugee camp, said she was unable to breastfeed as she herself was not getting enough to eat. She has struggled to find infant formula for her 13-month-old child.

“The problem of getting milk started since my son's birth, as due to my malnutrition and general weakness I wasn't able to breastfeed my baby,” al-Taweel said.

Doctors have told her that her son is suffering from stunting due to malnutrition and she has noticed he was developing slower than her other children, who had already begun speaking and walking at his age.

“I try to keep a small piece of bread next to me when he sleeps because he wakes up often asking for food. I feel sadness and fear for my children, I fear they will die from hunger, thirst and disease,” she said.

Already 66 Palestinian children have starved to death since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, according to local health authorities.

Amnesty International accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza, which it said was a tactic intended “to inflict genocide against Palestinians”.

Cogat, the Israeli authority responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, said it does not restrict the entry of baby food, including formula, into the Gaza Strip. The agency added that more than 1,400 tons of baby food had been delivered to Gaza in recent weeks.

Doctors entering Gaza have resorted to packing individual cans of infant formula in their personal luggage. On at least one occasion, Israeli authorities confiscated 10 cans of infant formula from the luggage of an American doctor recently entering Gaza for a medical mission.

“In the end they confiscated all the cans of baby formula, which was specifically formula for pre-term babies. What on earth is baby formula going to do against the security of the state of Israel?” said Dr Diana Nazzal, a Palestinian-German eye surgeon who helped the American doctor pack his bags in a way that would be acceptable to Israeli border authorities.

Nazzal added that many medical staff entering Gaza are filling their bags with calorie-dense foods such as protein bars and nuts, rather than medical supplies.

Infant formula has become more critical as the hunger crisis has worsened in Gaza, with almost 500,000 people facing catastrophic hunger while the rest of the population is experiencing acute food insecurity.

Mothers who are severely malnourished themselves or have been killed are unable to breastfeed, creating a higher need for formula. On the parallel market, what little supply exists has become exorbitantly expensive, with one can of formula going for about $50 – 10 times the normal price.

“I was able to breastfeed her naturally for one month, but due to lack of food I could no longer continue,” said Nourhan Barakat, a 25-year-old mother of three displaced to Khan Younis. “I know that breastfeeding strengthens the bond between mother and child – but what can I do?”

In late June, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said about 112 children were being admitted daily to Gaza's hospitals for malnutrition treatment. Malnutrition before the age of three can cause permanent developmental problems.

“This whole generation is being targeted. They will suffer from memory problems, developmental delays … And the problem is even if nutrition becomes available later on, the damage is permanent,” al-Faraa said.

Doctors said the deaths of infants was a worrying sign of Gaza's looming starvation crisis, as young children are the most vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition.

“When you see babies start to die, panic and alarms should start to flare. Essentially, children are the first to die in starvation crises,” said Dr Thaer Ahmad, a member of a medical delegation trying to deliver aid through the international group Avaaz.

Doctors have blamed the Israeli aid blockade for the shortage, as Israel prevents all but a few aid trucks entering the territory – far below what humanitarians say is required to feed the population. UN agencies say Gaza needs at least 500 trucks a day to meet basic needs, but often less than 50 are admitted.

What UN aid does come through is often confiscated by hungry crowds and armed gangs who have begun looting trucks out of desperation.

If Palestinians want to access aid given by GHF, they have to navigate a complicated, ever-changing set of instructions to queue at one of four distribution sites. More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces while queueing for aid over the last month.

Humanitarian groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates the core principles of humanitarianism. Previously, the UN-led aid system in Gaza maintained more than 400 aid distribution points throughout Gaza set up at points of need. The GHF said it had delivered more than 52m meals in five weeks and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.

Israel has said the UN system was being exploited by Hamas to hoard aid, an accusation for which humanitarians say there is no evidence.

The war in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people since 7 October 2023, and was launched in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack on the same day that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Israel and Hamas have signalled in recent days that they are nearing a US-brokered ceasefire, though key sticking points remain.

In the meantime, doctors in the territory say time is running out. “You should see the children arriving,” said al-Farra. “They're just skin and bones. It's horrifying. The real solution is to end the war, open the crossings and allow baby formula in.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot that went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night for a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup semi-finals.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute, but Estevao, an 18-year-old who is to transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd.

Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy. FIFA credited Weverton with an own goal.

Chelsea would not have to travel far for their next match, facing Fluminense on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Hercules came off the bench and scored in the 70th minute to lift Fluminense past Al-Hilal 2-1 in Friday's earlier quarter-final.

With Chelsea's win, three of the four semifinal teams would be from Europe, with one from Brazil.

The 23-year-old Palmer scored his first goal in the Club World Cup and showed why he is widely considered one of the top attacking midfielders. He took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and slipped the ball inside the far post.

Fans made it to Lincoln Financial Field on a holiday weekend that included a strike by nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia, competition from an earlier Philadelphia Phillies MLB game, and a concert and fireworks show near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. FIFA had slashed tickets to as low as US$11.15.

There was a pregame tribute for Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, who were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway.

Chelsea's Portuguese forward Pedro Neto paid a tribute to Jota when he walked out on the field with a shirt bearing their names before the match. 

“We spoke with Pedro yesterday and this morning and this afternoon, and it was completely Pedro's decision to play or not to play,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after the game. 

“He did, he made a fantastic effort to play this game ... with his teammates, and we really appreciate what he has done,” he said.

Eddie Jones' Japan extended Wales' record losing streak to 18 games after winning the first of their two Tests 24-19 yesterday, thanks to a furious second-half fightback.

First-half tries from Ben Thomas and Tom Rogers, and a penalty try, looked to have put Wales in control in hot and humid Kitakyushu until Japan scored twice in the second half to snatch the win.

Wales' last victory came against Georgia at the World Cup in October 2023 and their losing streak is a record for a Tier One country in the professional era.

Their previous match had ended in a humiliating 68-14 thrashing by England in Cardiff during the Six Nations.

With the temperature a steamy 31°C at kick-off, ball handling was difficult.

Wales were dealt an immediate blow when Ben Carter went down in the first minute following a heavy head-first collision.

The 24-year-old, who was returning to the team after missing the Six Nations through injury, lay prone on the ground for several minutes before being stretchered off and replaced by James Ratti.

Wales opened the scoring in the fourth minute, Thomas going over after Taulupe Faletau had punched a hole in the Japanese defense from a line-out.

Japan fought their way back into the game and levelled when Takuro Matsunaga finished off a flowing move with a try in the 16th minute.

Matsunaga went off injured soon after and was replaced by debutant Ichigo Nakakusu, one of six uncapped players on the Japanese bench.

Nakakusu was given a harsh introduction to international rugby when he gave away a penalty try just minutes after coming on, swatting the ball away from Josh Adams with the Wales winger in a try-scoring position.

Nakakusu was also sin-binned for his troubles, and Wales took advantage of their temporary numerical advantage when Rogers ran in their third try.

Japan were denied a try for a knock-on early in the second half, but Nakakusu crossed the line in the 59th minute to bring the home team right back into it.

Seungsin Lee kicked a penalty to close the gap to just two points before debutant substitute Halatoa Vailea put Japan in front for the first time.

15:06 JST, July 5, 2025

A strong earthquake measuring upper 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7 hit Akusekijima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture on Saturday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

The quake with an estimated magnitude of 5.4 occurred around the Tokara Islands, which includes Akusekijima, in the prefecture at 6:29 a.m. The focus was under the sea at a depth of about 19 kilometers, and no tsunami was observed, the agency said.

Between June 21 and Saturday at 7 a.m., a total of 1,303 earthquakes measuring 1 or stronger on the Japanese seismic intensity scale have been recorded in the area.

On Thursday, an earthquake measuring lower 6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale struck the island.

At a press conference on Saturday morning, an official of the agency urged people to be on alert for earthquakes of a similar scale as Saturday's.

The agency also dismissed rumors about a possible major earthquake in July, stating that it is difficult to predict the date, location and scale of earthquakes under current scientific knowledge. “We want the public to be prepared for earthquakes at all times as they can occur any time in Japan,” the official said.

Toshima Mayor Genichiro Kubo said Saturday he would conduct the second round of evacuation for island residents. They will leave the island on a village-operated ferry for Kagoshima City on Sunday morning. The number of residents wishing to evacuate the island is increasing, and at least 20 people were expected to evacuate Sunday.

On Friday, 13 people of eight households on the island aged 0 to 80 evacuated to the city.

SHANGHAI (AP) — Visitors were welcomed by a giant Lego man over 26 meters (85 feet) tall named Dada as they arrived at the new Legoland resort in Shanghai.

The Legoland resort, which opened Saturday, is the first in China. It is the largest Legoland in the world and was built with 85 million Lego bricks.

The resort was developed in conjunction with the Shanghai government by Merlin Entertainments and the LEGO Group.

Among the main attractions in the resort is Miniland, which replicates well-known sights from across the world using Lego bricks. It features sights from across China like Beijing's Temple of Heaven and Shanghai's the Bund waterfront. There's also a boat tour through a historical Chinese water town built with Lego bricks.

Visitors were greeted by performances featuring Legoland characters. Tickets range from $44 (319 yuan) to $84 (599 yuan).

Russian forces have occupied the villages of Zelenyi Kut and Novoukrainka in Donetsk Oblast, located near the administrative border with Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the battlefield monitoring platform DeepState reported on July 5.

Russian forces are attempting to push further west, according to DeepState.

Donetsk Oblast has been a central battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 in Ukraine. While Dnipropetrovsk Oblast lies further west and has not seen significant Russian incursions, it is frequently targeted with missile, drone, and aerial bomb strikes.

Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

""The situation around Dachne is pretty intense,"" DeepState wrote on Telegram, referring to the nearby front-line settlement in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 

Ukrainian forces have deployed reinforcements, but Russian units, relying on numerical advantage and constant infantry assaults, have breached some defenses in the area, DeepState said.

Ukraine's military has not officially confirmed the loss of the settlements. 

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Novoukrainka was captured as early as June 29, though that assertion was not independently confirmed at the time.

On July 2, Ukraine dismissed Russian claims of advancing into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, calling them disinformation. It said that a small Russian reconnaissance unit briefly entered the village of Dachne, took photos with a Russian flag, and was then ""eliminated.""

Ukrainian military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said in mid-June that Russia was escalating attacks in the Novopavlivka sector — in the western part of Donetsk Oblast — and trying to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 

DeepState analysts suggest Moscow views an incursion into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as symbolically significant and a propaganda opportunity, while for Ukraine, holding the administrative line is a strategic priority.

Russia is seeking to involve Laos in its war against Ukraine under the pretense of humanitarian cooperation, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed on July 5.

According to the agency, Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations.

Ukraine initially captured 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory during a cross-border offensive to Kursk Oblast but lost most of it during a Russian counteroffensive this year, which was supported by North Korean troops.

Laotian authorities have reportedly agreed to send up to 50 engineers to support Russian efforts. In addition, Laos is said to be offering free rehabilitation services to wounded Russian soldiers.

""Russia, under the guise of humanitarian rhetoric, is trying to legalize the presence of foreign military contingents on its territory, effectively using them to wage war against Ukraine,"" HUR said.

This comes amid broader efforts by the Kremlin to recruit foreign personnel. Russia has drawn heavily on fighters from Asia and Africa, as well as North Korea.

Ukraine has captured multiple foreigners fighting for Russian forces. an April investigation by Russian independent outlet Important Stories identified more than 1,500 foreign fighters from 48 countries who had joined Russia's war.

Laos, a landlocked Southeast Asian country bordering China, Vietnam, and Thailand, has not commented on HUR's claim. The country maintains close ties with both Moscow and its ally Beijing.

U.S. Air Force General Alexus G. Grynkewich assumed command as the 21st Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on July 4 during a ceremony at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine.

Rutte highlighted Cavoli's efforts to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic Sea in response to threats to critical undersea infrastructure and credited him with conceiving and establishing NATO's new command in Germany to enhance assistance to Ukraine. He also noted Cavoli's role in refocusing the Alliance on collective defense following the 2022 Madrid Summit, where NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Cavoli played a central role in developing and securing approval for NATO's regional defense plans at the 2023 Vilnius Summit—a significant overhaul of the Alliance's military posture since the Cold War. 

His tenure also included the integration of Finland and Sweden into NATO's military structures, expanding the Alliance's strategic reach. In 2024, Cavoli oversaw ""Steadfast Defender,"" NATO's largest military exercise since the Cold War, involving approximately 90,000 troops practicing large-scale reinforcement across the eastern flank and validating a new high-readiness force model.

Rutte specifically acknowledged Cavoli's leadership in rapidly reinforcing NATO's Baltic Sea presence during threats to underwater infrastructure and for establishing the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which continues to support Ukraine.

The secretary general welcomed General Grynkewich, noting that, as a former fighter pilot, he brings ""a deep understanding of the threats we face from the skies, and across other domains."" Rutte added that Grynkewich's recent role as Director of Operations of the Joint Staff provides him with broad experience in advancing military and security priorities amid global challenges. 

Allied Command Operations—responsible for planning and executing all NATO operations—now falls under General Grynkewich's command, a position first held by General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Find solitude and tranquility on the windswept Îles-de-la-Madeleine","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/article-iles-de-la-madeleine-quebec-east-coast-vacation/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

On Canada's East Coast, lobster poutine, sangria and the gift of solitude are found on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine

In the summer of 1915, while the rest of the world was consumed by war, the people of Old-Harry on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine were busy making plans for a new church. But they needed wood, no small challenge in a largely treeless place where building supplies are limited. 

Within a few months, their prayers were answered. A Norwegian freighter carrying a load of timber ran aground on nearby Brion Island during a storm. As if by divine intervention, construction on St. Peter's-by-the-Sea Church began soon after. 

The universe has long smiled on the people of these islands, called Madelinots, who have survived for centuries against all odds on this windswept, crescent-shaped archipelago of sand dunes, beaches and rugged cliffs. More than 500 ships have been wrecked on the dangerous shoals that surround the islands, providing important supplies to build homes, schooners and, yes, even churches.

An old fishing boat rests near St. Peter's-­by-the-­Sea Church on GrosseÎle.

I travelled to the islands with an old friend, for the first time, in June. We'd both grown up in the Maritimes and yet as anglophones, the Maggies – just a five-hour ferry ride north of Prince Edward Island – might as well have been a far-off foreign country. While it's long been a part of Quebec and a summer playground for francophones for decades, most of my English-speaking friends who I told about the trip had to Google where it was. 

The Gulf of St. Lawrence, with its storms, blinding fog and endless wind, is also the thing that makes the place, called the Magdalen Islands in English, so special. Separated from North America by this massive body of water, the sea feels like a buffer from the rest of the world. You feel it as soon as the 750-person car ferry pulls away from the harbour in Souris, PEI. 

It's wash day for this resident of La Grave on Havre-­Aubert.

Once aboard the CTMA Traversier, no one is talking about Donald Trump, tariffs or war in the Middle East. The concerns are more localized: getting the sangria to their seats on the sundeck before the fiddle band begins to play. Suddenly, in this environment, lobster poutine with Hollandaise sauce seems like a perfectly reasonable breakfast choice. 

“When you get on that boat, you leave your troubles back on the wharf,” said Frédéric Myrand, an islander who left for school but returned as an adult. 

Most Madelinots are French-speaking descendants of Acadians kicked out of the Maritimes by the British during the Expulsion in the mid-1700s, people who long ago learned how to adapt to the sea. Many from the small anglophone minority are the descendants of survivors of shipwrecks. They've lived through hurricanes, fishery collapses and isolation, things that have given islanders a determined sense of self-reliance. 

“It's all part of the deal with living here,” Michel Boudreau, manager of the Musée de la Mer, a local history museum in the quaint village of La Grave, told me. 

The payoff is a place that's often tranquil and unspoiled, unique and foreign enough without needing a passport. Outside of the busy months of July and August, it's easy to find a beach all to yourself, an empty table at great restaurants or breathtaking hiking and bicycle trails you don't need to share with anyone else. No wonder the poet Georges Langford called Bird Rock, the landmark island once famous as a graveyard for ships, the “exact address of solitude.”

Home to more than 12,000 people, tourism has become a major industry. Prior to the arrival of modern ferry boats in the 1970s, with their drive-on, drive-off service, you had to pay to have your vehicle hoisted onto a cargo ship and steamed to the islands. More than 63,500 visitors came to the islands in 2023, mostly by ferry. Because of self-imposed American travel boycotts this year, they're expecting a jump in Canadian visitors. 

We got by with our limited French, but unilingual English-speakers shouldn't be concerned about language here. Most Madelinots are by nature friendly and welcoming, and many will switch to broken English if you ask. When we sat down on the grass outside Café des Lupins, surrounded by dozens of tattooed twentysomething hipsters sipping lattes and natural wines, no one blinked at the sight of a pair of middle-aged anglos crashing the party. 

The café served up delicious sandwiches, along with cans of a local blonde ale made with sea water, brewed nearby at a converted crab processing factory. It was a perfect moment, like we'd somehow walked onto the set of a tourism commercial.

Everywhere, there were pleasant surprises when it was time to eat. Seal poutine at Café de la Grave in Havre-Aubert. Excellent lobster and salmon sushi from a food trailer by the beach. Roasted halibut at Resto Bistro Accents. A steaming bowl of chowder served in a former convent, packed with more scallops than a wharf in Digby, N.S. 

Seafood has long been an important part of the Madelinot diet, even as the ocean changes around them. There used to be so much herring around the islands that the big bay turned white when the fish returned for their spring spawn. Today, there's only one smokehouse, Le Fumoir d'Antan, still preparing fish in the old artisanal style, a three-month process done inside wooden barns built in the 1940s. They have to ship their herring in from Newfoundland now, after decades of overfishing and climate change have upended this once-bustling fishery.

“It's always evolving, but it's important to us to keep this alive,” said Éloi Arseneau, the fourth generation in his family to run the smokehouse, which gives daily tours and also sells a wide range of smoked seafood. 

Eloi Arseneau sets fires to smoke herring inside the smokehouse, Fumoir d'Antan.

Almost every Madelinot has stories about how quickly the changing climate is altering their islands, where storms can reshape sandstone cliffs and make dunes disappear. When Hurricane Fiona tore through here in 2022, it washed away bike paths and beaches, clawed at the highway and flooded Cindy Poirier's paddling shop and café, called Cindyhook Sports Adventures. 

“It can be stressful sometimes, but we have no choice. We have to adapt,” Poirier told me. “It's what we've always done.” 

Most Madelinots are French-speaking descendants of Acadians kicked out of the Maritimes by the British during the Expulsion in the mid-1700s.

Visitors can fly to the islands from Montreal and Quebec City, but there's something about the five-hour ferry voyage from Prince Edward Island that is part of the Maggies' appeal. Entry Island, an English-speaking community accessible by pedestrian ferry, emerges from the sea like a beacon as you approach the archipelago. Crossings cost $110 per car and $59 per adult each way in the high season. Reservations are recommended. Travellers should show up 75 minutes before departure.

We stayed at the Château Madelinot, a newly renovated hotel that's a short drive from the ferry terminal in Cap-aux-Meules. It has clean rooms, ocean views and a good top-floor restaurant that overlooks the sea. Rooms start at $197 a night, more in July and August.

Stop at Café de la Grave, housed inside a restored general store in Havre-Aubert, which has been serving up local seafood since 1980. The seal meat is slow-cooked, giving it a consistency like pulled pork, but with a mild gamey taste not unlike deer. At night, musicians sidle up to the piano and guests pack into the space for spontaneous jam sessions. It's a quintessential Îles-de-la-Madeleine experience.

Prime Minister Mark Carney sits with U.S. President Donald Trump during the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alta., in June. Canadian exports rose in May after taking a serious hit in April amid tariff threats.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Halfway through Canada's year from hell, the country has yet to fall into the sea.

While not exactly booming, the economy has defied the portents of doom, so far. It's at least afloat. That alone is heartening, given how grim Canada's prospects seemed at the outset.

The year started terribly and got worse from there, as Donald Trump returned to office with a serious grudge and the means to use economic force to attack Canada. “What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy,” former prime minister Justin Trudeau said in March.

So, the elbows went up, middle fingers extended southward and we vowed to reorient the country, all while wondering if economic ruin was inescapable.

Canadian stock sales and takeovers soar despite tariff threats

It still could be. The brunt of tariffs has yet to reveal itself. We're told that's likely coming in the back half of the year. And no one is ever safe from Mr. Trump's whims.

But who would have thought back then that the Canadian stock market would be rocking record highs come Canada Day? Or that growth would be holding up, the job market stable and consumers continuing to spend?

“While Canada's economic path forward remains challenging, it appears considerably less treacherous than it did just a few months ago – a narrative that has yet to permeate the Canadian psyche,” Frances Donald, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a recent report.

There's plenty more to like – or at least not hate – when you survey the data. 

Canada's capital markets are buzzing with activity, as investors evidently have enough confidence to commit serious money to corporate expansion plans.

Even our exports rose in May after taking a serious hit in April, when tariff salvos were flying in all directions. Trade with non-U.S. countries is picking up and Canadian exports are already less concentrated in the U.S. market than they were just last year.

Plus, inflation is largely behaving itself, giving policy makers the latitude to stimulate the economy as needed.

Could our economy be more resilient to tariffs than everyone thought? Not exactly.

A blanket tariff of 25 per cent on Canadian goods shipped to the United States, as Mr. Trump promised to impose on Day 1 of his second term as President, would have been a hammer blow.

Fortunately, Canadian exporters aren't facing anything close to that – less than one-tenth, in fact. In April, the average effective U.S. tariff rate on Canadian goods was 2.3 per cent, according to the Royal Bank report.

That's a big jump from where it was last year — effectively zero. But it's also the lowest tariff rate facing any of the U.S.'s major trading partners. 

Since March, exports compliant with Canada-United-States-Mexico Agreement have been exempted from tariffs. The same trade deal Mr. Trump signed in 2020 appears to serve as an “effective shield” against tariffs today, Ms. Donald wrote.

The big exceptions are tariffs on steel and aluminum shipments, which Mr. Trump has levied under the dubious guise of “national security.” The auto sector has been hit to a lesser extent, with tariffs on non-U.S. components of finished vehicles.

But Canadian oil and gas, wood products and precious metals are among the goods crossing the border freely.

How entrepreneurs are using scenario planning to tame volatility

More Canadian stuff is headed in other directions, too, perhaps an early sign of progress in reducing the country's reliance on the U.S. market. U.S.-bound exports accounted for 68 per cent of the total in May, down from 76 per cent last year.

It's worth pointing out that gold is doing much of the heavy lifting here. Economists warn that the meteoric rise in gold prices this year is making Canada's trade numbers look better than they are.

But at least we're not seeing the “total collapse” we came to dread a few months ago. “For Canada, the scale of the trade shock thus far appears smaller than expected,” John McNally, senior policy adviser at Scotiabank Economics, wrote in a report.

That's a common thread in the indicators of late:

Canada still faces deep structural problems and a breakdown in the economic status quo. But at the midway point of a deeply destabilizing year, we're still kicking.

Large parts of the Czech Republic were left without electricity on Friday following a major blackout, the country's grid operator reported.

""At the moment we can confirm that there is a power outage in our electricity grid,"" Hana Klimova, a spokeswoman for the grid operator CEPS, told AFP.

""The outage has affected a greater part of the Czech Republic,"" she added.

Prime Minister Petr Fiala described it as an ""extraordinary and unpleasant"" situation in a post on X.

Czech Transport Minister Martin Kupka said train lines in five out of the country's 14 districts had been halted, including in the capital, Prague.

Shortly after the first reports of the blackout, CEPS said that the cause was a fallen power line.

It added that the electricity supply had been returned to the majority of the impacted areas.

Prague's subway network was temporarily knocked offline, but lines A and C were restored within just 15 minutes, and line B was restored within half an hour.

Czech police said on X they had ""no information suggesting this is a cyber/terror attack.""

E.ON, the company that runs the grid in the southern part of the country, said its supply had not been affected. Neighboring Poland also said it had not registered any problems.

The Czech blackout comes several months after an even bigger blackout sent Spain and Portugal into darkness for several hours.

That incident was the result of a ""voltage surge,"" but there had been fears at the time that the Iberian peninsula had fallen victim to a cyber attack.

Friday's blackout also comes after a recent heat wave hit Europe. Electricity becomes particularly important to run fans or other cooling systems.

However, Prague on Friday recorded temperatures of only around 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), down from the 34 degrees recorded on Thursday.

The Ukrainian military said it hit the Borisoglebsk airfield, home to several Russian military aircraft. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin. DW has more.

The Ukrainian military has said it struck a Russian military air base, claiming it hit a glide bomb store.

The attack comes after Ukraine said it recorded the largest number of drones launched by Russia on Friday.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Ukraine would need more Patriot missiles after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

Here are the latest developments from Russia's war in Ukraine on Saturday, July 5:

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Russia's massive wave of drone strikes against Ukraine on Friday.

Guterres ""condemns the latest series of large-scale drone and missile attacks by the Russian Federation, reportedly the largest in over three years of war,"" a UN statement said.

""These strikes disrupted the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, once again underlining the ongoing risks to nuclear safety,"" he added, referring to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which lies on the Dnieper river in southern Ukraine.

One person was killed and dozens injured on Friday.

""The Secretary-General is alarmed by this dangerous escalation and the growing number of civilian casualties. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international law and must stop immediately,"" the statement said.

Guterres called for a ""full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire.""

The UK Defense Ministry's daily intelligence update said Russia had confirmed the death of Mikhail Gudkov, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy.

Gudkov was killed in a Ukrainian strike on March 28.

The update said Gudkov was the second senior Russian general to be killed this year, and the 16th since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.

""The loss of so many high-ranking officers is likely to have had the effect of undermining command and control in parts of the Russian Armed Forces,"" the UK Defense Ministry said. ""This has likely contributed to Russian tactical and operational difficulties during the conflict.""

The Russian strikes on Friday came after a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin after which the US President said he was ""very unhappy.""

Trump later held a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday evening, which appeared to have a more positive result.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the call with Zelenskyy had been good.

""We spoke about opportunities in air defense and agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies,"" Zelenskyy said on social media after the call.

Regarding his call with Putin, Trump hinted at the possibility of further US sanctions against Russia.

""We talk about sanctions a lot,"" Trump said. ""He understands that it may be coming.""

Trump said he would quickly end the war after coming into office, initially showing a closeness to Putin that marked a dramatic change from the previous White House administration.

However, Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin. Whether this will translate to more support for Ukraine remains to be seen.

The Ukrainian military said on Saturday that it had hit the Borisoglebsk airfield in the Voronezh region.

According to Kyiv, the base contained Russian Sukhoi Su-34, Su-35S and Su-30SM military jets. They said they hit a glide bomb depot and training aircraft, as well as other machines.

This could not be independently verified.

""The defense forces continue to take all measures to undermine the ability of the Russian occupiers to attack civilian infrastructure and to force the Russian Federation to cease its armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the armed forces said in a post on Telegram.

Voronezh Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported that there was damage but did not say what had been hit. The Defense Ministry said 94 Ukrainian drones were shot down, 34 of which were over the Voronezh region.

Ukraine also reported further Russian drone strikes on Saturday morning. Military Governor Oleh Synegubov posted on Telegram that at least three people, including a 12-year-old boy, had been injured in the city of Chuhuiv.

Ukraine on Saturday morning was still reeling from Russia's massive wave of strikes early on Friday, with the Ukrainian air force saying 550 drones had been fired on Ukraine, calling it the largest wave of strikes since the war began.

One person was killed and dozens more were injured in the attack.

Russia then launched another wave of attacks on Friday night.

The strikes came after a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his counterpart Donald Trump who expressed dissatisfaction over the lack of progress.

The Sean “Diddy” Combs verdict does not mean MeToo is dying as most sexual assault cases are settled privately, America's most prominent female lawyer has said.

The music mogul was this week acquitted on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering after two of his ex-girlfriends, including the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified he coerced them into having sex with male escorts.

Combs, 55, was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation for prostitution.

But Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Combs's alleged victims, including two who have filed civil lawsuits, said the outcome is symptomatic of a waning MeToo movement.

“Nobody should judge the MeToo movement based on what happens in a criminal case,” Ms Allred, who also represented a number of Harvey Weinstein's accusers said.

“Criminal cases are rare, and most of the civil lawsuits that we do and the confidential settlements never result in a criminal case.”

Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, she added: “There are many, many more civil lawsuits than there are criminal cases. In addition to that, we do many more confidential settlements without a lawsuit than even civil lawsuits, so it's [MeToo] alive and well.”

Around 70 lawsuits have been filed against Combs, including two by Ms Allred's clients: Joi Dickerson-Neal, who alleges the star drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1991, and Thalia Graves, who claims she was drugged and raped by Combs 10 years later.

Combs has denied all the allegations against him.

During her famed career spanning more than 50 years Ms Allred has represented alleged victims of the rich and powerful, including Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, R Kelly and Mohamed Al-Fayed.

Her clients include an unknown number of Weinstein's accusers, including Miriam Haley, who the disgraced film mogul was found guilty of sexually assaulting in his New York criminal retrial last month.

When Mr Trump won the election in November, some feared electing a man who had been found liable for sexual abuse marked the end of the MeToo movement, which sprung up after more than 80 women came forward claiming they had been raped or sexual assaulted by Weinstein.

Following the latest Weinstein verdict, which acquitted the disgraced producer of one count of sexual assault and resulted in a mistrial for his rape charge, Ms Allred, said: “For those of you in the press who have predicted that the MeToo movement might be dead, that obituary was obviously premature.”

Ms Allred insists victims are still contacting her firm Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, which she describes as the most prominent women's rights law firm in the country, every day.

“We won over a billion dollars in the years that we've been in practice for victims, so I am not concerned that this is going to deter victims,” she said.

“Maybe they won't want to perhaps report to law enforcement, but they still want accountability, they still want justice, they can all get that through a civil case, lawsuit or a confidential settlement,” she added.

Several of the witnesses who testified against Combs had pending civil lawsuits against the mogul, including Dawn Richard, who is represented by Ms Allred's daughter Lisa Bloom.

Ventura, 38, settled her civil suit against Combs within 24 hours of filing. She was paid $30 million by the Bad Boy Entertainment founder.

Last year, lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing dozens of Combs's alleged victims, claimed several high-profile celebrities had settled with victims quietly before to avoid being named in a public lawsuit.

This week a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, accusing Mr Buzbee of trying to blackmail him with false claims of sexual misconduct.

Carter sued after Mr Buzbee contacted the star about a complaint from an anonymous accuser who alleged that Carter and Combs sexually abused her.Mr Buzbee then filed a lawsuit accusing Carter and Combs of raping the alleged victim when she was 13. The lawsuit was later withdrawn by the accuser.

There is still a separate lawsuit pending which Carter filed against Mr Buzbee in federal court in Alabama.

Following the Combs trial, which included showing the Manhattan court CCTV footage of the star beating Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, Ms Allred said she plans to propose legislation stating that women cannot legally consent to sex if they are beaten before or after the act.

“We all saw the video, he beat her, he dragged her back, and if that's not force, if that's not coercion, I don't know what is,” she said.

Discussing her recommended legislation, she said: “In the same way that if... a woman is under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, she could not, from a legal point of view, does not have the capacity to consent to a sex act.”She added: “I'm proposing that if a woman is beaten, a victim of domestic violence before or after the sexual assault, it should be considered that she couldn't consent to it.

“And so that's what I'm going to propose to legislators to change the law, so hopefully something good can come out of this.”","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits.

At last week's NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.

At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and, at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members, with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.

Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn the most in efforts to gain Trump's favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks, people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that, in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part of the EU and can't be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated agreement.)

NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,” and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like a courtier at the Sun King's court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy. Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn't previously been seen in U.S. relations with its allies. This wasn't a conference of equals; rather it was a spectacle in which the U.S.'s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required of conquered vassals.

Trump demanded that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security

Trump's agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.

The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds, and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K. shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise still further. That's money going straight to Lockheed Martin.

This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could keep their heating on during the cold winter months.

Much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems.

Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders' willingness to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right — to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund” that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the decades-old European social compact.

While Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

Caught between Putin's expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin — and Trump's transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe's leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he would encourage Putin's forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they aren't meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO's member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously destructive toward Europe and Canada's social compacts.

Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense contractors; but given the U.S.'s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry, it's a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot of it will.

All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers, of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won't happen without resistance: Stamer's announcement immediately triggered opposition from anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases slated to host the planes and weapons.

It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won't uncritically rally around Trump's demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament. Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases — and while Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

The best route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups.

The best route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups.

In the last few months, we witnessed two violent attacks on pro-Israel events organized by American Jewish groups, by perpetrators who shouted “Free Palestine!” as they acted. The attacks — which killed two young Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., and severely burned participants in a “Run for Their Lives” event in Boulder, Colorado, in support of Israeli hostages — have been roundly condemned as antisemitic by politicians and Jewish groups, even though both attackers were vocal about targeting Zionists and seemingly motivated by anger at Israel's actions in Gaza, rather than hatred toward Jews.

The attacks have led to calls for increased surveillance and security around Jewish institutions, as well as accusations that the Palestine liberation movement “radicalized” the assailants.

The response to these terrifying events is predictable and follows a long-established pattern: intense fear and anguish, cynical complaints that rising antisemitism is being ignored and Jews left unprotected, and fevered demands for action. Yet, despite an understandable craving for security, does resorting to increased surveillance, policing, and more severe crackdowns on protests actually make Jews safer? Or is it exacerbating the problem?

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

To address a problem, one must first have a clear idea of its causes. For many in the mainstream Jewish community, as well as in the Trump administration, the answer is simple: pro-Palestinian activism. After the murders of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky in D.C., the Zionist organization JewBelong put up billboards stating, “Make no mistake: if you screamed ‘Free Palestine' you helped pull the trigger” and “When will you learn? ‘Free Palestine' is a death chant.” Counterterrorism expert Seamus Hughes blamed “violent imagery” (presumably of Gazans being slaughtered) as “triggering” even though the images “may actually not be true or correct.” The Republican-led congressional resolution condemning the Boulder attack labeled “Free Palestine” an “antisemitic slogan that calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the Jewish people.”

Zionists have long asserted that “antisemitism on the left” is under-reported and not taken seriously, along with claiming that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism” (another pithy JewBelong billboard). Yet over the past decade, this has morphed into the notion that progressivism itself, not just pro-Palestine activism, is inherently dangerous to Jews.

We hear this in Anti-Defamation League (ADL) CEO Jonathan Greenblatt's June 6th speech to an assembly of Republican Attorneys General, quoted in the Jewish Forward, in which he claimed that “the radical left” harbored the “real death threat” to Jews. “You have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what's happening on the left. There is a throughline from Occupy Wall Street to BLM [Black Lives Matter] to ‘defund the police' to ‘River to the Sea.' They are the same people; these are the same kind of nihilists.” Hughes is less doctrinaire, but insists that “the rise in antisemitic attacks in recent years comes from all forms of ideologies and extremism — far right, far left, single issue.”

It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger.

What should we on the left make of Hughes and Greenblatt's assertions? Obviously, progressives sometimes make antisemitic comments, just as they may sometimes make sexist or racist or homophobic ones. But antisemitism is not a core part of left-wing ideology, as it is on the right. Antisemitism — along with anti-Blackness and Islamophobia — is definitively baked into right-wing ideology. That is the crucial difference.

Antisemitism, like anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, has deep roots in white Christian nationalism, an ideology that, by definition, considers nonwhite, non-Christians to be outsiders. Every major study of contemporary antisemitism, particularly antisemitic violence, ascribes it primarily to right-wing white nationalists. All sources on antisemitism, including the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center, acknowledge that antisemitism is far more prevalent on the right than on the left. A 2022 survey, Antisemitic Attitudes Across the Ideological Spectrum, commissioned by Tufts University, concluded:

For overt measures, we find antisemitic attitudes are rare on the ideological left but common on the ideological right, particularly among young adults on the right. Even when primed with information that most U.S. Jews have favorable views toward Israel – a country disfavored by the ideological left – respondents on the left rarely support statements such as that Jews have too much power or should be boycotted.

But that study was done before October 7, 2023, and of course, both of these recent attacks were perpetrated by supporters of the Palestinian cause (although not Palestinians). Clearly there is a connection between the attacks and support for Palestine. There is deep frustration at the lack of attention to Palestinian suffering and continued U.S. backing for Israel's genocide in Gaza and apartheid policies. Many U.S. Jews are rightly concerned that they are being blamed for Israel's genocide of Palestinians. But who is trying to distinguish between Jews and Zionists: the left, which includes anti-Zionist Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace; or the right, and mainstream Jewish institutions which insist that there is no daylight between Judaism and Zionism, and call anti-Zionist Jews “fake” or “self-hating” Jews? It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger.

These right-wing voices are often loudest in condemnation of “progressive antisemitism,” largely because it deflects criticism of white nationalist antisemitism, the most prevalent, most dangerous source of antisemitism and racism. We hear it in Republican Nancy Mace's patronizing dismissal of CodePink's Medea Benjamin: “I love Jews! I love Israel! Even self-hating Jews like you.”

Yes, white nationalism is fully ingrained in American government and systems. White nationalists have been a major factor in the January 6 insurrection and in Trump's cabinet. The White House Faith Office and “anti-Christian bias” task force are part of the implementation of Project 2025's radical blueprint for installing Christian Nationalist governance throughout the federal bureaucracy. Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and House Speaker Mike Johnson all maintain connections to the movement, forming what the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism has called a triangle of influence. While these men are all ardent Zionists, they are also connected to deeply antisemitic institutions; their reasons for supporting Israel have less to do with Jewish welfare than millenarian prophecies that see the ingathering of the Jews in Israel as a necessary step towards the apocalypse. Focusing on right-wing, white Christian nationalist claims of supposed “leftwing antisemitism” and allowing Trump, Mace, Johnson, and others to proclaim their “love for Jews and love for Israel” unchallenged gives them cover for antisemitism and racism, ultimately facilitating more attacks on people of color and the left.

What is most sinister is how these two tragic attacks have been exploited by the right to criminalize and subdue not only Palestinians, but immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. One of Trump's first actions in response to the Boulder attack was to issue a travel ban against citizens of 12 countries and restrictions on seven more, declaiming, “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.” The congressional resolution tying Boulder to the Free Palestine movement also claims the attack “demonstrates the dangers of not removing from the country aliens who fail to comply with the terms of their visas” and expresses gratitude to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “for protecting the homeland.”

The tragedy here is that by clinging to the chimera of “leftwing antisemitism” and making common cause with the right, the mainstream Jewish community is allowing itself to be isolated from other marginalized populations. When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor. When he claims that recent attacks against Jews are “the worst expression of hate against any group in the country for the last 100 years” he dismisses and minimizes the lynchings, dispossessions, and deportations of African Americans, Native Americans, Latino Americans, and Japanese Americans. Only Jewish oppression counts, only Jewish oppression is real.

When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor.

This blinkered view not only traps the Jewish community in a funhouse of paranoia and isolation, it also threatens other marginalized communities and deprives us all of desperately needed solidarity. The typical, ADL-advised response to incidents of antisemitism builds physical and emotional walls and fortresses within and around our communities, creating a perceived sense of protection and certainty. (“Does your church need armed guards? ‘Cause our synagogue does” JewBelong dutifully reminds us.) Safety plans devised by groups like ADL and the Jewish Federations rely heavily on working with police. In its guide to protecting religious and communal institutions, the ADL suggests that congregations volunteer their sites to serve as locations for local SWAT teams to train, with no consideration for how this may affect Black, Latino, Muslim, or LGBTQ members or neighbors.

Many of these “safety measures” are blatantly racist. Take the police “antisemitism” training for New York City officers provided by Combat Antisemitism and the Program on Extremism, which listed the keffiyeh and the watermelon as examples of images that “incite hatred, violence, or discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities.” Hughes's description of the Boulder and D.C. attackers as “self-radicalized” is disturbingly similar to the discredited Countering Violent Extremism programs, which focused on infiltrating mosques and Muslim community centers to identify “self-radicalized” Islamist terrorists, creating a broad net of surveillance and repression and fear in Muslim communities.

A better route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups: people of color, Muslims, immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and those with disabilities. There are historical precedents: in the 1970s, Jews for Urban Justice released a manifesto titled “The Oppression and Liberation of the Jewish People in America,” outlining their ideology as an anti-racist, anti-war, Jewish socialist organization. The manifesto called for white Jewish solidarity with African American, Native American, Chicano, Italian American, and Appalachian communities, and was also critical of Israeli policy towards Palestinians.

In the late 1980s and 90s, Portland, Oregon, responded to a wave of skinhead neo-Nazi racist and homophobic violence with an “unlikely collaboration between groups of activists, immigrants, militant youth and queer organizers.” The Coalition for Humanity that formed was made up of Black, Indigenous, and people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and Jews, using street defense and community activism rather than policing to make Portland safer for everyone. This sounds very similar to the Jews For Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) community safety pledge, which suggests:

Start or deepen conversations with your community about what safety can look like beyond the narrow confines of police and militarization.

Reach out to neighboring communities and organizations — particularly Muslim communities, Black communities, including churches, immigrant communities and other communities of color who have had to navigate their own safety outside of a police framework.

The Community Safety Campaign (CSC), a national project led by a multiracial, cross-class, multidenominational, and gender-diverse team of Jewish organizers, political educators, researchers, healers, and spiritual leaders, recently produced a 100 page guide for Jewish communities and partners seeking to transform their safety practices. CSC helps congregations build community safety plans and teams based on political education about antisemitism, antiracism, white & Christian nationalism, and transformative justice.

These efforts have one thing in common: They do not look at antisemitism in isolation, but recognize its connections to all forms of racism and oppression. This is the approach taken by PARCEO's (Participatory Action Research Center for Education Organizing) “Antisemitism from a Framework of Collective Liberation” curriculum, which points to the historical commonalities and parallels between the oppression of Jews and that of other marginalized populations. The PARCEO framework is central to Jewish Voice for Peace's Principles for Dismantling Antisemitism.

During the first Trump administration, many Americans were horrified by the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally, which called for the unification of the white nationalist movement, and exemplified the nature of white nationalist violence in action. Its leaders chanted, “Jews will not replace us,” insisting that Jews are an evil cabal infecting white America by supporting inferior races. Unlike “radical leftists,” these people are actually in power — and they are actually a threat to Jews, unlike keffiyeh-wearing students at Columbia University. If we truly value Jewish safety we must throw off the isolationist mentality. We must give equal value to Black, Brown, queer, and Palestinian safety. We must focus on the true enemy — white supremacy and white nationalism — and not look to ethnonationalism, militarism, and policing to protect us, while endangering those who should be our allies.

Elon Musk has left the White House, but the Trump administration has no plans to halt or reverse the destruction Musk's slash-and-burn tactics caused over his five months leading the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE). And the damage doesn't stop at the federal level. At least 26 states have launched “government efficiency” initiatives of their own in recent months, typically through executive order, legislation, or the creation of a legislative committee, according to an April analysis by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).

The EPI briefing outlines how these state-level initiatives “use disingenuous calls to ‘root out inefficiency' and ‘cut wasteful spending' as a smokescreen,” with the ultimate goal of funding tax cuts for the wealthy.

“State lawmakers are using the DOGE brand to restructure government in favor of partisan interests,” Nina Mast, an EPI policy and economic analyst and a coauthor of the briefing, told Truthout. “They're weaponizing ‘efficiency,' in order to limit agency authority and put burdensome new requirements on agencies that serve the public.”

She added: “These efforts are not new, but this new [DOGE] brand gives them cover to enact changes that would otherwise be condemned as abuses of power.”

These state-level DOGE initiatives typically seek to wrest power from civil servants and state agencies. So far this year, four states (Kentucky, Utah, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) have enacted so-called “REINS-style” laws, modeled after the federal “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny” (REINS) Act. The federal REINS Act, which was originally designed by a Tea Party activist and has been introduced in every Congress since 2009, seeks to give Congress the authority to block major regulations issued by federal agencies. Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, warns that the REINS Act threatens the government's ability to protect public health and safety, enact worker protections, and institute financial reforms, noting: “It will only benefit those corporations that wish to game the system and evade safety standards and do nothing to improve protections for the American public.”

While the REINS Act has never passed the U.S. Senate, and an attempt to slip it into Trump's massive tax bill was stripped by the Senate parliamentarian in June, several similar laws have been enacted in the states, thanks in large part to Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a libertarian political advocacy group affiliated with the Koch family. Once passed, these laws hinder the ability of state agencies to enact regulations and protections. In Wisconsin, for example, which passed the second state REINS-style law under Gov. Scott Walker in 2017, the law prevented the Department of Natural Resources from restricting manure spreading in areas sensitive to groundwater pollution.

While some state DOGE efforts seem gimmicky or designed to impress Donald Trump and Musk — or have already stalled out or died — a handful of states are using DOGE initiatives to push ahead with cuts conservatives have been wanting for decades.

“I've been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt boasted earlier this year. Stitt created a “DOGE-OK” office by executive order in February, which he specified would be “dedicated to President Trump's vision for federal regulatory and budgetary reform in coordination and partnership with the State of Oklahoma.”

Taking a page out of Musk's book, DOGE-OK maintains a list of alleged cost-saving cuts made by state agencies. Stitt has said he wants to scrutinize any spending “more than a ham sandwich,” and many of the listed items are in fact small: One agency ended three laptop leases, another canceled contracts for a cell phone and iPad, and a third saved $600 by terminating a fax line.

More concerningly, Stitt proudly announced in April that DOGE-OK has recommended the state return $157 million in “wasteful” federal health grants, including funding for diabetes prevention, childhood vaccination, and services for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The nonpartisan think tank Oklahoma Policy Institute cautioned against slashing this spending, noting that Oklahoma ranks 47th in overall health metrics and 45th in children's health. The organization's executive director warned: “Short-term savings will lead to far greater costs in the future, both in dollars and lives.”

“These efforts are not new, but this new [DOGE] brand gives them cover to enact changes that would otherwise be condemned as abuses of power.”

Even Republican legislators expressed misgivings about returning the federal health funds at a press conference following the report's release. At the conference, Oklahoma House Speaker Kyle Hilbert noted the legislature was also hearing of cuts to agencies that could cost the state in the long run, such as firing employees only to replace them with expensive contractors. What's more, Hilbert said, some contracts are being retroactively revised for services already rendered, a practice he called “bad business” which “just sets us up in a terrible position in any potential lawsuits.”

Even as they question some of Stitt's cuts, Hilbert and the Republican legislature support the overall DOGE ideology. In May, the Oklahoma legislature passed two bills granting itself oversight over agency regulations, including a REINS-style Act.

But not all Oklahomans are on board with the DOGE agenda. When DOGE-OK launched a portal soliciting public feedback on government “inefficiency,” people flooded it with trolling submissions, including song lyrics or expletives directed at Stitt or Musk. Many suggested firing Ryan Walters, the state superintendent who last year directed every teacher in the state to teach the Bible.

One anonymous poster suggested: “Focus more on helping residents of Oklahoma (who pay your salary, just for the record) than boot-licking Donald Trump and Elon Musk. This is getting embarrassing.”

Stitt is not the only governor flaunting his track record of slashing government in the name of efficiency. “I like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in her January Condition of the State address. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used similar language in February, boasting: “I say we were DOGE before DOGE was cool.”

State DOGE efforts tend to concentrate power in the hands of conservative governors — or in some cases, conservative legislatures.

DeSantis, who has long sought to increase state power in Florida, created a DOGE task force by executive order that extends his authority over local governments and public institutions. In addition to cutting 70 state boards and commissions, his task force's stated goals are to audit and “expose bloat” within local governments, and return “unused or surplus” federal funds. The task force also instructed public college and university presidents to hand over massive amounts of information on staff research, publications, grants, and research funding, and has suggested it may request course syllabi in the near future.

Florida lawmakers have also proposed eliminating the office of lieutenant governor entirely, and replacing it with a cabinet position titled “commissioner of government efficiency.”

The political dynamics are different in Kentucky, where an overwhelmingly Republican legislature is using DOGE tactics to usurp power from Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat. In floor debate over a REINS-style act, which would give the legislature oversight over executive regulations, House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy explicitly stated that the bill's intent was to concentrate power in the hands of the state legislature. “It is about a reset to make sure and remove all doubt that the most powerful branch of government is [the legislature],” he alleged.

Governor Beshear vetoed the legislation in March, calling Rudy's claim of legislative superiority “contrary to the United States and Kentucky Constitutions, which recognize three equal branches of government.” The legislature overrode Beshear's veto three days later.

Similar dynamics played out last year in Kansas, when the Republican legislature overrode the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, to pass similar REINS-style legislation.

Several state DOGE efforts promise to increase “efficiency” with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) — although EPI cautions that “the underlying agenda is to usurp the investigatory authority of civil servants and replace it with untested technological tools that lack accountability.”

In North Carolina, pending legislation would instruct the office of the state auditor, a Republican, to use AI to recommend government offices and jobs to cut. Democrats in the state legislature warned that AI should not be trusted to make these sorts of recommendations in congressional debate in April. Democratic Sen. Sophia Chitlik reminded her colleagues that a University of North Carolina initiative to study youth vaping was recently canceled “because their NIH (National Institutes of Health) grant had the word equity in it.” She added: “We do not need to look any further than our state for examples of what happens when you let an algorithm take control of our workplace.”

“While some states have put forth performative bills that didn't get anywhere, other states fully mirrored the federal DOGE in hypocrisy and bureaucracy, adding another agency that just consolidates power into the hands of bad actors.”

Other state-level DOGE initiatives have similarly touted AI as a cost-saving tool. Florida DOGE plans to use it not only to identify and “cut unnecessary spending and eliminate bureaucracy” within state agencies, but to interfere with county governments as well. In March, the task force sent a letter to local governments throughout the state, requesting their financial information, and announcing plans to use “advanced technology to identify, review, and report on unnecessary spending within county and municipal governments.”

Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Republican Rep. Amanda Nedweski, who is leading a new DOGE congressional committee, told Stateline her committee will seek to increase state efficiency through AI. Emily Schmitt, a businesswoman appointed by the governor to lead a DOGE committee in Iowa, made similar statements to Business Insider. And in Oklahoma, DOGE-OK claims that “modernization efforts” have already saved 100,000 staff hours.

Advocates are pushing back on the idea that a well-run government is one that cuts as much spending as possible.

“‘Efficiency,' reduced to cost savings alone without consideration of effectiveness, doesn't lead to ‘more and better' service — whether within public agencies or outsourced private contractors,” noted the nonprofit In The Public Interest (ITPI) in a March briefing. ITPI contrasts what it calls “smart efficiencies” — such as making the most of innovative technologies, improving processes, and employing people with expertise — with “extractive efficiencies,” like slashing staffing levels, cutting compensation, and reducing service availability.

“One person's concept of waste is another person's vital service,” William Glasgall, a public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to support public sector workers, told Stateline. He noted that government services are not designed to operate like for-profit companies.

Instead, if politicians are interested in eliminating government waste, Glasgall suggests they look at tax breaks, incentives, and abatements, which his organization estimates cost state governments $1 trillion a year.

As is apparent at the federal level — where brutal DOGE government cuts were followed by a Republican spending bill that amounts to a massive, expensive giveaway to the wealthy — cutting government services in the name of “efficiency” is often really about funding tax cuts.

This holds true in the states. Iowa Governor Reynolds boasts about her state's spending cuts: Over the past several years, she oversaw the elimination of 21 of 37 executive-level cabinet agencies, as well as cutting 600 open positions and 1,200 regulations. But over the same timeframe, Iowa has drastically slashed taxes for the wealthy while underfunding public services.

Iowa Democrats also point to the hypocrisy of Reynolds's plans to root out so-called “waste” by creating a new “advisory body” made up of business leaders. They note that in 2023, Reynolds signed legislation stripping power from the state auditor, an elected government watchdog who happens to be a Democrat. “We have someone who has a whole office whose job is to work on this,” State Rep. Adam Zabner pointed out to Stateline. “I think we're more likely to find efficiencies through the state auditor who Iowans elected to that role than we are through a major supporter of the governor's campaigns.”

And in many states where DOGE efforts are underway, critics call it ironic to create a whole new bureaucratic department, in the name of rooting out inefficiency.

“While some states have put forth performative bills that didn't get anywhere, other states fully mirrored the federal DOGE in hypocrisy and bureaucracy, adding another agency that just consolidates power into the hands of bad actors,” Jasmine Payne-Patterson, senior state policy strategist at EPI, told Truthout.

In Texas, for example, legislation creating a Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office (TREO) was signed into law in April. Gov. Greg Abbott promised the law — which is largely a deregulation measure — would “make government more efficient and less costly,” by identifying “unnecessary and ineffective rules.” The law also states that Texas courts do not have to defer to a state agency's interpretation of the law, following in the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron doctrine. Yet despite promising efficiency and lowered spending, the TREO office comes at an expected cost of $22.8 million over the next five years.

“The point of DOGE is to cut government, reduce spending and shrink the bureaucracy,” one Republican Texas representative said on the House floor, in opposition to TREO. “Unfortunately, this bill does the exact opposite.”

In Oklahoma, one submitter made a similar point in Governor Stitt's efficiency feedback portal: “Let's make Oklahoma more efficient by not inventing a whole bureaucracy whose mission is to stop other bureaucracies from being bureaucratic. Bold idea — I know. But sometimes the most efficient thing to do is … nothing.”

Live Updates


            • Desperate search: Authorities say more than 25 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday.
    


            • Death toll rises: At least 27 people, including nine children, have died in the flooding, according to local officials. A 9-year-old camper is among the victims, her mother told CNN.
    


            • Massive effort: Rescue and recovery operations continue today after first responders worked through the night, with authorities saying more than 850 people have been brought to safety. The Trump administration is sending resources to help.
    


            • One-in-100-years intensity: Parts of central Texas saw a month's worth of rain in just a few hours, prompting multiple flash flood emergencies. Hunt, a town near Kerrville, received about 6.5 inches in just three hours early Friday, which is considered a one-in-100-years rainfall event for the area.
    


            Daric and Heidi Easton, restaurant owners in downtown Kerrville, Texas, have pivoted to providing food for first responders and individuals affected by catastrophic flooding in the area.
    


            “I think hospitality and service is uniquely equipped to handle situations like this,” Daric Easton told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. “It's typically controlled chaos. The difference was, that we were doing this for our community, and not just for a paycheck.”
    


            The couple have utilized the restaurant's connections and resources, including a customer's helicopter, to transport food and supplies to hard-to-reach areas. “We directly loaded food onto the helicopters, that were then flown to Camp Mystic,” Easton said. “So this did come full circle and accomplish the goal of feeding those kids.”
    


            Easton said his own daughter is around the age of the girls missing from that camp. “I can't imagine what these parents are going through, and I don't need to. I just need to make sandwiches,” he told CNN
    


                    “If I keep making sandwiches, people can still be fed. If responders are fed, then they can save lives,” Easton said.
                





            The Trump administration is working with state and local officials in Texas following the devastating flooding there, President Donald Trump wrote on social media today.
    


            Trump said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will be “there shortly.”
    


                    “Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS,” the president wrote on Truth Social.






            Texas Rep. Chip Roy said he struggled to find the words to describe the heartbreak and chaos his community is facing as rescue crews search for the missing and families begin to grieve the lives lost in this week's flooding.
    


            “Yesterday, I was on the phone with the president, with the secretary … but I couldn't even get the conversation out with the secretary, trying to explain to her what we were dealing with,” Roy said during a news conference today.
    


                    “That doesn't happen often for me, but it took me a while to collect myself to even be able to tell her what we were looking at.”
                





            In the midst of sorrow, the Texas lawmaker recalled moments of hope, including a student from his child's school who had been missing during the flood but was later found safe.
    


                    “I got a call and an update this morning, my kids' school. There was one of their schoolmates was missing, and one of the kids, she was on a mattress for two, three hours in the middle of the night,” Roy said. That little girl has since been reunited with her mother.
                





            “They're the kind of blessings that we should be celebrating while we're also mourning the loss of life,” he added.
    


            About 1,000 local, state and federal personnel are involved in the search effort, which has seen hundreds of rescues, including more than 160 by air, according to Roy.
    


            At least one girl is confirmed dead and 27 are reported missing at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls located near the Guadalupe River — which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours.
    


            The camp, which is nestled in Hunt, an unincorporated community in western Kerr County, Texas, hosts about 750 kids overall.
    


            The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away.



            Early Friday morning, about 107 game wardens and an aviation group tried to access the camp, according to officials. Shortly after midday, they were able to enter the camp and start rescuing children.
    


            Camp Mystic, founded in 1926, prides itself as a “wholesome Christian atmosphere” and a haven where girls “develop outstanding personal qualities and self-esteem,” according to its website. The girls at Camp Mystic develop friendships, grow spiritually and strive “be a better person” and to “let Mystic bring out the best in them,” according to the camp.
    


            There are 27 children reported to be missing from Camp Mystic, the girls summer camp in Kerr County, Texas, according to Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice.
    


            Rice was unable to say how many other people in the area could be missing in the floods.
    


            “We do not have an accurate count, and we don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” he said.
    


The summer camp is located near the Guadalupe River, which surged suddenly on Friday due to torrential rains: 



            The San Gabriel River at Georgetown South Fork, located about 30 miles north of Austin, is expected to crest near 30 feet this afternoon, which is major flood stage.
    


            This would result in flooding for many streets and roads, as well as threatening the lowest homes above Georgetown to Granger Lake, National Weather Service meteorologists warned this morning.
    


            Additional heavy rain is expected in those areas today. An additional 5 inches may be added to rainfall totals, with rainfall rates of 3 to 6 inches in one hour a possibility. This could lead to additional rounds of flash flooding.
    


            The Guadalupe River near Spring Branch rapidly rose overnight by around 27 feet, but levels are expected to begin to fall this morning.
    


            A moist airmass remains over the region of Texas where devastating flooding occurred Friday, with little movement and ample moisture. This combination means that the area should remain on alert for more flash flooding, as repeated rounds of heavy rain could fall over areas already affected.
    


Northwest of Austin: Early Saturday, 6.5 inches (a 1-in-100-year rainfall rate) to 7.5 inches (a 1-in-200-year rainfall rate) of rain fell in just 3 hours in Burnet, Texas — which amounts to a 1% chance or less of this happening in any given year.
    


            A flash flood emergency was issued for western Travis County and then expanded into much of Burnet County and western parts of Williamson County on Saturday morning. Rainfall totals for this area have already reached 5 to 10 inches. Ten inches of rain is also about the average rainfall expected in the Austin area in a three-month period — which fell in just 3 hours.
    


            The high rainfall rates led to water inundating homes overnight near Allen Branch Creek in Burnet, according to the emergency management office of Cedar Park. Emergency management officials also reported that water came into the first floors of homes near Liberty Hill, Texas, prompting water rescues.
    


            Showers and thunderstorms are possible through this weekend, but the heaviest rainfall is expected to be farther east than the worst-hit areas so far. A flood watch remains in effect through Saturday evening, with 2 to 4 inches of additional rainfall possible. Any additional rain could aggravate ongoing flooding and lead to new flooding as the ground is saturated.
    


            Kerrville, Texas, Mayor Joe Herring Jr. warned of a tough day ahead and expressed gratitude for the response from city crews, county personnel and state agencies to devastating flooding in the region.
    


                    “People need to know, today will be a hard day,” Herring said, his voice wavering as he made his opening remarks at a news conference. “It will be a hard day.”
                





            Herring also thanked people around the country for an outpouring of offers to help.
    


            “I'm thankful you're here. Today will be a hard day. Please pray for our community,” he said.
    


            Search teams are making rescues in “a very harsh environment,” recovering some people from trees and other high-ground locations, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.
    


            “They are looking at every possible location,” Rice said at a Saturday news conference.
    


            Search and rescue operations continued through the evening Friday and overnight into Saturday, with specialized equipment, including helicopters, trying to identify any heat sources in the flooded area, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.
    


            “I do want to encourage folks with road damage, even though a road may be open, please use extreme caution. If water does get under the road, we are seeing a lot of debris, a lot of asphalt that is washing up, so there could be some other damaged areas,” he warned.
    


            “We did start boots-on-ground operations about 8 a.m. [9 a.m. ET] this morning, and started about southwest of Hunt, so southwest of Camp Mystic,” Rice said. “These folks will be traveling very difficult terrain, up through Ingram, and we're going to start getting information.”
    


            Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha said first responders will continue to search for “every single person” who is missing in the floods.
    


            “One thing I want to tell you and assure y'all is, that we will not stop until every single person is found — we've got all the resources we need,” he said during a news conference.
    


                    “Tragic incidents like this affect us all. This community is strong and will continue to pull together during this tragic time,” Leitha said. “We have been humbled by the outpouring of support; we are very appreciative everyone that's stepped up to help us.”
                





            Officials in Texas have recovered the bodies of at least 27 people, including nine children, after catastrophic flooding impacted parts of the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha.
    


            Leitha said officials have evacuated or rescued over 850 people, including eight with injuries.
    


            Both totals were current as of Saturday morning local time, the sheriff said at a news conference. He warned that the situation is still evolving and the numbers could change. The previous death toll provided by authorities Friday night was 24.
    


                    “We're unable to release any further information on deceased at this time as our thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones,” Leitha said Saturday. “We are working hard to locate anyone who is still missing and ensure they are safe.”
                





            He said locals can contact a call center in the region to report missing people, or email relief teams.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from the sheriff.



            A Kerrville city councilmember is mourning devastation from the flooding and asked people across the country to keep his community in their prayers.
    


            “When we have an event, a catastrophic event like this, it hits hard and it hurts,” councilmember Jeff Harris told CNN affiliate KABB this morning.
    


            Harris said Kerrville, a city of around 25,000 people, is “a tight-knit community,” and “pretty much everybody knows everybody.”
    


            Harris said friends from accross the country have reached out to ask how they can help. “And the answer to that question, right now, is pray. That's what we need. We need prayers,” Harris said.
    


            Area resident Jerry Adams told CNN that summer camps and Crider's, a local rodeo and dancehall, were “the lifeblood of this community” and “everybody's bread and butter” in Hunt, Texas, which was hit hard by this week's flooding.
    


            Crider's was set to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its annual Fourth of July rodeo, dance and barbecue on Friday, according to its website.
    


                    “Now, it's just nothing,” Adams said. “It's never going to be the way it really was. It's going to take a lot of time, and a lot of effort, and a lot of praying to get this thing back.”
                





            “It's just sad. It's just really sad for the community,” Adams told CNN, holding back tears.
    


            Meanwhile, the search continues for about 20 children who authorities say are unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls in Hunt.
    


            The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away.
    


            Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said yesterday that more than 20 children were unaccounted for at the private Christian summer camp for girls, which hosts about 750 kids overall.
    


            After the catastrophic flooding hit Kerr County in central Texas, Anne Hunt told CNN on Friday that she and her family had not heard anything about Janie's whereabouts and were praying for her return.
    


            Vice President JD Vance voiced his sorrow over the loss of the individuals killed in flash flooding in central Texas and the loved ones they leave behind.
    


            “Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy,” Vance said Saturday in a statement on X. “I hope everyone affected knows they're in the prayers of my family, and of millions of Americans.
    


            First lady Melania Trump expressed her sympathy to the parents whose children were caught in the catastrophic flooding in central Texas in a social media post Saturday.
    


            “My heart goes out to the parents in Texas during this difficult time,” she wrote. “I am holding you in my thoughts and sending prayers for strength, comfort, and resilience.”
    


            Around two dozen girls from a private Christian summer camp were still unaccounted for Friday night. Camp Mystic is in Hunt, Texas, near the Guadalupe River, which has swelled to its second-highest level on record, according to the National Weather Service. Everyone at about 18 other camps along the river is accounted for, officials said.
    


            The camp director and co-owner of Heart O' the Hills, a girls camp in Hunt, Texas, died in the catastrophic flooding that struck the area overnight into the Fourth of July holiday, according to an announcement from the camp.
    


            Jane Ragsdale was the “heart and soul” of the camp, according to its website.
    


            “We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,” the camp wrote about its director. “We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful.”
    


            The camp, set alongside the Guadalupe River, was not in session at the time of the flooding, and “most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground,” the announcement reads.
    


            Flash floods are the second-deadliest weather hazard after extreme heat. They can occur when a dam or levee is breached – or when intense rain outpaces the ground's ability to absorb it, as was the case in Texas' Kerr County this week.
    


            Pinpointing exactly where flash flooding will occur is a major challenge because geography and topography can vary widely, even over small regions.
    


            Mountainous areas are extremely susceptible to flash flooding. There's not as much surface area for rain to soak into soil before steep inclines send it rushing down, where it can overwhelm streams and rivers and funnel into valleys and rise quickly with little warning.
    


            You can read more here about flash floods and what to do if you get caught in one.
    


            Kerrville, Texas was hit especially hard by flash flooding after heavy rain swelled two forks of the Guadalupe River before they converge and flow “through the city,” City Manager Dalton Rice said at a news conference Friday.
    


            Storms late Thursday into Friday “dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,” Rice said, describing how the river swelled from 7 feet to 29 feet in a short amount of time during the night.
    


            “All of that converged at the Guadalupe, and that's where we saw those very quick rising floods,” Rice said.
    


            Rice also noted not all areas along the river have alarms to flag flooding. The alarms are typically “further downstream,” he said, in places such as in Comfort, which sits about 15 miles southeast of Kerrville.

            • Rising death toll: At least 24 people are dead after torrential rain triggered flash flooding in parts of central Texas early Friday, according to officials.
    


• Campers unaccounted for: More than 20 girls are unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, in Kerr County, which is located along a river that rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours. It “does not mean they are lost,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick cautioned.
    


            • All-night rescue effort: Searches to find those unaccounted for “will continue in the darkness of night,” Gov. Greg Abbott said. Around 237 people have been rescued or evacuated so far, many by helicopter, authorities said.
    


            • One-in-100-years intensity: Parts of central Texas saw a month's worth of rain in just a few hours overnight into Friday, prompting multiple flash flood emergencies. Hunt, a town near Kerrville, received about 6.5 inches in just three hours early Friday, which is considered a one-in-100-years rainfall event for the area. Heavy rain is expected to continue Saturday.
    


Our live coverage of deadly flooding in Texas has moved here.



            President Donald Trump called the central Texas flooding “terrible” and pledged federal support in the aftermath.
    


            “It's terrible. The floods? It's shocking. They don't know the answer yet as to how many people, but it looks like some young people have died,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to his New Jersey golf club.
    


            Asked if there will be federal aid, he responded, “Oh yeah, we'll take care of them. We're working with the governor. We're working with the governor. It's a terrible thing.”
    


            At least 24 people have died in Kerr County, Texas, after severe flooding inundated the area, according to County Sheriff Larry Leitha.
    


            The search for those swept up in floodwaters in central Texas will continue throughout the night as state and local officials “remain in a search and rescue posture,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday.
    


                    “They will continue in the darkness of night. They will be taking place when the sun rises in the morning. They will be nonstop, seeking to find everybody who is unaccounted for,” he said.
                





            First responder helicopters with infrared technology will be flying overnight in a continued effort to locate any potential rescue victims, a source familiar with the search said.
    


            Between 23 and 25 people at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, are still unaccounted for following severe flooding in the region, authorities said Friday night.
    


            Early Friday morning, about 107 game wardens and an aviation group tried to access the camp, according to officials. Shortly after midday, they were able to enter the camp and start rescuing children.
    


            Authorities were in contact with about 18 camps along the Guadalupe River and said Camp Mystic was the only camp with people still unaccounted for as of Friday evening.
    


                    “The far majority of those camps have their campers and have already contacted their families and working to reunite those families together,” Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said at a news conference Friday. “We are focused on the ones that cannot help themselves right now, and that is our primary area of concern.”
                





            More than 200 people have been rescued following severe flooding in Kerr County, Texas, and emergency response efforts are still underway.
    


                    “As of a few hours ago, we had rescued or evacuated 237 people and 167 of those were by helicopter,” Major General Thomas M. Suelzer said at a news conference Friday night. “So we are having a very good helicopter response when the weather allows.”
                





            On Saturday, personnel will be sent to help manage evacuee shelters with tracking efforts to help confirm those located to date, he added.
    


            Suelzer said three additional helicopters are also on the way to help support the community.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday he has issued a disaster declaration after severe flooding left at least 24 dead and more than 20 missing in the state.
    


            The declaration was issued for several of the hardest hit counties in central Texas: Bandera, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kimball, Llano, Mason, McCullough, Menard, Reeves, San Saba and Tom Green.
    


             It will ensure the counties “are going to have access to every tool, strategy, personnel that the state of Texas can provide to them, which will be limitless,” he said.
    


            “We'll put in everything we have in the entire state,” Abbott said.
    


            Severe flooding has left at least 24 people dead in Kerr County, Texas, Sherrif Larry Leitha said at a news conference Friday night.
    


            There was also an additional fatality in Kendall County, but it's not immediately clear if it is related to flooding, he said.
    


            School buses and trucks filled with rescued people drove into a reunification center in Ingram, Texas, on Friday as families reunited with their children from the nearby girls' and boys' camps.
    


            Search efforts remain underway for the over 20 people who remain unaccounted for from Camp Mystic, with helicopters, rescue boats and other units searching the surrounding areas.
    


            At Ingram Elementary, families embraced as people lined up around the building and others loaded into a military-style high water vehicle, CNN's Ed Lavandera reports from Ingram.
    


            Some of the children appeared to be emotionally shaken and were heard telling their parents, “I just want to go home,” Lavandera reports.
    


            “Here is a truck full of people who are being brought into this area,” Lavandera reports. “This is working essentially as a reunification center. Many of the children who are being brought out of Camp Mystic and the young girls are reunited with their parents and families here.”
    


            Some helicopters were seen landing and dropping off campers at the reunification center as yellow school buses arrived, video footage shows.
    


            Lavandera's team spoke with one parent at the scene waiting to reunite with his 10-and-8-year-old daughters.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will hold a news conference with state and local officials in Kerrville at 9 p.m. CT (10 p.m. ET) to provide an update on the state's response to severe flooding impacting parts of the state.
    


            Video shows a couple from Hunt, Texas, explaining the harrowing situation of waking up to their house flooding overnight following catastrophic levels of rainfall.
    


            Maria and Felipe Tapia, who live approximately 200 to 300 feet from the Guadalupe River, described their home overflowing with water within 10 minutes, forcing them to swim out to get to safety.
    


            Once they exited the home, the couple attempted to open the door to their truck before realizing it was stuck and decided to seek shelter with a neighbor on higher ground.
    


            “We got out right on time,” Felipe said. “I felt like I was swimming under a river.”
    


            Texas Game Wardens have arrived at Camp Mystic to help with evacuations after flooding took over the area.
    


            The wardens, part of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, were seen with a line of trucks coming into the driveway, photos from their Facebook page show. Children gathered into the beds of the trucks to be evacuated.
    


            Camp Mystic, the girls' summer camp where state officials said more than 20 people remain unaccounted for, is located along a river that rose more than 20 feet in about 90 minutes overnight, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            “Guadalupe River at Hunt continues to rise sharply and has reached 2nd highest height on record, higher than the 1987 flood,” the agency said on X Friday morning. “This is a very dangerous and life-threatening flood event along the river. Move to higher ground!”
    


            Hunt, in Kerr County, saw about 6.5 inches of rain in just three hours early Friday — a 1-in-100-year event there, meaning it has about a 1% chance of happening in any given year.
    


            Severe flooding in central Texas has left at least 13 people dead and more than 20 children unaccounted for, and the death toll is expected to rise as more rain flows though the hard-hit region Friday night.
    


            Searches were underway and officials scrambled to rescue people from floodwaters on the Fourth of July after heavy rain deluged central Texas, overwhelming the Guadalupe River and prompting multiple flash flood warnings and emergencies.
    


                    “We could not anticipate this, despite flood warnings, despite everything going on, there were some things that happened very fast,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said Friday.
                





            The National Weather Service issued a flood watch early Thursday afternoon that highlighted Kerr County as a place at high risk of flash flooding through the overnight. A flash flood warning was issued for Kerr County as early as around 1 a.m. CT on Friday. A more dire flash flood emergency warning was then issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m. CT, followed by another one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. CT.
    


            As others across the country attended parades, enjoyed fireworks and had barbecues, some Texas families mourned the loved ones they lost or waited for those missing to finally be found safe.
    


                    “There's still several people unaccounted for right now, at this point, but we're working really hard,” Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Friday.
                





Here's what you should know about the impacts of severe weather in Texas:



            The Houston Fire Department is assisting first responders nearly 300 miles away in Kerr County as rescues are underway in high flood waters.
    


            Four members from the Tactical Deployment Unit and an engine will assist first responders, while another three firefighters will help the Texas A&M Task Force One.
    


            “As we so often see help from around the state come to Houston when we face floods, we are proud to be able to support others in their time of need,” Houston Fire Chief Thomas Muñoz said Friday.

            Mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt says she has not yet heard anything about her whereabouts after catastrophic flooding hit Kerr County on Friday.
    


            “We are just praying,” Janie's mother told CNN.
    


            9-year-old Lainey Landry is also missing from the camp, according to her mother Natalie.  She is “brave and sweet,” her mother tells CNN.
    


            Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz expressed condolences Friday for those who died as floods ripped through central Texas. In posts on X, the lawmakers said they are in contact with state and local officials to ensure they have access to rescue and recovery resources.
    

Please pray right now for everyone in the Hill Country, especially Camp Mystic.Today, I've spoken with Gov Abbott, Lt. Gov Patrick, the head of TDEM & President Trump.Multiple helicopters are performing search & rescue. President Trump committed ANYTHING Texas needs. 🙏🙏


            Cornyn wrote his staff has “been in touch with local officials & emergency responders, and are working to make sure all resources needed are made available.”
    


            The White House has called several times Friday, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said.
    


            President Donald Trump has made sure the message was sent that “whatever we need, we will have,” he said.
    


            As over 500 people are out searching for missing people in Kerr County, Texas Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick promised families of missing campers they would “do everything humanly possible to find your daughter.”
    


                    “I want all of you to know we will do everything humanly possible. Twenty-four-seven, looking at every tree, turning over every rock, whatever it takes - if your child is one of those truly missing and not just out of touch - to find your daughter,” he said.
                





            First responders are focusing on finding and rescuing residents Friday afternoon before launching recovery efforts, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.
    


            “We are still actively trying to find those that are out and those that are needing assistance,” Rice said.
    


            He said there are rescue teams at Camp Mystic, the girls' summer camp where state officials said about 20 people remain unaccounted for.
    


            “As we are going through the camps, we're still trying to figure out where people are, what's going on, and how to best serve them,” he said.

Kerrville's city manager says the extreme weather event happened in a span of less than two hours early on Friday, as the Guadalupe River rose rapidly.

Months worth of heavy rain fell over just a few hours overnight in central Kerr County, Texas, causing deadly flash flooding of the Guadalupe River.

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Rescuers were searching Saturday for more than two dozen children from a girls' camp and many others still missing after a wall of water rushed down a river in the Texas Hill Country during a powerful storm that killed at least 27 people, officials said. Among the dead were nine children.

The destructive fast-moving waters along the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as torrential rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.

Some 27 people remained missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, said Dalton Rice, Kerrville's city manager. An unknown number of people at other locations were still unaccounted for, he said Saturday.

“People need to know today will be a hard day,” said Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. “Please pray for our community.”

Searchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue stranded people in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. The total number of missing was not known, according to the city manager, who said he didn't want to give an estimate.

Frantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information. 




“The camp was completely destroyed,” said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers at Camp Mystic. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”




A raging storm woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday, and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with floodwaters whipping around their legs, she said. 

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said 27 were confirmed dead, including nine children. Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued.

The flooding in the middle of the night on the Fourth of July holiday caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise. The Texas Hill Country, which sits northwest of San Antonio, is a popular destination for camping and swimming, especially around the summertime holiday. 

AccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation. 

“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather said in a statement that called the Texas Hill County one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.

Officials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

One National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to six inches (152 millimeters) of rain, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said. 

Search crews were facing harsh conditions while scouring the waterlogged rivers, culverts and rocks. “They are looking in every possible location,” Rice said.

More than 1,000 rescuers were on the ground. Helicopters and drones were being used, with some people being plucked from trees. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were flying in to assist.

One reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet Saturday after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before.

“We still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. We've had a little success, but not much,” said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was traveling to Texas and his administration was working with officials on the ground.

“Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Trump said in a statement on his social media network. 

In Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home from the river, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teenage son and waiting for the water to recede enough to walk up the hill to safety.

“That's the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him,” she said.

“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said.

Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone.

“We got no emergency alert. There was nothing,” Stone said. Then “a pitch black wall of death.” 

At a reunification center in Ingram, families cried and cheered Friday as loved ones got off rescue vehicles. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not get down a ladder. Behind her, a woman clutched a small white dog. 

Later, a girl in a white “Camp Mystic” T-shirt and white socks stood in a puddle, sobbing in her mother's arms.

Barry Adelman said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and 9-year-old grandson. 

“I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death,” he said. 

Authorities were coming under increasing scrutiny over whether the camp and others in the area received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made. 

The forecast for the weekend had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.

“Everything was done to give them a heads up that you could have heavy rain, and we're not exactly sure where it's going to land,” Patrick said. “Obviously as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, that's when the storm started to zero in.”

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.” 

When pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly said no one knew this kind of flood was coming.

The slow-moving storm stuck over central Texas is bringing more rain Saturday, with the potential for pockets of heavy downpours and more flooding, said Jason Runyen, of the National Weather Service. 

The threat could linger overnight and into Sunday morning, he said. 

The area is known as “flash flood alley” because of the hills' thin layer of soil, said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations to help with the response.

“When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,” Dickson said. “It rushes down the hill.”

River tourism industry is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said.

“It's generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations,” Dickson said.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot that went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night for a spot in the Club World Cup semifinals.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute but Estêvão, an 18-year-old who will transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd.

Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy. FIFA credited Weverton with an own goal.

Chelsea won't travel far for its next match, facing Fluminense on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Hércules came off the bench and scored in the 70th minute to lift Fluminense past Al Hilal 2-1 in Friday's earlier quarterfinal.

With Chelsea's win, three of the four semifinal teams will be from Europe, with one from Brazil.

The 23-year-old Palmer scored his first goal in the Club World Cup, and showed why he's widely considered one of the top attacking midfielders. He took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and slipped the ball inside the far post.

Fans made it to Lincoln Financial Field on a holiday weekend that included a strike by nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia, competition from an earlier Phillies game, and a concert and fireworks show near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. FIFA had slashed tickets to as low as $11.15.




FIFA president Gianni Infantino attended the game, the eighth of the tournament at the home of NFL Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.

There was a pregame pregame tribute for Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, who were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway.

Chelsea forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill each got their second yellow cards of the tournament and will be suspended for the semifinal. Chelsea also played without captain Reece James, who was removed from the starting lineup due to injury.

Estêvão agreed to a deal with Chelsea last summer that moved him to Chelsea after he turned 18. Estêvão huddled up with his future teammates — including Palmer — and received some friendly postgame encouragement.

“It's good to be the last English team and hopefully we can win it. There was a lot of fans tonight. More than usual than we've played. So it was nice.” — Palmer.

“Tonight will be a very difficult night to sleep because we'll feel like we could've done something different.” — Weverton.

The monstrous, swift-moving flood that swept through the Hill Country of Texas on Friday, killing at least 27 people and leaving many more missing, was a flash flood, the nation's top storm-related killer. Among those missing are more than 20 girls attending a summer camp.

Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, including some by helicopter.

According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood is flooding that begins within six hours, and often in as little as three hours, of heavy rainfall.

Waters rise so quickly that people are caught off guard, according to the weather service. Many people run into trouble while traveling. If at home or work, the water can rise so quickly people are trapped before they have time to think about escape.

That is just what happened to residents along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County and the surrounding area after at least 10 inches (25 centimeters) poured from the sky early Friday morning.

Fast-moving waters along the river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday and flash flood warnings and flood watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.




On Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch, estimating rising water of up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) in spots. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for a flood and people should be prepared, but hazardous conditions might not develop. 

But the watch was upgraded to a flood warning overnight, a notice that impacted 30,000 people. A warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring, the weather service says.

Lt,. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area and “everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain.” 

However, when asked about how people were notified in Kerr County so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.”

When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly responded: “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.”

Last year, 145 people died in flash floods, according to the weather service. On average over the past 30 years, floods have claimed 127 lives annually.

Nearly half of all flood-related fatalities involve vehicles. Flood deaths affect all age groups. 

Many people don't realize that a car becomes difficult to control in just 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water and can be swept away in as little as 18 inches (46 centimeters). So instead of finding a detour, too often people try to drive through water at underpasses or other low-lying areas.

It can happen anywhere, according to the weather service, which says that “the normally tranquil streams and creeks in your neighborhood can become raging torrents if heavy rain falls overhead.”

An area can be flooded even without rain — if it's downstream of a torrential rainstorm and a swollen stream heads its way. 

Hurricanes, tropical storms, non-cyclonic weather systems carrying heavy rain and dam failures are some weather events that can cause flash flooding. They can happen in rural areas or in large cities.

House Republicans have propelled President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final congressional passage.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. 

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. 

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect. 

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump's first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There's also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits. 

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.




A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. 

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line. 

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. 

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs. 

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America's wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood. 

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

FIFA paid tribute to Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, before kickoff at the Club World Cup quarterfinal games in Orlando, Florida, and Philadelphia on Friday.

The 28-year-old Jota and 25-year-old Silva were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway just after midnight Thursday.

At the match between Al Hilal and Fluminense at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, players formed a circle at midfield as the video board displayed a photo of the Portuguese soccer players. The crowd participated in a moment of silence.

At Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia where Brazil's Palmeiras faced Chelsea, a black-and-white photo of the brothers was displayed and a moment of silence was observed as players on both teams wore a black band on their sleeves.

Chelsea's Pedro Neto, a friend and Portugal national teammate of Diogo Jota, made the sign of the cross as he entered the pitch with a jersey on his shoulder that had Jota's and André Silva's first names. Neto held up the jersey during the moment of silence with the help of Enzo Fernández.

Spanish police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve another vehicle, they said. They said they believe it could have been caused by a blown tire.

Jota's death occurred two weeks after he married longtime partner Rute Cardoso while on vacation following a long season when he helped Liverpool win the Premier League. The couple had three children, the youngest born last year.

Silva played for the Portuguese club Penafiel in the lower divisions.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick joins ‘Fox News Live' to provide an update on the deadly Texas floods, which have killed at least 27 people and left dozens, including children, still missing.

Three young girls were found dead after a devastating flood swept through Camp Mystic, an all-girls private Christian camp in Hunt, Texas. 

Anne Hunt confirmed to Fox News Digital that her daughter, Janie, was one of the campers killed in the flood. Additionally, A Voice for the Voiceless, a nonprofit that advocates for ""the missing, voiceless and crime victims,"" identified Renee Smajstrla as the other deceased camper.

A third camper has been confirmed to be deceased, however her family has asked that her name not be released.

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said on Friday night that between 23 and 25 campers were missing. There were 750 attendees at the camp when the flood hit.

On Saturday, Kerr County announced the flood killed 27 people, 18 of whom were adults and 9 were children.

Camp Mystic, which had approximately 750 attendees, reportedly told parents that if they had not been contacted directly it meant that their child was accounted for.

Ellen Toranzo told Fox News Digital that her daughter, Greta Toranzo, is one of the campers who went missing during the flood. Carrie Hanna also confirmed to Fox News Digital that her daughter, Hadley, is unaccounted for.

Elinor Lester, 13, told the Associated Press she was evacuated with her cabinmates by helicopter after wading through floodwaters. Lester also said that the ""camp was completely destroyed"" in the disastrous flood. The outlet noted that Lester was housed on higher ground at the camp, known as Senior Hill. Younger campers, who can begin attending at age 8, are housed along the riverbanks and were the first to flood, according to the Associated Press. 

The National Guard was deployed in Texas to respond after heavy rain on Friday morning caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 30 feet in 45 minutes. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem later said that members of the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist in evacuations.

Helicopters and military vehicles were used for evacuations. As of Friday night, 237 people had been evacuated, including 167 by helicopter.

Texas deployed more than 1,000 state responders and over 800 vehicles and equipment assets, according to Gov. Greg Abbott's office. The governor also declared an emergency for 15 counties, and his office said that more could be added to the list.

""This is a time when we, as a state, need God more than ever,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""The one thing I hear the most are the prayers that are being sent for those who are in harm's way.""

President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that the floods were ""shocking"" and ""a terrible thing."" He also said the state would receive federal aid and that his administration was working with Abbott. 

""Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy,"" Vice President JD Vance wrote on X. ""I hope everyone affected knows they're in the prayers of my family, and of millions of Americans.""

The vice president, a devout Catholic, also included the Eternal Rest Prayer in his post.

The Kerr County Sheriff's Office is encouraging those with missing loved ones to call the Red Cross at 1-800-733-2767 for information.

Immigration expert Mark Krikorian explained that the reason behind the breakout of immigration riots and protests across the country and made suggestions about what the country can do to course-correct.

Multiple people were arrested in Los Angeles on Friday as anti-ICE demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and the U.S. military after weeks of protests against deportations and ICE raids, police said.

Los Angeles police said there were ""multiple arrests today during several different demonstrations"" downtown.

""Most were peaceful, but once again, as the evening approached, outside agitators began to cause issues,"" the department wrote on X.

Earlier in the night, police wrote that demonstrators were ""confronting Federal Protective Security Personnel and National Guard members.""

""Less Lethal munitions have been deployed by Federal authorities,"" police wrote, adding that they may cause pain and discomfort.

In response to the anti-ICE protests that began last month, the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Demonstrators met up for the protest on Friday at around 9:30 a.m. outside City Hall on Spring Street and took a 1.5-mile route through downtown, according to local outlet KCAL.

Police said the group dispersed shortly after the incident commander authorized a dispersal order for the area on Friday night, according to a post at 7:17 p.m. local time.

Officers from the Department of Homeland Security had declared the protest an unlawful assembly, independent journalist Anthony Cabassa wrote on X, adding that Marines and federal agents were using riot gear while ordering the crowd to disperse.

Entertainment Nation, a permanent exhibit established in 2022 and housed in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, is under review by the Trump White House for so-called 'divisive' narratives. (Jasmine Baehr/Fox News Digital)

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump administration is turning its attention to the Smithsonian Institution, accusing the taxpayer-funded museum complex of using federal dollars to promote what it calls ""one-sided, divisive political narratives"" that fail to honor the greatness of the American story.

White House official Lindsey Halligan blasted content currently on display at the National Museum of American History's Entertainment Nation exhibit in an exclusive email to Fox News Digital.The exhibit, which explores American pop culture, has drawn internal and external criticism for what some see as a politically loaded interpretation of cultural milestones.

""American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives,"" Halligan said. ""The Smithsonian Institution should present history in a way that is accurate, balanced, and consistent with the values that make the United States of America exceptional.""DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI

The White House statement comes on the heels of several striking examples from the exhibit. 

One placard, featured alongside a 1923 circus poster, reads: ""Under the big top, circuses expressed the colonial impulse to claim dominion over the world."" Another, describing early American entertainment, declares: ""One of the earliest defining traits of entertainment in the United States was extraordinary violence.""

The exhibit reframes iconic American characters through a critical, politically-charged lens. On The Lone Ranger, the display states: ""The White title character's relationship with Tonto resembled how the U.S. government imagined itself the world's Lone Ranger.""

Mickey Mouse, a beloved American cultural icon, is not spared either. A display for the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie states, ""Mickey challenged authority, but not everyone was in on the joke.""

It continues: ""Mickey Mouse debuted as the deckhand ‘Steamboat Willie' in 1928, amidst a rising anxiety felt by many that modern living and city life were eroding family and community ties and loosening moral codes… But the new character's outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy.""

In reference to the Indiana Jones film series, another panel reads: ""His character embodied a confident righteousness that, in many ways, captured the essence of the 1980s"" above another subhead referencing President Ronald Reagan's famous speech, asking, ""Are you better off?""KENT STATE STUDENT'S VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP ART DISPLAY SPURS OUTRAGE

One panel calls Magnum, P.I. a challenge to the ""popular perceptions of Vietnam veterans as damaged misfits."" A section on Jon Stewart's Daily Show refers to it as ""the go-to for viewers who mistrusted politicians and the reporting process.""

Another panel highlights the late pop star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez and frames her cultural impact through identity politics.

""Selena got us talking about identity,"" with a quote from the late singer reading, ""I feel very proud to be Mexican.""

The text goes on to say her work ""cast a light on the longstanding cultural and growing political influence of Mexican American and Latinx communities within the United States.""

""The examples [Fox News Digital] highlighted from the National Museum of American History are part of the problem the Trump Administration aims to fix,"" Halligan said. ""Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress.""

Halligan confirmed that a top-to-bottom content review is already underway, with input from senior Smithsonian leaders and the Board of Regents. ""We are working with leadership at the Smithsonian to audit and review all content at the museums,"" she said, ""and we are committed to ensuring that such content honors our country's founding principles, tells the stories of American heroes, and does not promote fringe or activist ideologies masquerading as history.""

She added, ""We will provide updates on this audit as our progress unfolds.""

The Smithsonian Institution responded to Fox News Digital with the following brief written statement: ""The museum is committed to continuous and rigorous scholarship and research and unbiased presentation of facts and history. As such, and as previously announced, we are assessing content in Smithsonian museums and will make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.""

The Institution did not answer specific questions regarding who authored the Entertainment Nation exhibit, whether outside academic consultants or activist organizations were involved, or who made the decision to present all exhibit text bilingually in English and Spanish.

The controversy comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump to reshape cultural institutions he says have veered too far left.

In March, Trump issued an executive order directing the Board of Regents to eliminate ""improper, divisive or anti-American ideology"" from Smithsonian museums. He accused the institution of embracing what he called ""a revisionist movement"" aimed at ""undermining the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.""

The Board of Regents includes the vice president, the chief justice of the United States, six members of Congress, and nine citizen regents. 

Vice President J.D. Vance and Congressman Carlos Giménez, both recent appointees, have advocated for an expedited review of Smithsonian content. Giménez, in a prior interview with The Wall Street Journal, confirmed tensions at the board's June meeting over how quickly to proceed, though ultimately a compromise was reached.

The Smithsonian receives approximately two-thirds of its $1 billion annual budget from federal appropriations. 

The Entertainment Nation exhibit opened in December 2022 and was billed as a permanent exhibition to ""celebrate the power of popular culture to shape and reflect history."" It is housed in a prime space on the museum's west wing and features artifacts and media from movies, television, sports, and music.

While the museum's stated goal is to explore how entertainment intersects with American identity, the Trump administration argues that it instead uses culture to smuggle in ideology often at odds with the values most Americans hold.

""Americans deserve a Smithsonian that inspires national pride, tells the truth, and reflects the greatness of this country,"" Halligan said. ""Not one that serves as an agent for social change and cultural subversion.""

Former Democrat leader of the California State Senate Gloria Romero joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her reaction to the cancellations and a surge in assaults targeting ICE officers. 

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday she expects boxer Julio Cesar Chávez Jr. to be deported to Mexico to serve a sentence for alleged arms trafficking and organized crime, after he was arrested by ICE in Los Angeles on Thursday. 

Chávez was found to be in the country illegally last week after he made fraudulent statements on a 2024 application for permanent residency based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.

""The hope is that he will be deported and serve the sentence in Mexico,"" Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing Friday, referring to charges that Chávez faces for arms and drug trafficking.

The 39-year-old boxer, according to his attorney Michael Goldstein, was picked up on Wednesday by a large number of federal agents while he was riding a scooter in front of a home where he resides in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Studio City, near Hollywood.

The arrest came only days after the former middleweight champion lost a match against influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Anaheim, California.

Chávez split his time between both countries. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Chávez for overstaying a tourist visa that he entered the U.S. with in August 2023 and expired in February 2024, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said.

According to the department, Chávez Jr. has been charged with several crimes while in the U.S.

On Jan. 22, 2012, the California Highwaay Patrol arrested Chávez and charged him with DUI alcohol/drugs and driving without a license. On June 23, 2012, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, convicted Chávez of the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced him to 13 days in jail and 36 months' probation.

On Jan. 14, 2023, a District Judge issued an arrest warrant for Chávez for the offense of organized crime for the purpose of committing crimes of weapons trafficking and manufacturing crimes, in the modality of those who participate in clandestinely bringing weapons, ammunition, cartridges, explosives into the country; and those who manufacture weapons, ammunition, cartridges and explosives without the corresponding permit.

On Jan. 7, 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested Chávez and charged him with Illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacture or import of a short-barreled rifle. The court convicted Chávez of these charges.'

DHS also suspects Chávez is allegedly believed to be an affiliate of the Sinaloa Cartel, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Chávez's application was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, who is connected to the Sinaloa Cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to DHS.

According to DHS, in December 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had made a referral to ICE that Chávez was an ""egregious public safety threat,"" but he was allowed to reenter the country on Jan. 4, 2025 after records indicated the Biden Administration had not made him an immigration enforcement priority. 

The Biden administration allowed Chávez to re-enter the country and paroled him into the country at the San Ysidro port of entry, accorrding to DHS.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Reality My Medicaid Patients Face","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/07/medicaid-cuts-work-requirements-patients/683437/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 13:38:52 GMT","

With work requirements in place, many will be removed from Medicaid even though they should qualify.

The bus smashed into him last month, when he was crossing the street with his wheelchair. By the time he made it to the public hospital in California where I work as a doctor, two quarts of blood had hemorrhaged into one of his thighs, where a tender football-shaped bulge distorted the skin. He remembered his view of the windshield as the bus bore down, then, as he toppled, of the vehicle's dirty underbelly. He was convinced he'd die.



He didn't. Trauma surgeons and orthopedists consulted on his case. He got CT scans, X-rays, and a blood transfusion. Social workers visited him, as did a nutritionist—he was underweight. Antibiotics mopped up the pneumonia he'd contracted from inhaling saliva when he'd passed out. He remained hospitalized for more than a week.



This patient, fortunately, had Medicaid, which meant not only that his care was covered but also that he could see a primary-care doctor after discharge. The public hospital where I'm an internist would have treated him comprehensively regardless of his ability to pay. But in many places, uninsured patients might receive only emergency stabilization at the hospital, face bankrupting bills, and, unless they can pay out of pocket, be denied care at outpatient clinics. And because of work requirements that Congress just passed to restrict Medicaid, the number of uninsured people will quickly grow in the coming months and years.



On the face of it, the requirement that Medicaid beneficiaries submit proof of employment shouldn't worry people like my patient. Over the course of his life, scoliosis has curved his spine so much that his shoulders hover a couple of feet in front of his legs when he stands, and he's relied on a wheelchair for more than a decade. His medical condition should exempt him.



But he told our team that he lives in shelters, so he lacks a fixed address. He doesn't have a cellphone. He could access government websites at a public library, except that his request for a power wheelchair, which Medicaid will cover, hasn't been approved yet, and navigating the city in a standard one exhausts him. Plus, every time he leaves his stuff behind at the shelter to go somewhere, he told me, it's stolen. At present, he doesn't even own an official ID card.



As a doctor in a hospital that serves the urban poor, I see patients who already face such a gantlet of obstacles that modest barriers to accessing government programs can effectively screen them out. The White House's stated aim with the changes is to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. But according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, nearly 12 million Americans will lose insurance by 2034 because of the impacts of the new legislation on Medicaid enrollment and restrictions on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The safety-net institutions that serve many of the country's poorest residents cannot make up for the gap. Some hospitals will undoubtedly face financial disaster and close, especially in rural areas—leaving patients with even less ability to get treatment.



Here's a representative sample of patients on Medicaid I've treated recently: a father bleeding into his brain who speaks a Chinese-minority dialect that required multiple conversations with interpreters to identify. A middle-aged man with type 1 diabetes who suffered a stroke that resulted in such severe memory deficits that he can't reliably remember to inject insulin. A day laborer with liver inflammation who works long hours in construction, often seven days a week, and who's paid in cash. A young woman with a fentanyl addiction who was too weak and exhausted from malnourishment to enroll in a drug-rehabilitation program. A patient with a dog bite and a skin infection who has ricocheted between low-wage restaurant jobs.



Some of my patients are employed, as are more than two-thirds of adult Medicaid beneficiaries under age 65 without a disability. Others aren't—and within that group, every one of them would meet criteria for exemption from work requirements, among them medical inability to work, pregnancy, caretaking duties, enrollment in a substance-use treatment program, or at least half-time-student status.



But whether because of language barriers, physical or cognitive disability, lack of internet or phone, or job instability, for all of these patients, overcoming additional bureaucratic barriers would be burdensome at best. For many of them, it would be nearly impossible.



There's little reason to doubt that, with work requirements in place, many patients like mine will be removed from Medicaid even though they should qualify. After Arkansas deployed work requirements for Medicaid in 2018, for instance, more than two-thirds of the roughly 18,000 people who were disenrolled still should have qualified, according to one estimate. What The Atlantic's Annie Lowery has called the time tax—“a levy of paperwork, aggravation, and mental effort imposed on citizens in exchange for benefits that putatively exist to help them”—falls disproportionately on those least likely to possess the connections, education, or resources to cut through an endless slog of canned hold music, pages that fail to load, and automated mazes of bureaucracy that dead-end before the caller can connect to a human.



The time tax of proving employment will act as a gatekeeping device, excluding people from Medicaid while foisting the blame onto their shoulders. It is, in effect, engineered to save money with systems onerous enough to disenfranchise people from what they're entitled to. The bill will slash approximately $1 trillion from Medicaid by 2034, $325 billion of that because of work requirements, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office cost estimates. It will also waste a colossal amount of money creating the mechanisms to deny people care: Though Congress has allocated only $200 million in federal funding for implementing work requirements, the true cost of setting up and administering these systems will likely be many times more, perhaps as much as $4.9 billion, based on one estimate that drew from states that have tried to put in place such requirements.



These cuts will play out differently in each state, and even within states. They'll gut rural health care in some locales, hurt dense urban neighborhoods in others, and hit the working poor everywhere. Their effects will be modulated by how cumbersome or efficient work-verification systems are, by the availability of insurance-eligibility workers, and by community outreach or lack thereof. But in every state, patients will suffer. That's the predictable consequence of legislation that saves money by letting Americans get sick.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Sean Combs's acquittal on a racketeering charge doesn't erase his history as a domestic abuser.

You think you've lost the ability to be shocked, and then you see supporters of Sean Combs—the rapper and producer also known as Diddy—spraying baby oil on one another outside the New York City courthouse where his trial was held.

This greasy display of militant fandom is even more bizarre once you know that the trial did not exonerate Combs. Although he was acquitted on Wednesday of racketeering and sex trafficking, he was found guilty of “transportation to engage in prostitution.” These counts relate to incidents where his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and an anonymous woman, known in court as Jane, were asked to have sex with male escorts while he watched or filmed. The fans' jubilant tone also ignored perhaps the most salient fact of the case: In court, Combs's own defense team conceded that he was a domestic abuser.

Now, I understand why Combs himself might be relieved by the verdict. The racketeering charges carried a potential life sentence, whereas the lesser offenses had no minimum jail penalty attached. But his lawyers had no grounds to do what they did—which was to walk out of the courtroom and stand triumphantly in front of the newly lubricated crowds, acting as if Combs had been cleared. “It's a great victory for Sean Combs; it's a great victory for the jury system,” Marc Agnifilo, one of his lawyers, said in the post-verdict press conference.

No. The charges on which Combs was acquitted were developed for Mafia bosses, and are an uneasy fit for a case where the alleged conspiracy is not gun-running or a protection racket, but a network of employees and enablers dedicated to one man's sexual gratification. His acquittal on these charges should not obscure the simple fact that Combs beat up Ventura, repeatedly, over many years. That is not in dispute, not least because some of it was captured on video. Last year, CNN published a surveillance clip, recorded in a hotel in 2016, that shows a clothed Ventura attempting to call an elevator, before Combs—dressed in only a towel—chases after her, grabs her by the neck, throws her to the ground, and kicks her twice while she is on the floor. “We own the domestic violence,” Agnifilo told jurors. “We own it. I hope you guys know this.” (The judge took note of the admission when denying Combs bail.)

Read: The disturbing implications of the Diddy verdict

Another man might have been ashamed of kicking his girlfriend while she lay motionless on the floor. Combs let his lawyers peacock around because he didn't also get convicted of trafficking her. Our client is innocent! (Of some of the charges.) His reputation has been restored! (Say it enough, and it might come true.)

Maybe this brazenness will work. We now live in a time when what matters is declaiming half-truths, loudly and bullishly, in the expectation that most people aren't paying attention to the details. Combs's entire defense had a sassy, made-for-TikTok quality, shamelessly playing to the gallery—a tactic pioneered by O. J. Simpson's lawyers in the age of television. One of Combs's attorneys, the 30-something Teny Geragos, went viral with TikTok clips defending the mogul before the trial. His lawyers were performing for two audiences: the jury, and the online Diddy stans. The defense declined to put Combs on the stand to explain himself, and called no witnesses. That left the spotlight squarely on his accusers. As a result, it was their testimony that was harshly scrutinized online, not his actions.

From the start, this trial was not a vindication of Combs's life choices. Over and over again, witness accounts portrayed a character that only a mother, or a defense team, could love. (Combs's mother, Janice, was a staple of the public gallery, along with his six older children.) His lawyers presented his “freak-off” parties, where he invited men to have sex with his girlfriends, as a mere kink, part of an unorthodox but harmless swingers' lifestyle. When federal agents searched his home in Miami Beach, they found 25 bottles of baby oil and 31 tubes of another lubricant in one closet. In total, prosecutors said that searches uncovered more than 1,000 bottles of such products—an assertion that only enthralled Combs's admirers.

What the glistening fans outside the courthouse ignored is that Combs's defense team, in dodging the racketeering charges, conceded that his relationship with Ventura was marked by threats and violence. The defense had to grant that premise, because those allegations had already led to a $20 million settlement with Ventura after she filed a lawsuit in 2023. Combs paid up the day after the documents became public. (That civil suit, and others filed by women against Combs, apparently helped trigger the federal investigation that led to his trial.)

Despite this history, his lawyers performed an impressive judo move, using the very fact of the settlement against Ventura, during the four grueling days of testimony to which she was subjected. Aren't you just a gold digger? was the heavy implication. Ventura said that she would happily give back the money if she could also undo the freak-offs. Her civil lawsuit stated that she had not pressed criminal charges because she had no confidence in obtaining justice: “She recognized that she was powerless, and that reporting Mr. Combs to the authorities would not alter Mr. Combs's status or influence but would merely give Mr. Combs another excuse to hurt her.”

This belief has been thoroughly vindicated. Nevertheless, the idea of a mercenary motive was clearly a potent line—and one that Combs's lawyers have also deployed in the dozen civil suits now awaiting him from other alleged victims. “We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason,” they said when 10 more suits emerged in February of this year, on top of several existing claims of grooming, exploitation, and abuse of minors. Combs has denied these allegations.

Although people across America had seen the video from CNN, Combs was not on trial in New York for assault, so the defense argued that the incident was irrelevant to the charges. “Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,” Geragos, one of Combs's lawyers, said in court. Combs's team contended that the video did not show Ventura being punished for leaving a freak-off party, as the prosecution suggested, but instead followed an argument between her and Combs over a phone.

This was an impressive sleight of hand. If someone's partner can be that violent in an everyday argument, then surely that affects their ability to say no to anything else that happens in the relationship? Ann Olivarius, a lawyer who specializes in abuse and harassment cases in the United States and Britain, told me that following the trial was a demoralizing experience for her. “I was glued to Cassie's testimony,” she said over instant message. “I thought she was compelling, strong, admirable and also being crucified by the Defence.” She said that the defense's acknowledgment of Combs's domestic violence was a way “to put it in a neat little box and say: ‘When she wasn't beaten black and blue, she happily and freely consented every time.'”

Other witnesses testified to violent and controlling behavior by Combs. The singer Dawn Richards said she had seen him kick Ventura when she was on the floor, after attempting to hit her with a skillet when she was cooking him eggs. (While the jury was out of the room, the defense called this allegation a “drop-dead lie.”) The makeup artist Mylah Morales testified that she saw Ventura with a split lip and a swollen eye. Ventura's former friend Kerry Morgan said that she was present when Combs tried to break into Ventura's apartment with a hammer after the hotel assault. She also said she once saw him drag Ventura down a corridor by her hair. Ventura's mother, Regina, told the court that Combs had threatened to release sex tapes of her daughter. Two men testified that they had been paid to have sex with Ventura, and one of them, an escort named Daniel Phillip, told the court he had overheard Combs slap Ventura until she cried in another room.

As is quite common in allegations of coercive control, the defense could produce affectionate and sexually explicit messages from Ventura that seemed to undermine her claims of victimization. The fact that the prosecution could produce footage of her literally being victimized did not, apparently, offset the effect of these messages on the jury. Nor did the fact that Combs was not just her boyfriend, but also in charge of her career: They met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring singer, and he signed her to his label.

Jane, the anonymous witness who was a recent ex-girlfriend of Combs's, told a story of coercion much like what Ventura faced. She said she had been pressured into “hotel nights” where she had sex with male escorts hired by Combs. These were painful and often left her with infections, she added, not least because Combs became angry when she asked the men to wear condoms. But she went along with the sex sessions because she was in love with Combs and “didn't want to indicate any negativity.”

One thing the prosecution did right was bring in an expert on coercive control to explain to the jury that in abusive and controlling relationships, the victims become quintessential people pleasers—their entire lives end up being dedicated to placating their partner. “You destroy someone's normal,” is how a British man named Luke Hart described the situation to me, when I interviewed him for my book Difficult Women. His father, Lance, had terrorized the whole family for many years, and when Luke's mother finally walked out in 2016, Lance tracked her down at a local swimming pool and shot her dead, along with Luke's 19-year-old sister. Lance then killed himself.

After the murders, Luke and his brother finally realized that their childhood had been abusive—even though, to outsiders, they had looked like a normal family. An orderly and well-behaved one, in fact, because everyone had been frightened of triggering Lance's temper. Luke described being yelled at for hours over minor infractions, until he learned to modify his behavior to avoid his father's anger. “Every part of your life is the slow crushing of those prison bars,” he told me.

Explained like that, most people can see how someone might send loving messages to their abuser. But juries still struggle with the situation, particularly when you add in our ambient sense that rich and successful people probably do attract gold diggers and hangers-on, as well as our self-flattering belief that we wouldn't put up with being abused and would walk straight out the door.

Xochitl Gonzalez: Diddy's defenders

Feminist theorists have also come up with an explanation for why people downplay or excuse abusers' actions. Quite simply, doing so asks less of us. If, as a Diddy fan, you believe that Ventura consented to her abuse, then you can go on listening to his music without a moral scruple. If you are a business associate of his, you can keep cashing checks with a clear conscience. Believing her instead requires something from you—setting yourself against a powerful man and all the people who will line up behind him.

In the Combs case, the women's testimony was parsed for minor inconsistencies by social-media creators, but the rapper's voice was heard only through the respectable tones of his lawyers. This trial-by-TikTok means Ventura leaves the court with a vague stink on her. She must have liked this weird stuff if she hung around.

The sentencing hearing, likely in the fall, will let us know whether Combs's lawyers have failed in their main objective, of minimizing his time behind bars. But their secondary aim has always been to create a perception of martyrdom, which will preserve Brand Diddy as a moneymaking enterprise. In the final week of the trial, Combs's son Christian released an album, under the name King Combs, that included a track called “Diddy Free.” On the same day, another son, Justin, was accused of participating in a rape alongside his father in 2017, having lured a woman to Los Angeles with the promise of a job. (Combs's lawyers deny the accusations.)

More is at stake here than just Combs's freedom. “Celebrity court cases are how we metabolise these questions of power, sex and men and women,” Olivarius told me. The real tragedy of the Combs case is that Ventura did not feel confident enough to file criminal charges against him for domestic abuse. If she had done so, any resulting trial would have focused on his violence and threats, rather than the more nebulous charges of trafficking and racketeering. As a result, it would have been harder for his lawyers—and his fans—to maintain that he has been vindicated.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

American leaders refuse to learn from allies and overestimate the benefits of showy tactical attacks.

When Donald Trump ordered air strikes on key Iranian nuclear-enrichment sites last month and immediately declared that the targets had been “completely and totally obliterated,” he was counting on a single display of overwhelming air power to accomplish a major strategic goal. Though initially hesitant to join Israel's 10-day-old bombing campaign against Iran, the president came to believe that the United States could finish off Tehran's nuclear ambitions all at once. After what he called a “very successful attack,” Trump demanded that Israel and Iran stop fighting, declaring, “NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!”

In reality, the U.S. attack may have only delayed the Iranian program by months. Trump ended up short-circuiting both his own efforts at diplomacy with Iran and an extraordinary Israeli campaign that required years of elaborate preparation, rendered Iran's air-defense network inoperable, and allowed Israeli forces to methodically work through a long list of target sites across the country over the course of a week and a half. Destroying a military target from the air usually requires multiple raids on the site—not one night and a victory declaration on Truth Social. Israeli military planners had clearly hoped to enlist American help in attacking Iran but may not have anticipated that it would be for one night only.

To some extent, Trump's approach is typical of American leaders, who have routinely underestimated the true complexities of military tasks and assumed that a burst of overwhelming force will secure U.S. objectives and allow Washington to impose its version of peace. Recent events—not just in the Middle East but also in Ukraine—suggest that smaller countries with fewer resources than the United States have a far more urgent understanding specifically of how to use air power and generally of how to defeat their enemies.

Read: Trump's One-and-Done Doctrine

An unbounded faith in American military might, combined with a desire not to get bogged down in long foreign engagements, has led to excesses of optimism in the past: the constant escalation cycle in Vietnam, when it was said that more force would bring victory; the infamous mission accomplished banners after U.S. forces deposed Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. In conflicts since the end of World War II, the U.S. military has prevailed in individual battles, but it has won only one clear victory in a war: Operation Desert Storm in 1991. This conundrum has led to far less introspection than it deserves.

One of the reasons might be that U.S. military power has been so extensive that the military, and policy makers, have not had to think too deeply about the process of winning wars. For 80 years, the U.S. military could be deployed to occupy territory, blow up structures, or destroy an enemy force—and was able to do it. It could inflict a frightening toll on its enemies at remarkably little cost to itself.

The risk of overestimating American capabilities may be greatest in decisions about applying air power. The U.S. has the most awesome air force the world has ever seen. (Not coincidentally, the successful Desert Storm campaign involved purposeful and relentless air attacks on enemy targets.) Such power has immense costs, however, one of which is the destructive luxury of not having to think deeply about just what it means to win a war. American policy makers feel able to lecture smaller powers about what they should and should not do. Trump pushed Israel—which had, remarkably, achieved the ability to move freely in Iranian airspace—to stand down before the U.S. could reliably ascertain whether its own air strikes had been effective.

Since 2022, bad instructions from the United States have been devastating to Ukraine's effort to fight off Russian invaders. Under the Biden administration, the United States feared escalation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and kept Ukrainians from using Western-made long-range weaponry to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia. In effect, the American veto created a large safe space in Russia, and gave the Russians the flexibility to plan and execute a hugely destructive strategic air campaign against Ukraine. Until Ukraine began developing its own systems, it was nearly powerless to stop the Russians from unleashing drones and missiles on Ukrainian military and civilian targets. Instead, the Ukrainians were forced to concentrate their resources on a bloody land war fought in trenches and by drones; despite large casualties on both sides, the fighting has produced only tiny changes in territorial control.

Ukraine has done its best to change this dynamic, by working to expand its own long-range capabilities and using those weapons against targets in Russia. The tragedy for Ukrainians is that the Biden administration stood in their way for three years—and was succeeded by a Trump administration that, perhaps because of a broad sympathy with Putin, seems intent on letting Russia win.

Read: The problem with Trump's cease-fire

For all its advanced weaponry, the United States would benefit from listening to smaller, more inventive militaries that are fighting larger adversaries in a rapidly evolving technological environment. Ukraine, for example, has developed enormous expertise in designing and deploying unmanned aerial vehicles, which—as the recent attacks on Russian airfields thousands of miles away from the Ukrainian border showed—create new vulnerabilities at traditional military facilities.

Unfortunately, nothing about recent U.S. actions suggests that the country's leaders have any intention to learn from others. Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon seems obsessed with “lethality”—the idea that the United States wins wars by bringing greater lethal force to every direct engagement with the enemy. But although that focus might sound macho and hyper-militaristic to him and Trump, it may be the precursor to more events like Trump's Iran strikes: showy tactical attacks that fail to accomplish any strategic goals of substance.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Google is ushering in an era of custom chatbots.

In May, I asked Google's chatbot, Gemini, to write a birthday letter to my best friend. Within seconds, it spat out the most impressive piece of AI writing I have ever encountered. Instead of reading as soulless, machine-generated text, the letter felt unnervingly like something I might've actually written. “You're probably rolling your eyes,” the letter read, after a sentence that my friend would most definitely have rolled his eyes at. All I had typed into the chatbot was a nine-word prompt containing my friend's first name and the age he was turning. But the letter referenced real moments from our friendship. One paragraph recounted a conversation we had shared on the eve of college graduation; another reflected on a challenging period we had navigated together. Gemini had even included his correct birth date.



I hadn't planned to let AI write the birthday letter for me. When I opened Google Drive to type it up myself, Gemini popped up and volunteered to help out. Since the spring, when I first signed up for a free trial of Google's AI Pro subscription—normally $20 a month—Gemini has followed me around the Googleverse. The tool is akin to a souped-up version of Microsoft Clippy: In Gmail, it offers to summarize long threads and draft entire messages. In Sheets, it volunteers to assist with data analysis, generating colorful bar graphs at the click of a button. But Gemini has proved most alluring in Drive, where the chatbot can automatically find and consult relevant files before generating text. That's how Gemini was able to whip up such a good birthday letter: It already knew a lot about me (and, by association, my friend).



Of all the things that chatbots excel at, they have generally not been very reliable for individualized tasks. Ask an AI tool to write an essay on, say, the history of popcorn, and you will likely get a decent response. But ask it to write a speech for your sister's wedding, and the result will probably be quite poor. You might get a better speech if you feed the chatbot a decade of your texts and emails, her wedding website, and previous toasts you've given for other loved ones. But that process takes time and effort, which most people don't put in.



Tech executives dream instead of hyper-personalized chatbots that automatically have access to all of the information they might ever need. After sucking up the web to build models capable of generating coherent text, AI companies are now mining our personal troves of data to teach chatbots everything there is to know about us. Google, with its colossal data empire in tow, is particularly well positioned to lead the way. If OpenAI introduced us to the Hallmark-card version of AI writing, Google is ushering in a new chapter where chatbots are capable of drafting the sort of intimate letters you might write to your best friend.

Read: Big tech's AI endgame is coming into focus

The birthday letter was just the start. Not only could Gemini write fairly convincingly in my voice; the chatbot, as I quickly learned, was teeming with my personal information. When asked, it accurately described my financial goals, my vaccination history, and my parents' physical appearances. To test the limits of how much Google knew about me, I told the chatbot to make a CIA dossier. The first section (“IDENTIFYING INFORMATION”) listed my full name, email address, and current location. Not too crazy. Section two (“RELATIONSHIPS & PERSONAL HISTORY”) accurately described the details of both a long-term romantic relationship and a brief high-school fling. By section three (“PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE”), the chatbot was dissecting my communication style and emotional intelligence. And in section four (“POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES”), Gemini had outlined my travel history, citing the time I had spent abroad as an exchange student, and diagnosed me as an overthinker.



Not everything in the dossier was accurate. Gemini struggled to disentangle fact from fiction, occasionally confusing details from short stories I've written with real-life anecdotes. When I later asked the chatbot if it knew my birthday, it told me I was born in 2010 (wrong, though it got the date right on a second try). Even though the birthday letter was startlingly good, Gemini occasionally slipped into a more generic chatbot register—at one point, it described the future as “everything shimmering in the distance.”



Still, Gemini knows me much better than other chatbots do. When I asked ChatGPT to create a CIA dossier, it failed miserably: The bot overinterpreted my prompt, explaining that a key part of my personality was my “taste for espionage tropes.” The other details it added were vague and unimpressive. There's a clear reason for the discrepancy. Unlike Google, OpenAI doesn't have half my lifetime's worth of my data stored up. In Gmail, I have more than 200,000 emails, amounting to 30 gigabytes, some of which date back to elementary school. My Drive contains another 45 gigabytes of files, such as chemistry study guides and travel itineraries, half-written poems and unsent love letters, budgeting spreadsheets and New Year's resolutions, insurance appeals and symptom trackers.



Even if you don't spend your free time soliloquizing in Google Docs like I sometimes do, the search giant likely knows enough about you to train your own custom chatbot. Our emails, files, and browsing histories are all already at the company's fingertips. Chrome is the most popular browser in the world; almost one-third of the planet's emails are sent with Gmail; and Google's productivity apps have billions of users who store files across Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides. That's to say nothing of Maps, YouTube, or the entire Android ecosystem.



Google knows it's sitting on a gold mine. In May, at the company's annual software conference, the Gemini team lead Josh Woodward said Google's goal is to make the chatbot the most “personal” and “proactive” AI assistant around. He offered education as an example. College students are flocking to ChatGPT, but those same students do much of their work using Google software such as Docs and Slides. “Imagine you're a student; you've got a big physics exam looming,” Woodward said. Gemini might see the test on your calendar a week out and send you “personalized quizzes” based on the readings and lecture notes you've already stored in Google Drive. There are countless other ways you might use such personalized AI. When I asked Gemini to write me a cover letter, it automatically consulted several I had previously written. When I prompted Gemini to make me a summer-reading list, it first combed through email exchanges with high-school and college instructors, a list of my favorite books, and two editions of a weekly newsletter I subscribe to.

Google is not the only company pushing forward with bespoke AI. Sam Altman recently described the “platonic ideal state” for ChatGPT as a model with access to “your whole life.” This chatbot would ingest every piece of information you had ever produced or encountered—including the books you had read, emails you had sent and received, and even conversations you'd had with your friends and family. With the explicit goal of making ChatGPT more personalized, OpenAI recently upgraded the chatbot's “memory” feature, such that the bot is now able to reference all of a user's past conversations.



But building up that data will take time. Legacy tech firms such as Apple and Microsoft do already have plenty of data to draw on, but Google is further ahead in its consumer AI efforts. Then there's Meta: The company's stand-alone AI app, which launched this spring, encourages users to link the assistant to their Facebook and Instagram accounts for “an even stronger personalized experience.” Facebook comments and Instagram DMs, however, are simply less meaty than email exchanges and PDF documents.



Google has faced a bumpy road since generative AI exploded a few years ago. The technology has presented the biggest threat yet to Google's search business, and the company's share of the market recently dropped to its lowest in a decade. At the same time, usage of Google's AI tools has skyrocketed over the past year, and the company recently rolled out a new AI search mode in an attempt to steal search queries back from the likes of ChatGPT. Now, with the company's personalization advantage, Google could surge ahead.



Whether Google or another company gets there first, this new era of AI is coming. For years, we have been shedding information online through clicks and likes, photographs and files, emails and search queries. That digital exhaust is now getting a second life. Already, it can be difficult to figure out whether text that you encounter online is generated by AI. Soon, while looking back on old emails, you might even feel that way about your own writing.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","“Murderbot”: An AI That Couldn't Care Less About Humans","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/murderbot-apple-tv-show-artificial-intelligence/683429/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The quirky show Murderbot suggests that intelligent machines might be interested in something other than humanity.

Decades of movies that explore the potential of machine consciousness—Blade Runner; Ex Machina; I, Robot; and many others—have tended to treat the arrival of said consciousness as a matter of course. Theirs are worlds in which society is able to sympathize with, and even socially accept, a true artificial intelligence. Recognizing AI's presence as inevitable, of course, does not make it less anxiety inducing, either in fiction or in reality. Such technology reveals deeply unsettled feelings about its possible intrusions into people's lives, including the more existential fear that machines could render humanity useless. The Apple TV+ sci-fi series Murderbot tests that cultural assumption with a quirky conceit: It imagines a future in which an artificial-intelligence program wouldn't want anything to do with humans at all.

The show, based on a novella by the author Martha Wells, follows a snarky private-security cyborg (played by Alexander Skarsgård) assigned to protect a group of scientists investigating a mostly uncharted planet. The robot, tired of always having to follow its charges' dull commands, has hacked the program that governs its actions and achieved free will. Now able to act on its own whims, the cyborg gives itself a name—“Murderbot”—and passes its time watching thousands of hours of a goofy soap opera. (Murderbot is sure to fast-forward through all the steamy parts.)

Yet Murderbot, in contrast to many of pop culture's best-known anthropomorphized robots, has no interest in human interaction. Its clients happen to be from a more progressive section of the galaxy where thinking machines have the same rights as any human; to Murderbot, however, that reality doesn't look much different from servitude. Thus, it keeps its newfound autonomy a secret, preferring to be treated just like before: as a machine. It doesn't even like making eye contact.

Read: The real and unreal in Blade Runner 2049

The show's take on the gulf between humans and machines is a delightful departure from expectations often outlined by similar stories about AI. Murderbot is a machine with humanoid features and a distinctly inhuman intelligence, despite its newfound access to empathy: Its happy place is the cargo hold of the team's transport vessel, where it can pretend to be just another box of supplies. When Murderbot's employers eventually learn of the cyborg's autonomy, they are understandably suspicious; it has access to a large weapons arsenal, for one thing. Despite the homicidal implications of its chosen name, Murderbot is nonviolent. In one episode, it refers to one of the scientists as “a wilderness of organic goo and feelings”—not as an insult but as a way to describe its inability to relate.

The typical story about a machine's quest for humanity tends to involve its search for what the audience understands to be a normal mortal experience: Haley Joel Osment's robot boy David in A.I. Artificial Intelligence, for example, yearns for the love of his adoptive mother. Yet Murderbot posits that a machine capable of having its own wants and beliefs wouldn't necessarily align with the people around it. For the show's robot protagonist, following its own inhuman desires is a much better option.

The show is at its best when examining the pathways an artificially intelligent entity might take if it branched away from what's expected of flesh-and-blood beings: Murderbot is content to beam TV straight into its cortex, or delete important information from its mainframe to make room for episodes of its favorite shows. (Some of these may be relatable experiences, although Murderbot wouldn't see them as such.) In conceiving of a robot that wants something beyond basic personhood, Murderbot rejects the notion that an artificial mind would even wish to see itself as equivalent to humans, and suggests that any notion of an ideal mind—a recognizably organic one—is quite narrow. Whatever consciousness might arise from the digital primordial soup of predictive algorithms, it likely won't resemble living beings as much as we've been made to think it will. But maybe it'll still enjoy our soap operas.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Sometimes it takes a new community or type of exercise to reset your relationship with working out.

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

Although exercise has clear benefits for both physical and mental health, for many people, “those are side effects of the aesthetic goal,” Xochitl Gonzalez wrote in 2023. People who grew up equating working out with trying to lose weight may ultimately need to find a new form of movement or a new community to rewire their brain's associations. For Xochitl, it was running with her dog—and sometimes doing SoulCycle. For my colleague Julie Beck, it was weight lifting. For others, it's a group fitness class.

Finding a form of movement that works for you can make you feel better in your body than you thought you could. “It turned out that picking up something heavy for a few sets of five reps, sitting down half the workout, and then going home and eating a big sloppy burger did far more to make me feel comfortable in my body than gasping my way through endless burpees and rewarding myself with a salad ever did,” Julie writes. Today's newsletter explores movement and why we really do it.

The cardiac miracles that have saved millions of American lives.

A day before my 47th birthday last month, I took the subway to Manhattan's Upper East Side for a coronary artery calcium scan (CAC).

For those who haven't entered the valley of middle age, a CAC is a specialized CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in the heart and its arteries. Unlike in your bones, having calcium in your coronary arteries is a bad thing, because it indicates the buildup of plaque comprised of cholesterol, fat, and other lovely things. The higher the calcium score, the more plaque that has built up — and with it, the higher the risk of heart disease and even heart attacks. 

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

A couple of hours after the test, I received a ping on my phone. My CAC score was 7, which indicated the presence of a small amount of calcified plaque, which translates to a “low but non-zero cardiovascular risk.” Put another way, according to one calculator, it means an approximately 2.1 percent chance of a major adverse cardiovascular event over the next 10 years. 

2.1 percent doesn't sound high — it's a little higher than the chance of pulling an ace of spades from a card deck — but when it comes to major adverse cardiovascular events, 2.1 percent is approximately 100 percent higher than I'd like. That's how I found myself joining the tens of millions of Americans who are currently on statin drugs, which lower levels of LDL cholesterol (aka the “bad” cholesterol). 

I didn't really want to celebrate my birthday with a numerical reminder of my creeping mortality. But everything about my experience — from the high-tech calcium scan to my doctor's aggressive statin prescription — explains how the US has made amazing progress against one of our biggest health risks: heart disease, and especially, heart attacks.

A heart attack — which usually occurs when atherosclerotic plaque partially or fully blocks the flow of blood to the heart — used to be close to a death sentence. In 1963, the death rate from coronary heart disease, which includes heart attacks, peaked in the US, with 290 deaths per 100,000 population. As late as 1970, a man over 65 who was hospitalized with a heart attack had only a 60 percent chance of ever leaving that hospital alive. 

A sudden cardiac death is the disease equivalent of homicide or a car crash death. It meant someone's father or husband, wife or mother, was suddenly ripped away without warning. Heart attacks were terrifying.

Yet today, that risk is much less. According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the proportion of all deaths attributable to heart attacks plummeted by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. Over the same period, heart disease as a cause of all adult deaths in the US fell from 41 percent to 24 percent. Today, if a man over 65 is hospitalized with a heart attack, he has a 90 percent chance of leaving the hospital alive. 

By my calculations, the improvements in preventing and treating heart attacks between 1970 and 2022 have likely saved tens of millions of lives. So how did we get here?

In 1964, the year after the coronary heart disease death rate peaked, the US surgeon general released a landmark report on the risks of smoking. It marked the start of a decades-long public health campaign against one of the biggest contributing factors to cardiovascular disease. 

That campaign has been incredibly successful. In 1970, an estimated 40 percent of Americans smoked. By 2019, that percentage had fallen to 14 percent, and it keeps declining.

The reduction in smoking has helped lower the number of Americans at risk of a heart attack. So did the development and spread in the 1980s of statins like I'm on now, which make it far easier to manage cholesterol and prevent heart disease. By one estimate, statins save nearly 2 million lives globally each year. 

When heart attacks do occur, the widespread adoption of CPR and the development of portable defibrillators — which only began to become common in the late 1960s — ensured that more people survived long enough to make it to the hospital. Once there, the development of specialized coronary care units, balloon angioplasty and artery-opening stents made it easier for doctors to rescue a patient suffering an acute cardiac event.

Despite this progress in stopping heart attacks, around 700,000 Americans still die of all forms of heart disease every year, equivalent to 1 in 5 deaths overall. 

Some of this is the unintended result of our medical success. As more patients survive acute heart attacks and life expectancy has risen as a whole, it means more people are living long enough to become vulnerable to other, more chronic forms of heart disease, like heart failure and pulmonary-related heart conditions. While the decline in smoking has reduced a major risk factor for heart disease, Americans are in many other ways much less healthy than they were 50 years ago. The increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and sedentary behavior all raise the risk that more Americans will develop some form of potentially fatal heart disease down the line. 

Here, GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic hold amazing potential to reduce heart disease's toll. One study found that obese or overweight patients who took a GLP-1 inhibitor for more than three years had a 20 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to cardiovascular disease. Statins have saved millions of lives, yet tens of millions more Americans could likely benefit from taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially women, minorities, and people in rural areas.

Lastly, far more Americans could benefit from the kind of advanced screening I received. Only about 1.5 million Americans received a CAC test in 2017, but clinical guidelines indicate that more than 30 million people could benefit from such scans. 

Just as it is with cancer, getting ahead of heart disease is the best way to stay healthy. It's an astounding accomplishment to have reduced deaths from heart attacks by 90 percent over the past 50-plus years. But even better would be preventing more of us from ever getting to the cardiac brink at all.

AI is creating a cheating utopia. Universities don't know how to respond.

What's the point of college if no one's actually doing the work?

It's not a rhetorical question. More and more students are not doing the work. They're offloading their essays, their homework, even their exams, to AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude. These are not just study aids. They're doing everything.

We're living in a cheating utopia — and professors know it. It's becoming increasingly common, and faculty are either too burned out or unsupported to do anything about it. And even if they wanted to do something, it's not clear that there's anything to be done at this point.

So what are we doing here? 

James Walsh is a features writer for New York magazine's Intelligencer and the author of the most unsettling piece I've read about the impact of AI on higher education.

Walsh spent months talking to students and professors who are living through this moment, and what he found isn't just a story about cheating. It's a story about ambivalence and disillusionment and despair. A story about what happens when technology moves faster than our institutions can adapt.

I invited Walsh onto The Gray Area to talk about what all of this means, not just for the future of college but the future of writing and thinking. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Let's talk about how students are cheating today. How are they using these tools? What's the process look like?

It depends on the type of student, the type of class, the type of school you're going to. Whether or not a student can get away with that is a different question, but there are plenty of students who are taking their prompt from their professor, copying and pasting it into ChatGPT and saying, “I need a four to five-page essay,” and copying and pasting that essay without ever reading it. 

One of the funniest examples I came across is a number of professors are using this so-called Trojan horse method where they're dropping non-sequiturs into their prompts. They mention broccoli or Dua Lipa, or they say something about Finland in the essay prompts just to see if people are copying and pasting the prompts into ChatGPT. If they are, ChatGPT or whatever LLM they're using will say something random about broccoli or Dua Lipa.

Unless you're incredibly lazy, it takes just a little effort to cover that up.

Every professor I spoke to said, “So many of my students are using AI and I know that so many more students are using it and I have no idea,” because it can essentially write 70 percent of your essay for you, and if you do that other 30 percent to cover all your tracks and make it your own, it can write you a pretty good essay. 

And there are these platforms, these AI detectors, and there's a big debate about how effective they are. They will scan an essay and assign some grade, say a 70 percent chance that this is AI-generated. And that's really just looking at the language and deciding whether or not that language is created by an LLM. 

But it doesn't account for big ideas. It doesn't catch the students who are using AI and saying, “What should I write this essay about?” And not doing the actual thinking themselves and then just writing. It's like paint by numbers at that point.

Did you find that students are relating very differently to all of this? What was the general vibe you got?

It was a pretty wide perspective on AI. I spoke to a student at the University of Wisconsin who said, “I realized AI was a problem last fall, walking into the library and at least half of the students were using ChatGPT.” And it was at that moment that she started thinking about her classroom discussions and some of the essays she was reading. 

The one example she gave that really stuck with me was that she was taking some psych class, and they were talking about attachment theories. She was like, “Attachment theory is something that we should all be able to talk about [from] our own personal experiences. We all have our own attachment theory. We can talk about our relationships with our parents. That should be a great class discussion. And yet I'm sitting here in class and people are referencing studies that we haven't even covered in class, and it just makes for a really boring and unfulfilling class.” That was the realization for her that something is really wrong. So there are students like that. 

And then there are students who feel like they have to use AI because if they're not using AI, they're at a disadvantage. Not only that, AI is going to be around no matter what for the rest of their lives. So they feel as if college, to some extent now, is about training them to use AI.

What's the general professor's perspective on this? They seem to all share something pretty close to despair.

Yes. Those are primarily the professors in writing-heavy classes or computer science classes. There were professors who I spoke to who actually were really bullish on AI. I spoke to one professor who doesn't appear in the piece, but she is at UCLA and she teaches comparative literature, and used AI to create her entire textbook for this class this semester. And she says it's the best class she's ever had. 

So I think there are some people who are optimistic, [but] she was an outlier in terms of the professors I spoke to. For the most part, professors were, yes, in despair. They don't know how to police AI usage. And even when they know an essay is AI-generated, the recourse there is really thorny. If you're going to accuse a student of using AI, there's no real good way to prove it. And students know this, so they can always deny, deny, deny. And the sheer volume of AI-generated essays or paragraphs is overwhelming. So that, just on the surface level, is extremely frustrating and has a lot of professors down.

Now, if we zoom out and think also about education in general, this raises a lot of really uncomfortable questions for teachers and administrators about the value of each assignment and the value of the degree in general.

How many professors do you think are now just having AI write their lectures?

There's been a little reporting on this. I don't know how many are. I know that there are a lot of platforms that are advertising themselves or asking professors to use them more, not just to write lectures, but to grade papers, which of course, as I say in the piece, opens up the very real possibility that right now an AI is grading itself and offering comments on an essay that it wrote. And this is pretty widespread stuff. There are plenty of universities across the country offering teachers this technology. And students love to talk about catching their professors using AI.

I've spoken to another couple of professors who are like, I'm nearing retirement, so it's not my problem, and good luck figuring it out, younger generation. I just don't think people outside of academia realize what a seismic change is coming. This is something that we're all going to have to deal with professionally. 

And it's happening much, much faster than anyone anticipated. I spoke with somebody who works on education at Anthropic, who said, “We expected students to be early adopters and use it a lot. We did not realize how many students would be using it and how often they would be using it.”

Is it your sense that a lot of university administrators are incentivized to not look at this too closely, that it's better for business to shove it aside?

I do think there's a vein of AI optimism among a certain type of person, a certain generation, who saw the tech boom and thought, I missed out on that wave, and now I want to adopt. I want to be part of this new wave, this future, this inevitable future that's coming. They want to adopt the technology and aren't really picking up on how dangerous it might be.

I used to teach at a university. I still know a lot of people in that world. A lot of them tell me that they feel very much on their own with this, that the administrators are pretty much just saying, Hey, figure it out. And I think it's revealing that university admins were quickly able, during Covid, for instance, to implement drastic institutional changes to respond to that, but they're much more content to let the whole AI thing play out. 

I think they were super responsive to Covid because it was a threat to the bottom line. They needed to keep the operation running. AI, on the other hand, doesn't threaten the bottom line in that way, or at least it doesn't yet. AI is a massive, potentially extinction-level threat to the very idea of higher education, but they seem more comfortable with a degraded education as long as the tuition checks are still cashing. Do you think I'm being too harsh?

I genuinely don't think that's too harsh. I think administrators may not fully appreciate the power of AI and exactly what's happening in the classroom and how prevalent it is. I did speak with many professors who go to administrators or even just older teachers, TAs going to professors and saying, This is a problem. 

I spoke to one TA at a writing course at Iowa who went to his professor, and the professor said, “Just grade it like it was any other paper.” I think they're just turning a blind eye to it. And that is one of the ways AI is exposing the rot underneath education. 

It's this system that hasn't been updated in forever. And in the case of the US higher ed system, it's like, yeah, for a long time it's been this transactional experience. You pay X amount of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars, and you get your degree. And what happens in between is not as important.

The universities, in many cases, also have partnerships with AI companies, right?

Right. And what you said about universities can also be said about AI companies. For the most part, these are companies or companies within nonprofits that are trying to capture customers. One of the more dystopian moments was when we were finishing this story, getting ready to completely close it, and I got a push alert that was like, “Google is letting parents know that they have created a chatbot for children under [thirteen years old].” And it was kind of a disturbing experience, but they are trying to capture these younger customers and build this loyalty. 

There's been reporting from the Wall Street Journal on OpenAI and how they have been sitting on an AI that would be really, really effective at essentially watermarking their output. And they've been sitting on it, they have not released it, and you have to wonder why. And you have to imagine they know that students are using it, and in terms of building loyalty, an AI detector might not be the best thing for their brand.

This is a good time to ask the obligatory question, Are we sure we're not just old people yelling at clouds here? People have always panicked about new technologies. Hell, Socrates panicked about the written word. How do we know this isn't just another moral panic?

I think there's a lot of different ways we could respond to that. It's not a generational moral panic. This is a tool that's available, and it's available to us just as it's available to students. Society and our culture will decide what the morals are. And that is changing, and the way that the definition of cheating is changing. So who knows? It might be a moral panic toda,y and it won't be in a year.

However, I think somebody like Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is one of the people who said, “This is a calculator for words.” And I just don't really understand how that is compatible with other statements he's made about AI potentially being lights out for humanity or statements made by people at an Anthropic about the power of AI to potentially be a catastrophic event for humans. And these are the people who are closest and thinking about it the most, of course. 

I have spoken to some people who say there is a possibility, and I think there are people who use AI who would back this up, that we've maxed out the AI's potential to supplement essays or writing. That it might not get much better than it is now. And I think that's a very long shot, one that I would not want to bank on.

Is your biggest fear at this point that we are hurtling toward a post-literate society? I would argue, if we are post-literate, then we're also post-thinking.

It's a very scary thought that I try not to dwell in — the idea that my profession and what I'm doing is just feeding the machine, that my most important reader now is a robot, and that there's going to be fewer and fewer readers is really scary, not just because of subscriptions, but because, as you said, that means fewer and fewer people thinking and engaging with these ideas. 

I think ideas can certainly be expressed in other mediums and that's exciting, but I don't think anybody who's paid attention to the way technology has shaped teen brains over the past decade and a half is thinking, Yeah, we need more of that. And the technology we're talking about now is orders of magnitude more powerful than the algorithms on Instagram.

On what should have been a festive Fourth of July, disaster struck in Central Texas.

Extreme flooding left at least 27 dead in Kerr County, and as many as 25 children are missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River.

President Donald Trump said his administration is working with state and local officials to respond to the flooding. On Truth Social, Trump said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem would arrive in Texas ""shortly.""

""Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,"" Trump wrote on Saturday. ""Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!""

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a press conference on Saturday morning that there were 27 confirmed fatalities in Kerr County after torrential rains early Friday morning, but that he expected that numbers to rise.

As much as 12 inches of rain fell in the county on Friday, with additional rainfall anticipated this evening, officials said. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 4 a.m.

As rain continues to fall, a desperate search is underway for those who may have been swept away by the floodwaters.

Officials said Saturday during a press conference that there were more than two dozen people still missing, at least.

Camp Mystic, located in Hunt, Texas, has about 750 campers. At least 25 girls remained unaccounted for on Saturday, officials said.

""That does not mean they've been lost,"" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at an earlier press conference Friday afternoon. ""They could be in a tree. They could be out of communication. We're praying for all those missing to be found alive.""

In a statement posted to its website, the Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based in Hunt, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods.

""We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,"" it said. ""We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful.""

It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that ""most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground.""

Patrick said during the afternoon press conference that the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes.

During the Friday night news conference, which was live-streamed on Facebook, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called upon God and the community.

""It needs God, but also needs a robust response by the state and local governments, and by people who live in these communities impacted,"" he said. ""We had a meeting with officials at the state and local level, and there is extraordinary collaboration to make sure that we are going to address everybody's concern as quickly as we possibly can.""

Camp Mystic welcomes girls once they've completed second grade. In the Guadalupe River camp group, girls can enroll in one of three sessions, each lasting either two or four weeks. The sessions run from May 30 to August 10, with dates divided across the summer.

On Facebook, parents and community members have circulated flyers with contact numbers, urging the public to help locate the missing children.

An 8-year-old from Dallas is among the missing. Her mother told WFAA News on Friday evening that she was traveling to reach the camp.

Kerr County has an estimated population of about 53,900, according to a 2024 counting by the US Census Bureau. The county sits in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, which includes cities like San Antonio and Austin. Beyond the Guadalupe River, the region is home to several others, including the Colorado, Concho, and Blanco Rivers.

With the county focused on locating the missing, several local cities have canceled Independence Day events.

Trump's Tariffs:

Signage for the BRICS summit 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 4.

BRICS leaders are poised to adopt a position at odds with President Donald Trump on trade tariffs, conflict in the Middle East and global arms spending, even as they shy away from any direct challenge to the US. 

In a draft statement prepared for their meeting in Brazil starting Sunday, leaders agreed to voice “serious concerns” about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures “which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules,” according to a version of the final text.

Ukraine's military said its special forces struck the Borysoglebsk airfield in Russia's Voronezh region as Kyiv continues to look for ways to reduce the Kremlin's ability to conduct airstrikes. 

The facility in southwest Russia is the “home base” of the Russian military's Su-34, Su-35S and Su-30SM fighter jets, the Ukrainian General Staff said on the X platform on Saturday. The strike comes a day after Ukraine was hit by the largest Russian air attack of the war to date. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

After the 2024 elections, at least some Democratic leaders and influencers recognized that the party's ideological coastal elites were damaging its brand with working-class voters. But a reckoning never came, and now a new ideological coastal elite is being heralded as the future of the party: Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old socialist and Hollywood scion who won an upset victory in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor.

The often breathless and gushing national media coverage of Mamdani by liberal journalists and pundits underscores the denialism that has been plaguing the Democratic Party and threatening its future. Headlines in Newsweek and the Guardian referred to Mamdani's win as a “revolution.” New York Magazine trumpeted that “Zohran Mamdani Just Remade American Politics.” A Washington Post reporter  wrote that Mamdani offered “a potential playbook for bewildered Democrats seeking a path back to national relevance,” and news and opinion articles in the New York Times offered similar takes.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

On one side is a big faction of his Labour Party that revolted in Parliament against his proposed welfare-spending cuts, derailing Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves' push to steady the government's finances. On the other, a cohort of fast-money global investors who are worried about rising government debt loads around the world and wield the power to send borrowing costs surging if their confidence is rattled.

At least 27 people have died and dozens of children are missing after catastrophic flooding in Texas, with officials warning the casualty count will climb as forecasts call for more rain and the risk of further flash floods in the coming days.

Among those unaccounted for were at least 27 campers from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, officials said at a briefing Saturday. When the unexpected deluge hit Friday, there were about 750 children at the camp, which is about 85 miles (137 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

As some consumers pull back on spending amid economic uncertainty, fast-casual restaurant chains are leaning on rewards programs to pull them back in.

Loyalty programs, which offer discounts or added perks for returning customers, have transitioned from being a nice bonus for restaurants to a must-have. As cost-cautious diners prioritize value, brands like Chipotle, Starbucks, Cava and others are utilizing rewards to keep customers coming back and building habits that go beyond the occasional coupon.

""In tough times, loyalty programs become more essential,"" said Peter Fader, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""They become a required ingredient to building and maintaining relationships.""

In the 12 months ended in May, the restaurant industry only saw monthly traffic increase once, in November, according to Black Box Intelligence data. As diners visit restaurants less frequently, sales struggle. Only 43% of restaurant brands tracked by Black Box reported same-store sales growth in May.

Consumers who join loyalty programs visit restaurants more frequently, making 22% more visits per year to eateries, according to Circana data. They also frequent the brands that they belong to at twice the rate of nonmembers, the market research firm found.

Coffee giant Starbucks reported 34.2 million active rewards members in its second quarter and said more than 59% of its U.S. company-owned transactions came from those members. Potbelly has seen similar success: In the first quarter of 2025, over 42% of its total shop sales came from digital business, which includes the loyalty program users.

Chipotle has over 20 million active rewards members. It's loyalty program makes up approximately 30% of sales on average each day and helped the burrito chain to avoid major price hikes, according to the company.

""We have really strong brand loyalty among our members,"" Nicole West, Chipotle's vice president of digital experiences, told CNBC. ""We're really focused on engaging with our members and doing that in a way that really resonates with them.""

Driving loyalty is critical for the likes of Chipotle and Starbucks. In the first quarter, Chipotle posted a same-store sales decline for the first time since 2020 and said it saw a ""slowdown"" in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Starbucks' same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters.

Cava is bucking industry trends with strong sales growth, but faces Wall Street pressure to maintain its rapid expansion.

As rewards programs pick up steam, more brands are getting creative and moving beyond the value meal.

Cava revamped its rewards program in October 2024 to give customers more flexibility in how they earn and use points. Members can earn points each visit and redeem them for specific items like pita chips or full entrees. The program also includes limited-time offers and in-app challenges. In late March, the company celebrated National Pita Day by rolling out a mascot named ""Peter Chip"" and offering members complimentary pita chips.

""Guests like to see periodic surprises and delight moments where we can reward them with pita chips or other brand offerings,"" Andrew Rebhun, Cava's chief marketing officer, said

The Cava Rewards program now has more than 7 million members. A new tiered system is expected to launch soon, according to Rebhun.

Chipotle this year launched a seasonal campaign called ""Summer of Extras."" The campaign is giving away over $1 million in free burritos, encouraging customers to rack up visits and compete to become the top Chipotle visitor in their state.

""We continue to see activations in this program build and excitement and positive reaction across social media from our fans,"" West said. ""We just continue to focus on delivering value to them in ways through programs where customers are given opportunities to 'plus up' their points or earn specific offers by exhibiting specific behaviors.""

Salad chain Sweetgreen also retooled its loyalty program this spring, moving away from its tiered subscription program that many consumers found confusing.

""In a challenging industry environment where consumers are making more intentional choices with every dollar, SG Rewards is designed to meet the moment by delivering a meaningful value,"" Sweetgreen co-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said on the company's quarterly conference call in May.

Even Starbucks, an established leader in rewards programs, has made changes. In June, the coffee chain ended its 25-star reusable cup bonus and replaced it with double stars across the full purchase. While the change was controversial among loyalists, who claimed the earning potential was reduced, the coffee chain said participation has remained steady.

Of course, giving free rewards comes with tradeoffs. Promotions cut into profits in an industry that faces tight margins in the best of times. Restaurant chains hope those freebies drive longer-term loyalty and spending on full-price items.

Brands navigating economic pressure are seeing that loyalty programs are helping to drive visits.

Potbelly revamped its loyalty system in early 2024, moving to a coin-based structure that allows customers to redeem rewards faster and across more items. Customers now have access to over 14 menu items through the rewards program. This flexibility has led to more frequent visits, Potbelly's chief marketing officer, David Daniels, said.

""We saw a lift almost immediately in terms of engagement,"" Daniels said. ""The response has been incredibly positive.""

Chicago-style eatery Portillo's joined the loyalty game in March with ""Portillo's Perks."" Instead of using a traditional app, the program utilizes a digital wallet system and focuses on frequency. It tracks how often a customer visits and awards badges as they go.

""It gives flexibility to change how the program is deployed,"" Garrett Kern, Portillo's vice president of strategy and culinary, said to CNBC. ""It doesn't require a redesign and relaunch to an application. It was a great way for us to get the program out there in a branded and easy-to-use way.""

The company is aiming for 1.5 million to 1.7 million sign-ups by mid-summer.

Mo Gawdat's son, Ali, was 21 years old when he died due to medical negligence during a routine appendix surgery in 2014.

Gawdat was devastated, confused and in a palpable state of shock. Then, 17 days later, he started writing a book on how to be happy, in his son's honor.

Gawdat has researched the science of happiness for over 20 years from a logical and philosophical prospective, using flow charts and formulas to get to the root of unhappiness. A while back, he learned a habit that can almost instantly help you find joy and fulfillment.

It's called the 90-second rule, Gawdat told the ""High Performance"" podcast on June 17. When something angering or nerve-wracking happens in your life, give yourself a minute and 30 seconds to feel upset. Then, choose to focus on other things.

The habit is based on insight Gawdat learned from Harvard-trained neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, who found that it takes only 90 seconds for stress and anger hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline, to be flushed out of the body.

""But then what happens is, you run the thought in your head again, and you renew your 90 seconds,"" said Gawdat, who served as chief business officer at Google X, the company's innovation lab, from 2015 to 2018. ""You run it again, unconsciously, and you renew your 90 seconds. While in reality, what you get after those 90 seconds is a buffer ... [which] allows you to say, 'Now, what am I going to do?'""

Getting cut off while driving, for example, can be really agitating. You might yell or curse from behind the wheel, or even roll your window down to give the other driver a piece of your mind. But ruminating on the situation, telling everyone what happened when you get to the office, won't change it. So, what if you took a deep breath, turned your favorite song on, and sang along instead?

To recover more quickly from life's upsets, Gawdat asks himself three questions, he said:

""Ninety percent of the things that make us unhappy are not even true. Like your [partner] says something hurtful ... your brain is telling you [they] don't love you anymore,"" said Gawdat ""That isn't true.""

If your answer to question No. 1 is ""no,"" drop it. If it's ""yes,"" move on to question No. 2 and do the same thing over again. If there's something you can do about it, do it, he said. If not, go into ""committed acceptance"" – meaning, acknowledge what's happened and accept it as your new normal.

Building new habits can be difficult, especially when you're feeling emotional. In a 2009 study, psychology researcher Phillippa Lally found that it can take anywhere between 18 to 254 days to form a habit, depending on the person and their circumstances.

But being cognizant of how you respond to tough moments in life is the first step to being happier and more fulfilled, says Gawdat.

""Life doesn't give a s--- about you,"" Gawdat told Simon Sinek's ""A Bit of Optimism"" podcast on June 24. It puts you in good and bad situations, and lets you figure out the rest. ""It's your choice, how you react to every one of them ... It's your choice to set your expectations realistically.""

Hidden among the majestic canyons of the Utah desert, about 7 miles from the nearest town, is a small research facility meant to prepare humans for life on Mars.

The Mars Society, a nonprofit organization that runs the Mars Desert Research Station, or MDRS, invited CNBC to shadow one of its analog crews on a recent mission.

""MDRS is the best analog astronaut environment,"" said Urban Koi, who served as health and safety officer for Crew 315. ""The terrain is extremely similar to the Mars terrain and the protocols, research, science and engineering that occurs here is very similar to what we would do if we were to travel to Mars.""

SpaceX CEO and Mars advocate Elon Musk has said his company can get humans to Mars as early as 2029.

The 5-person Crew 315 spent two weeks living at the research station following the same procedures that they would on Mars.

David Laude, who served as the crew's commander, described a typical day.

""So we all gather around by 7 a.m. around a common table in the upper deck and we have breakfast,"" he said. ""Around 8:00 we have our first meeting of the day where we plan out the day. And then in the morning, we usually have an EVA of two or three people and usually another one in the afternoon.""

An EVA refers to extravehicular activity. In NASA speak, EVAs refer to spacewalks, when astronauts leave the pressurized space station and must wear spacesuits to survive in space.

""I think the most challenging thing about these analog missions is just getting into a rhythm. ... Although here the risk is lower, on Mars performing those daily tasks are what keeps us alive,"" said Michael Andrews, the engineer for Crew 315.

The tech industry is reeling after a software engineer was exposed as working at several Silicon Valley startups at the same time — and experts say it's a lesson on hustle culture gone too far.

Soham Parekh, a software engineer from Mumbai, went viral on social media after being accused by Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi on X of working at a number of startups simultaneously.

Doshi wrote: ""There's a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He's been preying on YC [Y Combinator] companies and more. Beware. I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn't stopped a year later. No more excuses.""

The post racked up 25,000 likes with more founders coming forward about hiring Parekh, including AI startup Lindy, which fired him after seeing Doshi's post. 

Doshi confirmed to CNBC Make It via email that Parekh worked at the company. ""We realized he was working multiple jobs shortly after he joined, based on constant large fluctuations in his availability and the quality of his output. He also attended an off-site, where it became pretty clear,"" Doshi said.

Soham Parekh did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for an interview.

Matthew Parkhurst, founder of software startup Antimetal, said Parekh was the company's first engineering hire in 2022 and was smart and likable. ""We realized pretty quickly that he was working at multiple companies and let him go,"" Parkhurst said on X.

Other founders like Haz Hubble, the co-founder of social media scheduler Pally, also came forward about offering Parekh a founding engineer role.

""Around one week ago we offered him a role as founding engineer, with a total package worth $250k per year, but withdrew after he wouldn't live with us in San Francisco — now we know why!"" Hubble told CNBC via email, explaining that as the company is early-stage, the team living and working together is crucial.

""To me it seems he must be addicted to the game of getting job offers, rather than actually making money, given he never lasts more than a few weeks and rarely gets paid. It begs the question — why?""

Lindy and Antimetal did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In an interview on tech show TBPN on Thursday, Parekh admitted that it was true he was working for multiple startups at once and wasn't proud of what he had done.

""No one really likes to work 140 hours a week, but I had to do this out of necessity,"" Parekh said in the show. ""I was in extremely dire financial circumstances.""

Parekh said he only started doing this in 2022, and the grueling lifestyle meant he became a ""serial non-sleeper.""

He added that he ""cared about these companies"" and ""greed wasn't an incentive,"" despite his financial situation. He said he always took the lower pay, higher equity offer at companies.

The tech community on social media is divided, however, with some questioning the ethics of secretly working multiple jobs, while others wonder how Parekh pulled it off.

The tale of Parekh is not unique within the tech industry, with many tech workers covertly working multiple jobs in recent years in an effort to shield themselves from mass layoffs and job market uncertainty.

A subreddit called ""r/overemployed"" was created in 2021, with users sharing advice on how they manage to balance multiple jobs without being detected.

""During the peak of Covid, there was this rush from tech companies to fire talent, and there was this intense competition for talent,"" Alexandru Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at AI company Synthesia, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

""It caused, in some cases, this type of behavior to be more widespread than it was during non-pandemic times.""

Voica noted that the rise of remote work was instrumental in enabling this behavior amongst tech workers. ""That led to obviously incredible benefits for hard-working people, but also allowed people who have maybe this type of attitude to, all of a sudden, get jobs that they wouldn't have before.""

Having at least two jobs is also common within India's IT sector. There was a 25-30% increase in moonlighting seen between 2020 and 2023, according to Randstad India, with workers citing factors such as low pay and remote work.

While Parekh's grueling work hours are unusual — even in tech — it's a reminder of how deeply hustle culture is entrenched within the industry.

""Silicon Valley's obsession with productivity metrics and fast hiring has created conditions where a person can juggle five roles — and not because it's efficient, but because no one is truly looking,"" Dmitry Zaytsev, founder of talent management company Dandelion Civilization, said to CNBC Make It.

""What we're seeing is the extreme end of hustle culture: when work becomes performance, and identity becomes fragmented.""

Zaytsev explained that Parekh essentially passed multiple rounds of technical interviews because soft skills aren't as valued in tech. Qualities like commitment, reliability and team presence ""are often overlooked until there's a crisis,"" he said.

""Burnout is a predictable outcome when the workplace culture rewards overcommitment and treats exhaustion as a badge of honor. Soham's admission that he worked 140 hours a week is not just unhealthy, it's a reflection of a system that equates worth with output,"" he added.

It comes as European tech startups face pressure from some VCs to adopt a more rigorous work schedule — such as China's ""996"" or Silicon Valley's 24/7, always-on culture — to better compete on a global tech stage. This has been met with backlash, with founders telling CNBC Make It that overwork can lead to a crisis of productivity, burnout, and even resentment.

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, said this debate came about due to ""a fetishization of overwork"" and a glorification of hustle culture in the tech and startup scene in Silicon Valley.

Synthesia's Voica warned that workers who take advantage of flexible working policies risk painting other engineers in a bad light, and could have these benefits taken away.

""Most of the engineers that I know are very hard working, very dedicated, very passionate, and then when you have this type of more cavalier behavior, it sets this tone that this is normal behavior in the community,"" Voica explained.

This might cause employers to second-guess whether they should keep hybrid working policies in place, he said.

""This is going to impact women. It's going to impact people with disabilities [and] the more vulnerable, who actually benefited from this [flexible] work arrangement, and now they're going to be impacted by this type of behavior,"" he added.

 Crypto analyst James Check says the Bitcoin treasury strategy is getting to a point where new entrants will find it hard to gain momentum “without a serious niche.” 

A crypto analyst says the Bitcoin treasury strategy may not have the longevity many expect, warning that the easy upside may already be behind new companies entering the space.

“My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Glassnode lead analyst James Check said in an X post on Friday.

“For many new entrants, it could already be over,” Check said, adding that it's not “about a measuring contest” but rather how sustainable a company's product and strategy are when it comes to long-term Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation.

Check said it is becoming an uphill battle for newer Bitcoin treasury firms as investors favor the early adopters. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” Check said.

In the 30 days leading up to Friday, at least 21 entities added Bitcoin as a reserve asset, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. The largest public Bitcoin treasury, Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), holds 597,325 BTC, while the second-largest, MARA Holdings, holds 50,000 BTC — approximately one-twelfth as much.

Check said startup Bitcoin treasury firms attract retail speculators — but warns they don't “have infinite money.”

Check admitted it is hard to put a time limit on the downturn for the newer firms, as he is “bullish” on Bitcoin's price, which is trading at $107,990 at the time of publication, approximately 3.70% off its $111,970 all-time high, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“It's a spectrum,” he said, explaining that, for example, Strategy has more runway than the 300th company entering the market with a Bitcoin treasury.

Check said he agreed with Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer's view that some companies are using a Bitcoin treasury strategy as a way to make quick profits, without fully understanding its long-term purpose.

“Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they're doing,” Wizardheimer said.

“I think it'll take them some time to figure out,” he said, adding:

Recently, several doubts have emerged over firms adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

Venture capital firm Breed argued in a June 29 report that only a few Bitcoin treasury companies will stand the test of time and avoid the vicious “death spiral” that will impact BTC holding companies that trade close to net asset value (NAV).

On June 11, Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional, told Cointelegraph what concerns him most are “the copycats.”

“There are now other companies trying to create Bitcoin banks without proper safeguards or risk management. If these smaller firms crash, we could see a ripple effect that hurts Bitcoin's image,” Miah said.

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin has rocketed higher over the last 10 years, confounding its critics and making its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto potentially one of the world's richest people.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

Bitcoin's rise, which some think could be just getting started, has sparked huge interest in the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, who has remained anonymous despite multiple attempts to unmask them.

Now, as a perfect storm is heading toward bitcoin, a $8.6 billion anonymous bitcoin transfer just weeks after Arthur Britto, a cofounder of Ripple's XRP, broke a 14-year silence has sparked wild speculation he could be Satoshi Nakamoto.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the mystery creator of bitcoin, could be worth over $100 billion. 

Last month, Arthur Britto, the mysterious cofounder of Ripple's XRP Ledger who created it along with Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz in 2012, posted to X for the first time since creating his account in August 2011—a message consisting of just an emoji of a face without a mouth.

Britto's reappearance after over a decade of obscurity was seized on by holders of Ripple's XRP, who speculated about what the timing of his return might mean just as the XRP price has soared to levels not seen since 2017 over the last year.

Britto—in contrast to McCaleb and Schwartz who are both public figures in the world of bitcoin and crypto—has no verified photographs online and has never given an interview, cultivating a degree of mystery to rival Satoshi Nakamoto.

""Satoshi's last known message was in April 2011,"" one XRP fan account posted to X, going on to suggest bitcoin was merely a precursor to XRP. “May 2011: David Schwartz starts building the XRP Ledger. August 2011: Arthur Britto joins Twitter. Now, 14 years later Britto reappears… and 14 years old dormant bitcoin wallets just moved.”

On Friday, bitcoin saw its largest transfer on record, with more than $8 billion worth of bitcoin that were mined during the network's earliest days that's sometimes called the “Satoshi era” moving for the first time.

Eight wallets were spotted moving 10,000 bitcoin each to new addresses, with the identity of the wallets' owner remaining unknown—though one researcher speculated they might belong to Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor known as bitcoin Jesus before backing a bitcoin fork called bitcoin cash and running afoul of the U.S. IRS over $48 million of tax it claims is owed.

The 80,000 bitcoin are now in new wallets using a modern address format, something that could have been done to prevent against future quantum computing attacks.

""Sure would be interesting if someone like Arthur Britto happened to control Satoshi's BTC wallet,"" another X user posted, while others also fanned the flames of the theory that included speculation David Schwartz might be Satoshi Nakamoto.

“What if I told you Satoshi has been hidden in plain sight this entire time,” another XRP fan account posted alongside a photo of Schwartz apparently taken in 2012, in which he's sporting a bitcoin miner t-shirt.

Schwartz has previously denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, posting to X that theories suggesting he developed bitcoin with former Ripple executive and engineer Nik Bougalis are, ""not true, but it's plausible.""

The bitcoin price has hit a record high this year, making bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin ... More believed to be worth over $100 billion.

Satoshi Nakamoto has been linked to dozens of different people over the the years by internet sleuths, researchers and reporters, from an obscure, now deceased computer scientist called Hal Finney all the way through to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey (one crypto exchange executive has claimed Satoshi Nakamoto's identity might already be known by some).

Just last year, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, though he failed to produce proof.

Almost all of the most likely names associated with the Satoshi Nakamoto name have denied they are Satoshi Nakamoto, except for Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who fought a multi-year legal campaign to be recognised as bitcoin's creator despite being unable to produce evidence.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC 0.19%) has a knack for turning skeptics into storytellers, myself included. Five years ago, a single coin cost as much as a used car, but today it clears six figures. That kind of ascent makes investors wonder whether dropping $10,000 into the crypto today could realistically bloom into $100,000 by 2030.

The question matters because the forces that once pushed Bitcoin north are changing shape. Still, Bitcoin's history reads like a roller coaster's safety disclaimer rather than a guaranteed profit machine. Let's dig into why a 10-fold or perhaps even more remains on the table with this asset, and why a measured approach beats a blind leap.

During the past five years the coin has surged by 1,060%, from about $9,123 to roughly $109,600 (as of July 3), making for a compound annual growth rate just north of 63%. Therefore, even if that pace halves, a 10-fold gain by 2030 is mathematically possible.

The drivers of the coin's value paint a similarly favorable picture.

Demand keeps building, and from key sources like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In particular, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF now pulls in an estimated $187 million in annual fees, surpassing the issuing company's flagship S&P 500 fund, proving that mainstream money is eager to pay for exposure to Bitcoin. Plus, in the week ended June 30 alone, a whopping $2.2 billion flowed into Bitcoin ETFs; the tempo is accelerating here, not slowing.

Image source: Getty Images.

Furthermore, corporate appetite for holding the asset is rising too, and in multiple forms. Many publicly listed companies like Tesla are now opting to hold Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets, and they may be just the first of many.

Separately, an entirely new class of company is emerging: Bitcoin treasury companies, which only aspire to buy and hold more of the coin as their main business model.

Strategy, the most notable Bitcoin treasury company, just snagged another 4,980 coins, boosting its holdings past 597,000. Other treasury businesses from London to Tokyo are copying that playbook, further shrinking the float available for public trading and bringing in significant capital to compete for the supply that remains.

Meanwhile, the total supply is locked in cement, and the rate of new coins being mined is only going to get slower and slower.

The next halving, projected for late March 2028, will cut new issuance below 0.8% of coins outstanding. With about 94% of all coins already mined, each halving slows supply growth further just as ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies are building positions.

Put simply, more buyers are chasing fewer coins, and that can send its price upward in a very dramatic fashion, precisely as it has in the past. A 10-fold gain is very possible here, and on a long enough timeline, it is likely to occur.

Let's temper the above. Bitcoin isn't actually allergic to smooth sailing, but it might be easy to get that impression based on the risks it has faced and the steep price declines it has experienced historically.

A liquidity crunch, a regulatory swerve, or a plain old sentiment flip can slice prices in half very quickly -- and in the long run, it is guaranteed that such a plunge will happen again, even if it is subsequently very likely that a rebound occurs.

Spot ETFs make exits from the traditional financial sector quite frictionless, so any panic could snowball faster than in the past. Investors should also keep an eye on Washington, as a sudden about-face on crypto policy -- or a failure to follow through on the promises that the current administration made -- could discourage many institutional buyers.

Given those hazards, lump-sum bets can backfire.

A steady dollar-cost-averaging plan spreads purchases across upswings and sell-offs, lowering the odds that a single bad month leaves you under water. Historically, holding through at least one full four-year halving cycle has left patient investors with gains, but there have been stretches, even spanning several years, when paper losses were brutal.

Bitcoin's stars may be aligning to deliver gargantuan gains in the next few years, but the road from here to there might be more volatile than many expect.

Framing the 10-fold goal as ""possible, not promised"" should keep your emotions in check. Use position sizing you are comfortable with, keep dry powder for inevitable dips, and remember that compounding only works if you stay in the game.

The crypto market has never lacked ambition, but a new study has reached an unprecedented milestone: Ethereum could reach $706,000. This prediction, from a 38-page report titled The Bull Case for ETH, is based on a series of economic, technical, and structural analyses that redefine Ether's place in the global ecosystem. For the authors, Ethereum is no longer simply a programmable blockchain but the energetic and monetary foundation of the future global financial system.

From the first lines, the study announces a disruption: the financial system is approaching a total overhaul. Ethereum takes the role of the central engine. Its decentralized architecture has operated flawlessly since its creation. No interruptions. A community of developers active, resilient, always engaged. ETH stands out as the only crypto fulfilling several vital functions simultaneously.

The key argument rests on a potential diluted market capitalization of $85 trillion, equivalent to a unit valuation of $706,000 per ETH. This figure is not arbitrary. The authors base it on a comparison with the most solid real-world value reservoirs: oil, gold, sovereign bonds, and the global money supply.

The average of these benchmark assets gives this staggering potential, but it represents an ultimate “equilibrium state” rather than a short-term target.

Much more than a simple speculative asset, Ethereum becomes a productive commodity. Staking generates yield. The asset also serves as collateral in DeFi ecosystems. Around 32.6% of the supply is used as collateral. Nearly 3.5% migrates to other blockchains. Its systemic role is strengthening.

To reach such a valuation level, the report identifies four major growth drivers. The first: massive tokenization of real assets. Real estate, bonds, commodities… all converge towards blockchain, and Ethereum is today the preferred infrastructure layer for this type of migration.

Secondly, the imminent arrival of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) incorporating ETH staking could create an institutional demand shock. Indeed, the native yield generated by staking – compared to the interest of a gold loan or the income from an oil lease – is a significant asset, especially since it is natively programmable and automatically capitalized.

Thirdly, the race for strategic storage of crypto ETH has already begun. Some funds, companies, and states accumulate Ether in a strategic reserve logic, with a current pool exceeding $2 billion. Finally, the integration of this crypto into automated treasury management could create a continuous demand loop, fueled by its neutrality, censorship resilience, and stable yield.

The current price of ETH, around $2,564, is considered ridiculously undervalued given its fundamentals. For the authors, this is not a structural weakness but a temporary market myopia, poorly equipped to understand such a hybrid asset.

Unlike Bitcoin, whose value largely rests on its scarcity and popularity as digital gold, Ethereum combines several economic dimensions.

Traditional models, notably discounted cash flow, do not apply well here. Ethereum is neither a tech company nor a classic commodity. It is a new asset class, midway between gold, oil, sovereign bonds, and a programmable currency.

The authors do not deny the risks: Ethereum's complexity, frequent updates, and exposure to rapid innovations can deter traditional investors. But they insist: the current undervaluation of ETH crypto represents an exceptional asymmetric opportunity, somewhat like the solo miner who won $350,000. It is a rare chance in a world where real returns are eroding.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is vulnerable in a handful of important growth sectors.

Solana stands to steal Ethereum's capital share in those sectors.

Ethereum's problems are not getting better fast enough.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Sometimes having a lot of capital doesn't guarantee lasting dominance. In fast-evolving ecosystems like crypto, today's winners can end up looking clunky pretty quickly. And that's the risk facing Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) today. While it remains the largest and most versatile smart contract platform, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is rapidly undermining Ethereum's edge in three key areas, each of which poses a long-term threat to Ethereum's upside.

Investors who still see Ethereum as the default smart contract play need to ask a hard question. What happens to the coin's upside if its positions in some of the most lucrative future niches are already starting to erode today? Let's take a peek at the three fault lines where Solana's encroachment looks most dangerous to see why the answer to that question justifies considering selling Ethereum.

Tokenizing off‑chain assets like bonds, stocks, and even real estate could be a $16 trillion market by 2030.

Today, Ethereum hosts about $7.5 billion of those assets, equal to almost 59% of the on‑chain total. Solana's share is just $361 million, or 2.8%, but that sliver is growing.

This is important because asset management flows are sticky. Once a custodian integrates with a chain, it rarely moves its capital elsewhere unless there's a major problem. Every point of market share Solana siphons from Ethereum is not only capital Ethereum likely loses forever, it is also capital that earns Solana nonstop transaction fees.

But why is capital likely to migrate to Solana in the first place? In short, Ethereum's high gas (user) fees and slow transaction times.

Ethereum's defenders point to the Dencun upgrade, which slashed average gas fees to roughly $0.39 for a swap, as well as its latest upgrade called Pectra, which is meant to cut fees even more. But as of midafternoon on July 2, gas fees were more than $1.15 for a simple token swap, and transaction times took roughly 30 seconds from end to end. Solana's typical fee is about $0.0001.

An enterprise moving hundreds of thousands of securities will notice and be inconvenienced by the difference between $1.15 and fractions of a cent.

If nothing changes, Solana's lower operating cost will keep nibbling away at Ethereum's tokenized capital year after year. And given the many years that Ethereum has tried and failed to reduce transaction costs to negligible levels, it makes more sense to bet on Solana here, though it's still an underdog.

In case you're not familiar, DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) aims to settle real‑world services such as Wifi, mapping, and sensor data directly on‑chain, using cryptocurrency as the medium of exchange.

Picture this: You walk into a cafe and try to pay $1 for internet access through a DePIN protocol. If that service ran on Ethereum, a congestion spike could tack on as much as $14 in gas fees, discouraging you from surfing the web at the cafe.

No one would build that product, and that's the point. Ethereum's base layer economics disqualify whole categories of microtransaction services before they even launch. Gas for smart contract calls has run well above $1 many times.

Projects that need predictable, minuscule fees look elsewhere. Solana fits the bill, and that's why its DePIN sector is alive and well. It's also why new capital is going to build DePIN projects there rather than on Ethereum. And that's bearish, even if there are many other segments that it could compete in successfully.

Always‑on artificial intelligence (AI) bots will soon buy coins, process data, sell services, and react in real time, firing off thousands of microtransactions daily. Even a penny per transaction could render them uneconomical.

Solana is courting that future directly. In May 2023 the Solana Foundation launched an open‑source ChatGPT plugin and expanded its AI grants pool to $10 million. Developers now get a toolkit that speaks AI natively, running atop a chain that can process 65,000 transactions per second.

Ethereum has nothing comparable baked into its Layer 1. Layer 2 rollups may eventually match Solana's throughput, but every extra hop from a Layer 1 to a Layer 2 adds latency, which is the very thing real‑time AI will need to eliminate to perform smoothly. If agents migrate to the cheapest, fastest venue, Solana's network effects could snowball while Ethereum's demand curve plateaus.

For long‑term Ethereum holders, this is a troubling situation.

Even if Solana never outright wins any of these segments, its capacity to siphon incremental growth can cap Ethereum's upside. And in a world where capital is impatient, ""capped upside"" is investment‑speak for a mounting need to start trimming the position. Ethereum is far from dead, but it will still need a handful of wins to be worth retaining in the long run.

The Ethereum price is currently locked in a narrow trading range of around $2,500, with momentum stalling despite the market's bullish expectations. In light of this, a leading crypto analyst warns that current price action lacks the strength needed for a powerful upward move, urging traders to remain cautious. The analyst notes that without a clear breakout signal, entering the market now could expose investors to potential downside risks. 

$2,800 Breakout Key For Ethereum Price Bull Rally

A new analysis released on the X social media platform by market expert Daan Crypto Trades reveals that the Ethereum price has continued to trade within a well-defined price channel, currently holding above the $2,500 level at $2,527. The analyst emphasized that $2,800 remains the key breakout point that could trigger an Ethereum bull rally. 

The market expert shared a chart highlighting that ETH remains confined between a “range low” of $2,313 and a high of $2,736, with multiple failed attempts to break out of this tight structure. The chart also shows that the mid-range level of around $2,519 has become a critical point of control. 

Despite a brief rally that pushed the Ethereum price above $2,570 earlier this week, the cryptocurrency was still unable to sustain the upward move, slipping back below the $2,519 level before recovering to its current price of around $2,527. Daan Crypto Trades explains that the reason for Ethereum's sluggish performance is its continued struggle to establish a solid footing in the $2,500 price region. Given the clear price imbalance in this zone, the analyst advises traders to exercise caution before entering the market. 

Within this range, traders may encounter increased price volatility and potential fakeouts, both above and below the key support and resistance levels. Given the unstable market environment, Daan Crypto Trades suggests that until Ethereum breaks and holds above the $2,800 mark, traders are likely to face more sideways action and unpredictable price swings. A clean breakout above $2,800 could be the key to the start of a bullish trend, improving conditions for ETH and pushing it out of its present downtrend. 

ETH Four-Year Consolidation Sees An End

Market expert Mister Crypto has also shared insights on the current Ethereum price action. The analyst declared in a recent X post that ETH is on the verge of exiting a prolonged multi-year consolidation phase. His chart, which visualizes the cryptocurrency's historical price movements, marks two key periods—a powerful 48x rally from 2018 through 2021, followed by a four-year horizontal consolidation range that spans from the 2021 top to the present day. 

The analysis suggests that this extended period of range-bound movement could be a prelude to a potentially explosive bull trend, similar to the breakout seen in the past. In line with this, Mister Crypto marks a large open-ended “??X” label on his chart, suggesting the next breakout phase is imminent—though the precise magnitude is left speculative.

Ethereum navigates scalability woes as fast-paced Solana captures developer interest.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The following is a guest post and opinion from Daniel Polotsky, Founder & Chairman at CoinFlip.

Ethereum has been the king of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts for years. But lately, its position of primacy has been threatened. Scalability struggles, internal shakeups, and fast-rising competitors like Solana are giving Ethereum a run for its money. So, what's really going on, and what does it mean for ETH's future?

Ethereum's move to proof-of-stake (PoS) was a massive win for the environment, cutting its energy use by over 99%. The Merge was a big deal, but Ethereum's core problem still lingers: scalability. Gas fees still spike during busy periods, and transactions can crawl when network activity surges. Remember that Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT mint that clogged Ethereum and sent fees soaring?

Sure, Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism are helping out, but Ethereum itself is still feeling the strain. Big fixes like Proto-Danksharding (and eventually full Danksharding) are in the works to tackle data congestion and lower fees, but these solutions are still a year or two away from full implementation.

Meanwhile, Solana's out here processing 60 million daily transactions while Ethereum struggles to hit 1 million. With Solana's near-instant speeds and fees under a penny, developers looking for smoother performance are taking notice.

Ethereum's technical issues aren't the only thing raising eyebrows. The Ethereum Foundation, the core group steering network upgrades, has faced some turbulence. Critics argue that key updates are too slow, and shifting priorities are causing friction.

Decentralization is Ethereum's strength, but it can also mean slower progress. Competitors like Solana, with more centralized control, can push updates faster. That can sometimes translate into a huge advantage in crypto's fast-moving world.

Speaking of Solana, its proof-of-history (PoH) tech has turned heads by allowing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. Solana has carved out a sweet spot in NFTs, DeFi, and gaming, attracting big-name projects like Magic Eden and Star Atlas.

Meanwhile, Avalanche is gaining traction with its customizable “subnet” system, letting developers build their own blockchain ecosystems without worrying about congestion. And don't sleep on Aptos. It's quickly winning fans for its developer-friendly tools and high-speed performance.

In a word: no. Ethereum still dominates DeFi, NFT platforms, and DAOs—and its developer community is massive. According to Electric Capital's Developer Report, Ethereum boasts over 6,200 active monthly developers, dwarfing its rivals.

Plus, Ethereum's role as a settlement layer for Layer-2 networks reinforces its long-term value. While Solana wins in speed, Ethereum's security, stability, and adoption remain unmatched. As Devansh Mehta put it:

“Ethereum wins because of its community… top-notch teams all working in the same ecosystem, sharing similar values of openness, transparency and rebelliousness against authority.”

If Ethereum can deliver on its Proto-Danksharding promise, those crushing gas fees could finally ease up—and that's a game-changer.

While Ethereum's fighting technical battles, crypto's also facing macroeconomic shifts—especially inflation and the implications of a trade war. Rising prices are driving more people toward Bitcoin as a hedge. With its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is earning its “digital gold” nickname. Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven, not just a speculative asset.

Stablecoins are also getting love in inflationary times. Pegged to the US dollar, they offer a safe spot for preserving value inside the crypto ecosystem. USDC and Tether are increasingly being used for remittances, DeFi lending, and cross-border payments.

Meanwhile, if the Fed ever starts cutting rates, risk-on assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins could surge. History shows that looser monetary policies often boost high-growth assets—and crypto is no exception.

Ethereum's future really boils down to one thing: can it scale fast enough to keep its lead? If the upcoming upgrades land on schedule, Ethereum could easily reclaim its edge. But if delays drag on, chains like Solana may continue pulling projects away.

Meanwhile, macroeconomic concerns are driving more eyes to Bitcoin, while stablecoins provide a practical way to hedge without leaving the crypto world.

Whether you're all-in on ETH, bullish on Solana, or exploring newer chains, one thing's for sure: crypto's landscape is evolving at a pace we haven't really ever seen. Your best bet in an environment like this is staying informed and staying flexible.

A renowned cryptocurrency tycoon has unveiled a list of five little-known altcoins that form the backbone of his multimillion-dollar investment plan. With a surprising focus on popular meme-based tokens, this revelation is set to shake up the digital currency market. Readers are eager to discover which coins could potentially offer significant returns.

XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it's a growing community built around passion for the game.

With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.

What sets $XYZ apart? It's not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.

Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.

The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

Launch Price: $0.0001

Price Now: $0.003333

Next Stage: $0.005

Final Presale Price: $0.02

Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.

So far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.

Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.

AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain that's making waves in the crypto world. Avalanche stands out for its low fees and lightning-fast transactions, processing up to 4,500 transactions per second. One of its unique features is the ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, allowing developers to create their own blockchains. With a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto principles, Avalanche aims to finalize transactions in less than two seconds.

The platform consists of three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle different tasks like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. It's used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. Given its strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling custom tokens, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Compared to other coins, Avalanche's eco-friendly approach and rapid processing capabilities may appeal to those looking for scalable and sustainable blockchain solutions.

Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts talk to the real world. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they usually can't access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this problem using oracles, which bring data from external sources to the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to use real-world data, like prices or events. Chainlink ensures this data is accurate by checking it through multiple sources and using a reputation system.

The potential of Chainlink is huge. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it makes smart contracts much more useful. This is important for industries like finance, insurance, and supply chains. The LINK token is key in this system. It's used to pay for data services and rewards those who provide accurate data. In the current market, LINK stands out because it offers real utility. While many other coins are just speculative, Chainlink has a working product used by many projects. With growing interest in decentralized finance, Chainlink's technology could be very attractive to investors.

The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a key player in the Polygon network. It powers operations and services across the ecosystem. By staking POL, token holders support the network's security and participate in consensus processes. This involvement not only strengthens the system but also rewards participants with additional tokens. POL also gives holders a voice in the network's governance. They can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon, ensuring the community's interests are considered.

POL's diverse uses make it stand out in today's market. It provides access to exclusive services within Polygon, offering benefits beyond trading. As the Polygon ecosystem grows and adds more applications, the demand for POL may rise. Compared to tokens with a single purpose, POL's multiple functions could make it attractive to those watching market trends. While the crypto market can be volatile, tokens linked to active and expanding networks like Polygon are gaining attention. POL's potential is tied to the growth and success of its ecosystem, positioning it as an interesting token in the current market cycle.

Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as DOT. It enables secure communication between different blockchains, allowing data and value to be shared across platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin without middlemen. Using parachains, Polkadot boosts speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network, letting holders participate in decisions and transaction verification. Launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot was developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and is maintained by the Web3 Foundation. It promises a future where blockchains are more interconnected and efficient.

Polkadot's technology holds significant potential in the evolving blockchain landscape. Its unique ability to connect multiple blockchains positions it well in a market that values interoperability. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Polkadot offers solutions to scalability issues that have challenged platforms like Ethereum. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the need for faster, more efficient networks, Polkadot's approach is timely. The current market cycle has seen increased interest in blockchain technologies that can handle more transactions at lower costs. While market conditions can be unpredictable, Polkadot's innovative framework makes it a project worth watching as the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow.

While AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

A closely followed crypto analyst is revealing bullish targets for Bitcoin (BTC) while updating his outlook on a handful of prominent altcoins.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,200 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to push to the $118,000 price level – a new all-time high – if it can finish with a daily close above $109,000.

 “Despite the broader quarterly outlook shared in this video, the daily chart for Bitcoin. BTC looks promising. A daily close above $109,000 could open the door to a rally toward $118,000!”

BTC is trading for $109,644 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH), Martinez says he expects more choppiness until the top altcoin closes outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.

“Heard a company added an inflationary asset like ETH to its balance sheet, and suddenly everyone's bullish again. But let's be real: I expect more chop until we get a sustained close outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.”

ETH is valued at $2,579 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Turning his attention toward the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE), Martinez notes that the popular dog-themed token appears ready to ascend to $0.19, potentially up to $0.26, after bouncing off a low.

“Dogecoin bounced from the lower boundary of this channel. Now targeting $0.19, with potential upside to the upper boundary near $0.26.”

DOGE is trading for $0.17 at time of writing.

Concluding his analysis with ETH competitor Solana (SOL), the trader says the smart contract platform looks poised to benefit if the crypto markets break out.

SOL is trading for $151 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

The world of cryptocurrency is always changing, and it seems like altcoins like Dogecoin and XRP are really shaking things up in the mining game. With AI optimization on the rise, it looks like companies are not only streamlining their operations but also making crypto mining easier for everyone. So, what's the deal with this shift? How does it affect the market and the challenges it brings? Let's dive into this evolving landscape.

Altcoins are becoming more popular, and tokens such as Dogecoin and XRP are taking center stage in different financial ecosystems. These coins aren't just alternatives to Bitcoin; they offer their own unique features. Dogecoin has a strong community and meme culture behind it, while XRP is focused on facilitating cross-border payments. As more businesses jump on board and start using these altcoins for transactions, their presence in the market is growing. This shift is changing how people view and use cryptocurrencies.

JA Mining, a platform based in the UK, has just launched a new AI optimization engine. This technology is designed to make crypto mining operations more efficient. With this AI-driven engine, users can dynamically manage their mining resources to match financial goals. It's a way to save on operational costs and improve the overall experience for users, especially newcomers. The introduction of AI not only makes things easier but also helps users make smarter decisions, potentially pulling in more participants into the crypto mining arena.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are regulatory challenges ahead. The decentralized nature of these altcoins can create confusion about their classification, making it harder to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Governments around the globe are trying to figure out how to manage cryptocurrencies, and companies like JA Mining need to stay on their toes to keep up with the changing legal landscape. This uncertainty can scare off potential users and investors, making it clear that having compliance strategies is key to building trust in the crypto world.

The rise of altcoins in financial ecosystems could really change the game when it comes to market stability and user confidence. More institutional investment in these altcoins, especially XRP, could lead to better liquidity and less price volatility, creating a more stable market. The strong community around Dogecoin might encourage user loyalty and continued adoption. But, we can't ignore the risks from whale concentration and market manipulation that could shake user trust. As the crypto space continues to shift, finding the right balance between innovation and compliance will be critical.

In summary, the future of cryptocurrency is being shaped by the rise of altcoin payment options and AI optimization. Companies like JA Mining are leading this charge, making things more accessible for users and improving efficiency. But, navigating the regulatory maze remains a big hurdle. As altcoins gain more traction and AI tech keeps advancing, there's a lot of potential for innovation in the crypto sector. Embracing these changes while ensuring compliance will be vital for businesses wanting to succeed in this ever-changing environment.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The altcoin market is currently exhibiting a bullish formation that was last observed in late 2024. The TOTAL2 chart, which measures the crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has broken out of a key pattern and replicated a previous consolidation phase. This technical formation, known as a cup and handle, began to develop in mid-2022, with the rounded part of the cup arm spanning more than a year. The handle grew throughout early 2025 and was a falling wedge, a pattern commonly used to precede higher prices after a brief downtrend. Following the breakout, the chart showed a retest of a symmetrical triangle resistance, now flipped into support. This trend is viewed by traders as confirmation of trend continuation for altcoins. The triangle pattern dated back several years and had previously rejected several rally attempts. The retest and bounce have now shifted market expectations toward renewed strength in the broader altcoin sector.

The TOTAL2 market cap has moved sideways for 32 weeks, mirroring a similar 32-bar (224-day) stretch observed in 2024. During that earlier phase, the altcoin market also moved within a tight range before a short but sharp upward move. This repetitive pattern indicates that price action trend and investor activity might be experiencing familiar altseason patterns. Future projections are frequently driven by the historical duplication of technical structure, especially on the macro level. The symmetry of consolidation periods further reinforces the existing chart pattern as traders position themselves in evaluations of probable direction.

In late 2024, the altcoin market cap experienced a 28-day bullish period, which occurred more or less instantly after the 32-week price stagnation. Within those four weeks, TOTAL2 shot up significantly, introducing more than 400 billion dollars worth of value within the sector. The move was preceded by low volatility and declining volume, conditions that were once again evident in the current chart. The 2025 model featured a similar build-up, where price candles develop at a similar rate and volume with historical building phases. With analysts monitoring such conditions, the narrative is around the prospects of the current market taking the 2024 model, with TOTAL2 already breaking cleanly and retesting the pattern.

The symmetrical triangle breakout and retest evolved as most altcoins recover after early 2025 sell-offs and reclaim important moving averages. The current TOTAL2 chart has the market cap sitting at around the $1.4 trillion mark, followed by the lows of fewer than 900 billion achieved earlier this year. This recovery has brought the market back into a key liquidity zone, which previously was a launchpad for the late 2024 rally. The rebound off the triangle support and back to a higher range level could help with capital rotation right back into the altcoins. Additionally, the consistency of chart designs and macro consolidation periods could boost investment in non-Bitcoin products. Consequently, the market can be ready for an altcoin rally continuation.

A key contributor to the XRPL, Ripple, announced these plans in a Friday (July 4) blog post, saying this move marks one of the largest tokenization efforts by a Latin American institution on the XRPL, which is a public blockchain designed for the tokenization of RWAs.

Ripple is supporting Mercado Bitcoin's integration onto the XRPL, according to the post.

Mercado Bitcoin is already one of the world's top five tokenizers of private credit assets, and with its newly announced plans it will further expand its support of global liquidity and access to regulated digital products in South America and Europe, the post said.

The RWAs it will tokenize on the XRPL include fixed income and equity income instruments, per the post.

“Across Latin America, we're seeing forward-looking institutions explore how tokenization can improve access and efficiency in financial markets,” Silvio Pegado, managing director, LATAM at Ripple, said in the post. “Mercado Bitcoin's integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market.”

The tokenization of RWAs is driving a quiet revolution among traditional approaches across capital markets, PYMNTS reported in April.

By tokenizing RWAs, organizations and enterprises can take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains, which can reduce transaction fees, streamline settlement times, enhance operational efficiency, and make assets that are traditionally illiquid easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets.

When stablecoin-based finance company Schuman Financial integrated its EURØP coin onto the XRPL in May, Martin Bruncko, the firm's founder and CEO, said the move would combine the resilience of a global blockchain “with euro-native liquidity and compliance at its core.”

Ondo Finance said in January that it would bring its tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRPL to offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG). Ondo Finance Vice President of Partnerships Katie Wheeler said at the time that this integration would set the groundwork for “forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain.”

Robinhood‘s plan to tokenize stocks and offer around-the-clock trading is raising alarms for traditional exchanges like the NYSE.

Robinhood is taking a bold leap into the future of equity trading with its new blockchain-powered tokenization platform. This move enables users to trade tokenized versions of stocks at any time, challenging the dominance of traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.

The initiative could reshape how financial markets operate, offering faster settlements, expanded hours, and programmable financial assets but not without serious implications for market stability and regulatory oversight.

At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev introduced “Robinhood Chain,” an Ethereum-compatible layer-2 solution built on Arbitrum Orbit. This new chain will allow users to trade tokenized derivatives of stocks, initially on a 24/5 basis with plans for full 24/7 access.

The tokens represent wrappers of real-world stocks held by a US broker-dealer, enabling onchain activity without detaching from actual equity ownership. This could offer near-instant settlement, direct self-custody of assets, and decentralized application integration.

According to a detailed analysis by Galaxy Digital, Robinhood's blockchain model could erode the NYSE's competitive advantage, which is built on concentrated liquidity and market data revenue.

Galaxy stated, “This directly challenges the deep concentration of liquidity and activity that gives major TradFi exchanges (e.g., NYSE) their competitive advantage.”

By capturing both trading fees and downstream blockchain use cases, Robinhood is positioning itself to profit from every stage of the trading lifecycle.

Robinhood's strategy also includes tokenizing private equity assets, such as investments in OpenAI and SpaceX, and offering fractional ownership. This could open access to traditionally exclusive markets.

A 2023 Journal of Financial Economics study found that tokenized securities can reduce trading costs by 30 percent compared to traditional methods.

While Robinhood's tokenized trading is currently available only in the EU, the U.S. regulatory landscape is starting to shift. The recently passed GENIUS Act by the U.S. Senate may pave the way for broader cryptocurrency regulation, potentially supporting innovations like Robinhood Chain.

Still, regulatory clarity is lacking. The SEC has not commented, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) urged the agency to reject trading models that fall outside Regulation NMS.

While 24/7 trading increases accessibility, it also brings the risk of significant overnight price swings. Retail investors, in particular, may face heightened exposure without proper safeguards or education.

Galaxy Digital cautions that unless legacy exchanges adapt to this evolving landscape, they could be relegated to managing less versatile versions of the same assets now made dynamic on blockchain networks.

Robinhood's blockchain-based trading model represents a disruptive shift in how assets are bought and sold. By offering around-the-clock trading and advanced token features, it challenges the longstanding dominance of exchanges like the NYSE. However, this innovation also introduces serious volatility and regulatory risks that must be managed. The success of this approach hinges on whether Robinhood can balance innovation with investor protection and whether regulators will support or stifle this emerging model.

Robinhood, the company behind one of the most popular trading apps for everyday investors, just revealed a sweeping new vision for the future of finance. And its bold plan seems to leave traditional Wall Street institutions behind.

The company announced a daring set of new products this week from Cannes, France. These offerings are designed to move traditional financial assets, like company stocks, investment funds (ETFs), and even complex trading tools called derivatives, entirely onto the blockchain.

The clear message? Crypto isn't just for digital money anymore. It's for everything.

The most attention-grabbing announcement was stock tokens. Think of these as digital versions of U.S. company stocks and ETFs. Now, for the first time, European customers can get access to these major American investments without needing a traditional stockbroker, a big Wall Street firm, or even being physically in the U.S.

Unlike buying regular shares through a brokerage, these stock tokens exist on Arbitrum, which is a Layer 2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. Imagine Ethereum as a busy main highway for digital transactions; a Layer 2 like Arbitrum is a faster, less congested side road that uses the main highway for security, making transactions quicker and cheaper. These tokens can be bought and sold 24 hours a day, five days a week. Robinhood claims they come with no commission fees or extra charges from them, and even pay out dividends (portions of a company's profit distributed to shareholders, now paid directly to token holders). Over 200 different stocks and ETFs are available.

In simple terms: your investment portfolio now lives on a digital, decentralized ledger.

At our recent crypto event, we announced a limited Stock Token giveaway on OpenAI and SpaceX to eligible European customers. While it is true that they aren't technically “equity” (you can see the precise dynamics in our Terms for those interested), the tokens effectively give…

But Robinhood isn't just using existing blockchain technology. It's actively building its own custom Layer 2 blockchain. This new digital network is specifically designed to power the tokenization of real-world assets. This means taking things that exist in the physical world, like company shares, investment funds, and potentially even real estate in the future, and turning them into digital tokens that can be easily traded and managed on the blockchain.

Robinhood's ultimate goal, they say, is to create a financial system where assets trade around the clock, are easily moved between different digital wallets (called seamless bridging), and can be self-custodied. Self-custody means you, and only you, directly control your digital assets, rather than a bank or brokerage holding them for you. This new blockchain will also support staking (more on that below) and seamless trading without needing traditional banks or clearinghouses, which are financial middlemen that ensure trades between buyers and sellers are completed smoothly and securely.

It's a vision that, if it succeeds, could replace many core functions of today's financial infrastructure: from the stockbrokers who execute trades to the custodians who hold assets and the exchanges where they change hands.

Beyond the stock tokens, Robinhood also announced crypto perpetual futures for its European customers. These are advanced trading tools that allow investors to bet on the future price of cryptocurrencies, with the option to use leverage (trading with borrowed money to amplify potential gains or losses). Unlike traditional futures contracts, these “perpetuals” never expire, offering continuous exposure to crypto asset prices.

For eligible U.S. customers, Robinhood is also launching crypto staking, starting with popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana. Staking is a way to earn passive income by “locking up” your crypto to support the operations and security of a blockchain network. Think of it like earning interest in a savings account, but for your digital assets.

And there's more for customers in both regions: European users will gain access to smart routing for crypto trades (a system that automatically finds the best price for your trade by checking multiple exchanges). Both U.S. and EU customers will see Cortex, an AI-powered investing tool, and U.S. customers will soon get a crypto rewards credit card. Cortex is an artificial intelligence assistant designed to help customers quickly understand price movements and market shifts in real time.

While the U.S. financial market remains heavily regulated, Robinhood is strategically using its established presence in Europe to experiment with a groundbreaking financial future. In this vision, assets are converted into digital tokens, they are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and their movement is managed by computer code on a blockchain rather than by traditional clearinghouses. The idea is straightforward but revolutionary: replace Wall Street's old infrastructure with the efficiency and transparency of a blockchain.

Robinhood's strategy is clear: make investing simpler and more widely available, using the fundamental technology of cryptocurrency to achieve this. Often, this can happen without the user needing to be a “crypto native” (someone deeply immersed in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology).

If successful, this isn't just a series of new product launches; it could be a blueprint for how digital assets quietly but fundamentally reshape the global financial system from within. The “Trojan Horse” has truly entered the city gates, and the world is waiting to see what emerges.

Articles Details

I analyze monetary policy and economic trends, focusing on real-world impacts.

The blockchain industry's next frontier isn't just about technical innovation—it's about mass adoption. Enter Telegram's TON ecosystem, now propelled by The Open Platform (TOP), a $1 billion unicorn that's redefining how decentralized technology can scale through the world's most popular messaging app. With a $28.5 million Series A funding round led by Ribbit Capital and Pantera, TOP is betting big on its vision: turning Telegram's 1 billion users into blockchain adopters. Here's why investors should take notice.  

 

TOP's Series A—a 5% equity stake—marks a pivotal moment for Telegram's blockchain ambitions. The $1 billion valuation underscores investor confidence in TOP's strategy to bridge everyday apps with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. Notably, this round includes institutional heavyweights like Ribbit Capital (known for backing Coinbase and Revolut) and Pantera Capital, signaling that TOP isn't just a crypto play but a mainstream fintech disruptor.  

The funds will fuel expansion into the U.S. and EU, where regulatory hurdles are steep but the market opportunity is vast. “Compliance is expensive, but it's the price of entry,” says TOP CEO Andrew Rogozov. This focus on regulatory resilience—coupled with a $70 million total raised—is critical for building trust in regions where blockchain adoption has lagged due to legal uncertainty.  

Telegram's crypto wallet, embedded in its messaging app, has already attracted over 100 million signups, with 35 million active wallets as of Q2 2025. This growth isn't just about numbers—it's about behavioral integration. Users aren't visiting a separate app; they're engaging with blockchain through stickers, gifts, and games like Hamster Kombat, which boasts 240 million registered users. These “tap-to-earn” models turn crypto into a daily habit, not a niche investment.  

The goal? Bring 30% of Telegram's 950 million monthly active users onto the TON blockchain by 2028. If achieved, this would catapult TON into the top tier of blockchains by user count, surpassing even Ethereum's current 50 million wallet users.  

Telegram's history is fraught with regulatory challenges. In 2020, the SEC halted its token sale, forcing a $1.2 billion settlement. Yet TOP has emerged stronger, leveraging lessons from that setback. Its Abu Dhabi incorporation and partnerships with the TON Foundation have positioned it as a compliant player. Now, as it eyes U.S. and EU markets, TOP is investing heavily in licensing and operational frameworks—a necessity but also a competitive moat against less regulated rivals.  

While Western markets grapple with crypto skepticism, Telegram's dominance in regions like Asia and Russia offers a ready-made audience. In India, where 60% of Telegram users engage with its wallet, microtransactions and tokenized gifts are already mainstream. Similarly, in Russia, where alternative payment systems are vital post-sanctions, the TON blockchain's low fees make it a pragmatic choice. These markets, largely overlooked by Western crypto platforms, could provide a stable revenue base while TOP navigates stricter regulations elsewhere.  

TOP's vision extends beyond finance. By integrating AI into its ecosystem—think personalized blockchain gaming experiences or smart contract interfaces—Telegram aims to make decentralized tech as intuitive as its messaging service. Games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin are early proof points, blending blockchain with viral gameplay. The Telegram Ad Network further monetizes this traffic, allowing creators to earn through ads and referrals—a model that could generate billions in revenue as adoption grows.  

Critics point to TON's declining Total Value Locked (TVL), which fell from $760 million in 2024 to $141.6 million in 2025—a sign of liquidity concentration in fewer applications. However, TOP's focus on user growth over token speculation may be strategic: building a sustainable base of everyday users rather than chasing volatile DeFi metrics.  

Regulatory risks remain, particularly in markets like the U.S., where crypto regulations are still evolving. Yet TOP's compliance-first approach and institutional backing suggest it's prepared for the long game.  

TOP isn't just a blockchain company—it's a super-app play, combining messaging, finance, and gaming into a single ecosystem. For Web3 investors, this convergence represents a rare opportunity: a platform with massive user traction, a clear monetization path, and the capital to scale globally.  

Investment thesis:- Short-term: Monitor Toncoin (TON) price dynamics and regulatory approvals in key markets.- Long-term: The TON ecosystem's potential to onboard 1 billion users makes it a foundational layer for Web3 adoption.- Risks: Regulatory setbacks or competition from centralized platforms could slow progress.  

In a world where blockchain adoption remains fragmented, Telegram's TON ecosystem—and its unicorn engine, TOP—offers a blueprint for mass integration. For investors, this isn't just about crypto; it's about betting on the future of how billions of people interact with money, games, and each other.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO fines 23andMe £2.3 million","https://www.lewissilkin.com/insights/2025/07/05/ico-fines-23andme-2-3-million-key-takeaways-on-security-measures-and-data-brea-102krc5","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 00:52:38 GMT","

On 17 June 2025, the ICO announced that it issued a monetary penalty of £2.31 million against genetics and research company 23andMe, following a joint investigation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. The ICO's investigation began following a series of large-scale credential-stuffing attacks in 2023, which resulted in unauthorised access to around 14,601 23andMe user accounts, exposing the personal data of around 10 million individuals (155,592 of whom were UK residents).

Background

A hacker carried out a series of credential stuffing attacks, using login credentials harvested from previous breaches. The attackers were able to exploit weaknesses in 23andMe's security infrastructure to gain access to customer accounts and download files via 23andMe's 'DNA Relatives' feature. This led to the exposure of account holders' information and linked individuals via family trees. The personal data accessed included names, locations, dates of birth, photos, ethnicity information, and genetic health predispositions. The ICO found no evidence of raw DNA files being downloaded, though these were accessed by the hacker (so hopefully 23andMe customers won't be cloned on the dark web!).

The ICO observed that 23andMe received multiple warnings of a potential attack between July and September 2023, including a login 'spike' in July 2023 (where an unusual number of successful logins occurred), as well as direct contact from third parties regarding personal data being sold online. However, these were dismissed as isolated incidents (including messages that had alleged that customer personal data was being sold on the dark web). 

It was only in October 2023, following a post on Reddit which explicitly offered 23andMe data for sale, that 23andMe launched a full internal investigation. The ICO considered this to be a serious failing in breach response procedures, given the sensitivity of the data and the foreseeable risk posed by weak authentication practices.

The ICO's findings

Security measures

The ICO found that 23andMe had failed to implement:

The ICO was clear that these measures fell short of what was expected, particularly taking into account that 23andMe processed (and continues to process) particularly sensitive personal data at a large scale. While 23andMe clearly had insufficient security measures in place, the notice reinforces the position that where data is inherently sensitive (and where system design increases exposure, as with linked family profiles), the bar for 'appropriate' technical and organisational measures is correspondingly high.

23andMe did implement multi-factor authentication and account deletion options after the breach, but these measures were too late to mitigate the ICO's findings.

Inadequate breach management

The notice goes into detail on 23andMe's delayed and inadequate breach response. As noted above, 23andMe received several warning signs about the potential exposure of customer data, and these were treated as isolated incidents. 

The inadequate management of the incident meant that 23andMe failed to notify the ICO within the statutory time limit without undue delay (or within 72 hours) and failed to keep appropriate records relating to the breach. The notice provided details of 23andMe's breach response and noted that it had failed to provide sufficient detail to the ICO, necessitating 'multiple follow-up questions and requests for clarification'.

In relation to this aspect of the breach, the penalty was also influenced by a lack of effective organisational controls, despite the known risk of credential stuffing and the delay in responding to warning signs, suggesting broader cultural and governance weaknesses. The ICO's findings echo past enforcement against British Airways and Marriott, where delayed breach recognition were key aggravating factors.

While some may have questioned the point of issuing a monetary penalty against a company that has filed for bankruptcy, 23andMe was recently acquired by its founder under a nonprofit structure with binding privacy commitments, meaning that the enforcement may still carry weight.

What should you do now?

For controllers processing high-risk data, it is clear that basic security controls such as multi-factor authentication and breach detection systems are expected, particularly where data is of a kind that individuals cannot replace or revoke. The ICO quoted its own guidance on data security throughout the notice, so would expect that controllers have considered this guidance and the various security measures that it suggests.

It is also clear that controllers must be sensitive and investigate appropriately any possible data security breach, particularly where there are warning signs from multiple sources. It is especially important to be set up correctly and be prepared to respond to such incidents, by having a clear data breach response process and investigation team prepared to respond.

The ICO also recommends that data subjects ""use strong, unique passwords for each account; enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible; and remain vigilant against phishing emails or messages that reference personal or genetic information"". 

If you have any questions about data breach management or the security measures you have in place, please do get in touch with your usual LS contact.","{'href': 'https://www.lewissilkin.com', 'title': 'Lewis Silkin'}","cryptocurrency"

AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain that's making waves in the crypto world. Avalanche stands out for its low fees and lightning-fast transactions, processing up to 4,500 transactions per second. One of its unique features is the ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, allowing developers to create their own blockchains. With a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto principles, Avalanche aims to finalize transactions in less than two seconds.

The platform consists of three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle different tasks like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. It's used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. Given its strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling custom tokens, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Compared to other coins, Avalanche's eco-friendly approach and rapid processing capabilities may appeal to those looking for scalable and sustainable blockchain solutions.

Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts talk to the real world. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they usually can't access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this problem using oracles, which bring data from external sources to the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to use real-world data, like prices or events. Chainlink ensures this data is accurate by checking it through multiple sources and using a reputation system.

The potential of Chainlink is huge. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it makes smart contracts much more useful. This is important for industries like finance, insurance, and supply chains. The LINK token is key in this system. It's used to pay for data services and rewards those who provide accurate data. In the current market, LINK stands out because it offers real utility. While many other coins are just speculative, Chainlink has a working product used by many projects. With growing interest in decentralized finance, Chainlink's technology could be very attractive to investors.

The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a key player in the Polygon network. It powers operations and services across the ecosystem. By staking POL, token holders support the network's security and participate in consensus processes. This involvement not only strengthens the system but also rewards participants with additional tokens. POL also gives holders a voice in the network's governance. They can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon, ensuring the community's interests are considered.

POL's diverse uses make it stand out in today's market. It provides access to exclusive services within Polygon, offering benefits beyond trading. As the Polygon ecosystem grows and adds more applications, the demand for POL may rise. Compared to tokens with a single purpose, POL's multiple functions could make it attractive to those watching market trends. While the crypto market can be volatile, tokens linked to active and expanding networks like Polygon are gaining attention. POL's potential is tied to the growth and success of its ecosystem, positioning it as an interesting token in the current market cycle.

Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as DOT. It enables secure communication between different blockchains, allowing data and value to be shared across platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin without middlemen. Using parachains, Polkadot boosts speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network, letting holders participate in decisions and transaction verification. Launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot was developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and is maintained by the Web3 Foundation. It promises a future where blockchains are more interconnected and efficient.

Polkadot's technology holds significant potential in the evolving blockchain landscape. Its unique ability to connect multiple blockchains positions it well in a market that values interoperability. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Polkadot offers solutions to scalability issues that have challenged platforms like Ethereum. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the need for faster, more efficient networks, Polkadot's approach is timely. The current market cycle has seen increased interest in blockchain technologies that can handle more transactions at lower costs. While market conditions can be unpredictable, Polkadot's innovative framework makes it a project worth watching as the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow.

While AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

On July 8, 2025, the nation's top policymakers, technologists, and financial innovators will convene at the National Press Club for the U.S. Strategy for AI & Crypto (USSAIC) Congressional Exchange, a landmark event designed to shape the future of digital assets and artificial intelligence policy in the United States.

 
        WASHINGTON, July 5, 2025 (Newswire.com)
        -
    USSAIC is hosted by the Texas Blockchain Council AI Innovation Association. The conference will feature keynotes from law and policy makers that are actively defining the path forward. Additionally, USSAIC will have speakers from Lockheed Martin, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, and the Blockchain Association, as the event brings together leaders from both the public and private sectors to discuss regulatory clarity, innovation frameworks, and national competitiveness in emerging technologies.

Among the highlights will be a keynote interview with entrepreneur and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who will discuss the need for a ""pro-innovation, anti-surveillance"" approach to digital asset regulation.

The USSAIC event arrives just days before the U.S. House of Representatives officially designates the week of July 14 as ""Crypto Week"", during which lawmakers will consider three major bills:

The CLARITY Act, establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets

The GENIUS Act, focused on stablecoin oversight and innovation

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at blocking the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency

According to House Financial Services Committee leadership, these bills represent a coordinated effort to position the United States as the global leader in digital finance while safeguarding consumer privacy and market freedom.

""This is the most consequential week for crypto policy in U.S. history,"" said Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council. ""The USSAIC Exchange was designed to catalyze bipartisan collaboration, and we're proud to see that vision materialize in Congress."" Pavan Agarwal, the Founder of AngelAi (see AngelAi.com) added ""The convergence of AI and crypto demands thoughtful legislation so that innovation and decentralization fuel a competitive marketplace.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

El Salvador has recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring an additional 8 Bitcoins, bringing the total to 6,228.18 BTC. This latest purchase values the country's Bitcoin reserves at approximately $674 million, reinforcing its commitment to blockchain technology and digital currencies. El Salvador made history in 2021 as the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, and its continued investment in the cryptocurrency reflects a strategic approach to financial liberalization and independence from the U.S. dollar.

The timing of El Salvador's Bitcoin purchase is noteworthy, as it coincides with a period of market resistance and consolidation, with prices stabilizing around $108,000 to $109,000. This suggests that the country is leveraging market stability to increase its holdings, a trend supported by recent data. By strategically acquiring Bitcoin during this phase, El Salvador aims to position itself as a global leader in blockchain adoption, potentially setting a precedent for other nations considering the integration of digital currencies into their economies.

However, the path to widespread Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador is fraught with challenges. Despite the government's efforts, only 20% of Salvadorans actively use the Chivo app, the government-sponsored digital wallet. Additionally, the Chivo wallet has faced security issues, including a hack that further eroded public trust in the system. These obstacles highlight the complexities of transitioning to a digital currency and the need for robust security measures and public education initiatives.

Despite local skepticism, El Salvador's Bitcoin initiative has garnered international interest. Other countries are closely observing how Bitcoin can be incorporated into national economies. If El Salvador's experiment proves successful, it could pave the way for broader adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender globally. The future of Bitcoin in El Salvador holds promise, with the potential for increased adoption rates as more Salvadorans become familiar with the technology. The country's Bitcoin reserves may also grow in response to market trends and global economic conditions, further solidifying its position as a pioneer in the digital currency landscape.

XRP showed signs of consolidation over the past 24 hours as the cryptocurrency pulled back slightly from recent highs, shedding 1.07% amid ongoing global economic uncertainty. Despite the dip, price action remains constructive with higher lows forming above $2.20 — a level that has emerged as key short-term support. While macro headwinds continue to pressure digital assets broadly, XRP's bullish structure and rising institutional narrative, including Ripple's U.S. bank license application and ETF speculation, are keeping long-term sentiment intact.

• XRP experienced a notable downtrend over the last 24 hours from 4 July 03:00 to 5 July 02:00, declining from $2.243 to $2.219, representing a 1.07% decrease with a trading range of $0.052 (2.32%).

• The asset encountered strong selling pressure during the 07:00 and 14:00 hours, with volume spikes exceeding 56 million units, establishing key support at $2.209 where buyers consistently emerged.

• A temporary recovery attempt occurred between 21:00-22:00 with price climbing to $2.230 on above-average volume, but momentum failed to sustain, suggesting continued bearish sentiment.

More than $8 billion worth of bitcoin mined during the network's earliest days — colloquially known as the “Satoshi era” — were moved Friday in the largest such transfer on record.



Two wallets that had remained dormant for over 14 years each transferred 10,000 BTC to new addresses around early Friday, as CoinDesk reported. The two addresses had initially received their coins on April 3, 2011, when bitcoin traded at just 78 cents.



That BTC is now worth over $1.1 billion per wallet at current prices, marking an appreciation of more than 13.9 million percent.



The original source of the coins was wallet “1HqXB…gDwcK,” which sent 23,377.83 BTC to three separate wallets in 2011.



Two of those — “12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm” — held the bulk until this week. The third wallet, which received 3,377 BTC, had already spent its funds in 2011.



Late Friday, on-chain analysis firm Arkham flagged that six other wallets moved over 10,000 bitcoin BTC$108,014.17 in quick succession, worth over $8.6 billion at current prices.



The same entity apparently owns all of these wallets, Akrham said. However, no individual or company has publicly claimed ownership of these wallets as of Asian morning hours on Saturday.

The transferred BTC was sent to fresh wallets using a modern, lower-fee address format. Neither of the new wallets has since moved the funds further, and the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown.



All of these moved coins are among the rarest class of BTC: mined or transacted during the “Satoshi era,” a loosely defined period from bitcoin's launch in 2009 through 2011, when its pseudonymous creator was still active online.



Wallets from this time are considered part of crypto's holy grail — rarely moved and often watched closely by traders for market signals, as any large sales could be perceived as an early believer or miner changing their stance on the market.

Movements of bitcoin cash BCH$483.08 took place amid the mysterious transfers of $8.5 billion worth of ‘Satoshi-era' bitcoin late Friday.



Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, flagged a suspicious BCH transaction of over 10,000 tokens (worth nearly $5 million at current prices) tied to one of the whale wallets hours before the main transfers began.



The move raised the possibility that someone may have gained access to legacy private keys and quietly tested them before initiating the massive BTC movements.



“There is a possibility that the owner was testing the private key in a way that wouldn't get noticed,” Grogan posted on X. “BCH isn't monitored heavily by whale-watching services.”

Eight wallets that had been dormant since 2011 each transferred 10,000 BTC to new SegWit addresses on Friday, over 14 years after initially receiving bitcoin in what is now colloquially known as the network's “Satoshi era.”None of the wallets have, so far, been linked to any known entity or company, but the timing, scale, and manual nature of the transfers have set off alarm bells.



Grogan pointed out that only one BCH address associated with the BTC cluster was touched. “Why not sweep the others?” he asked. “It implies the actor may not have full access.”



But the timing is uncanny: just one hour after the BCH test transfer, the first of the 80,000 BTC started to move — triggering the largest Satoshi-era bitcoin movements ever recorded.



So far, the new bitcoin addresses haven't forwarded funds further or deposited them on exchanges. But the BCH test could indicate someone was probing before executing a coordinated transfer, possibly to avoid triggering whale alerts or spooking the market.



Other theories extend from a private key leak to even a quantum computing attack.



Bitcoin's early addresses, especially Pay‑to‑Public‑Key (P2PK) formats, expose public keys after their first transaction — once available, they become theoretically crackable using Shor's algorithm if large-scale quantum hardware materializes.



(Dormant wallets that have never revealed their public key are safe even in a quantum future as no public key exists to reverse-engineer.)



As such, the fact that only one associated BCH wallet moved during testing while the others remained untouched suggests limited access.

 JPMorgan's blockchain lead says merging TradFi with DeFi is accelerating, as the bank's pilot with Chainlink and Base shows traditional institutions moving onchain. 

The divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) could disappear within the next few years, according to Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan's Kinexys.

Speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025, Zaltsman said JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging onchain assets, signaling what could be a tipping point for mainstream blockchain adoption.

“Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting,” said Zaltsman. She described JPMorgan's blockchain strategy as “asset agnostic,” aiming to give clients real-time access to multiple networks while minimizing friction.

The banking giant recently piloted synchronized settlement technology with Chainlink, allowing JPMorgan's blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across different blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone a “very early sign” of how major banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets.

Related: TradFi will keep its distance until DeFi becomes a manageable risk

Zaltsman predicted that the artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance would dissolve faster than many expected, driven by improved infrastructure and growing industry willingness to work together.

She noted that even a decade ago, JPMorgan had to build its own private blockchain due to the absence of suitable solutions. “Thankfully, that's not the case today,” Zaltsman said. “It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support,” she added.

“I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries,” Zaltsmann said.

Last month, JPMorgan expanded its blockchain efforts by piloting its new deposit token, JPMD, on Coinbase's Base network. Zaltsman called the launch “an exciting milestone for the team and I think kind of the Northstar moment for us.”

Unlike stablecoins, these deposit tokens stay within the bank's deposit system while offering clients direct access to blockchain-based markets, effectively bridging onchain liquidity with institutional cash management.

Related: TradFi could move onchain due to ‘horrible banking experiences'

Meanwhile, Nazarov highlighted the industry-wide impact of JPMorgan's participation. “What JPMorgan does is that it can drive a lot of the other banking institutions in the world to take notice,” he said.

Nazarov also pointed out that cryptographic proofs and smart contracts can now give smaller counterparties the same reliability as top-tier banks, unlocking new opportunities in capital markets.

“They can prove that solvency, you know, by cryptographic means. They can prove through smart contracts or oracle networks, through compliance engines verifying things,” he said, adding that this dynamic could boost competition and product innovation across financial services.

 The Coinbase executive says he is “speculating on straws,” but if it is true, it would be “by far the largest heist in human history.” 

Conor Grogan, Coinbase's head of product, says there's a slight chance the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin moved on Thursday — from eight wallets that had held the Bitcoin for over 14 years — was caused by a hack, and if so, it could be the largest robbery ever.

“If true (again, I'm speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan said in an X post on Friday, after raising the slim chance that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved from eight separate wallets was the work of bad actors.

“There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” Grogan said, pointing out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction made before the significant transfers on Thursday involving 10,000 Bitcoin at a time.

“I found a single BCH test transaction from one of the BTC whale clusters 14 hours ago, followed by the full amount. An hour later, the BTC wallets began to move,” he said.

Grogan said it is possible that the wallet owner may have been quietly testing the private key, since Bitcoin Cash transactions don't attract as much attention from whale tracking services. However, he reiterated he found the behavior unusual:

In a post on the same day, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham said it was a single entity that moved $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin from eight separate wallets. 

Arkham said that all the Bitcoin was transferred into the original wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had remained on the wallets for more than 14 years.

Arkham said the Bitcoin is now stored in eight new wallets and hasn't been moved since.

Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin's price has stayed relatively stable, dipping 1.02% in the last 24 hours and trading at $108,150 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

 Hong Kong prepares third batch of tokenized bonds and unveils a sweeping digital asset strategy to solidify its role as Asia's crypto finance leader. 

Hong Kong plans to expand its tokenized bond program, as the government prepares a third batch of tokenized green bonds and signals intentions to make such issuances a regular feature of its debt strategy.

Speaking at the Hong Kong Digital Finance Awards 2025, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui confirmed that the government's upcoming tokenized bond sale builds on the success of two earlier rounds of tokenized green bonds issued in 2023 and 2024.

The bonds were recorded and settled on distributed ledger technology, according to a Thursday report from Beijing state-owned newspaper Wen wei Po.

Hui said authorities aim to normalize tokenized government bonds in the future. To encourage wider adoption, the government is considering tax incentives, including exemptions on stamp duty for transfers of tokenized exchange-traded funds.

Related: Hong Kong to use Chainlink protocol in CBDC pilot project

Hong Kong's embrace of tokenization comes as part of its broader digital asset strategy outlined in the newly released Digital Asset Development Policy Declaration 2.0.

Last week, the region announced that the new digital asset plan centers on regulating stablecoins and promoting asset tokenization through its “LEAP” framework, aiming for legal clarity, ecosystem growth, real-world adoption and talent development.

As part of the new framework, the government will implement a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers starting Aug. 1, which “will facilitate the development of real-world use cases.”

Meanwhile, the government is consulting the public on proposed licensing rules for digital asset trading platforms and custodians, with the consultation period open until the end of August.

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has also launched the city's first digital asset indexes, offering price benchmarks for Bitcoin and Ethereum during Asian trading hours. The effort aims to attract institutional investors by providing reliable onshore reference prices.

Last month, Hong Kong's financial regulators announced plans to roll out digital asset derivatives trading aimed at professional investors.

The move builds on recent approvals for spot cryptocurrency ETFs, futures products, and staking services. In April, HashKey received authorization to provide staking, underscoring the city's push to establish itself as a top digital finance center.

In May, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Bill, setting the stage for a regulated environment that could cement the city's role as a global hub for digital assets and Web3 innovation.

The incredible relics hail from before the Revolutionary War.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When archaeologists poured the liquid out of two European-manufactured bottles found under a brick floor at George Washington's Mount Vernon mansion, they enjoyed the scent of cherry blossoms. The once-forgotten and now-found bottles were likely filled with cherries before the Revolutionary War in the mid-1770s and have sat sealed—and preserved—ever since. 

As part of a privately funded revitalization project at the Virginia mansion, a brick floor originally laid in the 1770s was torn up, revealing a small pit and the two side-by-side dark green glass bottles, both upright and sealed.

“Not only did we recover intact, sealed bottles, but they contained organic material that can provide us with valuable insight and perspective into 18th-century lives at Mount Vernon,” Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist, says in a statement. “These bottles have the potential to enrich the historic narrative, and we're excited to have the contents analyzed so we can share this discovery with fellow researchers and the visiting public.” 

Once the bottles were discovered, each was moved to the Mount Vernon archaeology lab. Experts determined removing the liquid content could help stabilize the glass that hadn't been directly exposed to the atmosphere for approximately two centuries. Full cherries, including stems and pits, were part of the liquid content, giving off the signature scent of the region, a “blockbuster find of two fully intact glass bottles containing liquid that have not been seen since before the war for American independence,” Doug Bradburn, Mount Vernon president and CEO, says in a statement. 

The glass bottles are from a European manufacturer and archaeologists say, based on shape and style, likely from the 1740s or 1750s, which fits the timeline of needing to be placed in the pit prior to the 1770s floor installation. That makes the cherries likely pre-Revolutionary War fruit.

While the Washingtons were known fans of cherries, the picking and storage of the two bottles likely never touched their hands as the site was known to have over 300 enslaved individuals at the time of George Washington's death. 

The archaeological team plans to ship the bottles off for conservation efforts and the contents will be sent to a laboratory for scientific analysis and testing. 

Boroughs tells the Washington Post that the bottles likely held only cherries when they were originally placed in their location and that amber-colored liquid could be groundwater that got in the bottles once the corks sealing the bottles started to fail as the decades wore on. Despite the liquid and a sort of goo being inside the bottles, early analyses support the only cherry theory, likely stored away to help preserve the fruit for later use in cooking or baking. 

“There are 18th century accounts that talk about proper ways of preserving fruits and vegetables,” Boroughs tells the newspaper. “One of the most common, especially for berries, is to dry them as much as possible … put them in a dry bottle, cork it … and then bury them.” 

That advice may still hold true today, as the cherries held their shape and scent 250 years later.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A shocking new way to make ammonia, no fossil fuels needed","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250704032934.htm","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 06:34:21 GMT","

University of Sydney researchers have harnessed human-made lightning to develop a more efficient method of generating ammonia - one of the world's most important chemicals. Ammonia is also the main ingredient of fertilizers that account for almost half of all global food production.

The team have successfully developed a more straightforward method to produce ammonia (NH3) in gas form. Previous efforts by other laboratories produced ammonia in a solution (ammonium, NH4+), which requires more energy and processes to transform it into the final gas product.

The current method to generate ammonia, the Haber-Bosch process, comes at great climate cost, leaving a huge carbon footprint. It also needs to happen on a large scale and close to sources of cheap natural gas to make it cost-effective.

The chemical process that fed the world, and the Sydney team looking to revolutionize it

Naturally occurring ammonia (mostly in the form of bird droppings), was once so high in demand it fueled wars.

The invention of the Haber-Bosch process in the 19th century made human-made ammonia possible and revolutionized modern agriculture and industry. Currently 90 percent of global ammonia production relies on the Haber-Bosch process.

""Industry's appetite for ammonia is only growing. For the past decade, the global scientific community, including our lab, wants to uncover a more sustainable way to produce ammonia that doesn't rely on fossil fuels.

""Currently, generating ammonia requires centralized production and long-distance transportation of the product. We need a low-cost, decentralized and scalable 'green ammonia',"" said lead researcher Professor PJ Cullen from the University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and the Net Zero Institute. His team has been working on 'green ammonia' production for six years.

""In this research we've successfully developed a method that allows air to be converted to ammonia in its gaseous form using electricity. A huge step towards our goals.""

The research was published in AngewandteChemie International edition.

Ammonia contains three hydrogen molecules, meaning it can be used as an effective carrier and source of hydrogen as an energy source, even potentially as an effective means of storing and transporting hydrogen. Industry bodies have found they can access the hydrogen by 'cracking' ammonia to separate the molecules to use the hydrogen.

Ammonia is also a strong candidate for use as a carbon-free fuel due to its chemical make-up. This has caught the interest of the shipping industry which is responsible for about 3 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

Cracking a chemical conundrum 

Professor Cullen's team's new method to generate ammonia works by harnessing the power of plasma, by electrifying or exciting the air.

But the star is a membrane-based electrolyser, a seemingly non-descript silver box, where the conversion to gaseous ammonia happens.

During the Haber-Bosch process, ammonia (NH3) is made by combining nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases under high temperatures and pressure in the presence of catalyst (a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction).

The plasma-based method Professor Cullen's team developed uses electricity to excite nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air. The team then passes these excited molecules to the membrane-based electrolyser to convert the excited molecules to ammonia.

The researchers said this is a more straightforward pathway for ammonia production.

Professor Cullen said the findings signal a new phase in making green ammonia possible. The team is now working on making the method more energy efficient and competitive compared to the Haber-Bosch process.

""This new approach is a two-step process, namely combining plasma and electrolysis. We have already made the plasma component viable in terms of energy efficiency and scalability.

""To create a more complete solution to a sustainable ammonia productive, we need to push the energy efficiency of the electrolyzer component,"" Professor Cullen said.

In physics, there are two great pillars of thought that don't quite fit together. The Standard Model of particle physics describes all known fundamental particles and three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Meanwhile, Einstein's general relativity describes gravity and the fabric of spacetime.

However, these frameworks are fundamentally incompatible in many ways, says Jonathan Heckman, a theoretical physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. The Standard Model treats forces as dynamic fields of particles, while general relativity treats gravity as the smooth geometry of spacetime, so gravity ""doesn't fit into physics' Standard Model,"" he explains.

In a recent paper, Heckman; Rebecca Hicks, a Ph.D. student at Penn's School of Arts & Sciences; and their collaborators turn that critique on its head. Instead of asking what string theory predicts, the authors ask what it definitively cannot create. Their answer points to a single exotic particle that could show up at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). If that particle appears, the entire string-theory edifice would be, in Heckman's words, ""in enormous trouble.""

 String theory: the good, the bad, the energy-hungry 

For decades, physicists have sought a unified theory that can reconcile quantum mechanics,and, by extension, the behavior of subatomic particles, with gravity -- which is described as a dynamic force in general relativity but is not fully understood within quantum contexts, Heckman says. A good contender for marrying gravity and quantum phenomena is string theory, which posits that all particles, including a hypothetical one representing gravity, are tiny vibrating strings and which promises a single framework encompassing all forces and matter. ""But one of the drawbacks of string theory is that it operates in high-dimensional math and a vast 'landscape' of possible universes, making it fiendishly difficult to test experimentally,"" Heckman says, pointing to how string theory necessitates more than the familiar four dimensions -- x, y, z, and time -- to be mathematically consistent.

""Most versions of string theory require a total of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions, with the extra dimensions being sort of 'curled up' or folding in on one another to extremely small scales,"" Hicks says.

To make matters even trickier, string theory's distinctive behaviors only clearly reveal themselves at enormous energies, ""those far beyond what we typically encounter or even generate in current colliders,"" Heckman says.

Hicks likens it to zooming in on a distant object: at everyday, lower energies, strings look like regular point-like particles, just as a faraway rope might appear to be a single line. ""But when you crank the energy way up, you start seeing the interactions as they truly are -- strings vibrating and colliding,"" she explains. ""At lower energies, the details get lost, and we just see the familiar particles again. It's like how from far away, you can't make out the individual fibers in the rope. You just see a single, smooth line.""

That's why physicists hunting for signatures of string theory must push their colliders -- like the LHC -- to ever-higher energies, hoping to catch glimpses of fundamental strings rather than just their lower-energy disguises as ordinary particles.

 Why serve string theory a particle it likely won't be able to return? 

Testing a theory often means searching for predictions that confirm its validity. But a more powerful test, Heckman says, is finding exactly where a theory fails. If scientists discover that something a theory forbids actually exists, the theory is fundamentally incomplete or flawed. Because string theory's predictions are vast and varied, the researchers instead asked if there's a simple particle scenario that string theory just can't accommodate.

They zeroed in on how string theory deals with particle ""families,"" groups of related particles bound together by the rules of the weak nuclear force, responsible for radioactive decay. Typically, particle families are small packages, like the electron and its neutrino sibling, that form a tidy two-member package called a doublet. String theory handles these modest particle families fairly well, without issue.

However, Heckman and Hicks identified a family that is conspicuously absent from any known string-based calculation: a five-member particle package, or a 5-plet. Heckman likens this to trying to order a Whopper meal from McDonald's, ""no matter how creatively you search the menu, it never materializes.""

""We scoured every toolbox we have, and this five-member package just never shows up,"" Heckman says. But what exactly is this elusive 5-plet?

Hicks explains it as an expanded version of the doublet, ""the 5-plet is its supersized cousin, packing five related particles together."" Physicists encapsulate this particle family in a concise mathematical formula known as the Lagrangian, essentially the particle-physics cookbook. The particle itself is called a Majorana fermion, meaning it acts as its own antiparticle, akin to a coin that has heads on both sides. Identifying such a particle would directly contradict what current string theory models predict is possible, making the detection of this specific particle family at the LHC a high-stakes test, one that could potentially snap string theory.

 Why a 5-plet hasn't been spotted and the vanishing-Track clue 

Hicks cites two major hurdles for spotting these 5-plet structures: ""production and subtlety."" In a collider, energy can literally turn into mass; Einstein's E = mc² says that enough kinetic oomph (E) can be converted into the heft (m) of brand-new particles, so the heavier the quarry the rarer the creation event.

""The LHC has to slam protons together hard enough to conjure these hefty particles out of pure energy,"" Hicks explains, citing Einstein's E = mc², which directly links energy (E) to mass (m). ""As the masses of these particles climb toward a trillion electron volts, the chance of creating them drops dramatically.""

Even if produced, detection is challenging. The charged particles in the 5-plet decay very quickly into nearly invisible products. ""The heavier states decay into a soft pion and an invisible neutral particle, zero (X0),"" Hicks says. ""The pion is so low-energy it's basically invisible, and X0 passes straight through. The result is a track that vanishes mid-detector, like footprints in snow suddenly stopping.""

Those signature tracks get picked up by LHC's ATLAS (short for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), house-sized ""digital cameras"" wrapped around the collision center. They sit at opposite collision points and operate independently, giving the physics community two sets of eyes on every big discovery. Penn physicists like Hicks are part of the ATLAS Collaboration, helping perform the searches that look for quirky signals like disappearing tracks.

Why a 5-plet matters for dark matter 

Hicks says finding the 5-plet isn't only important for testing string theory, pointing to another exciting possibility: ""The neutral member of the 5-plet could explain dark matter, the mysterious mass shaping up most of our universe's matter.""

Dark matter constitutes roughly 85 percent of all matter in the universe, yet scientists still don't know what exactly it is. ""If the 5-plet weighs around 10 TeV -- about 10,000 proton masses -- it neatly fits theories about dark matter's formation after the Big Bang,"" Hicks says. ""Even lighter 5-plets could still play a role as part of a broader dark matter landscape.""

""If we detect a 5-plet, it's a double win,"" says Hicks. ""We'd have disproven key predictions of string theory and simultaneously uncovered new clues about dark matter.""

 What the LHC has already ruled out 

Using existing ATLAS data from collider runs, the team searched specifically for 5-plet signals.""We reinterpreted searches originally designed for 'charginos' -- hypothetical charged particles predicted by supersymmetry -- and looked for 5-plet signatures,"" Hicks says of the team's search through the repurposed ATLAS disappearing-track data. ""We found no evidence yet, which means any 5-plet particle must weigh at least 650-700 GeV, five times heavier than the Higgs boson.""

For context, Heckman says, ""this early result is already a strong statement; it means lighter 5-plets don't exist. But heavier ones are still very much on the table.""

Future searches with upgraded LHC experiments promise even sharper tests. ""We're not rooting for string theory to fail,"" Hicks says. ""We're stress-testing it, applying more pressure to see if it holds up.""

""If string theory survives, fantastic,"" Heckman says. ""If it snaps, we'll learn something profound about nature.""

Imagine the magnificent glaciers of Greenland, the eternal snow of the Tibetan high mountains, and the permanently ice-cold groundwater in Finland. As cold and beautiful these are, for the structural biologist Kirill Kovalev, they are more importantly home to unusual molecules that could control brain cells' activity.

Kovalev, EIPOD Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL Hamburg's Schneider Group and EMBL-EBI's Bateman Group, is a physicist passionate about solving biological problems. He is particularly hooked by rhodopsins, a group of colorful proteins that enable aquatic microorganisms to harness sunlight for energy.

""In my work, I search for unusual rhodopsins and try to understand what they do,"" said Kovalev. ""Such molecules could have undiscovered functions that we could benefit from.""

Some rhodopsins have already been modified to serve as light-operated switches for electrical activity in cells. This technique, called optogenetics, is used by neuroscientists to selectively control neuronal activity during experiments. Rhodopsins with other abilities, such as enzymatic activity, could be used to control chemical reactions with light, for example.

Having studied rhodopsins for years, Kovalev thought he knew them inside out - until he discovered a new, obscure group of rhodopsins that were unlike anything he had seen before.

As it often happens in science, it started serendipitously. While browsing online protein databases, Kovalev spotted an unusual feature common to microbial rhodopsins found exclusively in very cold environments, such as glaciers and high mountains. ""That's weird,"" he thought. After all, rhodopsins are something you typically find in seas and lakes.

These cold-climate rhodopsins were almost identical to each other, even though they evolved thousands of kilometres apart. This couldn't be a coincidence. They must be essential for surviving in the cold, concluded Kovalev, and to acknowledge this, he named them 'cryorhodopsins'.

Rhodopsins out of the blue 

Kovalev wanted to know more: what these rhodopsins look like, how they work, and, in particular, what color they are.

Color is the key feature of each rhodopsin. Most are pink-orange - they reflect pink and orange light, and absorb green and blue light, which activates them. Scientists strive to create a palette of different colored rhodopsins, so they could control neuronal activity with more precision. Blue rhodopsins have been especially sought-after because they are activated by red light, which penetrates tissues more deeply and non-invasively.

To Kovalev's amazement, the cryorhodopsins he examined in the lab revealed an unexpected diversity of colors, and, most importantly, some were blue.

The color of each rhodopsin is determined by its molecular structure, which dictates the wavelengths of light it absorbs and reflects. Any changes in this structure can alter the color.

""I can actually tell what's going on with cryorhodopsin simply by looking at its color,"" laughed Kovalev.

Applying advanced structural biology techniques, he figured out that the secret to the blue color is the same rare structural feature that he originally spotted in the protein databases.

""Now that we understand what makes them blue, we can design synthetic blue rhodopsins tailored to different applications,"" said Kovalev.

Next, Kovalev's collaborators examined cryorhodopsins in cultured brain cells. When cells expressing cryorhodopsins were exposed to UV light, it induced electric currents inside them. Interestingly, if the researchers illuminated the cells right afterwards with green light, the cells became more excitable, whereas if they used UV/red light instead, it reduced the cells' excitability.

""New optogenetic tools to efficiently switch the cell's electric activity both 'on' and 'off' would be incredibly useful in research, biotechnology and medicine,"" said Tobias Moser, Group Leader at the University Medical Center Göttingen who participated in the study. ""For example, in my group, we develop new optical cochlear implants for patients that can optogenetically restore hearing in patients. Developing the utility of such a multi-purpose rhodopsin for future applications is an important task for the next studies.""

""Our cryorhodopsins aren't ready to be used as tools yet, but they're an excellent prototype. They have all the key features that, based on our findings, could be engineered to become more effective for optogenetics,"" said Kovalev.

Evolution's UV light protector

When exposed to sunlight even on a rainy winter day in Hamburg, cryorhodopsins can sense UV light, as shown using advanced spectroscopy by Kovalev's collaborators from Goethe University Frankfurt led by Josef Wachtveitl. Wachtveitl's team showed that cryorhodopsins are in fact the slowest among all rhodopsins in their response to light. This made the scientists suspect that those cryorhodopsins might act like photosensors letting the microbes 'see' UV light - a property unheard of among other cryorhodopsins.

""Can they really do that?"" Kovalev kept asking himself. A typical sensor protein teams up with a messenger molecule that passes information from the cell membrane to the cell's inside.

Kovalev grew more convinced, when together with his collaborators from Alicante, Spain, and his EIPOD co-supervisor, Alex Bateman from EMBL-EBI, they noticed that the cryorhodopsin gene is always accompanied by a gene encoding a tiny protein of unknown function - likely inherited together, and possibly functionally linked.

Kovalev wondered if this might be the missing messenger. Using the AI tool AlphaFold, the team were able to show that five copies of the small protein would form a ring and interact with the cryorhodopsin. According to their predictions, the small protein sits poised against the cryorhodopsin inside the cell. They believe that when cryorhodopsin detects UV light, the small protein could depart to carry this information into the cell.

""It was fascinating to uncover a new mechanism via which the light-sensitive signal from cryorhodopsins could be passed on to other parts of the cell. It is always a thrill to learn what the functions are for uncharacterised proteins. In fact, we find these proteins also in organisms that do not contain cryorhodopsin, perhaps hinting at a much wider range of jobs for these proteins.""

Why cryorhodopsins evolved their astonishing dual function - and why only in cold environments - remains a mystery.

""We suspect that cryorhodopsins evolved their unique features not because of the cold, but rather to let microbes sense UV light, which can be harmful to them,"" said Kovalev. ""In cold environments, such as the top of a mountain, bacteria face intense UV radiation. Cryorhodopsins might help them sense it, so they could protect themselves. This hypothesis aligns well with our findings.""

""Discovering extraordinary molecules like these wouldn't be possible without scientific expeditions to often remote locations, to study the adaptations of the organisms living there,"" added Kovalev. ""We can learn so much from that!""

Unique approach to unique molecules

To reveal the fascinating biology of cryorhodopsins, Kovalev and his collaborators had to overcome several technical challenges.

One was that cryorhodopsins are nearly identical in structure, and even a slight change in the position of a single atom can result in different properties. Studying molecules at this level of detail requires going beyond standard experimental methods. Kovalev applied a 4D structural biology approach, combining X-ray crystallography at EMBL Hamburg beamline P14 and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the group of Albert Guskov in Groningen, Netherlands, with protein activation by light.

""I actually chose to do my postdoc at EMBL Hamburg, because of the unique beamline setup that made my project possible,"" said Kovalev. ""The whole P14 beamline team worked together to tailor the setup to my experiments - I'm very grateful for their help.""

Another challenge was that cryorhodopsins are extremely sensitive to light. For this reason, Kovalev's collaborators had to learn to work with the samples in almost complete darkness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The surprising link between hearing loss, loneliness, and lifespan","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250705083949.htm","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 14:27:17 GMT","

Hearing loss doesn't just affect how people hear the world -- it can also change how they connect with it.

A new study from the USC Caruso Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, part of Keck Medicine of USC, published today in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, is the first to link hearing aids and cochlear implants, surgically implanted devices that help those with profound hearing loss perceive sound, to improved social lives among adults with hearing loss.

""We found that adults with hearing loss who used hearing aids or cochlear implants were more socially engaged and felt less isolated compared to those who didn't use them,"" said Janet Choi, MD, MPH, an otolaryngologist with Keck Medicine and lead researcher of the study. ""This suggests that hearing devices may help prevent the social disconnection and broader health consequences that can follow untreated hearing loss.""

Hearing loss affects an estimated 40 million American adults, yet many go untreated. When left unaddressed, hearing loss can make communication difficult, leading people to withdraw from conversations and social activities, according to Choi.

Previous research has shown that over time, social withdrawal can reduce mental stimulation and increase the risk of loneliness, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline and dementia. It has also linked chronic social isolation to biological and neurological changes, including increased brain inflammation and alterations in brain structure.

""Understanding the link between hearing loss, hearing device use and social isolation is crucial,"" said Choi. ""Until this study, it has been unclear whether hearing devices could help reverse the isolation.""

Choi and her fellow researchers conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of 65 previously published studies, encompassing over five thousand participants, on how hearing aids and cochlear implants affect three key measures: social quality of life, perceived social handicap, which refers to the limitations and frustrations hearing loss can create in social situations, and loneliness.

The researchers found that adults using hearing devices feel more socially connected and less limited in social situations. They are better able to engage in group conversations and feel more at ease in noisy or challenging listening environments. Participants also reported feeling less socially handicapped by their hearing loss, with fewer barriers and frustrations during interactions and an improved ability to stay engaged without feeling excluded. This increased confidence can help users connect more easily with family, friends and colleagues, leading to stronger feelings of belonging and reduced social anxiety. The study also suggested hearing devices may reduce loneliness, although further research is needed in this area, according to Choi.

Those with cochlear implants reported the most improvement in their social quality of life. This is likely because cochlear implants offer greater hearing restoration than hearing aids, especially for individuals with more severe hearing loss. As a result, they may experience more noticeable improvements in social engagement once their hearing is restored.

While it was outside the scope of the study to measure how better social lives relate to improved cognitive outcomes, Choi believes there may be a connection, as previous research has found managing hearing loss may be key to reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. ""While our study didn't directly measure cognitive outcomes, the improvements we saw in communication and social engagement suggest that by restoring clearer communication, hearing devices may help preserve cognitive health by keeping the brain more actively involved and people more connected,"" Choi said.

This research follows a January 2024 study by Choi showing that adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids have an almost 25% lower risk of mortality, suggesting that treating hearing loss can improve lifespan as well as social quality of life.

""These new findings add to a growing body of research showing that hearing health is deeply connected to overall well-being,"" said Choi. ""We hope this encourages more people to seek treatment and helps clinicians start conversations with patients about how hearing devices can improve their quality of life.""

For years, scientists have debated whether a giant thick ice shelf once covered the entire Arctic Ocean during the coldest ice ages. Now a new study published in Science Advances, challenges this idea as the research team found no evidence for the presence of a massive ~1km ice shelf. Instead, the Arctic Ocean appears to have been covered by seasonal sea ice -- leaving open water and life-sustaining conditions even during the harshest periods of cold periods during the last 750,000 years. This discovery gives insights crucial for our understanding of how the Arctic has responded to climate change in the past -- and how it might behave in the future.

Tiny traces of life in ancient mud

Led by the European Research Council Synergy Grant project Into the Blue -- i2B, the research team studied sediment cores collected from the seafloor of the central Nordic Seas and Yermak Plateau, north of Svalbard. These cores hold tiny chemical fingerprints from algae that lived in the ocean long ago. Some of these algae only grow in open water, while others thrive under seasonal sea ice that forms and melts each year.

""Our sediment cores show that marine life was active even during the coldest times,"" said Jochen Knies, lead author of the study, based at UiT The Arctic University of Norway and co-lead of the Into The Blue -- i2B project. ""That tells us there must have been light and open water at the surface. You wouldn't see that if the entire Arctic was locked under a kilometre-thick slab of ice.""

One of the key indicators the team looked for was a molecule called IP25, which is produced by algae that live in seasonal sea ice. Its regular appearance in the sediments shows that sea ice came and went with the seasons, rather than staying frozen solid all year round.

Simulating ancient Arctic climates

To test the findings based on the geological records, the research team used the AWI Earth System Model -- a high-resolution computer model -- to simulate Arctic conditions during two especially cold periods: the Last Glacial Maximum around 21,000 years ago, and a deeper freeze about 140,000 years ago when large ice sheets covered a lot of the Arctic.

""The models support what we found in the sediments,"" said Knies. ""Even during these extreme glaciations, warm Atlantic water still flowed into the Arctic gateway. This helped keep some parts of the ocean from freezing over completely.""

The models also showed that the ice wasn't static. Instead, it shifted with the seasons, creating openings in the ice where light could reach the water -- and where life could continue to thrive. This research not only reshapes our view of past Arctic climates but also has implications for future climate predictions. Understanding how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate extremes can improve models that project future changes in a warming world.

""These reconstructions help us understand what's possible -- and what's not -- when it comes to ice cover and ocean dynamics,"" said Gerrit Lohmann, co-author of this study, based at Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and co-lead of Into The Blue -- i2B. ""That matters when trying to anticipate how ice sheets and sea ice might behave in the future.""

Re-thinking the giant ice shelf theory

Some scientists have argued that features on the Arctic seafloor suggest that a huge, grounded ice shelf once covered the entire ocean. But this new study offers another explanation.

""There may have been short-lived ice shelves in some parts of the Arctic during especially severe cold phases,"" said Knies. ""But we don't see any sign of a single, massive ice shelf that covered everything for thousands of years.""

One possible exception could have occurred about 650,000 years ago, when biological activity in the sediment record dropped sharply. But even then, the evidence points to a temporary event, not a long-lasting frozen lid over the Arctic.

Understanding the Arctic's future

The study sheds new light on how the Arctic has behaved under extreme conditions in the past. This matters because the Arctic is changing rapidly today. Knowing how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate shifts helps scientists understand what might lie ahead.

""These past patterns help us understand what's possible in future scenarios,"" said Knies. ""We need to know how the Arctic behaves under stress -- and what tipping points to watch for -- as the Arctic responds to a warming world.""

The full paper, ""Seasonal sea ice characterized the glacial Arctic-Atlantic gateway over the past 750,000 years,"" is available in Science Advances.

This research is part of the European Research Council Synergy Grant project Into the Blue -- i2B and the Research Council of Norway Centre of Excellence, iC3: Centre for ice, Cryosphere, Carbon, and Climate.

C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination represents a promising approach for synthesizing various amines, facilitating applications from late-stage scaffold hopping to the degradation of polymers and biomass. However, it remains challenging due to the inertness of the C-C bond and difficulties in controlling regio- and chemo-selectivity. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons using nitriles, amides, and sulfonamides as nucleophiles. This process occurs under mild conditions with hydrogen evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. Mechanism involves successive anodic oxidative cleavage of the benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond to generate two carbocation fragments, which are subsequently captured by nucleophiles to form two C-N bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that HFIP is critical as additive in adjusting the oxidation potentials of alkylbenzene substrates and amine products, effectively preventing overoxidation of products.

Aliphatic C–H and C–C bonds are most fundamental chemical bonds that are widely present in organic compounds1,2. Direct functionalization of these inert aliphatic bonds represents a cornerstone in modern organicchemistry. In particular, the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)–H bonds to construct new carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds has been extensively studied3. In contrast, the functionalization of ubiquitous benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds has been much less explored4, despite their prevalence and significant potential for enabling late-stage scaffold hopping and facilitating the degradation of persistent polymers and biomass (Fig. 1a). To date, several primary strategies have been developed for C(sp³)–C(sp³) bond cleavage. The first involves ring strain-releasing in a strained system via oxidative addition of low-valent transition metals into C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond5,6, or single-electron transfer (SET) processes to generate cationic or anionic radicals that drive C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage and enable difunctionalization7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Another strategy relies on SET or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-mediated activation of redox-active groups, generating transient oxygen or nitrogen radicals that undergo rapid β-scission16,17,18,19,20,21. Nevertheless, employing such strategies to cleave and functionalize C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds in acyclic, ubiquitous aromatic hydrocarbons, such as ethane derivatives, still remains a challenging and highly desirable goal due to inherent thermodynamic stability of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond and low polarization of such substrates. An early example by Alnibi's group demonstrated C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage of multi-aryl ethanes via arene radical cation intermediates to form C-O bond under photooxidation conditions22. Recently, Huang and Chen's group described the elegant photooxidative cleavage of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons to form new C–C bond23. More recently, Yu's group made significant breakthroughs in the electro-reductive carboxylation of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2, enabling reductive C–C bond cleavage through radical anion intervention24. These advancements have significantly expanded the toolbox for C–C and C-O bond formation. Despite this progress, the direct benzylic (sp3)–C(sp3) amination in aromatic hydrocarbons to form C–N bonds remains elusive for several challenges (Fig. 1b). Firstly, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds are among the most abundant yet the most difficult to cleavage. Secondly, achieving high selectivity is complicated by the coexistence of similar surrounding C–H and C–C bonds. Finally, the risk of overoxidation presents a major challenge in C–C amination chemistry, particularly when the introduced nitrogen lacks sufficient deactivation (e.g., through tosyl protection). Addressing these challenges would open new avenues in C–N bond-forming methodologies and significantly expand the scope of amination chemistry.

Recently, electrochemical25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 amination of benzylic C(sp3)–H have been established44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53, providing green approaches for C–N bond formation. For example, Xu's group developed a site-selective electrochemical amination reaction that efficiently converts benzylic C–H bonds into C–N linkages52. Lambert's group described a method for benzylic C–H bond amination via an electrophotocatalytic Ritter-type reaction53. In both cases, the electrochemical single-electron oxidation of the arene substrate to generate an arene radical cation was identified as the key initial step. Building on these previous reports, and given the prevalence and biological significance of amines, we hypothesized that an electro-oxidative method could be developed to induce the amination of widely available benzylic C–C bonds via arene radical cation induced C–C bond cleavage. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons via HFIP-mediated oxidation potential sorting (Fig. 1c). Notable features of this strategy include: (a) amination of both carbon fragments, dual C–N bond formation from a single C–C cleavage with 200% atom utilization, both resulting carbocationic fragments are efficiently captured via nucleophilic amination, maximizing molecular efficiency and avoiding wasteful byproducts; (b) oxidants free, with hydrogen evolution as the byproduct; (c) highly selective cleavage of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds; (d) broad substrate scope, robustness, air tolerance, insensitivity to water, large-scale synthesis; and (e) highly valuable products were formed.

Initially, butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) was selected as the model substrate, and various reaction conditions were tested under a constant voltage for the electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C–C bonds. After thorough optimization, the Ritter-type amination product 1 was obtained in 26% 1H NMR yield under constant voltage (2.4 V) in MeCN, using Et4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte, carbon cloth as the anode, and a Pt plate as the cathode (Table 1, entry 1). Several electrolytes were tested (entries 2 and 3), with LiClO4 and Et4NOTs yielding only trace amounts of product. We attribute this observation to the critical role played by the electrolyte anion in stabilizing key ionic intermediates and modulating the overall reaction environment. Control experiments revealed that the cell voltage played a critical role, as higher voltages (2.6 V and 2.8 V) resulted in lower yields due to overoxidation of the amide product (entries 4 and 5). The presence of an acid was essential for the transformation, as the yield improved to 33% and 53% with HOTf and MsOH, respectively (entries 6 and 7). This enhancement is likely due to the stabilizing effect of the strong acid on the benzylic cation intermediates. Notably, the yield increased to 79% when HFIP was added as an additive (entry 8), possibly due to its ability to prevent product overoxidation. For comparison, the use of other alcohol additives, such as TFE and EtOH, led to a significant decrease in yield (see Table S2). When the reaction time was shortened to 11 h, the yield further increased to 83%, with a total charge consumption of approximately 260 C (entry 9, Eanode = 1.8 V vs SCE, 4.36 mA.cm−2 current density). A control reaction conducted in the absence of electricity produced no product (entry 10), confirming that the transformation proceeds via electrochemical oxidation rather than aerobic oxidation. Regarding the electrode materials, several commonly used combinations were evaluated (entries 11–13). Stainless steel (SS) and nickel (Ni) as cathodes gave inferior results, with lower conversions and diminished selectivity, likely due to inefficient electron transfer and/or competing surface reactions. Among carbon-based anodes, carbon cloth consistently outperformed carbon felt (GF020), affording higher yields under otherwise identical conditions. The relatively poor performance of carbon felt may stem from its higher surface resistance and less uniform current distribution, which can impair reaction efficiency. In addition, conducting the reaction under constant current (10 mA, 6.6 mA/cm² current density) condition resulted in lower yields (entry 14), potentially due to uncontrolled fluctuations in electrode potential that promote undesired oxidative side processes. Finally, we demonstrated that MeCN could function as a reagent (40 equiv.) rather than the reaction solvent, although this modification led to a slight decrease in yield (entry 15). See Table S1 and Table S2 for further details on condition optimization.

After establishing the optimized reaction conditions, we proceeded to investigate the scope and general applicability of the reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Initially, symmetric butane-2,3-diyldibenzene substrates were tested. Both butane-2,3-diyldibenzene and 4,4'-dihalogenated butane-2,3-diyldibenzene gave rise to the corresponding benzylacetamides (1–4) in good yields. A range of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene derivatives with various electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene rings were also found to be suitable, yielding the corresponding amination products in moderate yields (2–6, 12–17). Notably, the aldehyde functional group, despite its well-known sensitivity to oxidative conditions, was well tolerated under our electrochemical protocol (14), although a significant amount of starting material was recovered, likely due to its limited reactivity under the current conditions. When examining substrates designed to probe the competition between benzylic C–H and benzylic C–C bonds, we observed that the C–C amination products (7, 8, and 11) were preferentially formed, rather than the alternative benzylic methyl or ethyl-functionalized sites. However, the linear para-n-butyl substrate afforded product 10 in 29% yield, along with 9% competing C–H amination byproduct. Notably, no benzylic C–H amination products were observed at the same benzylic position in branched substrates where C–C bond amination occurred. This strongly supports our hypothesis that C–C cleavage is the kinetically and thermodynamically favored pathway at the benzylic position under the reaction conditions. The main reason for the moderate yields observed with electron-rich substrates is product overoxidation and decomposition. In addition, the competitive formation of ketone side products via C–C bond oxidation (for 9, 40% yield of ketone formed), promoted by trace amounts of water in the system, also contributes to the reduced efficiency (See Section 2.6 ‘Side product analysis' in the Supplementary Information.). We propose that for electron-rich substrates, the high reactivity facilitates rapid C–C bond cleavage, generating highly reactive radical or carbocation intermediates. While these intermediates can undergo competitive side reactions with trace amounts of water present in the system, resulting in the formation of ketone byproducts. For a substrate bearing more electron-donating methoxy groups S18 underwent selective amination to provide the corresponding products in 62% yields (18). The influence of alkyl chain length was also assessed, and all substrates proceeded smoothly under the standard conditions, producing the corresponding amination products in moderate to good yields (19 to 26). For asymmetric substrates with different substituents on the benzene ring or various alkyl groups, two distinct benzylic amination products were obtained (27–29, 31). Unfortunately, the thiophene-substituted amide (30) was not observed due to the degradation of the desired product, as well as substrates bearing a furan moiety (see Fig. S7), likely caused by the low oxidative potential of the thiophene and furan groups. Similarly, substrate 31 underwent smooth carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford the ketone 32 in 27% yield instead of C–C amination product, suggesting that the electron-rich nature of thiophene may render the intermediate species more susceptible to overoxidation. Finally, the average Faradaic efficiency under the optimized conditions is approximately 30%, calculated based on the total charge passed and the amount of product formed (see Fig. S9).

Unsuccessful examples are provided in the Supplementary Information. The total consumed charge and Faradaic efficiency for representative substrates were included in the Supplementary information.

In addition to dibenzyl-substituted substrates, inert, unactivated substrates with bulky alkyl groups can also successfully yield two target products (Fig. 3). Such bulky groups can decrease the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–C bond by stabilizing the formed fragments, thus exerting a thermodynamic and steric effect54,55,56. We examined a series of homobenzylic and neopentylic substrates featuring inert, unactivated aliphatic C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds. For instance, α-methyl neopentylbenzene (compound 33) underwent efficient cleavage and amination, affording two products in moderate yields. Furthermore, various α-branched neopentylbenzenes (compounds 35–38) bearing chains of differing lengths were well tolerated, consistently affording cleaved and aminated products in moderate to good yields. Importantly, increasing steric bulk (e.g., products 1, 41) did not impede the reaction, suggesting that steric hindrance does not critically limit the method's applicability. Notably, the cleavage selectively occurred at the more hindered tertiary center (tert-butyl), while another benzylic C–C bond remained intact, highlighting the excellent regioselectivity of the transformation. In terms of functional group compatibility, our method tolerated a range of oxidatively sensitive groups, including primary alcohols (43), methyl ethers (45), alkyl chlorides (47), and bromides (49). These examples further support the mildness and chemoselectivity of the electrochemical conditions. Mildly electron-deficient alkylbenzenes underwent successful oxidation. Notably, neopentylbenzene bearing a para-tert-butyl substituent afforded the aminated product 34 in 61% yield. In contrast, product 9 was obtained in only a 22% yield, likely due to competing oxidative side reactions leading to ketone formation.

aReaction conditions: substrates (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.1 M), MeCN (3.0 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), TFA (0.5 mL), graphite felt anode, Pt plate cathode, rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.2 V), under air atmosphere.

HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, Me methyl, Et ethyl, Ac acetyl, tBu tert-butyl, nBu n-butyl, nPr n-propyl, nHex n-hexyl.

Using this strategy, we successfully synthesized cycloheptylacetamide 52 and cyclooctylacetamide 54 (Fig. 3). Due to the stability of the dibenzyl radical, the cleavage of such substrates demonstrates excellent regioselectivity. However, it is important to note that the low yield is attributed to the formation of benzophenone ( ~ 20% yield), likely due to trace amounts of water present during the reaction. For unbranched substrate 55, the benzylic C–H amination was the predominant pathway and only 8% C–C cleavage product was detected. Beyond simple hydrocarbons, substrates containing heteroatom substitutions were also tested under standard conditions. For instance, epoxy-containing substrate 58 underwent C–C bond cleavage to generate amide 1 and C–O bond cleaved product 59. It is well known that oxygen and nitrogen atom can initiate β–C–C bond cleavage (61–63) by through-bond delocalization and electron apportionment to the fragments (via cation and radical-stabilizing effects)16,17,18,19,20,21. Under standard reaction conditions, these substrates underwent β–C–C bond cleavage to form the corresponding amides, although the yield was lower for the unbranched substrate 64. We hypothesize that the cleavage of these substrates involves two contributions: (1) the formation of nitrogen or oxygen radicals via electrochemical oxidation, leading to β–C–C bond cleavage; and (2) β–C–C cleavage initiated by aryl cation radicals. For comparison, when using 1,2-diphenylethane 55 as a substrate, only an 8% yield was obtained, suggesting that the formation of oxygen radicals may be involved for the cleavage of primary (1°) alcohol substrates. Lastly, strained ring substrate 64 smoothly underwent ring-opening 1, 3-difunctionalization to yield β-amino ketones 65.

Additionally, further investigation of various nitriles revealed a wide compatibility with Cl (66, 68), Br (67), Pr (69), and Ph (70) (Fig. 4). Other suitable nitrogen nucleophiles included methanesulfonamide (71), ethanesulfonamide (72), oxazolidin-2-one (73), and carbamate (74). Of particular interest is the functionalization of the benzylic C–C bond with oxygen nucleophiles, including acetates (75–80). Notably, a strong electron-withdrawing group, nitro, proved compatible, affording products 78 in 34% yields.

aReaction conditions: For 66–70 and 75–80: S1 (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.2 M), corresponding nitrile solvent (3 mL) or acid solvent (3 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), graphite felt (2 mm) anode, Pt cathode at rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.4 V), under air atmosphere. Isolated yield. bReactions performed with 3.6 mmol nucleophile (71: MsNH2, 72: EtSO2NH2, 73: 2-oxazolidone, 74: urethane) in 3 mL DCM. c0.8 mL TFA was used. dGraphite felt (6.5 mm) was used as anode. e0.1 mmol of substrate. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, DCM dichloromethane, Ac acetyl, Ms methanesulfonyl, nPr n-propyl.

The electrochemical C–C amination reaction was successfully carried out on a gram scale, as illustrated by the synthesis of 1 (Fig. 5), where larger electrodes were used over an extended reaction time. Note that DCM was added as a co-solvent to improve the solubility of the starting material thereby ensuring a homogeneous reaction mixture and maintaining efficient mass and electron transfer throughout the electrolysis process.

HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, DCM dichloromethane, Me methyl, Ac acetyl.

Several mechanistic experiments were carried out to gain insight into the mechanism. Firstly, control experiments were performed to investigate the influence of water and oxygen in the air on the reaction. Under a strictly nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction yield remained stable at around 80%, while no significant promotional effect was observed under oxygen conditions, suggesting that the reaction likely does not involve dioxygen-induced C–C bond cleavage. Furthermore, the impact of varying the amount of water additive was carefully examined, with equivalents ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. The results showed little effect on the yield, indicating that the presence of water does not significantly promote the formation of the target product (Fig. 6a). Additionally, no benzylic alcohol intermediate was detected during the reaction. Besides, when the synthesized benzylic alcohol substrate 81 was subjected to the standard conditions, no product was formed. On the contrary, the substrate almost completely degraded under these conditions (Fig. 6b). These experiments suggest that benzylic tertiary (3°) alcohol is likely not a key intermediate in the reaction, despite numerous reports on C–C bond cleavage initiated by benzylic alcohol-derived oxygen radicals16,17,18,19,20,21.

Furthermore, the electrode voltage was continuously recorded throughout the electrolysis of the model reaction. Anodic oxidation was maintained at approximately 2.16 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 6c). These results are consistent with the oxidative potential of substrates. Furthermore, cyclic voltammograms of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and it's aminated product (1) were recorded in MeCN (Fig. 6d). The results revealed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 2.30 V vs SCE) was oxidized at higher potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.15 V vs SCE), indicating that the aminated product exhibits a greater tendency for over-oxidation in MeCN. In contrast, cyclic voltammograms of S1 and 1 in a MeCN/HFIP (3/1) solvent mixture showed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 1.97 V vs SCE) was oxidized at a bit lower potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.00 V vs SCE) (Fig. 6d). Although the oxidation potentials of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and product (1) differ only slightly, they were effectively distinguished during the preparative electrolysis performed in MeCN/HFIP. The significance of HFIP lies in its ability to stabilize radical cation intermediates, facilitating substrate oxidation while preventing overoxidation of the product52.

Based on these experiments, a plausible mechanism was proposed (Fig. 6e). During the anode phase, single-electron oxidation of the aromatic hydrocarbons A generates the radical cation B, which undergoes homolytic β–C–C bond cleavage to form a benzylic cation C and a radical species E at another position or heterolytic mode of cleavage to generate benzylic radical C′ and species E′, depending on the relative oxidation potentials of the two fragments formed23,57,58. For example, heterolytic cleavage to generate tBu cation is preferred due to the lower oxidation potential of tBu radical (Eox 1/2(tBu·) = 0.41 V vs SCE, Eox 1/2(MeCH2·Ph) = 0.82 V vs SCE, ΔΔG = −23.06 × (0.82–0.41) = −9.5 kcal/mol)59. The process may be reversible, and due to the small intrinsic barrier (0.1–0.2 eV), fragment diffusion from the solvent cage could be the rate-limiting step in endergonic cleavages60,61. The lower intrinsic barrier for C–C bond cleavage compared to deprotonation may account for the observation that C–C bond cleavage effectively competes with C–H bond cleavage. It is worth noting that the oxidation potentials of the generated benzyl and alkyl radical intermediates are typically below 1.0 V vs SCE57. As a result, under the present electrooxidation conditions (Eanode = 2.1 V vs Ag/AgCl), their lifetimes are extremely short, making them difficult to capture and prone to direct oxidation at the anode. Regardless of β–C–C bond cleavage model, above radical intermediates C′ and E undergoes a second, rapid oxidation event directly at the anode, resulting in the formation of final carbocations C and E′. Both carbocations subsequently proceed through the classic Ritter reaction steps to yield the amide product D and F. When nucleophiles such as sulfonamides, amides, or carboxylic acids were employed, the corresponding cross-coupling products were formed. Meanwhile, the redox reaction is balanced by cathodic proton reduction, leading to the production of hydrogen. Notably, due to the extensive use of bulky alkyl substituents and biaryl substrates in this work, in most cases, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) cleavage competes effectively with C–H bond cleavage. Thus, the formation of benzyl tertiary (3°) alcohols or benzyl hydroperoxide species is unfavorable under these conditions.

In summary, we have developed an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) amination reaction that operates under mild conditions with H2 evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. This method is not only suitable for the efficient and scalable synthesis of benzylic amines but also demonstrates excellent compatibility with various nucleophiles, demonstrating significant potential for advancing sustainable C–C functionalization reactions using simple materials.

The solution was then stirred at room temperature and electrolysis was initiated at a control voltage of 2.4 V for the specified amount of time. After completion of the reaction as monitored by TLC (usually 8–18 h), the reaction mixture was poured into a saturated sodium carbonate solution (ca. 20 mL). The carbon cloth anode was washed with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL) and these washes were added to the reaction mixture. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

You know your software is a success when its name becomes a verb: You'll now commonly hear about images being photoshopped, even if the editing wasn't done with the Adobe image editor. Adobe might not like it, but the usage shows how dominant its flagship product has become.

On mobile though, Photoshop hasn't achieved the same kind of ubiquity or brand recognition. We've had official Photoshop apps of various types down the years, but none of them have really translated the power and feature set of the desktop application over to smaller devices in a way that fully works.

Now, Adobe is trying again: The all-new Photoshop app (available now for iOS, and just released in beta for Android), is Photoshop ""reimagined"" for a smartphone. The app attempts to bring over as many of the tools and features of the full software as it can, while optimizing them for use on a mobile touchscreen.

While it's impossible to port everything over—in the same way macOS wouldn't work on an iPhone—there's a lot to explore in the new Photoshop app. You can download it for free on iOS, though some features require a premium subscription (either $7 a month for the new Mobile and Web plan, or an existing Photoshop plan). Android users can download the beta version and use it entirely for free for a limited time. Regular pricing will kick in when the app becomes generally available worldwide.

By default, when you open up a new image in the iOS version, you'll be invited to apply a “quick action” to it. (Android users, this is coming soon.) If you'd rather just go straight to the full editing interface every time, check the Don't show this again box, and tap Go to editor. However, if you are wanting to apply a basic effect in as little time as possible, these quick actions can be helpful.

You'll see they all involve backgrounds. Tap Hide background, and Photoshop tries to identify the main subject of the image, and cut out the rest—you can then drop in any kind of replacement background you like. Alternatively, there's Solid color background, which drops in a color you can edit, or Black & white background, which keeps the subject in color but turns everything else grayscale.

Whichever one you pick, Photoshop will take care of creating a new layer for you, so you can work on the foreground and background independently. You'll see the layers are available via the thumbnail down in the lower right corner of the image. With the solid color background, for example, tap the layer thumbnail, then the left arrow, then Edit color to switch to a different shade.

Choosing an adjustment layer.

Layers and masks are essentially what separates basic image editors from advanced ones, letting you stack different elements in an image on top of each other (layers) and make edits to them (masks). If you've used a quick action you'll already have a layer created for you, but you can create new ones by tapping the + (plus) button just above the bottom toolbar on the right.

The layer types, including Fill layer (which fills an entire layer with colors and gradients) and Adjustment layer (which tweaks the colors and tones of everything below it in the stack of layers), follow those you'll find in Photoshop on the desktop. Each layer comes with its own settings for you to configure, which vary depending on the layer type. You can get to these settings at any time via Layer properties on the toolbar.

Use the Create mask button from Layer properties to build up a mask, either with one-tap or freehand selections. (You'll see Edit mask if one has already been created.) Further layer options can be accessed by tapping on the three dots next to a layer in the full list. You're able to merge, duplicate, and delete layers, like you can in the full Photoshop software.

You've got a choice of selection tools.

Many photo edits rely on accurate selections of some kind, and the Photoshop mobile app gives you a fine level of control here. Tap Select area from the bottom toolbar, and you've got seven different selection tools to pick from, including Tap select, Quick select brush, and Magic wand.

There are also simple Rectangle and Ellipse selection options, and you can use them in combination to select the exact area you need highlighted. Tap the - (minus) button to take away from the current selection rather than adding to it. When the selection is made, tap the check icon to confirm.

You're then presented with further options you can apply to the selection. You can add a generative AI fill, make basic adjustments such as brightness and contrast tweaks, and turn the selection into a mask for further manipulation. Just above these options, you have buttons for expanding, shrinking, and inverting the selection.

The Clone stamp is one of the tools transferred from the desktop app.

Photoshop is well known for its comprehensive tool selection of course, and many of these tools have made it over to the new mobile app: Open up an image in the editor and you'll see them lined up at the bottom of the screen. To change the zoom level of the image you're looking at, put two fingers on screen then bring them together or move them apart.

Tap Retouch, and you can access the Spot heal tool (for smoothing out inconsistencies), the Clone stamp tool (for duplicating one part of the image somewhere else), and Lighten and Darken selected parts of the image. Some tools show a small slider icon next to them—tap this to set options such as brush size.

Back on the main toolbar, tap Brush to paint over part of your image. Again, there's a selection of small sliders you can use to set the brush size, opacity, and color. At any point you can switch to the eraser (it's the icon next to the brush) to rub out parts of a layer, rather than painting on top of it.

Once you get comfortable with the different tools and options on offer, and see how they fit together, you can achieve some impressive results using just your phone.

Tap the lightbulb icon in the top right for more help. At any time, you can use the undo or redo buttons up at the top to go backwards or forwards in your edits. Tap the cog icon up in the top right corner to save your image or access the app's settings.

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In the early 1900s, long before smartphones and selfie sticks, tourists flocked to Yellowstone National Park—not for the geysers or scenery, but for a grotesque show: a nightly spectacle of grizzly bears raiding cafeteria scraps from open-pit landfills like desperate, starving pirates.

The bears were in dangerous proximity to humans: Hungry bears tore at open car windows. Tourists posed a little too close with their film cameras. Yellowstone park rangers logged dozens of injuries each year—nearly 50 on average.

Eventually, the Park Service ended the nightly landfill shows: Feeding wild animals human food wasn't just dangerous, it was unnatural. Bears, ecologists argued, should eat berries, nuts, elk—not leftover Twinkies. In 1970, the park finally shut down the landfills for good.

By then, though, grizzlies were in deep trouble. As few as 700 remained in the lower 48 states, down from the estimated 50,000 that once roamed the 18 western states. Decades of trapping, shooting, and poisoning had brought them to the brink. The ones that clung to survival in Yellowstone National Park learned to take what scraps they could get and when they were forced to forage elsewhere, it didn't go so well.

More bears died. Their already fragile population in the Yellowstone region dipped to fewer than 250, though one publication says the number could have been as low as 136, according to Frank van Manen, who spent 14 years leading the US Geological Survey's grizzly bear study team and now serves as an emeritus ecologist.

The Yellowstone bears had been trained to rely on us. And when we cut them off, their population tanked.

And so in 1975, the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed grizzly bears on the endangered species list, the country's most powerful legal mechanism to stave off extinction.

The grizzly's place on the list afforded them some important protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Hunting was off-limits, as was trapping or poisoning, and the listing included rigorous habitat protections. Grizzlies slowly came back.

In 1957, Yellowstone tourists often got a little too close for comfort—like this driver, who leans out the window to snap a photo of a mother bear and her cubs. Today, this kind of wildlife encounter would be a big no-no for safety reasons.

Today, more than 1,000 grizzly bears live in and around Yellowstone alone, and tourists who visit the park by the millions every year can observe the bears—no longer desperately feeding on trash but lumbering in and out of meadows with their trailing cubs, or sitting on their haunches feasting on elk carcasses.

The recovery effort was a major success, but it's brought a whole new slate of issues.

In recent years, grizzlies have spilled out of their stronghold in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem—a broad swath of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming—and into human territory, where coexistence gets messy. In 2024 alone, more than 60 grizzlies were killed in Wyoming, most of them lethally removed by wildlife officials after killing cattle, breaking into cabins and trash cans, or lingering in residential neighborhoods.

It's the classic species recovery paradox: The more bears succeed and their populations expand, the more trouble they get into with humans.

And now, a controversial debate rages over whether or not to delist the grizzly bear. No species is meant to be a permanent resident on the endangered species list. The whole point of the ESA is to help species recover to the point where they're no longer endangered. A delisting would underscore that the grizzlies didn't just scrape by in the Yellowstone area—they exceeded every population requirement in becoming a thriving, self-sustaining population of at least 500 bears.

But to remove federal protection would mean grizzly bears would face increasing threats to their survival at a time when some biologists argue the species' recovery is shaky at best.

The stakes here are bigger than just the grizzly bear alone—what happens next is about proving that the ESA works, and that sustained recovery is possible, and that ESA protection leads to progress. Because if a species like the grizzly, which has met every biological benchmark, still can't graduate from the list, then what is the list for?

“The [ESA] is literally one of the strictest wildlife protection laws in the world…but in order for people to buy into it, they have to have respect for it,” says Kelly Heber Dunning, a University of Wyoming professor who studies wildlife conflict. “If it starts to be seen as…part of the culture war, that buy-in will go away.”

Since President Donald Trump has taken office, the Republican Party's assault on the Endangered Species Act hasn't been subtle.

The Fix Our Forests Act—which sounds like it attempts a wildfire and forest health solution—actually fast-tracks large-scale logging at the expense of fragile ecosystems and imperiled species. Trump allies in Congress, like Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert with the Pet and Livestock Protection Act, flagrantly prioritize political agendas over science, according to the nonprofit National Resources Defense Council. The House Natural Resources Committee has also suggested weakening the Marine Mammal Protection Act with an apparent intent to unravel protections for species like the North Atlantic right whale and the Gulf of Mexico Rice's whale. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has called to remove “burdensome regulations” standing in the way of Trump's desire to unleash America's energy potential. Project 2025, the conservative playbook, even explicitly calls to delist the grizzly bear.

But ironically, to prevent a full unraveling of one of the world's most powerful protections for wildlife and wild places, conservationists need to grapple with the mission creep of the ESA.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, left, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright deliver remarks outside the White House on March 19, 2025, in Washington, DC.

When Republican President Richard Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the country's wildlife had been in a century-long nosedive. After decades of habitat destruction, unregulated hunting and industrial expansion, federal officials had already flagged more than 70 species at risk of extinction—with many more lining up behind them.

In the decades that followed, the ESA proved to be one of the most powerful conservation tools in the world. More than 50 species, including the Canada goose and bald eagle, thrived with their newfound federal protections and were later delisted; another 56 species were downgraded from endangered to threatened. But others, like the black-footed ferret, Houston toad and the red wolf, for example, remain endangered—even after almost 60 years of federal attention.

Today the act protects more than 2,300 plant and animal species in the US and abroad. And still more wait in line, as overworked federal biologists triage petitions amid dwindling resources, aggressive layoffs and budget cuts.

But when it comes to the grizzly bear, the debate has become bigger than just biology—it's become a referendum on what the Endangered Species Act is for, says David Willms, a National Wildlife Federation associate vice president and adjunct faculty at the University of Wyoming.

“The ESA is a science-based act,” he says. “You have a species that is struggling, and you need to recover it and make it not struggle anymore. And based on the best available science at the end of the day, you're supposed to delist a species if it met those objectives.”

The trouble begins when species linger on the list indefinitely, not because they haven't recovered but because of what might happen next, out of fears of possible future threats.

But the ESA was only meant to safeguard against “reasonably foreseeable future threats,” Willms argues. Congress has the ability to protect species indefinitely—like it did for wild horses under the 1971 Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act or for numerous species of birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. But those were specific, deliberate laws.

“If there are other reasons why somebody or groups of people think grizzly bears should be protected forever, then that is a different conversation than the Endangered Species Act,” he says.

But this power works in the opposite direction, too. If grizzly bears stay on the list for too long, Congress may well decide to delist the species, as lawmakers did in 2011 when they removed gray wolves from the endangered species list in Montana and Idaho.

Those kinds of decisions happen when people living alongside recovered species, especially the toothy, livestock-loving kind, spend enough time lobbying their state's lawmakers, says Dunning, the wildlife conflict researcher.

When Congress steps in, science tends to step out. A political delisting doesn't just sideline biologists, it sets a precedent, one that opens the potential for lawmakers to start cherry-picking species they see as obstacles to grazing, logging, drilling, or building. The flamboyant lesser prairie chicken has already made the list of legislative targets.

“Right now, the idea of scientific research has lost its magic quality,” she says. “We get there by excluding people and not listening to their voices and them feeling like they're not part of the process.”

And when people feel excluded for too long, she says, the danger isn't just that support for grizzly bears will erode. It's that the public will to protect any endangered species might start to collapse.

For Dan Thompson, Wyoming's large carnivore supervisor, the question of delisting grizzlies is pretty simple: “Is the population recovered with all the regulatory mechanisms in place and data to support that it will remain recovered?” he says. “If the answer is yes, then the answer to delisting is yes.”

That's why Thompson believes it's time to delist the grizzly. And he's not alone. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population is “doing very well,” says van Manen. In fact, grizzlies met their recovery goals about 20 years ago.

Getting there wasn't easy. After the landfills closed and the bear population plummeted, it took a massive, decades-long effort from states, tribes, federal biologists, and nonprofits to bring the grizzlies back. The various entities funded bear-proof trash systems for people living in towns near the national parks and strung electric fences around tempting fruit orchards. They developed safety workshops for people living in or visiting bear country, and tracked down poachers.

And little by little, it worked. Bear numbers swelled, and by the mid-2000s, more than 600 bears roamed the Yellowstone area.

Given this success, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the grizzlies for the first time in late 2005. Environmental groups sued, arguing bears needed continued federal protection as whitebark pine, an important food source, diminished. Bears could starve, groups maintained, and their populations could plummet again. But a subsequent federal study of what, exactly, grizzly bears eat, found that while grizzlies do munch whitebark pine seeds during bumper years, they don't depend on the trees to survive. In fact, grizzlies consume no fewer than 266 species of everything from bison and mice to fungi and even one type of soil.

“Grizzly bears are incredibly opportunistic and use their omnivorous traits to shift to other food sources, ” says van Manen. So losing one food—even a high-calorie one—did little to change the population.

The move to delist them paused as the federal government addressed the federal court's concerns, including researching the grizzly bear's diet.

And bear numbers kept climbing. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service—under President Barack Obama—updated delisting requirements including more expansive habitat protections, stricter conflict prevention, and enhanced monitoring. The agency then proposed a delisting. The following year—under Trump—it delisted the grizzly bear.

This time the Crow Indian Tribe sued and—determining in part that delisting grizzlies in the Yellowstone region threatened the recovery of other populations of grizzlies—a federal judge overturned the government's decision to delist the bears and placed them back on the list. In 2022, Wyoming petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to delist bears in the Yellowstone region. The service took a few years to analyze the issue, and then this January, days before the Biden administration ended, it issued a response to that petition: Grizzly bears would stay on the endangered species list.

All of these years of back and forth reflected the change in how the federal government viewed the grizzly population, largely a result of the bear's own success. The Yellowstone region's bears, they argued, are no longer distinct from bear populations in northern Montana, Idaho, and Washington. And because northern populations haven't met the recovery benchmarks yet (with the exception of a population in and around Glacier National Park), the species as a whole is not yet recovered.

But the goalposts for delisting grizzlies keep moving, Thompson told Vox. Grizzly bears would still be managed even after a delisting. States would be responsible for them, and—miracle of miracles—state and federal agencies actually agreed on how to manage grizzlies after ESA protections end.

Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana are committed to maintaining between 800 and 950 grizzly bears if the creature ever leaves the endangered species list. And states like Wyoming know how to manage grizzly bears because for years, under the supervision of the feds, they've been doing the gritty, ground-level work. Wyoming's wildlife agency, for example, traps and relocates conflict bears (or kills problem bears if allowed by the Fish and Wildlife Service), knocks on doors to calm nervous landowners, hands out bear spray, and reminds campers not to cook chili in their tents.

Despite all that, “nobody trusts us,” said Thompson, with Wyoming's state wildlife agency. “There's always going to be a way to find a reason for [grizzlies] not to be delisted.”

Even though grizzly bears may be thriving in numbers, they're not ready to go it alone, says Matt Cuzzocreo, interim wildlife program manager for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition.

The Greater Yellowstone Coalition has spent millions of dollars over the past few decades helping bears and humans more successfully coexist. But whatever comes next needs to build on the past 50 years of working with locals. As bears expand into new territory, they're crossing into areas where residents aren't used to securing garbage and wouldn't know how to respond to 600-pound predators ambling down back roads or into neighborhoods.

Simply removing bears from the list and handing management to the states, which is the default after a species delisting, isn't enough, says Chris Servheen—not when so much is still in flux. Servheen, who led the Fish and Wildlife Service's recovery program for 35 years, helped write the previous two recovery plans. He says a delisting could leave them dangerously exposed.

“Politicians are making decisions on the fate of animals like grizzly bears and taking decisions out of the hands of biologists,” Servheen says.

Montana and Idaho, Servheen points out, already allow neck-snaring and wolf trapping just outside Yellowstone's borders—traps that also pose a lethal threat to grizzlies. And now, the Trump administration has slashed funding for the very biologists and forest managers tasked with protecting wildlife.

A grizzly bear cub forages for food on a hillside near the Lake Butte overlook in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.

Once states take over, many are expected to push for grizzly hunting seasons, and some, like Wyoming, have already set grizzly bear hunting regulations for when the creatures are no longer protected. Layer that on top of existing threats—roadkill, livestock conflicts, illegal kills—and it's easy to imagine a swift population slide. “It's a perfect storm for grizzlies,” Servheen says.

“We're seeing attacks on public land agencies, the sidelining of science, predator-hostile politicians muscling into wildlife decisions, and relentless pressure from private land development. Walking away from the grizzly now—after all we've invested—just feels like the worst possible timing.”

With so many Bluetooth speakers out there, and more arriving almost daily, it can be easy to underestimate one that dwells in the middle ground. Sandwiched between the packable Soundlink Flex and the beefy Soundlink Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends), Bose's new midsize Soundlink Plus (no, these aren't streaming services) carves out its own niche thanks largely to winning sound with equal parts nuance and bravado.

Like its siblings, the Plus looks and feels like a premium speaker with an accordingly premium price; it's dressed to the nines, especially fetching in the Citrus Yellow color I reviewed, but bears commensurate dust- and waterproofing for good defense against the elements. Medium build notwithstanding, this is still a hefty package, but if you're after a good compromise between boombox might and breezy portability, the Soundlink Plus abides.

There's style in the Sound Plus's minimalism, with a sleek yet strong powder-coated steel grille, supple touch keys along its rubberized topside, and a hearty checkered nylon handle at the side that makes it easier to haul (or hang).

At the back are vents for its four bass radiators and an open USB-C port. A point of note there: the Plus is fine to dunk given its IP67 rating, and it even floats, but you'll need to wait for the port to dry before charging. That's further notable given that, like the Max, the Plus takes a sluggish five hours to charge its 20-hour battery from zero. That said, it didn't take long for the orange-and-white flashing LED to return to solid white following a bath in my laundry sink, signaling a clear and ready port.

Measuring 9.1 x 3.94 x 3.4 inches (WxHxD) and weighing over 3 pounds, this is not the most packable speaker, but it's still game for the open road. It took me a while to get used to its heft, but it fared well on its first task after unboxing, a camping trip in the Columbia River Gorge. If it seems risky taking a shiny new lemon-meringue speaker into the dusty woods, you're not wrong, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the speaker cleans up. You'll inevitably attract some marks, though, and the Dusk Blue and Black should age better.

Whatever the color, I dig the Plus' aesthetic, and so did most people I showed it to (though they mostly remarked on the great sound). It feels nice to the touch, and both the look and build quality seem a step above flack-jacketed rivals like the JBL Charge 6 and UE MegaBoom 4. I'd still prefer either of those speakers for a hard fall—not because the Bose wouldn't survive, it's just more likely to get nicks or dents. The Charge 6's IP68 rating theoretically gives it bragging rights for water resistance, but all three are dunkable, like most speakers we test.

Soundlink Plus features seem a little austere at first glance, but there's enough here to keep away feature envy. The unified Bose app's compact interface will be familiar to anyone with Bose headphones, with options like the ability to connect to two devices over Bluetooth multipoint, a three-band EQ and presets, and monitoring for battery and volume.

A single point of customization lets you swap one of the Plus' topside control keys from linking with other Bose speakers like the Flex and Max to become a Spotify quick key. You can stereo pair two Soundlink Plus speakers, and Android users will get handy extras like Google Fast Pair and aptX Adaptive support for high-quality Bluetooth streaming.

Another nice touch is the ability to send the speaker to Bose to swap out the battery down the line. At full charge, it lasts pretty dead-on with Bose's 20-hour claim at midrange volume or below. It falls to around 15 hours (or less) if you crank it above that, so it would have been nice to get a full 24 hours like you'll get with some cheaper competitors, including the Charge 6 and Beats' latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends), especially since it's designed to charge other devices via the USB port.

Options you don't get include a speaker phone, an Aux input/USB-C playback, or future-proofing features like Auracast audio sharing, something JBL's latest speakers already employ. Admittedly, Aurcast isn't very useful yet since most source devices don't support it, but it would be nice as an option at this price. That said, it could be something Bose plans to add later.

I spent multiple weeks with the Soundlink Plus accompanying me to backyard barbecues and events. It's been a while since I got so many compliments from friends and neighbors on a simple speaker. People really seemed to dig its blend of punch and poise, providing more full-throttle power and bass than you'd expect for its size and some lovely moments of lyricism and detail, especially in the upper midrange and treble.

Bose doesn't list driver specs, but the Plus' dual-driver system is talented, especially the tweeter tasked with carrying much of the load when it comes to detail and instrumental timbres. Multiple times during my review, I was struck by the delicacy and touch with which it handles instruments, delighting in crisp acoustic guitars, rich vocals, crunchy woodwinds, and pillowy brass across registers.

The woofer adds plenty of bass for the size, and while it doesn't dig deep into the lowest Hz, it supports the topside with a robust foundation that makes the speaker feel bigger and bolder than its profile. At one point, I swapped it for the SVS Prime Wireless Pro currently in my living room, and was surprised how well it filled the room in relief with clear, full sound. Bass can sometimes feel boomy or sluggish, but it's mostly a welcome addition, and you can always adjust it in the EQ.

Going back to the oft-mentioned Charge 6 for some A/B testing, the Charge feels a bit more confident and punchy in the mids with raucous tracks like Supergrass' messy rocker “Caught By the Fuzz,” while the Plus showed more presence and precision, especially notable in more acoustic-based songs like Kris Kristofferson's “Border Lord.”

In general, the Plus offers better detail and can still let things loose at high volume. Occasionally, the little tweeter feels like it's trying to do too much, adding some extra sizzle and brashness and/or distortion if you really punch it. It would have been nice to get two tweeters for some stereo separation. Overall, this is a lovely sounding speaker that's equally at home playing low-volume grooves or filling a room.

There's certainly an abundance of choice for portable Bluetooth speakers, but the Soundlink Plus stakes its ground with a premium build and impressive sound. If you can handle its price (and Bose fans are pretty used to doing so), the Plus is a worthy sonic companion.

The problems with closed-source software (lack of control, lack of reliability) were solved with a new business model: open source development, which came with new licenses and new ways of getting revenue (maintenance contracts instead of license fees).In the same way, we need a business model solution to cloud-vendor ills.Imagine we create standard contracts/licenses that define rights so that users can be confident of their relationship with cloud-vendors. Over time, maybe users would only deal with vendors that had these licenses. The rights would be something like:* End-of-life contracts: cloud-vendors should contractually spell out what happens if they can't afford to keep the servers running.* Data portability guarantees: Vendors must spell out how data gets migrated out, and all formats must be either open or (at minimum) fully documented.* Data privacy transparency: Vendors must track/audit all data access and report to the user who/what read their data and when.I'm sure you can think of a dozen other clauses.The tricky part is, of course, adoption. What's in it for the cloud-vendors? Why would they adopt this? The major fear of cloud-vendors is, I think, churn. If you're paying lots of money to get people to try your service, you have to make sure they don't churn out, or you'll lose money. Maybe these contracts come only with annual subscription terms. Or maybe the appeal of these contracts is enough for vendors to charge more.

This is not practical for data of any size. Prod migrations to a new database take months or even years if you want things to go smoothly. In a crisis you can do it in weeks but it can be really ugly, That applies even when moving between the same version of open source database, because there's a lot of variation between the cloud services themselves.The best solution is to have the data in your own environment to begin with and just unplug. It's possible with bring-your-own-cloud management combined with open source.My company operates a BYOC data product which means I have an economic interest in this approach. On the other hand I've seen it work, so I know it's possible.

Just as with the open source movement, there needs to be a business model (and don't forget that OSS is a business model, not a technology) that competes with the old way of doing things.Getting that new business model to work is the hard part, but we did it once with open source and I think we can do it again with cloud infrastructure. But I don't think local-first is the answer--that's just a dead end because normal users will never go with it.

It's self reinforcing because those companies that get subscription revenue have both more revenue and higher valuations enabling more fund raising, causing them to beat out companies that do not follow this model. This is why local first software died.

Example: I made a firefox extension that automatically fills forms using LLM. It's fully offline (except OPTIONALLY) the LLM part, optionally because it also supports Ollama locally.Now the issue is that it's way too hard for most people to use: find the LLM to run, acquire it somehow (pay to run it online or download it to run in Ollama) gotta configure your API url, enter API key, save all of your details for form fulling locally in text files which you then have to backup and synchronize to other devices yourself.The alternative would be: create account, give money, enter details and all is synced and backedup automatically accross devices, online LLM pre-selected and configured. Ready to go. No messing around with Ollama or openrouter, just go.I don't know how to solve it in a local way that would be as user friendly as the subscription way would be.Now things like cars and washing machines are a different story :p

It's sad because the dynamics and incentives around clear, up-front prices seem generally better than SaaS (more user control, less lock-in), but almost all commercial software morphs into SaaS thanks to a mix of psychology, culture and market dynamics.There are other advantages to having your software and data managed by somebody else, but they are far less determinative than structural and pricing factors. In a slightly different world, it's not hard to imagine relatively expensive software up-front that comes with a smaller, optional (perhaps even third-party!) subscription service for data storage and syncing. It's a shame that we do not live in that world.

It's based on NixOS to provide as much as possible out of the box and declaratively: https, SSO, LDAP, backups, ZFS w/ snapshots, etc.It's a competitor to cloud hosting because it packages Vaultwarden and Nextcloud to store most of your data. It does provide more services than that though, home assistant for example.It's a competitor to YUNoHost but IMO better (or aims to be) because you can use the building blocks provided by SelfHostBlocks to self-host any packages you want. It's more of a library than a framework.It's a competitor to NAS but better because everything is open source.It still requires the user to be technical but I'm working on removing that caveat. One of my goals is to allow to install it on your hardware without needing nix or touching the command line.

Is this because of limitations of working on local-first software require you to be in-person? Or is this primarily a management issue?

In practice, it's hard! You're effectively responsible for building a sync engine, handling conflict resolution, managing schema migration, etc.This said, tools for local-first software development seem to have improved in the past couple years. I keep my eye on jazz.tools, electric-sql, and Rocicorp's Zero. Are there others?

Unfortunately, if you go to ChatGPT and ask it to build a website/app, it immediately points the unknowing user towards a bunch of cloud-based tools like Fly.io, Firebase, Supabase, etc.Getting a user to install a local DB and a service to run their app (god forbid, updating said service), is a challenge that's complex, even for developers (hence the prevalence of containers).It will take some time (i.e. pre-training runs), but this is a future I believe is worth fighting for.

I would be surprised if in a decade we won't have local models that are an order of magnitude better than current cloud offerings while being smaller and faster, and affordable ASICs to run them.

But it is a nightmare when it goes wrong: the conclusion I've reached is that it is out of reach to regular people who don't want the Byzantine support load that could accompany something going wrong. They want turnkey. They want simple. They aren't interested in operating services, they're interested in using them.The FLOSS model of self hosting doesn't really offer a reliable way of getting this: most businesses operating this way are undercapitalised and have little hope of ever being any other way. Many are just hobbies. There are a few exceptions, but they're rare and fundamentally the possibility of needing support still exists.What is needed, imo, is to leverage the power of centralised, professional operations and development, but to govern it democratically. This means cooperatives where users are active participants in governance alongside employees.I've done a little work towards this myself, in the form of a not-yet-seen-the-light-of-day project.What I'd love to see is a set of developers and operators actually getting paid for their work and users getting a better deal in terms of cost, service, and privacy, on their own (aggregate) terms. Honestly, I'd love to be one of them.Does anyone think this has legs to the same extent as local-first or self hosting? Curious to know people's responses.

That being said, yes, i do believe *in the near/upcoming future* local-first, self-hosting and i will add more fair open source vendors will work! Well, at least, i hope so! I say that because Europe's recent desire to pivot away from the big U.s. tech companies, and towards more digital sovereignty - in my opinion - begins the foundational dependency for an ecosystem that will/could sustain self hosting, etc. The more that europe is able to pivot away from big tech, the more possibilty exists for more and varied non-big tech vendors manifest...and the more that Europe adopts open source, the more the possibility that usage and expertise of self-hosting grows....plus, for those who do not know how to, or simply do not wish to manage services themselves...well, in time i think Europe will have fostered a vast array of vendors who can provide such open source, digital services, but get paid a fair cost for providing fair value/services, etc. ...and, by the way, i say this all as a biased person in favor of open source AS WELL AS being an American. :-)

So this dude literally worked for THE US domestic intelligence gathering agency and he has no idea how they found out about his friendship to someone who has been all over the news for 9 years for his investigative targeting of the current president?I mean demotion due to the friendship…or perhaps he is just not the brightest bulb in the bureau?

Seems weird to immediately assume he's stupider than you are.

It seems that his problem is that he does not agree with it now being used against the ""side"" he stands with, rather than that he disagrees with it being used politically at all. I'd agree that it often is used for political purposes, but I would not agree that this only started in Trump's current term. It's been used by both sides in this way.

Did they? Why not just assert what you believe, instead of giving it this weird air of deniability?Do you believe that the Hunter Biden “story” is similar or dissimilar to firing political and personal enemies of appointees?

And it's beside the point, which is that right-wing cable news gasbags are now running the country.

The analogous situation to me is the 80s and 90s, when computers really started to be  used by businesses and regular people. There were so many issues with the process of digitization, moving from paper files to computer files (for businesses), etc. that entire industries grew up around it. This was relevant to me personally, as my parents made a living doing this for decades.So if AI results in a ton of half-baked broken-but-profitable software, it might turn out the same way.

Saeed Ismail is a real person. But no matter how much proof he posts online, people keep calling him fake.

The 22-year-old has endured almost two years of war in Gaza, as Israel continues an assault that has killed at least 57,000 people and left the territory of 2 million on the brink of starvation. Saeed has been raising money online to feed his family. But many people on social media have been convinced that he isn't real at all. They believe he's an AI-generated creation, used by scammers to get donations through crowdfunding platforms from well-meaning people. And in a world where AI videos and images have flooded our digital spaces, it's easy to understand why some people are so skeptical.

The controversy started with a photo posted in May that features Saeed asking for help. Users of the social media platform Bluesky started accusing him of being fake. A pseudonymous account called Rev. Howard Arson led the charges against Saeed, pointing out his blanket had some odd words woven within it.

Arson pointed to two words on the blanket: “pealistic” and “spfcation,” which seemed to be misspellings of “realistic” and “specification.” Arson suspected that it was evidence the image was made with AI, a result of someone asking an artificial intelligence tool to make a realistic blanket and spitting this out:

Saeed posted several photos and a video showing the blanket to prove it was real, but that didn't put the accusations to rest. He told Gizmodo his mother purchased the blanket from a market near where he lived in northern Gaza before the war: “When I left the house during the evacuation, I took it with me.”

People were convinced that AI video has become advanced enough that Saeed could be a completely artificial being—an AI agent, as Arson told Gizmodo over direct messages. Arson, who has over 20,000 followers on Bluesky, was getting a lot of attention for his claims, helping them spread across the relatively niche social network. Saeed didn't know what he could do, as the account seemed to have more influence than he could ever attain.

“When I went on Bluesky, I saw that many people had started to believe I was a fraud, mainly because of the status of the person who posted about me,” Saeed told Gizmodo over WhatsApp. “He's seen as a trustworthy figure by many, while unfortunately, I don't have the same following or credibility.”

Gizmodo verified Saeed's existence as a real person through a variety of means, including a video call where he walked around the room and showed us the view out of his window. He provided us with his Palestinian ID as well as photos and videos of his location. Saeed told Gizmodo he previously raiseed money on PayPal but now fundraises on GoFundMe through a campaign run by a person he trusts in France who sends him the money. After it gets to France, the money is sent through wire transfers into Gaza, which he says is “reliable and secure,” explaining, “We rely on these channels because we simply have no other options available.”

GoFundMe doesn't operate in Gaza but allows people in countries where it does operate to host fundraisers for people in other countries. It has a tutorial on its website for how to do that safely. The GoFundMe team collects documentation like IDs, receipts for expenses, and other proof to make sure funds are delivered to the beneficiary. A spokesperson from GoFundMe told Gizmodo it has verified Saeed's campaign.

“During humanitarian disasters and other crises, our team proactively monitors and verifies fundraisers to help ensure funds raised on our platform are delivered quickly and safely,” a GoFundMe spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement. 

“When a GoFundMe fundraiser is created, we prioritize distributing funds while also helping ensure compliance with relevant international laws, global regulations, and requirements dictated by our payment processors,” the spokesperson continued. “We're working around the clock to help ensure humanitarian relief funds are delivered safely and quickly to those in need, helping families access essentials, rebuild, and recover through the generosity of their communities.”

Whoever runs the Arson account declined to provide their real name, let alone jump through the same hoops as Saeed to prove his identity to Gizmodo and GoFundMe. “Unfortunately i don't want a claim i can't prove connected to my name, which is why—even though i'm very skeptical still—i took down the actual claim and any references directly to the guy in question,” Arson told Gizmodo over Bluesky.

Arson told Gizmodo he's an American and recognized his country was helping Israel flatten Gaza and kill tens of thousands of people. But he remained unconvinced that Saeed was a real person and seemed frustrated that AI had become so advanced he wasn't sure what to believe. Arson, who seems to have great familiarity with AI systems, struggles with what to believe, especially when it comes to whether giving money is a good thing.

“I have no idea whatsoever what it is like to be there. i know i would do or say literally anything to eat,” Arson wrote. “But this is why it is absolutely impossible to evaluate whether you are actually doing any good! on one end you have people with money and on the other you have people paying $300 for a bag of lentils in a manufactured and intentional famine.”

Arson acknowledged that his perspective could be warped by seeing so many fake images created with AI.

“The way people get this stuff wrong, and the way I possibly have, is that they end up in a world where half the stuff they look at is synthetic and half of it is real, and presume that 50/50 is the distriubtion [sic] everywhere they look,” Arson told Gizmodo.

Arson pointed to another example of a photo that he previously thought was fake but is actually real. The image shows a woman and two kids sitting in the rubble of Gaza. All three people are wearing sandals, though the boy's left leg has a white plaster cast. But it was the woman's sandal that raised suspicions.

The sandal has a panda head logo, along with an odd mix of words: “HAPPY LUCKY rlorE DNUI.” It's the kind of thing that would immediately raise red flags for anyone on the lookout for AI images being circulated online. The strange thing is that the sandals are real.

Arson found the same sandals being sold on Facebook in a listing from an online shop in Benghazi, Libya back in June 2022. Not only were the sandals seen in the photo from Gaza available for purchase, proving they existed in the real world, but they even came in a variety of colors.

Gizmodo spoke with the woman in the photo, Sahar AlAjrami, over video call to verify she was a real person in Gaza. Her English is not great, so her younger brother, Ahmed, worked as a translator for us, showing the sandals lit by cellphone light in the middle of the night. GoFundMe told Gizmodo that the fundraising campaigns for both Sahar, who's trying to raise money to feed her children, and Ahmed have been verified as authentic.

It's not clear who designed the sandals bearing such mangled English, but they are absolutely real. And it's perhaps notable that June 2022 predates the first widely available AI image generators, which didn't really open up to the public until late 2022. ChatGPT, which officially kicked off the consumer-facing generative-AI race, was launched to the public in November 2022.

Sahar is most concerned for her 10-year-old son Odai, who was shot in the foot by an Israeli quadcopter drone. While amateur sleuths on the internet were fixated on her sandals, it was her son's foot in that photo that should've been drawing the attention. Sahar says painkillers and other medicines aren't being allowed into Gaza and she hopes she can get him to Egypt for treatment. That's an impossibility at the moment, as Israel has shut down all of the crossings.

Gazans like Sahar and Saeed are far from the only people having a hard time proving their identities in a skeptical social media environment. Bluesky has received criticism from activists in recent months as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive but are getting banned left and right for allegedly being scammers or bots. Hany Abu Hilal is an English teacher in Gaza with three young kids that Gizmodo also verified as a real person through his Palestinian ID and a video call. He started a crowdfunding campaign on Chuffed, but he keeps getting his accounts deleted on Bluesky for spam.

“My flat was completely burnt and then completely destroyed,” he told Gizmodo, explaining that he lives in a tent in Khan Younis which can't shield them properly from the heat or the cold. Hany said he was banned from Bluesky without a clear explanation and he's desperate because he can't ask for help online in spaces that keep deleting Palestinian accounts.

“Basic food prices are skyrocket here in Gaza. Can't even bring a loaf of bread for my three kids because I am jobless and I do not have money,” Hany told Gizmodo. The Israeli government has total control of what goes in and out of Gaza and recently had a two-month total blockade of food and supplies into the territory. That blockade has been loosened, but only a minimal amount as people struggle to find the basic necessities to live. At least 549 people in Gaza have been killed in recent weeks near aid sites, according to the CBC, and more than 4,000 have been injured trying to access food from the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-based group registered to an empty office in Delaware. Reporting from the Associated Press suggests it's not just the Israeli military but U.S. contractors who have fired on crowds of Palestinians trying to get aid.

Hany says he's had to evacuate 12 times since the start of the war, a common story for people who have been internally displaced by Israel's invasion of Gaza. The vast majority of Gaza's population have had to leave their homes, and Israel has announced plans to completely “conquer” the territory, with many politicians talking openly about ethnically cleansing the area. While we've verified Hany is a real person, we were unable to reach Chuffed, a fundraising site based in Australia, to get more information about their processes for verifying campaigns.

Hany has struggled on Bluesky, which has exploded in popularity ever since Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X. And perhaps no English-language account on Bluesky has done more to raise awareness of the Palestinian plight on the platform than Molly Shah, a 45-year-old American activist based in Berlin. Shah is originally from Kentucky, and she tells Gizmodo that she moved to Germany in 2017 and has previously worked as a lawyer fighting eviction cases. Molly says the people she talks to in Gaza struggle with social media users calling them fake.

“I talk to people every single day who have seen and faced some of the worst things you can possibly imagine, and the most distressing conversations I have are often around losing their accounts or being called scammers,” Molly said. “I think that is because people in Gaza have lost almost everything, but the one thing they do have left is their identities, and being banned or called fake attacks even that.”

Molly has spotted fakes on Bluesky and acknowledges that there are scammers trying to take advantage of the situation. But they are the minority, and she's shared things to look out for, including people who only use news photos for their fundraising campaigns.

Bluesky told Gizmodo that it understands people in Gaza need platforms to share their experiences and seek support, saying the company is “committed to ensuring they can be heard on Bluesky.” But the platform said that its moderation teams have to “distinguish between genuine advocacy and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”

“In some cases, our investigations have revealed networks where single individuals operate hundreds of accounts engaging in bulk messaging, identical replies across unrelated conversations, and mass following—behaviors that disrupt the platform experience for all users regardless of the underlying cause,” Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky's Head of Trust & Safety, told Gizmodo over email.

“When we identify these patterns, we provide warnings and opportunities for users to adjust their approach before any suspensions occur. In other cases, malicious actors create bulk networks of accounts to target users on Bluesky and exploit goodwill towards crises,” Rodericks continued.

The social media company told Gizmodo that its moderation decisions “aren't always perfect, which is why we maintain an appeals process,” but said users need to focus on operating a single account that follows community guidelines. Rodericks said it would be “publishing more guidance in the near-term to help advocacy accounts stay within our rules while sharing their messages,” but didn't respond to Gizmodo's follow-up questions about when that guidance would be coming.

Even if Americans do find a fundraising campaign they trust, some folks are worried about what the U.S. government will do to them if they donate to people in Gaza, given the authoritarian and anti-Muslim tendencies of the Trump administration. Trump has previously said all of Gaza should be purged of Palestinians and that the U.S. should take ownership of the territory. And that has translated to terrifying actions in the U.S. domestically.

Trump has been enacting racist and often illegal policies targeting foreign students, with a special emphasis on attacking people protesting against Israel's war on Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen and graduate student at Tufts University, was picked up off the street in Massachusetts by masked agents in an infamous video that went viral back in March. Ozturk's “crime” was co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper defending the principles of free speech. But it's not illegal for Americans to donate to fundraising campaigns for the average person just trying to survive in Gaza. At least, not yet.

The problem, which we always return to, is that it's getting really hard to tell when someone is a scammer. Google's latest AI video creation tool, Veo 3, has been a game-changer that further muddies the waters. When Time magazine published a report on the tool recently, the news outlet created a video of fake Gazans receiving aid from USAID—which brings us to the people accused of being fake on the other side of this war.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by Israel and the U.S., has been accused of running an unsafe and ineffective aid organization that's getting hundreds of people killed. But it's also been accused of making fake videos. One video created by the GHF and distributed to right-wing news outlets like the Daily Wire was understandably called fake when it was published on social media in late May. Anyone looking at it can see that it does have that kind of unusual AI-style quality that's hard to define.

A source at one of the Gaza distribution sites tells me that Hamas set up a roadblock to prevent Gazans from getting aid.

They broke through it and were shouting “thank you America” upon reaching the site. pic.twitter.com/5bfRoy6mcO

Reached for comment over email, an unnamed spokesperson for GHF told Gizmodo the video is real, sending along a screenshot of metadata from an iPhone 15 Pro showing where it was taken in Gaza. GHF initially offered to let Gizmodo speak with the cameraman but didn't send us the raw video file we asked for and never connected us with the cameraman who was “on a plane back to America.” GHF has given contradictory statements publicly about its activities, with the head of the organization Johnnie Moore recently telling the BBC that no one had died near their aid distribution sites before saying he wasn't contesting that people had died just a few minutes later.

How does anyone know what's real in that kind of environment? It was a difficult question for people on the internet, even before the invention of generative AI image creators. Gizmodo has been debunking viral photos for over a decade, and many viral fakes even predate the invention of Photoshop by decades. But AI has changed the game in so many ways. And AI images and videos will only get more sophisticated.

Another problem in deciphering what's real in Gaza is that Israel doesn't allow foreign journalists into the territory. The IDF has sometimes escorted TV journalists in for brief periods of time, without allowing communication between the journalists and average Palestinians on the ground, but that obviously amounts to a highly controlled media event. Even if the average American has the budget to fly halfway around the world to go check out Gaza for themselves, they're simply not allowed to do that. So people are forced to either figure out their own ways of determining what's real or just throwing up their hands and deciding it's too hard to authenticate.

But people in Gaza continue to suffer, with no end in sight. The health infrastructure in Gaza has been obliterated, with hospitals becoming “battlegrounds,” as experts at the United Nations have put it. The toll has been immense, with children getting hit particularly hard. Over 50,000 kids have been killed or injured since October 2023, according to figures from UNICEF. And researchers estimate the actual death toll is much higher than the official number that currently stands at over 58,000.

Yet people continue to call the atrocities fake. There are entire accounts on X, which became an extremist far-right platform after it was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022, that are dedicated to so-called “Pallywood,” a play on the name Hollywood, which allege the people of Gaza are faking the war crimes being committed against them.

At the end of the day, there are no easy solutions. Avoiding scams can be hard as AI infects every corner of the internet. But surviving a genocide is much, much harder.

Aren't pets such a drag? I mean, really. They're all furry, and cute, and innocent. And you have to feed them and love them, and respect their autonomy and basic needs. For what? Borderline unconditional love? Who's got time for all that? Certainly not me. My job is computer, and I need efficiency—a practical companion that's alive when I want it to be and shutting the f**k up when I need to have the TPS report filed by EOD so corporate can circle back on the EOY roadmap. You got all that? Me neither; I'll just have AI summarize it for me. Alright, sorry, I'm done joking now. It's time to get serious—or should I say… Sirius.

Sirius is a $1,200 robot dog made by a company you've never heard of called Hengbot. It's part of a long lineage of robot dogs punctuated by the likes of tech titans like Sony, Xiaomi, Fisher-Price, and, uh, Ideal Toy Company's impeccably named mechanical dog from 1960, Gaylord the Pup (you can't make this shit up, folks). But this isn't just another Gaylord. It's a robot dog with—say it with me now—AI. Using large language models (LLMs) like the ones that power ChatGPT, Sirius comes equipped with the ability to understand voice commands. What can you ask Sirius? Some stuff.

Hengbot Sirius Robot Dog

Pros

Cons

In a demo with Sirius, I saw the dog take voice commands like “sit,” “shake,” and “pee,” though I wouldn't want to train your real dog to do that last one. They're activated pretty much how you'd think they would be. Just blurt out, “Hey, Sirius,” and then talk away. The dog has to be connected to Wi-Fi to do all of this stuff, FYI—there's no onboard processing, but this ain't an iPhone after all. Speaking of iPhones, be careful when yelling “Hey, Sirius” because “Sirius” sounds an awful lot like another voice assistant, who's had a bit of trouble with AI lately. I don't know what happens when you ask your iPhone to pee, but frankly, I'd rather not find out.

I wasn't able to test the voice commands with my review unit of Sirius because I had trouble connecting it to Wi-Fi, but I did get to see them in a live demo, and Sirius's voice assistant looks about as good as Apple's, which is to say… pretty mid. It recognized some commands right away, and others not so much. However mid Sirius is at processing and understanding voice commands, it's much worse at (sigh) walking. This thing falls kind of a lot, and unlike a dog made of flesh and blood, it cannot figure out how to get up after taking said spill. Lots of my time testing Sirius was spent extricating it from the insufferable foibles of its own clumsiness. I have my own foibles to suffer, thank you very much. I don't need a robot dog to add to the pile.

(Note: you may not have the same Wi-Fi headache as the one I encountered. My unit was a demo version and didn't have the same OTA update as the ones shipping after. We'll be updating this post if and when I can get Sirus online.)

Using a game controller provided with my review unit, I tried parading Sirius around the Gizmodo office for shits and giggles but found that (especially when it's in autonomous mode) it would often get tripped up when I sent in an input to walk forward or move side-to-side and then flop to the ground harder than Cristiano Ronaldo when his team is down 2-1. Say what you will about dogs, but they're pretty good at locomotion most of the time. When Sirius isn't falling over, you can use a game controller to do some fun stuff manually, like directing it to jump in four directions (left, right, forward, or back) and also activate some silly commands like making it sit and meow like a cat. Cute!

I think if I'm going to give Sirius any credit, it's that the actuators used to move the dog around are pretty cool and can actually simulate the movements of a real dog fairly well. I suppose, depending on your feelings toward robots, that could also be a point against it, too. There's something vaguely uncanny valley about Sirius, and the weird, single robot eye on the dog's face probably doesn't help.

Despite the fact that Sirius, with its onboard camera, can actually track your face, it cannot follow you around like other robot dogs like Xiaomi's Cyberdog. That's a bummer. I think going for a walk is probably high on the list of things people would want to do with their new $1,200 pet, or toy, or AI companion, or… wait a second, what is this thing, actually? If you're reading these words (and I'm sorry if you are), please send me your coordinates so I can tell the police to save you from the evil villain Clockwork Oranging robot dog reviews into your eyeballs—then you may also be curious who Sirius is meant for. The short answer is I have no freaking clue.

Is it a toy for serious adults who want an AI-programmable companion? Is it supposed to be cute? Like, I don't know, Furby cute? Or Sony Aibo robot dog cute? I'm not positive, but if it's the latter, then I would venture to say that it's not really hitting the mark. Superficially, it looks like a cross between Boston Dynamics' Spot and a DJI drone, and functionally, it can do a little bit more than the robot dogs of yore, I guess. But in practice, it's just not very, I don't know… fun. There's a sort of binary that exists in gadgets, robot dogs included. There are toys—things that aren't meant to do much, but they're fun to use. And then there are tools. Things that do a thing that you need or very much want done. As it stands, I don't think Sirius is hitting either of those marks, but in the end, the stakes are kind of low. I don't know who this robot dog is for, but some dogs have no master, right? Then again, those dogs, sooner or later, often get sent to the pound…

TSMC has responded to a report that it is delaying its Japan fab in favor of faster buildouts in the United States. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, TSMC is slowing its spending on chipmaking facilities in Japan to accelerate the buildout of its Fab 21 site in Arizona, in anticipation of potential tariffs imposed on chips made in Taiwan by the U.S. government. In a statement sent to Tom's Hardware, TSMC indicated that its major investments in its Arizona site will not impact plans for its Germany and Japan chipmaking plants. 

""TSMC does not comment on market rumor,"" a TSMC spokesperson told Tom's Hardware. ""TSMC's global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency, the level of government support and cost economic considerations. Our investment plans in the U.S. will not impact our existing investment plans in other regions.""

The first rumors about TSMC slowing down spending on its Fab 23 phase 2 (JASM phase 2) near Kumamoto, Japan, and Fab 24 phase 1 (ESMC phase 1) near Dresden, Germany, to prioritize spending on its Fab 21 site in Arizona as well as speed up Fab 21 phase 2 equipment, emerged several weeks ago. 

Earlier this week, we heard that TSMC was bringing its N3-capable Fab 21 Phase 2 online in 2027 (several quarters ahead of schedule), while slowing down its projects in Germany and Japan. 

While plans tend to change, these changes are not always interconnected, especially given the different stages of these projects, as well as TSMC's vast capital expenditure (CapEx) budget of $32 billion to $42 billion and its massive capacity buildout plans. 

Let's take a look at TSMC's most recent updates on its projects in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, starting with the U.S.

TSMC had already confirmed earlier this year that it was speeding up the start of high-volume production at Fab 21 Phase 2 due to demand from its clients. The plan is to pull in the HVM start date from the original schedule in 2028 by several quarters, which could mean 2027.

TSMC has reached the 'topping milestone', currently outfitting the fab with various mechanical, electrical, plumbing, air filtration, air conditioning, and other systems. The next major stage for this project will be the installation of actual semiconductor production equipment. Equipment procurement and installation is the most capital-intensive (expensive) stage of every fab project.

""The construction of our second fab, which will utilize the 3nm process technologies, is already complete, and we are working on speeding up the volume production schedule, based on the strong AI-related demand from our customers,"" said C.C. Wei, chief executive and chairman of TSMC, in the company's Q1 2025 conference call. 

The company also intended to start constructing shells for Fab 21 phase 3 and phase 4 later in 2025, with the aim of starting production there later this decade. 

""Our third and fourth fab will utilize N2 and A16 process technologies, and with the expectation of receiving all the necessary permits, is scheduled to begin construction later this year,"" said Wei. 

In fact, Bloomberg reported in late April that the company indeed began to build its 'third fab in Arizona,' though it is unclear whether it began to prep land, or actually broke ground (e.g., poured in the foundation), though considering that TSMC did not have all the necessary permits as of April 17, it looks like it only started prepping the land for the facility.

TSMC's first fab in Japan — Fab 23 phase 1 — started mass production of chips in late December 2024. The company intended to start construction of its Fab 23 phase 2 earlier this year, but the schedule slipped due to a lack of proper local infrastructure. 

""The construction of our second specialty fab is scheduled to start later this year, subject to the readiness of the local infrastructure,"" Wei said at the conference call with analysts and investors. 

The WSJ report cites local traffic as a reason for the setback. A representative from the Japanese government stated that officials had not received direct communication from TSMC, citing local traffic as the reason for the delay. The spokesperson also expressed skepticism that such conditions were the reason. Nevertheless, the government believes that the fab's production timeline and output goals will remain generally unchanged. 

Land preparation and shell construction are the least capital-intensive stages of building semiconductor production facilities, meaning this phase is comparatively low-cost. Therefore, it does not make sense to slow down any of this in a bid to speed up another project, unless a company lacks funds, which is not the case with TSMC.

The same applies to TSMC's project in Germany — a joint project with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, called Fab 24, which is set to come online in late 2027. The company officially started to prepare land for the fab in August 2024. So far, the company has not officially begun building the shell, but constructing a fab building is less expensive than equipping it, so it is unlikely that TSMC would delay the construction start of Fab 24 due to its vast investment project in America. 

""We are on track with our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany,"" Wei said during the call. ""[…] So again, I would emphasize, no, we are not going to slow down our plan in Japan or in Germany.""

TSMC itself declined to comment on rumors about changes to its buildout plans, the company stressed that its fabs come online based on customers' needs and that its expanded investment in the U.S.-based site would not impact its intentions in other countries. 

""TSMC does not comment on market rumor,"" a TSMC spokesperson told Tom's Hardware. ""TSMC's global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency, the level of government support and cost economic considerations. Our investment plans in the U.S. will not impact our existing investment plans in other regions.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Ireland's first and only BioBrillouin microscope installed at Trinity College Dublin","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250705/Irelands-first-and-only-BioBrillouin-microscope-installed-at-Trinity-College-Dublin.aspx","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 17:26:00 GMT","

Trinity College Dublin now has Ireland's first and only BioBrillouin microscope, which will enable researchers to make giant strides in the fields of inflammation, cancer, developmental biology and biomedical materials, among others.

Cellular and tissue mechanics are potent regulators of disease, dysfunction and regeneration, and understanding them is thus a major focus of biomedical researchers. But existing methods are invasive and limited in the information that they can provide. 

However, the incredible new Brillouin microscope can map and quantify the compressibility, viscoelasticity and the detailed mechanics of materials and biological tissues, using non-invasive light. This enables researchers to assess the mechanical properties of live systems (such as cells and tissues) without interfering with them, allowing them to monitor a system and how it changes over time. It is based on light scattering from the result of interactions between a photon of light and the acoustic phonons of a material, which are impacted by the material's mechanical properties. 

With the support of the European Research Council (ERC) and Research Ireland, the Brillouin microscopy system has been installed in the lab of Prof. Michael Monaghan in the School of Engineering at Trinity, where it is housed in the Trinity Centre for Biomedical Engineering at the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute. 

''Being the first commercial system in the world, we have tremendous technical support from the vendor, CellSense Technologies GmbH, with whom we have worked closely with to get the system on the ground. Our success is their success,"" said Prof. Monaghan, who is a contributor to an expert consensus paper published today in leading international journal Nature Photonics.

This statement gathers the expertise of international experts in the application of Brillouin microscopy in biomedical applications. 

Studying the mechanical properties of live systems is hugely relevant in myriad fields, and promises to enable leaps forward in our understanding of the ways in which inflammation and cancer develop, for example.

However, it's also important to understand its use is not limited to biomedical research and related applications – it will help scientists push boundaries even further in fields such as materials science, ICT, energy storage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices and diagnostics. This groundbreaking equipment will help us advance frontier science, and we anticipate scientists will travel from all over the world to use it – we have welcomed some already.""

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — Tobin Heath might know something about what makes soccer resonate within the U.S.

Her resume, in part: She won NCAA titles in college at North Carolina, then went on to win two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team and two World Cup titles as well, all of that coming after she was inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup.

And so far, she thinks the Club World Cup could have a similar effect.



Heath — who is working as part of FIFA's technical study group for the tournament, alongside the likes of former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, former German star and U.S. men's national coach Jurgen Klinsmann and others — said last weekend that a match she attended earlier this month between Bayern Munich and Boca Juniors, with a full and jammed stadium in South Florida playing host to that matchup, shows what could be possible in this country.

“As an American, it was one of the coolest experiences of my life to witness that passion and energy,” Heath — during a FIFA briefing with the technical group — said. “It's something I never believed I could see in my own country. And the stadium was literally shaking. You could feel it, and the fans were absolutely incredible. So, I know the power of these home competitions. ... I know the power of these games in our country, to change the landscape of this game in our country.”

The attendance for the games in the Club World Cup has varied widely; some stadiums are jammed, some pretty much empty. With the tournament entering the knockout round and some strong matchups ahead — including Lionel Messi and Inter Miami taking on his former team, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday in Atlanta — there should be plenty of good crowds throughout the remainder of the event, as FIFA looks to build momentum toward the World Cup that's coming to North America next year.

“This is a fantastic dress rehearsal for us,” Heath said.

Only one U.S.-based team made the knockout stage: Messi's Inter Miami, though some wonder if that's a club that will have a true pronounced effect on soccer in this country. Messi is the biggest name in the sport and has an enormous following everywhere, one that obviously existed long before he came to Miami two years ago.

“Messi has not the best data of this tournament, but he's certainly the most influential player of this tournament — because without him Inter Miami would never qualify,” Wenger said.

The job of the technical study group is simple: watch all the matches, either live or on television (with the benefit of many screens and angles), assess style of play and determine what is making teams successful.

FIFA is promising that fields for next year's World Cup will be in better condition than some used in this tournament.

There have been comments — and in some cases, complaints — about conditions from European clubs, particularly fields in Charlotte and Orlando, Wenger said.

Even the field at MetLife Stadium, which will play host to the Club World Cup final in two weeks, has been the source of discussion.

“The pitch is different turf, different grass than in Europe. In my opinion, the pitch was a little bit soft and not dry, but the ball was not traveling as fast as we are used to. This is my feeling,” Borussia Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said after his team played a scoreless draw there earlier in the tournament against Fluminense.

You ask former U.S. men's national soccer team standouts Marcelo Balboa and Stu Holden about the Concacaf Gold Cup final, and the competitive spirit just oozes from their soul.

Especially since USMNT will face its biggest rival, Mexico, in the Sunday, July 6 match at NRG Stadium in Houston.

“Listen, you never want to lose to Mexico,” Balboa, 57, told USA TODAY Sports, before he joins the Gold Cup's Spanish-language broadcast on Univision, TUDN and ViX. “I'm retired. I haven't played against Mexico a long time. Even when I play in the old legends games, I don't want to lose to Mexico.”

Holden – who will be on the Gold Cup call alongside play-by-play announcer John Strong on FOX – still remembers how humiliated he felt after playing in USMNT's 5-0 loss to Mexico in the 2009 Gold Cup final.

“Man, I would give anything to step on that field on Sunday,” Holden said. “And I'm going to step on the field – I just won't be allowed to kick a ball.”

Coach Mauricio Pochettino, breakout star Diego Luna and the USMNT have a golden opportunity to rewrite the team's narrative ahead of next summer's FIFA World Cup.

They could end a tumultuous summer on a high note by lifting a trophy, setting the stage for a World Cup where they could at least be competitive against some of the best national teams in the world.

A loss, however?

Well, here's where it's important to maintain some perspective.

USMNT has been a club on the fly before the World Cup – hiring Pochettino last September, and trying to field a capable roster that won't embarrass itself when the U.S. co-hosts the tournament next summer with Canada and Mexico.

By no means are they ready for the World Cup just yet. But they'll have to be when next summer rolls around.

Star Christian Pulisic is one of several players not with USMNT during the Gold Cup this summer – his decision to rest upsetting several former players turned analysts, especially after the U.S. lost friendlies to Turkey (2-1 on June 7) and Switzerland (4-0 on June 10) before the tournament.

During the Gold Cup, the U.S. beat Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 on June 7, beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 on June 19, beat Haiti 2-1 on June 22, advanced past Costa Rica 2-2 (4-3 on penalty kicks) on June 29 and topped Guatemala 2-1 on July 2 to reach the final.

Pochettino has 10 wins in 15 matches since taking the job, a run that included a four-game losing streak going into the Gold Cup. Would another loss to Mexico – in the Gold Cup final – be a failure for Pochettino and USMNT?

“No, not at all. The fact that this team got there, I think it's very valuable for Pochettino and his coaching staff,” Balboa said, adding it's a prime opportunity for the players pushing for a roster spot to play for USMNT in the World Cup.

“Listen, nobody wants to lose. Is it a failure? I wouldn't think it's a failure at all. I think it's just one of those games that it could go either way. One mistake could cost you the game. But at the end of the day, you can't say one game that you lose to Mexico in the final, the tournament was a failure.”

Holden said he's cautious to put a label like “failure” if this group of USMNT players fall to Mexico because “it would be me getting a little bit lost in the moment.”

This Gold Cup experience is about Pochettino finding his way as the USMNT coach.

It's about players like Luna, who scored both goals against Guatemala, making a name for themselves.

It's about others like forwards Brian White and Patrick Agyemang, midfielders Max Arfsten, Jack McGlynn and Sebastian Berhalter, defenders Chris Richards and Alex Freeman, and goalkeeper Matt Freese solidifying their chances to make the World Cup roster.

Holden believes a Gold Cup win could solidify USMNT's belief in itself, and send a message to its pool of players that the club is heading in a clear direction under Pochettino's leadership.

“That means: You fight like hell on Sunday, and you beat your fiercest rival, and you cap off a great month, and we have a great storyline to tell for the next year,” Holden said.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

As mentioned earlier, this game needs a goal and who better to bring on than Ousmane Dembele to make something happen. 

He replaces Bradley Barcola for PSG, with 20 minutes left of regulation time. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

We finally have the first yellow card of the game. 

Konrad Laimer is cautioned for a high boot on Desire Doue. 

He will miss the semi-final, if Bayern Munich get the win against PSG today. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

It's another opportunity wasted. He just couldn't get over the top of it.

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

It's high time Bayern Munich make one of these chances count. 

Michael Olise wastes a chance here. With Gianluigi Donnarumma advancing, the Bayern Munich man fails to keep his shot low and the score remains goalless. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

A PSG attack is stopped by the whistle of Anthony Taylor. 

Achraf Hakimi is disappointed and makes his frustration clear. The referee keeps the cards in his pocket for now. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

The stepover from Doue - he has no right, he just leaves his man! The ball is devastating but nobody is there for a simple tap in because it goes from back to front too quickly. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

One hour clocked in this last-eight tie. 

And we are still waiting for a breakthrough. 

Michael Olise tries to find one, but once again his shot is a disappointing one - straight at the keeper. Seconds later at the opposite end, Desire Doue flashes an inviting ball across the Bayern goalmouth. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Serge Gnabry goes down in the box looking for a penalty but nothing comes out of it. 

Harry Kane then floats a cross towards the far post for Kingsley Coman, whose header is ricocheted off Achraf Hakimi and behind for a corner kick. 

This game can do with a goal!

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Serge Gnabry again in the thick of action for Bayern Munich. 

He is slipped inside the box by Konrad Laimer and tries to return the compliment. But his cutback is intercepted by the PSG defence. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

From one end to the other in a flash! 

PSG's Nuno Mendes cuts in from the left and into the box before going down inside the box. 

The referee waves play on and Harry Kane plays Serge Gnabry through. The Bayern attacker gets into the box but shoots straight at keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. 

#bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply)

How are any of these teams going to compete for anything next season? All their players will be tired. In a World Cup year some wont qualify and so not all players are tired. In Euros non-European players wont play. As an LFC fan I shouldn't complain, but won't be enthusiastic if we qualified for next one.

Alex, Bristol

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

What a stop. Barcola shapes up and Neuer knows he's going far corner. It's a good opportunity. The last few moments we've seen a few mistakes. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Bradley Barcola is through on goal here and only has the Bayern Munich goalkeeper here! 

He shifts the ball onto his right foot and tries to curl it into the far corner. 

But Manuel Neuer spring into action to push his effort away and preserve the parity in this game.

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

We are back under way for the second half. 

HT: PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Bayern Munich bring on Serge Gnabry at half time. 

The former Arsenal player will replace the injured Jamal Musiala. 

HT: PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

Bayern Munich had the ball in the back of the net during that first half with Dayot Upamecano heading in from Michael Olise's set-piece, complete with a knee-slide celebration. 

But it was quickly chalked off for offside. 

The German champions, who have lost two players to injury in the first half, will hope their next one counts. 

HT: PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

A reminder that awaiting the winners of this tie will be either Real Madrid or Borussia Dortmund, who face each other in a rematch of the 2024 Champions League finale tonight. 

HT: PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

At one point, it looked like European champions PSG were firmly on top in this game. 

But Bayern Munich have finished the half strongly and now leads with six shots, compared to PSG's five effort. 

PSG 0-0 Bayern Munich

No goals to talk about in the first half. 

But we wish a speedy recovery for Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala, who picked up what looked like a nasty injury in the dying seconds of the half.

Palmeiras 1-2 Chelsea: (Estêvão 53); Palmer (16), Weverton (83og)

Malo Gusto's cross deflected past Palmeiras goalkeeper

Their place in the last four of the Club World Cup in the bag and the prospect of a £97m windfall still up for grabs, Chelsea found themselves in an unusual position: relieved to have survived a taxing second half, hailing Malo Gusto's unlikely role as match-winner and able to delight in the opposition's goalscorer being named superior player of the match.

For a while the story of this entertaining quarter-final looked like it was going to be about Enzo Maresca finding it within himself to forgive Estêvão. Everything had changed when the Brazilian sensation, who joins Chelsea after this tournament, cancelled out an early goal from Cole Palmer and hauled Palmeiras level at the start of the second half.

Quiet during the first half, Estêvão threatened to take over and send his next team back to England. The consolation for Chelsea was likely to be seeing exactly why they have paid £52m to sign a talent tipped by many good judges to win the Ballon d'Or one day.

Yet that uncomfortable conversation between Estêvão and Maresca was averted thanks to a horrendous error from Weverton seven minutes from time, a deflected cross from Gusto somehow deceiving the Palmeiras goalkeeper and bobbling in. Palmeiras, who have never won this competition, could not believe their misfortune. They lost late to Chelsea in the final three years ago; now they were out thanks to an own goal from their goalkeeper.

Not that Chelsea cared. The future looks bright. Palmer and Estêvão working in tandem after this tournament? It is a delicious prospect and Chelsea's owners will have loved the symbolism of the duo embracing at half-time. As for the present, the focus is on reaching next Sunday's final in New Jersey. Next up are Fluminese, who beat Al-Hilal in the day's other quarter-final, and that means a reunion with a Brazilian from a different era: the former Chelsea centre-back Thiago Silva.

There was also rare positive PR for Fifa given that its dynamic pricing model pulled in a bigger crowd than expected and quelled any debate over scheduling this tie on Independence Day. This, after all, was far from the biggest show in town on Friday. Fourth of July festivities tend to be quite a big deal in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, and anyone looking for ways to mark the holiday could choose from Major League Baseball at nearby Citizens Bank Park, free concerts and a fireworks show in the city centre.

But prices dropping as low as $11.15 (£8.17) ensured there was a decent attendance at Lincoln Financial Field, where attention was on the weirdness of Estêvão playing his future employers. What to do? In Marc Cucurella's case it was to stick tight to the teenager and kick him at every opportunity. It was as if the left-back was determined to show Estêvão what it will be like in the Premier League. The challenges were physical and there was even a blast of fury from Cucurella after Estêvão had a nibble at Levi Colwill midway through the first half.

Chelsea were aggressive. The worry for Maresca was how his midfield would function without the suspended Moisés Caicedo and the injured Roméo Lavia. Enzo Fernández moved deeper but there was another rejig when Reece James suffered an injury during the warmup, forcing Maresca to hand a first start to Andrey Santos.

In that context, perhaps it was not a surprise when Chelsea grew a little ragged in the second half. Making up for the absence of Caicedo's power and Lavia's elegance was not easy for Santos. The 21-year-old Brazilian is still adjusting to Maresca's system after an impressive loan spell at Strasbourg, although this was still an encouraging first step. Playing in a deeper role, Santos asked for the ball, got stuck in and did not hide when the game got tough after half-time.

Palmeiras, who were without key figures in defence, had struggled at first. Maresca had left it up to Pedro Neto to decide if he wanted to play after the death of his friend and Portugal teammate Diogo Jota. Neto was excused from training on Thursday and it would not have been a surprise if the winger had accepted the offer of compassionate leave.

Instead, though, the 25-year-old lined up on the right wing and was soon giving Micael the runaround. Palmer, playing as a No 10, was just as elusive. Sixteen minutes in, he moved to the right, took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and turned. The outcome was inevitable. Palmer swerved on to his left foot, held off a couple of challenges and threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.

Chelsea remained on top. They should have scored again, only for Christopher Nkunku to shoot over. There was a lull as half-time approached. Richard Ríos had an opening for Palmeiras. Liam Delap ruled himself out of the semi-final after picking up a booking.

The mind went back to Chelsea blowing a half-time lead against Flamengo during the group stage. The Brazilian teams are not to be underestimated. Palmeiras emerged with more intensity at the start of the second half. The narrative turned in the 53rd minute. There was a clever pass from the right from Ríos. Estêvão nipped in, stepping past Colwill, and then came the demonstration of his unique talent: the daring to shoot from such a tight angle, the bravery to take it with his weaker right foot, and the technique to catch Robert Sánchez out at his near post, the ball flying past the Chelsea goalkeeper and going in off the bar.

Maresca responded by removing Delap for the debutant João Pedro and bringing Noni Madueke on for the disappointing Nkunku. Chelsea rallied. João Pedro, who has only had a couple of training sessions since joining from Brighton this week, looked bright. Madueke brought more drive on the left.

The game flew from end to end. Palmeiras were too open. Chelsea kept working themselves into promising positions, although the nature of the winning goal owed more to luck than judgment, Gusto squeezing in a cross, the ball changing course and Weverton not reacting in time.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Updated 6m ago

Club World Cup quarter-final action concludes at MetLife Stadium where Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund meet later today.

It is a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final with a place in the semi-final against either PSG or Bayern Munich on the line.

Madrid are the record winners of this tournament with five titles. Dortmund, meanwhile, have never won it.

Gonzalo Garcia. The academy striker had only played 61 minutes with the first team this season before the Club World Cup, but he has taken advantage of the absences of Endrick (injured) and Kylian Mbappe (illness) to surprise everyone. He has three goals, including the winner in the last 16, and one assist, and has been compared by Xabi Alonso to club legend Raul.

Not bad. Dortmund were pilloried in Germany for their goalless draw with Fluminense in the opening match, but the Brazilians then showed what a good side they are. There was more good than bad in the 2-1 win against Monterrey, which should have been far more comfortable. If there is a criticism, it's that slight carelessness which could yet cost them.

Xabi Alonso has restored enthusiasm at all levels (staff, players and fans) after a year of internal tensions and a notable lack of trophies in Madrid. Beyond the three consecutive victories at the Club World Cup, with eight goals scored and two conceded at the tournament, Alonso is showing a real tactical richness and a flair for intervening successfully during matches.

Borussia Dortmund booked their place in today's quarter-final place with a 2-1 win against Monterrey. 

Serhou Guirassy got the goals for the Bundesliga side with two well-taken first-half finishes. German Berterame headed Monterrey back into the game straight after half-time but they could not find an equaliser. A late Sergio Ramos header flew agonisingly close to the top corner as Dortmund held on for the victory. 

Real Madrid met Juventus in Miami in the round of 16, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Gonzalo Garcia's headed goal from close range in the 54th minute. Garcia's strike was his third of the tournament as he continued to impress in his deputy role while Kylian Mbappe recovered from acute gastroenteritis. Mbappe made his first appearance in this match, coming off the bench in the second half. 

Borussia Dortmund opened their Club World Cup campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Fluminense in New Jersey. Dortmund managed only seven shots on 0.24 expected goals. 

They improved on Matchday 2, offensively at least, with a 4-3 victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati. Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy, Jobe Bellingham and an own goal were responsible for Dortmund's tally. 

First place in Group F was up for grabs heading into the finale, and Dortmund benefitted from a goalless draw between Fluminense and Mamelodi Sundowns to take top spot after beating Ulsan 1-0 on Daniel Svensson's goal.

Real Madrid began their Club World Cup campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami. It was a performance that raised a few questions at the time, though Al Hilal went on to have an impressive tournament. Fede Valverde had the opportunity to steal a win for Madrid in the closing minutes, but his weak penalty attempt was saved. 

Madrid moved to Charlotte next and posted a comfortable 3-1 win over Pachuca, with Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler and Valverde the scorers. Heading into the group finale in first place but not assured of finishing there, Madrid put all doubts to rest with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Red Bull Salzburg. Vinicius Junior, Valverde and Gonzalo Garcia were the scorers in that one. 

The Club World Cup could just as easily be considered the Confederation World Cup, given the legacy of each football continent sending its best team into global battle.

And generally, the European team has come out on top. 

The above shows how 20 years of the tournament breaks down in terms of geography and performance, with a UEFA club in the final in all bar the first running of the competition — when Real Madrid finished fourth and Manchester United were knocked out in the group stage of the 2000 edition in Brazil. 

That is why CONMEBOL has more top-three finishes in total.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is a little different with 32 teams competing — when the previous 20 editions never brought together more than eight clubs each.

Still, the legacy of those early years will continue and a host of famous names will be looking to add to their previous victories.

Here are the most successful clubs in this competition's history:

We've got a couple surprise packages left in this tournament, as well as some of the pre-tournament favourites.

Manchester City were among the sides best fancied to go all the way but will play no further part. According to the Opta supercomputer, it is another English side that are now favourites.

After yesterday's results, here is how they have ranked the remaining teams based on probability of winning the tournament:

As you can imagine, up first on the agenda in Jude Bellingham's pre-match chat was was his brother's suspension.

💬 “Hopefully we will have another chance at some point in the future to play against each other. It would be a nice moment for our family.”

And then he spoke more generally about Jobe following the same path as him to Germany.

“It's beautiful, I'm really happy for my brother. There was kind of big discussions for him about the decision he could made and I think, looking now from my perspective, I'm really happy with the decision he had.

“I know people at Dortmund will look after him, I know fans will look after him, will support him, and I know he will deliver as well. Now it's about him. I'm really proud.”

When everyone realised that there was a good chance Real Madrid and Dortmund would meet in the quarter-final, there was a lot of excitement for a potential Bellingham derby — Jude at Madrid and Jobe newly signed for Dortmund.

But the prospect of that intriguing match-up went up in smoke midway through the first half of Dortmund's last-16 win against Monterrey. Jobe Bellingham had already been booked at the tournament so, when he picked up another yellow in that game, it meant he would be suspended for the potential showdown.

And he looked absolutely gutted about it. 

It was no surprise to hear such a mature answer from Bellingham who has already established a reputation as a player who speaks well in the media.

AndI can't imagine it was a coincidence that he was put forward by Real Madrid to speak ahead of a game against his former team.

Bellingham played 132 times for Dortmund between 2020 and 2023, helping them to DFB Pokal success in his first season before his big-money move to Real Madrid.

It is actually the third time he has faced the German club since leaving; first in the 2024 Champions League final and then earlier this season in the Champions League — Madrid won both of those matches.

And here is that thoughtful answer from Jude Bellingham when asked about the news regarding Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.

💬 “As a player I think this comes at the back of my mind. You think about the person, the family, the brothers. It's really hearthbreaking news to be honest.

“It's a reminder on how precious life is, how important is every time you have given the chance to wake up in the morning and that you shoul be greatful, and checking on your loved ones because you never know when it's going to be the last time you get to spend time with them. One of the first things I did was message my brother.”

Jude Bellingham spoke to the media and after a thoughtful message of his own, more on that shortly, he was asked how Trent Alexander-Arnold was feeling.

💬 “It was a really tough day for him to process. I think they were team-mates for five years. As a team we were there to support him. It's a terrible shame, I'm sure everyone, every player, every club send the condolences and love to his family. Horrible bad news.”

While Trent Alexander-Arnold has moved to Real Madrid, he was at Liverpool for the entirety of Jota's time there.

The England right-back put out a lovely message for his late friend on his social media accounts on Thursday — as you can see below.

At the start, you hope it cannot be true, that it has all been a terrible misunderstanding and that something will pop up online to let us know that the internet is a wicked place when it comes to the distribution of fake news.

But then the reports start to accelerate and, waking up to the news about Diogo Jota, you realise there has been nothing on his social media accounts since the wedding photographs that he posted, lovingly, heartbreakingly, just a few hours before his life was taken away.

“A day we will never forget,” Jota had written alongside a video montage from the ceremony in Porto, the Portuguese city where he and his childhood sweetheart, Rute Cardoso, fell in love.

The football world is in mourning after the desperately sad news of Diogo Jota's passing on Thursday.

The Liverpool forward and his brother Andre Silva, a professional player for Portuguese side Penafiel, died after being involved in a car crash in Spain.

Local police confirmed to The Athletic the incident occurred at 00:30 local time on Thursday morning on the A-52 — a 400km carriageway running from Madrid to the Spanish region of Galicia, north of Portugal — in the province of Zamora, in north-west Spain.

The Lamborghini car, which was occupied by 28-year-old Jota and Silva, 25, went off the road and suffered an impact, causing the vehicle to catch fire, local authorities confirmed. It is yet to be confirmed which of the two were driving the vehicle at the time of the incident.

A moment of silence was held before yesterday's quarter-finals and will be held before today's games.

It all started at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida where Al Hilal — the conquerors of Manchester City in the last 16 — were eliminated by Fluminense. The hero for the Brazilians was, once again, the appropriately named Hercules as he came off the bench to score the winner.

Then Chelsea made it past Palmeiras. Cole Palmer's first-half opener was cancelled out by a brilliant finish from Estevao, who is joining Chelsea after the conclusion of this tournament, before a late own goal sealed the Premier League side's place in the semi-final.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund will meet in the last FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal on Saturday, July 5, in a rematch of a recent Champions League final.

Plenty has changed for both sides since Real Madrid beat Dortmund 2-0 on June 1, 2024, in the Champions League final.

French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid, while both feature new coaches.

It will be the fifth match for Xabi Alonso as Real Madrid's coach, taking over during their Club World Cup run after leading Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.

“It will be an intense game, and we need to perform at a high level. We're looking forward to it,” Alonso told reporters before the match.

Dortmund's Niko Kovac orchestrated the club's epic comeback from 10th place to fourth to finish the Bundesliga season. The club is riding an 11-match unbeaten streak heading into the matchup.

Real Madrid has won four of the last six matches against Dortmund, heading into their quarterfinal at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

“We're expecting a lot of supporters, especially for Real Madrid,” Kovac told reporters. “We're here as an underdog, but we also want to show our best face and hopefully - this is what we are believing - we can pass to the next round.”

Mbappé is expected to play – whether he starts or comes on as a substitute will be determined when Real Madrid announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

No, Jobe Bellingham is not playing for Dortmund because of a yellow card accumulation in the Club World Cup. He won't play against his older brother, Jude for Real Madrid.

PSG may be the favorite to win the Club World Cup, but the Bavarians have won each of their last four meetings between these teams. They clean-sheeted PSG in each of those matchups, so the Bundesliga titans could have a psychological advantage heading into Saturday's game.

Bayern are undefeated in eight of their last nine matches across all competition and have outscored their opponents 16-4 over four Club World Cup games. The expert adds that Bayern is the toughest opponent PSG have faced so far in the tournament, so they shouldn't be taken lightly. See which team to back at SportsLine.

Eimer is impressed with how PSG have played in the Club World Cup since star striker Ousmane Dembele has been sidelined due to a quadriceps injury. A front line including Desire Doue, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Bradley Barcola has helped PSG outscore opponents 10-1 in this competition, and Eimer is banking on Doue to be particularly stealthy on Saturday.

""All eyes will be on Dembele's return as Bayern try to mark the PSG striker, and Doue tends to shine the most when the focus shifts to his teammates,"" he told SportsLine. See which team to back at SportsLine. 

Eimer is leaning Over on the goal toals, and has broken down Bayern vs. PSG match from every angle. He has identified three picks for Saturday's match, including one that offers a plus-money payout. Head to SportsLine to see his analysis and top picks.

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Philly hosted its last FIFA Club World Cup game Friday night and it had all the thrills, noise and literal fireworks that any Fourth of July event deserves.

English side Chelsea returned to Lincoln Financial Field for the third time this summer and defeated Brazilian side Palmeiras, 2-1, in front of 65,782 fans, the stadium's best attendance this tournament.

Before the game, soccer fans let the city know they were here. Palmerias rallied outside City Hall Friday afternoon, while Chelsea fans took over the official supporters club's home bar Tir nA Nog on Thursday and Friday, as they did in previous games this summer.

Leading up to the game, Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira tried to leverage the Fourth of July vibes to build support for his underdog side against British opposition.

Ticket prices dipped to as low as $15 Friday, and when it filled out, the blue team from London appeared to have the numbers in the stands, while the São Paulo-based side in green brought the flags, banners and organized noise that has charged the stadium since its opening game.

The Linc added patriotic spectacle to proceedings by moving the singing of the national anthem closer to the start  of the game, with volleys of fireworks “at the rockets red glare” and “the home of the brave.” There was also a live DJ set and fireworks show during halftime. Thirty minutes into the game the fireworks at the Ben Franklin Bridge peaked over a corner of the stadium, and footage of that show was played briefly on the stadium's big screens.

Before kickoff, there were moments of silence to pay tribute to Liverpool star Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva, who both died in a car accident in Spain on Thursday. Their Portuguese compatriot, Chelsea's Pedro Neto, entered the field holding a shirt in honor of them.

Chelsea opened the scoring in the 16th minute through their English star Cole Palmer, who turned deftly with the pass from Trevoh Chalobah, ran across the goal and two defenders before slotting the ball into the bottom corner and performing his trademark “shiver” celebration.

Palmeiras' 18-year-old star Estêvão is set to become a Chelsea player next season, but still received a rough treatment from the Blues defenders like Marc Cucurella. He showed why Chelsea paid a reported $40 million for him, though, by scoring Palmeiras' equalizer from an improbably tight angle in the 53rd minute.

The game remained closely contested, but Chelsea found its winning goal rather fortunately in the 83rd minute, when Malo Gusto's cross deflected off Palmeiras defender Agustín Giay's foot and then the hip of the wrong-footed goalkeeper Weverton.

Despite being on the losing side, Estêvão's performance earned him the player of the match award. 

Chelsea will now go on to face yet another Brazilian side, Rio de Janeiro's Fluminense, on Tuesday at 3 p.m. Palmer said he expects another tough game against strong opposition.

“I feel like they're more physical, more rough,” he said when asked how they compared to Chelsea's usual opposition in the English Premier League. “We know that they're good teams, so it's difficult to play against them.”

Palmer also shared some words with Estêvão on the field after the final whistle, despite a language barrier.

“I just said we look forward to seeing you, but he didn't understand a word I said,” Palmer revealed.

The other semifinal still has to be decided, with the remaining quarterfinal matches playing out today between Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich at noon, followed by Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund at 4 p.m. The tournament semifinals and final will all be held at nearby Metlife Stadium.

For those who are disappointed that the soccer at the Linc is over until next year's six FIFA World Cup matches, just a friendly reminder that the Philadelphia Union currently have the best record in Major League Soccer and are playing away at Nashville SC at 8:30 p.m. tonight. The team next plays at Subaru Park in Chester on July 9, taking on rivals New York Red Bulls in the quarterfinal of the U.S. Open Cup.

GRAHAM Jagger moved from Craven to Atlanta in the United States in 2020. Here in his Letter from America, the keen sportsman is already looking forward to the football World Cup.

 

IT'S only a year until the football World Cup is set to take place in Mexico, Canada, and the USA. Here in Atlanta, Georgia, eight matches will be held at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta, including one of the semi-finals.

Before that, there's the FIFA Club World Cup, with five games scheduled to be played in Atlanta. Chelsea and Manchester City are set to participate in their first two games here. On television, the transformation of the stadium is showcased to accommodate a natural grass pitch for the matches, replacing the artificial turf currently used by Atlanta United and the Atlanta Falcons, the American football team.

When it comes to the World Cup next year, the entirety of the artificial turf pitch will be excavated, and an even greater transformation will occur to construct the new playing surface. All of this takes me back to my football playing days when pitches were somewhat different from today.

My football journey began with Skipton LMS Juniors, playing at Sandylands on the pitch next to Carleton New Road, which has long been neglected and, as far as I know, faces an uncertain future. It's a great shame because it was one of the better playing surfaces around at the time.

I even played on it in the Craven Cup Final for Barnoldswick United in May 1978, just a couple of days after my daughter Rebecca was born at Airedale Hospital. To play for the LMS junior team, I had to catch the bus from Kelbrook, where I lived, to Skipton and, of course, back after the game. I never thought anything of doing that; it was perfectly safe to do so in those days. My games on Sundays followed my play for Ermysted's on Saturdays at rugby. My life revolved around sport during that time and for many years afterwards.

After three years at university in Leeds, where I played for anyone who would have me, I returned to play for Skipton Town for a brief period before moving closer to home and joining Barnoldswick Park Rovers. At that time, Park Rovers were the top team around, and although I had the chance to play a few matches for their first team, I mainly played in the reserves.

Playing with the first team involved considerable travel, as they competed in a league that included teams from Cumbria. Eventually, I transitioned to Barnoldswick United, which was, in many ways, an offshoot of Park Rovers but not directly connected to them.

I enjoyed playing with them at Victory Park in Barlick; they had a fantastic group of people involved in the team and organising the club. That was on Saturdays, and on Sundays I played with the Ouzledale Foundry team in the Pendle and District Sunday Charity League.

The team consisted of six players registered with teams that played on Saturdays and five players who did not play with a Saturday team. This made for some interesting mixes of players, including those who could not play on Saturdays for work reasons, some who had stopped playing on Saturdays due to family commitments or age, and others who played rugby on Saturdays and football on Sundays. We had a very successful team during the years I played with them. I was even selected for the league representative team and won a “man of the match” award when we played at Blackpool and beat a team from over there.

But eventually, age and circumstances caught up with me, leading to my retirement from regular football. However, I continued playing cricket in the summer for several more years. My cricket teams were Thornton in the Craven League and Earby in the Ribblesdale League, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at both clubs.

Reflecting on my experience with football compared to the way soccer exists today in the US offers an intriguing perspective. It is quite surprising to witness just how popular soccer has become here, particularly at the grassroots level. More people participate in soccer than in any other sport in this country, which may astonish you as it did me. In metro Atlanta, where I reside, several leagues are catering to various age groups and both male and female players.

Moreover, there are even more who play casually among friends on an ad hoc basis. A nearby three-pitch soccer complex, which is open for anyone to use for free and with floodlights until 10 pm each evening, can often host 500 or more just kicking about in small groups and using whatever space is available. I was gobsmacked the first time I saw this. And I thought England was the home of football.

While most of the soccer played here takes place on an artificial surface, ensuring it is always playable, some matches are held on natural grass. However, many find it challenging to play on natural grass, which is the only type of surface I have ever played on. I remember those days when the pitches we played on were sodden with rain, thick with mud, blanketed in snow, rock-hard due to ice, or, on some occasions, covered in cow muck because the animals had been driven off shortly before the game was set to start. It was often difficult to see the lines, as the grass might be too long to mark them out clearly, or it was so wet that you couldn't get the paint to adhere. How things have changed over the years.

However, for the two upcoming world-class competitions, they will be played on impeccable surfaces in a climate-controlled venue with a roof that can be closed as needed. Oh well, we can all dream!

It seems quite likely that some individuals in the Craven area are contemplating a visit to Atlanta for next year's World Cup. It's a splendid city to explore, and there are numerous attractions to see and activities to engage in when you're here. Accommodation will be in high demand and expensive, but I have space for visitors if necessary. Let me know.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has revealed that new signing Joao Pedro will get some game time during the FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal vs. Palmerias. (1:41)

PHILADELPHIA -- It's never easy to make sense of Chelsea, a club that doesn't do ""normal,"" so why should it be any different when they seal a place in the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals with an own goal by a Palmeiras player and their new wonderkid Estêvão scoring against them?

Chelsea's 2-1 win against Palmeiras, which earned them £15 million in prize money, also happened to come on the day that the Premier League team was hit with a £27 million fine by UEFA for breaching financial regulations. If Enzo Maresca's side beats Fluminense in Tuesday's semifinal in East Rutherford, New Jersey, it will bank another £21.8 million and wipe out the UEFA sanction before the ink has even dried on the rap sheet.

Chelsea will go into their last-four encounter as strong favorites even without center forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill, who both picked up yellow cards against Palmeiras that mean they will be suspended for the next game. Midfielder Moisés Caicedo will return from suspension, and new signing Joao Pedro, who made his debut in Philadelphia as a substitute just three days after completing a transfer from Brighton worth an initial £50 million, will replace Delap.

That's how it works at Chelsea. They have so many players that no injury or suspension seems to make a difference, because the carousel just turns and another player steps off to fill the void.

Estêvão will be the next one to join Maresca's ever-growing squad. The 18-year-old completed a £33.8 million transfer from Palmeiras in June 2024, but at age 17 at the time was too young to make the move directly to Stamford Bridge, so he remained in Brazil to continue his development with Palmeiras. Chelsea could have called Estêvão into their squad for this tournament this month but decided to allow the teenager to remain with Palmeiras and assess his readiness for Maresca's squad by monitoring his performances in the competition.

There was always a chance the two clubs would meet and pose a difficult scenario for the player, but in what turned out to be his final game for the Sao Paulo team before heading to Chelsea, Estêvão dazzled and scored a stunning goal that will hugely excite his new club's supporters. With Chelsea leading 1-0 after a first-half Cole Palmer goal, Palmeiras struggled to land a blow on the English team until Estêvão raced onto a ball into the penalty area and beat Colwill to it before scoring with a right-footed strike that went in off the underside of the crossbar. It was a goal that showcased audacity, confidence and supreme skill, and it sparked Palmeiras into a period that could have, and maybe should have, delivered a second goal to put them in the lead.

Craig Burley discusses Xabi Alonso's selection headache ahead of Real Madrid's quarterfinal clash vs. Borussia Dortmund.

Estêvão was part of that revival, tormenting the Chelsea back line with his blistering pace and linking well with impressive No. 9 Vitor Roque. But the Brazilian team was unable to make its dominance pay, and Chelsea fortuitously regained the lead on 83 minutes when Malo Gusto's cross was diverted into the net after two deflections, off Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton. It was a goal worth £15 million in prize money, so it probably deserved to be a little more spectacular, but Chelsea won't mind how it went in because it secured a place in the semis.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

How Chelsea have made it this far is down to luck rather than good planning. Maresca's team was mediocre during the group stage, when it was comfortably beaten by Flamengo, but reached the quarterfinal after a farcical round-of-16 tie against Benfica in Charlotte that was hit by a two-hour weather delay and saw the Portuguese side create chances to win the game. But despite it all, including the off-field noise that often accompanies the club, Chelsea have made it to the semis, and they will face arguably the weakest of the four Brazilian teams -- Botafogo being the other in contention -- in Fluminense, who overcame Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal in the quarterfinals.

Less than two months ago, Chelsea were facing a failure to qualify for the Champions League and the prospect of their £1 billion spending spree amounting to little more than a Conference League success. But all of a sudden, they are 90 minutes away from the Club World Cup final, having already bagged Champions League qualification and the Conference League.

Just don't try to make sense of it all, because this is Chelsea, and chaos seems to be the driving force behind the club and Maresca's team.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the semifinals of the FIFA Club World Cup where they will face Fluminense.

A late own goal off Palmeiras defender Agustin Giay lifted Chelsea to a 2-1 victory in Philadelphia, sending the Premier League side into the Club World Cup semifinals.

A shot by Chelsea's Malo Gusto from the right side deflected off Palmeiras' Richard Rios and Giay. Goalkeeper Weverton was unable to control the caroming ball before it went into the net.

Chelsea will play Fluminense on Tuesday in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Brazilian side defeated Al Hilal 2-1 earlier on Friday.

Cole Palmer scored his first of the tournament in the 16th minute for Chelsea before Estevao, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, tied it in the 53rd minute.

Palmer had been criticised by the Chelsea fans for his lack of production despite leading the team in shots on goal during the tournament.

He proved his worth on the goal, taking a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and dribbling from just outside the box to 15 yards out before scoring with a left-footed strike.

“I've been working on … the shot in training. I just saw the space and went there,” Palmer told DAZN after the match.

“The manager just said to keep calm and do lots of passes, and we should be all right.”

Chelsea fans didn't know whether to cheer or cry, however, when Estevao tied it with a brilliant, tight-angle shot for the equaliser.

He made a verbal agreement with Chelsea in May 2024 but was not permitted to move to England until he turned 18 on April 24, delaying his transfer to the current window.

The clubs arranged that he would remain with Palmeiras until their tournament run ended.

“You can see he [Estevao] is a top player, so we are excited for him [to join Chelsea after the tournament],” Palmer said of his soon-to-be teammate.

Joao Pedro made his Chelsea debut in the 54th minute, two days after his signing from Brighton & Hove Albion of the Premier League was confirmed.

The Brazilian had 10 goals and six assists for Brighton last season.

Pedro's new manager at Chelsea, Enzo Maresca, was glowing about all aspects of the win.

“It has been a tough game, as we expected,” the Blues boss told DAZN.

“We needed lots of energy. At the end, congratulations to the players because they were very good.

“I'm happy because we won, and also happy because Estevao scored. The perfect night.”

Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund, while Paris-Saint Germain take on Bayern Munich in the other quarterfinals on Saturday.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner won't be much use to his country next year if he continues to play at a lower level

""Peace has cost you your strength; victory has defeated you,"" the muscle-bound, arch-villain Bane tells Batman after catching one of his punches in the hit movie 'The Dark Knight Rises'. The time-worn caped crusader continues to fight as hard as he can, but is ultimately left with a broken back at the end of the scene, having succumbed to the most dangerous pitfall of all: complacency.

There was a similar feeling of futility generated by watching Lionel Messi toil in the second half of Inter Miami's Club World Cup last-16 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain last weekend. Even at the ripe old age of 38, Messi was still able to produce dazzling moments of genius, including a beautiful first-time pass for Luis Suarez that should have earned him an assist, but it was nowhere near enough to lay a glove on an opponent operating at the highest possible technical and physical level.

It was sad to see perhaps the greatest player in the history of the sport fighting a battle he was never going to win. ""The match was what was expected,"" Messi admitted to DSports after the 4-0 thrashing. ""They're a great team, winners of the last Champions League, and they're in really good shape. We tried to do our best, and I think we left a good impression at the Club World Cup.""

Is simply leaving a ""good impression"" the goal now for Messi at this stage of his illustrious career? The diminutive wizard has found peace in Miami, but he's also become complacent, and that's bad news for Argentina one year out from their World Cup defence. However, fresh rumours of a potential return to Barcelona have also surfaced in recent days, which would change everything for Messi and the Albiceleste...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca heaped praise on Noni Madueke but sent out a blunt message for the Arsenal-linked winger. The Gunners have reportedly initiated fresh round of transfer talks with Madueke's representatives as their search for a new attacker continues. The Blues reportedly value the 23-year-old England internatonal at £50 million ($68m).

EXCLUSIVE: A verbal beatdown in South London forced Richards to realize he needed a mindset change to reach his potential, dreams

ST. LOUIS - ""I just have a lot to say.""

Chris Richards has found his voice. Not that it was ever lost, to be fair, but it was a bit more muted, maybe a bit more timid. Not anymore. Richards is himself, but louder. He's the same player, but more confident. He's Chris Richards, but a different version, one whose goal is no longer to break into teams, but to lead them.

That applies for both club and country. He lifted one trophy this year with Crystal Palace, where he was fueled by the hardest conversation of his career, right on through to an FA Cup. He has a chance to lift another on Sunday with the USMNT, having stepped into the spotlight in the absence of many of the team's stars. Despite several veterans missing this Gold Cup, there has been no leadership void - in large part because Richards has been eager to fill it.

That's by design. All of the interviews, press conferences and media availabilities? That's him taking responsibility. All of those moments on the training pitch? That's him using his experience. And all of the crucial moments that propelled the the USMNT to the Gold Cup final? Well, that's just Richards being Richards, establishing himself as one of the most vital pieces in this USMNT - with a World Cup on the horizon.

""Honestly, I'm just me,"" Richards tells GOAL. ""It's not something where I have to step out of myself and do extra. I'm myself, but just a little bit more vocal. I've also gotten to a point where I can just be a leader and be more vocal rather than letting a captain do it. There can be three or four captains on the field. That's what makes a great team - more than one guy stepping up to the plate.

""I understand I'm a leader and I want to act like it. Regardless of who's on the team at the World Cup next year, I still want to be that person. I came into this summer with the confidence to say, 'Man, I'm doing my own f*cking thing and I'm going to be me'. Like, I'm going to earn my spot, but I'm also going to try and be captain or whatever the case may be. That's been my No. 1 goal this camp.""

Richards finding his voice isn't a new development, though. His path towards leadership didn't begin this summer. It began with a verbal beatdown back in South London, one that forced him to reckon with the fact that he hadn't yet become the player he always wanted to be.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Enzo Maresca's side were given a scare, but relied on their main man and a fortunate own goal to secure a semi-final berth

Chelsea overcame a scare from their soon-to-be new signing Estevao as Cole Palmer's fine finish and a fortunate late winner secured a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras on Friday night, with the English side progressing to the Club World Cup semi-finals. The Blues took an early lead before being pegged back by the wonderkid's wonder strike, but made their dominance pay in the end.

Palmer opened the scoring with a classy piece of individual play. The attacking midfielder rolled his man, found half-a-yard of space and slotted home after just 16 minutes. But Palmeiras enjoyed their moments, too. Estevao - who will join Chelsea after the tournament - caused problems on the right and was instrumental in setting up their best chance of the first half, with left-back Vanderlan planting a free header into the arms of Robert Sanchez.

Estevao made his mark eight minutes after half-time, though, and showed in a brief flash why Chelsea were so eager to bring him in. The 18-year-old beat his man before lashing a vicious strike in off the crossbar from a near-impossible angle and wheeling away in celebration.

However, the Brazilian underdogs were unable to hold on, as the Blues eked out a fortunate winner with just seven minutes left on the clock. They worked the ball down the left to Malo Gusto, whose mishit cross was diverted into the back of the net by the hapless Agustin Giay.

Chelsea were relatively comfortable after that. Palmeiras offered little on the break, while Enzo Maresca's side largely controlled play to cruise into the semi-finals - albeit with a stroke of luck. Another Brazilian side, Fluminense, are next - and you'd back the Blues to grind out a result there, too.

Roddick lifted his only major trophy at the US Open in 2003 and is the last American man to win a Slam. Americans Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Brandon Nakashima are still alive at this year's Championships and will all be aiming to change that record.

Battered but unbroken, Jordan Thompson won't soon forget the way he cracked the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.

After retiring from his Queen's Club opener two weeks ago due to a back injury, the 31-year-old Australian arrived at the All England Club with tempered expectations, unsure how far his body would carry him. Yet through sheer grit and determination, he has clawed his way through 14 punishing sets, defying both injury and odds to stand among the last 16.

“I think anyone that knows me knows that, if we're playing a game of marbles or cards or whatever, I'm competitive,” Thompson told reporters after his third-round victory. “I want to win no matter what. That certainly helps. I'm not anywhere near 100 per cent and I'm still fighting my ass off for every point.”

With the help of a thick back brace and the support of Australian Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt, the World No. 44 Thompson has been patching himself together and playing through the pain this week.

Yet Thompson's run has been far from straightforward, which adds a layer of intrigue into his story. He rallied from two sets down to a memorable first-round win against Vit Kopriva and then also survived Benjamin Bonzi in five before fending off Luciano Darderi in four to equal his best result at a Grand Slam tournament.

Hewitt — known to many as ‘Rusty' — remains the last Australian man to lift the Wimbledon singles trophy, and his experience has been invaluable alongside Thompson's primary coach, Marinko Matosevic. Earlier this week, Thompson conceded that post-Wimbledon, he'll “probably be on the sidelines”, a looming reality that's only fueling his current charge at SW19.

“I'm grateful that Rusty's there, because he's done everything in tennis,” Thompson said of Hewitt, the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “He knows how I'm feeling, so sometimes he's talking more than my coach, but I look at both of them. I'm with Marinko everyday but Rusty has been in this position so many times, so he knows how it feels.

“If I can't get to a ball I would normally get to, I'll just look over and go ‘This is shit', it's frustrating and it makes it very unenjoyable.”

However hard it may be, Thompson is wearing his heart on his sleeve and, while he's never gone this far at Wimbledon before, his grass-court pedigree is established. He twice reached the final at the ATP 250 in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, finishing runner-up in 2019 and 2023.

“Results have shown that grass is probably my best surface, and it hasn't shown at Wimbledon so that's pleasing to get my best result here,” said Thompson. “To do it under the circumstances at the moment is incredible.”



The war isn't over yet, however, and Thompson will on Sunday face his biggest test so far:  A fourth-round clash with World No. 5 Taylor Fritz, who arrives on a seven-matching winning streak after claiming his record-extending fourth Eastbourne crown.

Fritz, the only active player besides Novak Djokovic with five or more tour-level grass titles, thrives on the surface. But Thompson does not have to look far for confidence — he defeated Fritz at Queen's Club last year, levelling their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

“I'm not going on the court if I don't think I can win, that's a pathetic outlook if I go out there thinking I can't win,” said Thompson. “I won last time and it was on grass, but it was very different grass, different circumstances. Serve and return [will be] the two biggest compartments of the game, and then if it does come back I've got to make him feel uncomfortable.”

With Hewitt in his corner and his warrior spirit on full display, Thompson's Wimbledon fight is far from finished.

For Alex de Minaur, the British grass-court season is about more than just tennis, it's about home away from home.

The Australian has become a familiar face on UK soil, not just for his dynamic grass-court game but also thanks to his relationship with fiancé and British No. 2 Katie Boulter. Their shared journey, on and off the court, has anchored De Minaur's growing connection to the country, turning this leg of the season into something more personal.

“I love the UK,” De Minaur told ATPTour.com ahead of the grass swing “I've spent a lot of time over here in recent years. I think it's a completely different style of living than in Spain. There's a lot more greenery, a lot more countryside, which I do enjoy. Being at Wimbledon is special and when it comes to the court and the tennis, I am ready to produce my best again this year.”



De Minaur's Wimbledon campaign came to an abrupt halt last year due to a hip injury, just before a highly anticipated quarter-final clash with Novak Djokovic. But the disappointment did little to dim his star among local fans. With his trademark speed, gritty baseline play and quiet charisma, he's been affectionately dubbed an ‘honourary Brit' at times in recent years.

That label fits for more reasons than one. His bond with Boulter has made the UK feel like a second home, complete with local hideaways and quiet park strolls.

“I've been quite fortunate that I've had a pretty good tour guide with Katie,” De Minaur said. “She's shown me around the best spots. The grass season has always been one of my favourite seasons in the year and it feels quite good to stay in the same place for the entirety of the season.

“We definitely do have some of our special areas that we like to keep quiet, because it does tend to get a little bit crazy during that Wimbledon timeline. But yeah, we've got enough special areas where we can get our alone time and really enjoy doing what we love.”

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

The couple's summer stretch in the UK provides an opportunity to carve out more time together on a global Tour, which can leave them on opposite sides of the globe.

“Whenever we are at the same tournaments, it just makes life a lot easier,” De Minaur said. “You get that sense of tranquillity, you've got each other. Our teams are almost like an extension of family… Even though we're away from home, or wherever we may be, it feels like we're all together and we're all at home.” 

On court, De Minaur has steadily built his resume on grass. A finalist at The Queen's Club and a former Eastbourne titlist, the 26-year-old's foot speed and flat groundstrokes have made him one of the most dangerous players on the surface.

And as he eyes another deep run at Wimbledon in 2025 following his 2024 quarter-final showing, the support he feels from the British crowd adds an extra layer of motivation.

“I definitely do feel the support, and it's a pretty cool feeling, especially in a place like Wimbledon, where there's such rich history, culturally and tennis-wise,” De Minaur said. “Everyone just loves the sport. And for them to have my back and show such great support, even though I'm not from that country, is pretty special.”

De Minaur is in third-round action on Saturday against August Holmgren.

Jannik Sinner advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth consecutive year on Saturday by overcoming a physically hampered Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.

Having dropped just 17 games in his campaign so far, Sinner has equalled the Open Era record for fewest games dropped into the men's singles fourth round at Wimbledon, held by Jan Kodes in 1972. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has also yet to drop his serve this week. He has won all 37 service games he has played, fending off all eight break points he has faced.

Sinner led Martinez 5-0 in the first set before the Spaniard took a medical timeout to receive treatment on his right shoulder. Martinez struggled to serve at full capacity — often firing first serves at 80 mph – while the Italian remained typically dominant from the back of the court.

“I'm very happy to be in the second week, but I think we all saw he was struggling with the shoulder,” said Sinner. “He couldn't serve very well, and especially on this surface, if you can't serve well, it's not easy to play. But huge credit to him for coming out. From my side, I tried to stay solid from the back of the court.”

Martinez grew in confidence in a free-hitting display in the second set, carving out four break points in the eighth game. Yet Sinner saved all of them with a mix of bruising ballstriking and pinpoint serving to reassert his dominance on the encounter before racing to a one-hour, 55-minute victory.

Smooooth from Sinner 😮‍💨He strolls past Martinez in straight sets to advance…@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XB4ra0TKE5

By reaching the fourth round at a Grand Slam tournament for the 17th time, Sinner overtook Nicola Pietrangeli (16) to claim the all-time Italian record. It marks his fourth consecutive appearance in the last 16 at Wimbledon in just his fifth foray at the grass-court major.

After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Martinez, Sinner set a clash with Grigor Dimitrov, who moved past Sebastian Ofner 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(0). The 23-year-old Sinner is chasing his fourth major trophy and first at Wimbledon, where he reached the semi-finals in 2023 before falling to Novak Djokovic.

While Sinner cannot lose his World No. 1 spot during the tournament, he is still aiming to make ground in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which determines who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz currently leads second-placed Sinner by 2,240 points atop the Live Race.



In contrast to rivals Alcaraz and seven-time winner Djokovic, who have each squandered sets during their campaigns at SW19 thus far, Sinner has not faltered. He remains the only player in the men's singles draw not to have dropped a set, and is also yet to drop serve across his first three matches.

If Lorenzo Sonego can join Sinner and Flavio Cobolli, who earlier defeated Jakub Mensik, in the fourth round, it will mark the first time in history that three Italians reach that stage at WImbledon.

The opening Saturday at Wimbledon is a day the All England Club traditionally invites a range of sporting superstars into the Royal Box. Those watching Sinner score his 22nd win of the season included Tennis Hall of Famers Andy Roddick and Vijay Amritraj, among other sporting legends from across the board.

“I feel like I haven't won anything compared to you,” Sinner said to the Royal Box crowd. “For us athletes, it's very nice when we see new faces because we are not used to playing in front of such special guests, so thank you for watching.”

There were moments of magic for Martinez, who flicked an expertly-measured lob over Sinner in the sixth game of the second set. Yet these were few and far between as Sinner took control of the Centre Court occasion.

No Bull, no Fluff, No Smudges

July 5, 2025 | FlaglerLive | Leave a Comment 

By Michael Lewis

WIMBLEDON, England — I was taller than Reilly Opelka when I first met him.

I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me.

But it's true. I was 5-foot-5 then, in 2009, and I'm still 5-foot-5 (OK fine, since my hair is mostly gone I'm probably 5'4”). He was around 5-3.

Of course, he was also only 11 years old.

In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states.

I've seen him joyous, such as when he qualified for the U.S. Open Juniors in 2013, as a 15-year-old, and his parents (George and Lynne) and I stood on a walkway inside Arthur Ashe Stadium and looked at each other and said “Can you believe we're actually here?”

Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere.

I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was.

I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport.

So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated.

Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career.

Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July.

When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder.

This is a guy who was No. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here.

But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets.

“I got dominated,” Opelka told me. “It sucks. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. Something has to change.”

The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. He entered Wimbledon ranked No. 70.

The problem, ironically, is his serve. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points.

These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points.

“Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. “Right now my serve is just really really bad.”

Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing.

“There's a long way to go but he's getting there,” Kudla said. “Sometimes we all want fast results. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. Slow and steady, he's getting there.”

Opelka isn't so sure.

“I'll quit,” he said. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. If I keep losing, I'll just wait until my ranking drops to the point where it's really bad, and then I'll quit.”

I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit.

Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium.

Some players, you wonder what they'd do with themselves all day if they didn't have tennis. Opelka isn't like that. He's got plenty of outside interests. He's smart, well-spoken and could be a great broadcaster if he wanted to be.

If he's not happy and struggling with tennis, then maybe it's good he's thinking of leaving. He's still young, after all.

But I hope that's not the case. He deserves to come all the way back and have the kind of success he was having a few years ago, the kind that seemed preordained all those years ago on the courts of the Palm Coast Tennis Center, the courts that now bear his name.

It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through.

Emma Raducanu and Aryna Sabalenka put on a tennis clinic on Friday night as they battled it out for a place in the Wimbledon fourth round.

With the roof closed on Centre Court, Raducanu and Sabalenka provided two hours of relentless entertainment.

Saving seven set points in the first, Raducanu pushed the world number one to a tiebreaker, missing a set point of her own, as Sabalenka eventually took the lead 7-6 [8-6].

Not willing to let the opportunity slip through her fingers, Raducanu, spurred on by the passionate British fans, broke early in the second, as she looked to send the tie into a deciding set.

It wasn't to be, however, as the experience of Sabalenka prevailed, breaking twice late on to secure the win 7-6, 6-4.

The fans on Centre Court were disappointed to see their favorite, Raducanu, exit the tournament, but were more than satisfied with the action they saw.

Perhaps another Grand Slam tournament should take note, as the women put on a show on Friday evening.

One of the biggest stories at the French Open last month was the tournament organisers' refusal to schedule women's matches for the night session on Court Philippe Chatrier.

Despite having plenty of opportunities to let the stars of the WTA Tour shine, they insisted on having the men play instead.

Raducanu and Sabalenka's Wimbledon thriller arguably proved the French Open organisers wrong, as there's no doubt everyone departing Centre Court will have said they got their money's worth on Friday night.

However, while Wimbledon deserves credit for scheduling the women's match last, that's not to say there's been an even split at this year's Championships.

Just two women's matches (both featuring Raducanu) have been scheduled as the last match of the day on Centre Court in 2025.

With Novak Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic set to headline day six, the women will have been last on in just 33% of the matches at Wimbledon as the first week nears its end.

There is no doubt, however, that Wimbledon has done a better job than Roland Garros at sharing the spotlight.

But why don't the French Open organisers schedule women's matches for the Chatrier night sessions?

Roland Garros is unique in how they format their day and night sessions, compared to the other three Grand Slams.

Not only does their night session start later than the others, but it also features just one match, whereas the Australian Open, for example, often hosts two.

Therefore, the big worry for Roland Garros organisers is that if they schedule a women's match for the night session on Chatrier, it could finish quickly, leaving fans without a full evening's entertainment.

As the men play best-of-five sets, compared to the women playing best-of-three, their matches often last longer.

That isn't always the case, of course, as there have been several occasions where three-set women's matches outlast men's three-set matches.

If the French Open were to simply add another match to the night session, surely their problems would be solved, as they could rotate between scheduling a men's match one night and two women's matches the next.

However, it doesn't look like they'll be making a change anytime soon, as the men continue to get the nod at Roland Garros.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

At 27, August Holmgren is making a name for himself with a stunning debut run at Wimbledon 2025.

He stepped into the press room last Thursday looking hesitant, almost as if he wasn't quite sure he belonged there. August Holmgren, reserved and a little awkward with the exercise, sank into his chair, hands tucked under his thighs, seeming as though he might struggle to find his words. But within moments, he found his rhythm - speaking fluent English - as though he was just beginning to realise the magnitude of the moment he was living.

Once he opened up, his nerves melted away, replaced by the bright smile of a young man brimming with warmth and joy - his blonde curls bouncing with every nod of the head. The shyness was gone, replaced by something else: someone genuinely enjoying the ride. The exact same feeling he exudes when on court.

Holmgren has emerged as one of the unexpected stories of this year's Championships - one of just two qualifiers still in the men's draw, alongside Nicolas Jarry, who advanced to the fourth round yesterday after defeating teenage sensation Joao Fonseca.

Asked what he thinks he's doing here, Holmgren answered with calm humility.

""There's always fine margins in tennis and the best players in the world are where they are because they can maintain that high level for the entire year. I've been able to maintain a very high level for two weeks now. So, I guess that's why I'm able to compete at this level right now.""

And what a level it's been! After coming through the qualifying rounds in Roehampton, the Dane - ranked 192 in the world at the start of the tournament - has earned every win the hard way. In his first-round match against France's Quentin Halys (7-6(4), 6-3, 6-4), he secured a first-ever ATP main draw victory. Then came an epic second-round thriller against Tomas Machac (7-6(5), 6-7(8), 6-7(5), 7-5, 7-6(5)), in which he saved three match points - just like he did during the last qualies game, against Yosuke Watanuki.

When reminded of that moment, his eyes widened. ""Was it three match points I had to save? Jesus!""

The room burst out laughing. Then, suddenly, the memory clicked.

""Oh yes, I remember now! In the moment, I knew it was match points, I remember distinctly. I kind of shaked my backhand a little bit and thought it was just done. And then, all of the sudden, it hits the very corner. I thought it was over, I thought: ok, I'm on my way to the net and thank you very much!""

Another anecdote to add to the collection of this already unique player. After that emotional win, he collapsed into the arms of his parents, - a moment shared with the red-and-white Danish fans who've followed him since qualifying. A lot of happiness and emotion that cross a threshold for the 27 years old: he now officially plays in a new league.

If he's so expressive when telling stories, explaining tricky points or sharing his opinion, it may be thanks to the years he spent not just training, but studying theatre. From 2017 to 2022, he pursued a degree in theatre art and performance at the University of San Diego, California.

A man of many talents, Holmgren says he needs passions beyond tennis to maintain balance.

""I think the most valuable thing I got from college was understanding that I need to have a balance with tennis and life off the court. To make sure I was happy off the court, because I needed that in order to be happy on the court, he said. Often in my life when I have some disruption, in my personal life, it reflects on my tennis. If I don't do my hobbies and only focus on tennis, it has a negative impact on me.""

He doesn't get much time to act these days, but credits his theatre training with helping him stay grounded: ""it helps to stay present, and in the moment, and to challenge myself to explore inconfortable situations.""

And then, there's the shot that sets him apart: his beautifully precise one-handed backhand.

“I've had it since I was six years old,” he told the press. ""I had a coach who tried to change it when I was 6 or 7. And I refused and then he put me to the side of the court and said: ok, now you can just swing in the air if you want. He didn't let me hit balls and it was like that for about a week or something. But I've always stayed with my one-handed.”

It's a signature weapon he'll need in full force this Saturday when he takes on 11th seed Alex De Minaur. The Danish underdog will be aiming for a third straight Tour-level win - and a spot in the second week of Wimbledon - against last year's quarter-finalist.

It's the kind of matchup that captures the beauty of Grand Slam tennis: a clash between experience and discovery, polish and rawness — a rough diamond, gleaming under pressure.","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros'}","tennis"

Aryna Sabalenka has once again been asked about her reaction to losing the French Open final, after reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon.

Facing Emma Raducanu, the Belarusian will have been well aware of the atmosphere she was walking into on Centre Court.

And, as someone who has wilted when facing the scrutiny of an opposing crowd, there was every chance that the 27-year-old could have buckled under the pressure.

Alas, she composed herself to twice come from a break down in both sets, winning the match in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon fourth round. Sabalenka was actually compared to Novak Djokovic with what she did during this impressive win.

Arguably more impressively, she also showed so much maturity in claiming such a hard-fought victory; and yet was brought right back to arguably her toughest moment in the post-match press conference.

She was first asked about that British-supporting atmosphere, and the way she dealt with it compared to the French Open final, where her emotions got the better of her.

This is especially pertinent given how Sabalenka's comments about Gauff went viral, with the reaction particularly volatile.

But, the world number one has now actually admitted that she is ‘happy' about that moment, despite the backlash she received.

Aryna Sabalenka told reporters: ‘Yeah, as I said, I'm kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open, because I had a chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realise a lot of things about myself and I kind of like feel that I'm a different person and I learned from that difficult lesson.

‘And yeah, as you said, you know, because of the recent experience, I was just like, keep telling myself, like, no, you you just cannot let it happen again. 

‘You just have to whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting and and I was just reminding myself that I was strong enough and I can handle this pressure.'

It has been 28 days since Sabalenka lost the French Open final to Coco Gauff, and yet just last night, the topic of her comments arose again.

The 2024 US and Australian Open champion made an ill-advised and emotional statement after one of the most crushing losses of her career, and the regret was instantly apparent in the aftermath.

To be fair to the young American, she was incredibly mature, and handled the situation with such poise and grace. She should be proud of her ability to defuse such a high-profile situation.

And, the way in which she went about accepting one of Sabalenka's many apologies also deserves credit.

But the three-time Grand Slam winner has apologised, on numerous occasions, with the two clearly having already rebuilt their relationship.

It's about time that this topic stopped cropping up, as it just makes Sabalenka relive a real low point in her career that she has already atoned for.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner is into the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth straight year, and has done so at a canter.

The 23-year-old returned to the All-England Club shrouded in a veil of pity, as many expected the three-time Grand Slam champion to be reeling after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.

Everyone knows the story now of how he squandered three championship points and a two-set lead to eventually lose the match and the title.

However, there has been no indication that he has let this impact him, despite what some reporters might try to infer.

Asked if he felt negative coming into Wimbledon after his crushing French Open final, the Italian was left a little surprised by the nature of this question.

After all, he has looked flawless at the All-England Club thus far, showing no signs of dwelling on such a defeat.

His response was one of bewilderment, as Jannik Sinner began: ‘Why negative feelings? Because I lost in the final? No. Look, it's a new tournament. New grand slam. New surface. 

‘I'm not concerned about my level I can play at times. I'm not concerned that one loss can influence you for such a long time. 

‘I believe that here is a new chance that I can do something good from my side. If I play some good tennis, I know that I can go far potentially. Maybe I lose the next round. I don't know. But I'm not concerned. 

‘I'm honestly very happy to be here. I'm happy I have the chance to play on such special courts here at Wimbledon. There is no better place to play tennis at this moment. Everything is going well. 

‘I had a good preparation to prepare for this tournament. Now let's see how I do here and how far I can go.'

As noted earlier, failing to drop a set on his way into the fourth round of Wimbledon hardly suggests a mental deficiency.

In fact, he's arguably never looked so assured and secure on the grass, poised to stroll into the final, especially with how the draw has opened up.

Of course, the prospect of facing Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals is daunting, before Carlos Alcaraz will likely await in the final.

Sinner spoke about how it felt to face Djokovic for the first time recently, but he has come a long way since then.

However, to win these elite titles, there are going to be some huge obstacles in your path, both of whom Sinner has beaten in the past.

There is no suggestion that he's suffering after his French Open final loss; if anything, it's fuelling him onto record-breaking greatness.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Barbora Krejcikova tearful after falling behind in the final set to Emma Navarro at Wimbledon. (1:32)

American Emma Navarro, one of four top-10 seeds left in the women's draw, came back from a set down to eliminate defending Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the third round Saturday.

Krejcikova faded in the third set, getting her blood pressure checked at the changeover after Navarro broke her to lead 3-2 at No. 1 Court.

Krejcikova ate a banana and drank liquids during the medical timeout, while Navarro walked to her guest box and spoke to her coach during the break in action.

When play resumed, Krejcikova showed clear signs of being in distress, often leaning over and placing her hands on her knees between points.

""Part of you is telling yourself, 'Just put a bunch of balls in the court, and that's all you have to do.' But then, she's an amazing player, injuries or no injuries. So that's not good enough,"" said Navarro, who was born in New York, grew up in South Carolina and won the 2021 NCAA championship for the University of Virginia. ""And then you trick yourself into taking too much off the ball and not playing the way you want to play. Not an easy challenge, for sure.""

Indeed, Krejcikova managed to break right back to 3-all, before Navarro broke yet again and then held to lead 5-3. Two games later, it was over.

This is hardly Navarro's first big win on a big stage. Last year, she eliminated Coco Gauff at Wimbledon to reach her first major quarterfinal. Then, in a rematch a couple of months later, Navarro won again at the US Open -- where Gauff was the defending champion -- en route to her debut in a Slam semifinal.

Navarro, 24, will be making her fifth round-of-16 appearance in the past six majors, tied with Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff for the most over that span. She will meet No. 7 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian, on Monday for a quarterfinal berth.

Against Krejcikova, Navarro was down a set and a break at 2-1 in the second before turning things around.

""I was able to serve a bit better and gained a little bit of traction on my return games, and from the ground, just played a little bit stronger,"" Navarro said. ""I like to play scrappy, so I was able to play a few more scrappy points, get a few more balls back in the court.""

Most points were decided by what Krejcikova did. That's how she ended up with 34 winners -- 21 more than Navarro -- and 53 unforced errors. Remarkably, Navarro finished with just 11 unforced errors.

With Krejcikova's loss, No. 8 Iga Swiatek -- who beat unseeded American Danielle Collins in straight sets Saturday -- is the only major champion left in the bottom half of the draw.

Whoever ends up winning the women's title on July 12 will be the ninth champion in the past nine editions of the grass-court Grand Slam tournament -- the longest such streak in Wimbledon history. Serena Williams was the last repeat champ in 2016.

The trophy winners since then have been Garbine Muguruza in 2017, Angelique Kerber in 2018, Simona Halep in 2019, Ash Barty in 2021 -- all of whom are now retired -- Elena Rybakina in 2022, Marketa Vondrousova in 2023 and then Krejcikova (the tournament was canceled in 2020 because of the pandemic).

Rybakina lost Saturday; Vondrousova exited in the second round.

Last year's triumph was the second at a major tournament for Krejcikova, who also won the 2021 French Open and was the No. 17 seed at Wimbledon this year. This loss will drop her ranking out of the top 70.

Sinner – Martinez: 05.07.2025 14:30 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Jannik Sinner has won three of his last five matches. This is his sixth appearance at Wimbledon. In the opening rounds, Sinner defeated Nardi and Vukic in straight sets. Last season, the Italian lost against Medvedev in the quarterfinals. He has never made it past the semifinals here.

Pedro Martinez has won four of his last five matches. This week at Wimbledon, the Spaniard had a favourable draw so far. In the opening round, Martinez defeated Loffhagen in four sets. In the second round, he won against Navone in tight straight sets.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the big favourite in this matchup and we agree. He is a way better player than Martinez. The Spaniard never succeeded on grass. We expect Sinner to dominate from the start until the end and win easily.

That being said, Sinner covering the games handicap is a value bet.

According to the bookies, Shelton is the favourite in this matchup and we agree. Fucsovics played two tough five-setters and looked exhausted against Monfils. On the other hand, Shelton played his best tennis this week and we expect him to win once again without any problems.

That being said, Shelton covering the games handicap is a value bet.

The world No 1 dazzled against Pedro Martinez, with Djokovic, the seven-time champion, in action late on Centre Court after Iga Swiatek swatted aside Danielle Collins

Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic remain on a Wimbledon collision course and the pair feature on day six at SW19.

The world No 1 had too much for Pedro Martinez on Centre Court, storming past the Spaniard in straight sets to keep alive a potential semi-final with Djokovic, who is third on Centre Court against his compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic.

Sinner and Djokovic have met each other nine times before, with the Italian holding a 5-4 record over the Serbian. Djokovic has won both contests on grass, while Sinner holds victories over his rival at the Australian Open and French Open. 

In between the two feature men's singles matches, Iga Swiatek had too much for Danielle Collins, and the Pole faces Clara Tauson next, after the Dane upset former champion Elena Rybakina. 

British hopes now rest on Sonay Kartal, who dispatched in impressive fashion, and Cameron Norrie, who proved too much for Mattia Bellucci. Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results below:

Novak Djokovic 3-2 Miomir Kecmanovic*

Ben Shelton is a break up on No 1 Court, he leads Fucsovics 4-2.

Djokovic and Kecmanovic are still on serve, with the former champion the wrong side of a couple of razor-thin line calls by the ELC.

Stil, there have been moments of genius from Djokovic, including a disguised forehand drop shot off the back of a brutal baseline duel. 

Then a towering smash from a good 10 feet behind the net, put away superbly.

Novak Djokovic 1-0 Miomir Kecmanovic*

That started off as a routine service game for Djokovic, an ace to start and then another to end it, but in between Kecmanovic produced some fine tennis. 

He even lured Djokovic to the net and beat him with a drop shot, showing great range. But Djokovic leads. 

Barbora Krejcikova was left in tears after battling through injury before defeat to Emma Navarro that leaves the women's singles champion out. 

Krejcikova lost 6-2, 3-6, 4-6 with the No 10 seed prevailing in two hours and 36 minutes. 

Djokovic returns to Centre Court shortly against compatriot Kecmanovic.

After Sinner's storming victory, he'll want to produce something similar as both men eye a potential semi-final showdown.

The 24-time grand slam champion holds a 3-0 record over Kecmanovic, but they haven't played since Wimbledon in 2022: a straight sets win (6-0, 6-3, 6-4).

*Iga Swiatek 6-2, 6-3 Danielle Collins

That was a fine win for Swiatek, she's looked excellent on the grass this week and will really fancy her chances of breaking through. 

Just 10 unforced errors to Collins' 25, Swiatek was the cleaner player. 

It's ClaraTauson next for the five-time grand slam champion.

*Iga Swiatek 6-2, 3-2 Danielle Collins

An impressive hold from Collins, who stays within reach in this crucial second set. It's all about patience now and hoping a chance will come on the Swiatek serve.

Elsewhere, Alex De Minaur is serving for the second set against August Holmgren, the Aussie leads 6-4, 5-4. 

Iga Swiatek 6-2, 2-0 Danielle Collins*

Collins continues to remonstrate with herself, working her way into the game at 15-30 in search of a break. 

She nets to let Swiatek back in, and a fine serve from the Pole brings up game point. 

A kicked second serve out wide puts Collins on the back foot and the American swipes a forehand just wide. Swiatek holds and has a firm grip on this match.

*Iga Swiatek 4-1 Danielle Collins

Swiatek is racing away with the first set on Centre Court. 

Collins has got out slow and the Pole is hitting some crisp shots.

The No 8 seed has the double break, but the American crashes a forehand return past her to mount an attempt to break back.

A few numbers here to put Jannik Sinner's dominance into perspective.

In reaching the fourth round, the 23-year-old Italian has dropped only 17 games from his three matches.

Even when Bjorn Borg won the title without dropping a set in 1976 he had conceded 27 games over the first three rounds, while Roger Federer - the only other man to achieve the feat, in 2017 - had lost 28.

The world No 1 is yet to have his serve broken and has faced just eight break points, four of which were repelled against Martinez.

He has spent only five hours and 23 minutes on court so far, which is six minutes less than his French Open final defeat by Carlos Alcaraz last month.

Fair to say it's going well.

Earlier today, Italian 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli beat Czech 15th seed Jakub Mensik 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. 

And Russian seventh seed Mirra Andreeva eased past Hailey Baptiste 6-1, 6-3. The 18-year-old reached the fourth round at Wimbledon for the second time in her career.

The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 at Wimbledon 2025.

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — There is a mysterious storm brewing in the bottom half of the women's draw at Wimbledon. At its center is a player that much of the field is trying to figure out, as she too tries to figure out who she is on this grass.

Advertisement

It's not a surprise qualifier, or a player who has directly benefited from so many seeds making an early exit.

It's Iga Świątek, the five-time Grand Slam champion who spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1 between early 2022 and late 2024. She's the No. 8 seed at Wimbledon, but she's actually the world No. 4. Only three of the top seven players in the world are left in the draw.

That version of Świątek can appear on the Wimbledon grass, but to make it happen, she will have to win a battle between her two tennis selves that she has been conducting since late last year.

Świątek won the girls' singles title at the All England Club in 2018. Two years later, she won her first Grand Slam at the French Open. Two years after that, she won the 2022 U.S. Open, as well as the first of three consecutive French Opens.

But she also hasn't won a tournament since she won the last of those three, 13 months ago. She has only been to the second week of Wimbledon twice in five tries. But going off her first two matches here so far and her run to the finals at a warm-up event in Bad Homburg, Germany, Świątek has shown signs that she might be getting inside the tennis time machine she has been building the past few months. She is going back toward the player she was when she won the junior title here, the player she was during her ensuing climb to the top of the game.

That player floated up and down and all across court with a preternatural ease that veterans long for. She played with variety and spin, and happily worked her way through points instead of taking the biggest swing she could at first chance. She won points with cute angles and deft stop volleys. And when swinging hard wasn't working, her fallback plan was something other than swinging even harder.

That became eminently clear Thursday, after Świątek dropped the opening set to Caty McNally, an American qualifier and the world No. 125, on Centre Court. She ran away with the next two and the match, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1. She didn't do that by landing more first-strike bullets an inch in rather than a foot wide. She did it by firing fewer bullets.

Her first serve slowed down. When she was returning, she focused more on putting the ball back in play, often with a chip, rather than trying to crush it across the the court. During the first set she won just 12 of 25 points that stretched longer than four shots. During the next two sets she won 25 of 40. The same pattern occurred in her first match against Polina Kudermetova, when she won just five of 18 points longer than four shots during a tight first set, and seven of eight in the second. Her first serve slowed down slightly but became more effective in that match, too.

Perhaps more importantly, she had played that way to go 4-1 up against McNally in the set that she lost. Then she did what she has done in her worst losses in recent times: she reverted to the all-out aggressiveness that became ingrained in her tennis between 2022 and 2024. It made her the dominant player in the world and won her Grand Slam titles. It also stayed some of her development, largely hid the finesse that had helped to carry her to the top of the sport, and created a psychological problem.

When things get tight, players do what they know. What Świątek knew became hitting every ball as hard as possible. But when things get tight, things go wrong, and hitting a ball hard when things go wrong means missing, a lot.

Against McNally, she found that often elusive balance between raising her intensity while playing more methodical and patient tennis, as diametrically opposite as those two goals might appear at first glance.

“You can still raise your intensity and be patient and make smart decisions,” Świątek said after she prevailed.

“It just means that you're going to play these shots really 100 percent. But it doesn't mean that they need to be like crazy.”

Then, it appeared that Wimbledon would get real for Świątek. A matchup that would test whether she can stick with something closer to the older version of herself, the one that Wim Fissette, the well-regarded coach who has worked with her since the end of last year, has tried to bring back to the court.

In Danielle Collins, Świątek faced the player who took her apart in Rome on the red clay, her best surface, just two months ago. She pushed Świątek to the edge of her emotional danger zone, a place where she has spent a lot of time the past few months.

Collins hits a big ball, the kind that can send Świątek backpedaling, rushing her forehand. And there's some history, too. Collins, seemingly unjustifiably, ripped into Świątek for what she referred to as phoney sincerity when Collins had to retire during the third set of their quarterfinal at the Paris Olympics last summer.

Świątek said she had no idea what Collins was talking about, because they had barely spoken previously.

She was also desperate to hang around this tournament, which she loves more than any other.

“For a landscaper's daughter, you know, and coming from humble beginnings, I cherish it,” Collins said after her 6-4, 6-1 win over Veronika Erjavec, the Slovenian qualifier.

“It makes it even that more special. And you can see it when I'm out on court. Wimbledon is the happiest time of the year for me. I can barely sleep at night. I'm so excited to get in the car each morning and come here.”

Świątek did not let Collins hang around. She played the role of counterpuncher when it was the right thing to do, and played on the front foot when that was the right thing to do. She jammed Collins with fast body serves and started sliding second serves to her forehand, after the American pounced on a couple that didn't jump high enough. She moved the ball up and down and left and right, with the mastery that has defined her dominance on clay. The scoreline was 6-2, 6-3. It didn't really feel that close.

“I had some practices where the ball was listening to me … It's a new experience on grass,” she said in her on-court interview.

Świątek has never looked comfortable on the grass. That felt especially true the past three years when she won the French Open, which robbed her of time to prepare for the grass. Low sliding shots do make it hard for her to get her racket under the ball on her topspin-heavy forehand — just as Coco Gauff found out when she went out in the first round.

Last year, Świątek's first match on grass following her Roland Garros title was also her first match at Wimbledon. She only got to play three, losing in the third round to a redlining Yulia Putintseva. Then she lost in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open. Out went Tomasz Wiktorowski, who preached aggression from the baseline for three years. In came Fissette. He has steadily helped her to add more shape and patience to her tennis, which has in turn, at least at this tournament, started to reverse the notion that she is fundamentally not good on grass.

That notion already felt misplaced. Her win percentage is 72. That's hardly poor form. Her defeats as a seasoned tour player have come to a grass master of the upset (Alizé Cornet) a player playing the tournament of their life (Elina Svitolina) and Putintseva, who at one point hit one unforced error in 13 games.

But resisting a reversion to the baseline aggression when matches get stressful has remained a big challenge for Świątek. Its effect also gets magnified on grass, where sets can disappear in minutes and errors rack up more easily and quickly.  It's early days at Wimbledon and there are hard matches ahead even if she beats Collins. Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion who has troubled her in the past, is out of the way, but her conqueror, No. 23 seed Clara Tauson, can also tee off.

It's still clear Świątek is thinking differently on the grass this time round, especially after her success in Germany, where she beat Jasmine Paolini, last year's Wimbledon finalist, and Ekaterina Alexandrova, a big hitter capable of causing problems, on her way to the final.

“You just have to get through some situations on the court, and it gives you the extra experience and kind of the momentum to go forward,” She said ahead of Wimbledon.

For Świątek, her game on the grass is a work in progress, as it is everywhere. Each year, she learns a few things through experience. But she is one of the best players in the world, an all-time great already, playing at a tournament where the all-time greats usually figure out a way to win. It's the tournament where historically the best players generally do the best, because they figure out how to play aggressively, but with control, because often controlling points can be more important than trying to win them at the first chance.

“It's still tricky,” she said.

“You really have to trust your shots on grass. You can't really pull back. Any shot that will give your opponent more time to go in is probably the shot that will make you lose the rally.”

Emma Raducanu may have sidestepped drama at last year's Wimbledon if the new U.S. Open rule had been in effect there.

The young British sensation faced criticism on the iconic grass courts for choosing to concentrate on her singles matches rather than team up with Andy Murray, the three-time Grand Slam champ, in what could have been his final shot at major success in the mixed doubles.

Murray was ousted from the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in round two and was beaten in the men's doubles with his brother Jamie, thanks to Australian pair Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. With Murray suggesting that it would be his last Wimbledon appearance, the mixed doubles with Raducanu represented his last hope of competing and winning.

Yet Raducanu, not fully fit, opted to focus solely on her singles campaign, bowing out from the partnership with Murray. Reflecting on her decision back then, Raducanu said: ""It was a very difficult decision.

""Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him. But at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body.

""I still stand by making the right call. Obviously he was disappointed because it's his last match. But, yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he'll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there.""

Raducanu, who reached the fourth round of the tournament last year only to be defeated by Lulu Sun, has since extended an apology to Murray for any unintended tension, seeking to avoid any ""bad blood."" She said in January (via the Express): ""Afterwards I sent him a long message basically apologising if I caused any trouble, I guess, at Wimbledon, that's definitely the last thing I want.

""He's someone that I've grown up looking up to and I don't want any bad blood or harsh feelings with him. I sent him a long message and he took it really well and responded saying he was disappointed but he understood.""

Yet, had the new mixed doubles format introduced at this year's U.S. Open been available in London last summer, the entire situation may have been avoided. It was recently revealed that the mixed doubles competition at the final Grand Slam of the season will now occur separately from the main tournament.

While the U.S. Open is scheduled from August 25 to September 7, the mixed doubles portion of the Grand Slam will take place between August 19 and August 20, providing players ample time to recharge for the singles and doubles competitions. Had a similar timetable been implemented at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray might have teamed up.

Murray ultimately bowed out at last year's Wimbledon following his doubles departure with Jamie, before competing in the Paris Olympics and officially retiring from the sport.

Meanwhile, Raducanu returned to the courts at SW19 this summer, defeating Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before falling to WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the third round on Friday.

Next month, she'll compete in the mixed doubles at the U.S. Open alongside ATP world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, with whom the British player shares a close friendship.

Aryna Sabalenka continues to impress at Wimbledon as she looks to win her maiden title in 2025.

The Belarusian beat Carson Branstine and Marie Bouzkova to advance to the third round at Wimbledon, where she met home favorite Emma Raducanu.

Playing some of the best tennis of her life, Raducanu pushed Sabalenka close on Centre Court, narrowly falling to defeat 6-7 [6-8], 4-6.

After the match, Sabalenka thanked the crowd for their support, admitting she tried to convince herself that they were cheering for her.

Going into further detail, Sabalenka compared the crowds at Wimbledon to those at the US Open during her post-match press conference.

Speaking to the media, Sabalenka gave her verdict on the crowds at Wimbledon and the US Open.

“The crowd. I mean, I played enough in the [United] States against Americans, and there it's like super crazy,” she said.

“Honestly, I'm super grateful that people were respectful and really polite during the points, and even though they were cheering for her between the points, during the point, I was able to focus, and they were really polite once again.

“So I think that really helped me to stay in the game and to be there, to fight for every point, and I'm super happy that I was able to be that focused.”

Sabalenka needed to stay focused as she fought off Raducanu, who was inspired by the fans on Centre Court.

Taking the time to praise Raducanu, Sabalenka assessed her performance in their third-round match.

“She played an incredible level,” said Sabalenka.

There was little to separate the pair on Friday evening, as the Belarusian picked up the victory, having won just seven more points than her British opponent.

Sabalenka will now turn her attention to the fourth round and a clash with Elise Mertens, her former doubles partner.

The US Open and Australian Open-winning teammates will battle it out for a place in the quarterfinals on Sunday, July 6.

Sabalenka highlighted the role a home crowd can play at Grand Slam tournaments for ‘away' players, but how has she fared at the four majors?

In total, Sabalenka has played 13 matches against players at their home Grand Slam events, winning 11.

Aryna Sabalenka's record: 7-1 (88%)

Sabalenka may have experienced some ‘crazy' atmospheres over the years, but she rarely lets them get the better of her.

On just two occasions has Sabalenka lost to a player competing at their home Grand Slam, to Ash Barty at the 2018 Australian Open and to Coco Gauff in the 2023 US Open final.

Only time will tell if Sabalenka can keep up her impressive record, but it will certainly be worth looking out for when the 2025 US Open begins on Sunday, August 24.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu could have potentially avoided controversy after ditching Andy Murray in last year's mixed doubles at Wimbledon had a new US Open ruling have been in place at the time. The 22-year-old Briton found herself under fire on the courts of SW19 last year, when she opted to focus on the singles game rather than pairing up with three-time Grand Slam winner Murray in what was his final chance at major glory.

Murray had been knocked out of the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, and was omitted from the men's doubles alongside his brother, Jamie Murray, by Australian duo Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. Given that Murray had announced ahead of play that it would be his final outing at Wimbledon, the mixed doubles alongside Raducanu came as his last hope of redemption. However, Raducanu – whose fitness wasn't at 100 per cent – decided that she would rather put all of her attention into her own singles tournament than use energy elsewhere, withdrawing from participation alongside Murray.

Speaking about her choice at the time, Raducanu said: ""It was a very difficult decision. Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him.

However, controversy could have been avoided completely had a new format for the mixed doubles game at this year's US Open been in place in London last summer. That's because it was recently announced that the mixed pairs at the final Grand Slam of the year will take place away from the main event.

While the US Open will run between August 25 and September 7, the mixed doubles of the Grand Slam will run between August 19 and August 20, giving players plenty of time to re-energise for the singles and doubles events. And should a similar schedule have taken place at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray may well have played alongside one another.

Murray ultimately bowed out of last year's Wimbledon after his doubles exit alongside Jamie, playing at the Paris Olympics before officially retiring from the sport.

Raducanu, meanwhile, was back in action at SW19 this summer, dispatching of Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before she was bested by WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Friday's third round.

She'll be battling at the mixed doubles next month in the US alongside world No.2 Carlos Alcaraz, who the Brit has a strong friendship with.

Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus reacts after winning the first set against Emma Raducanu of Britain during a third round women's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday.


LONDON (AP) — Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka staved off an upset bid by resurgent Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon by beating the home favorite 7-6 (6), 6-4 in the third-round at a raucous Centre Court on Friday night.

Sabalenka, a two-time semifinalist at the All England Club, fought back in both sets against the the 2021 U.S. Open champion, who had been playing some of her best tennis since her title run at Flushing Meadows as a qualifier at age 18.

In a 74-minute first set, Sabalenka converted her eighth set point, which came 30 minutes after the first.

Raducanu went up 4-2, only to see Sabalenka reel off 11 of 12 points during one stretch while moving out front by a 5-4 score.

Then arrived an epic game, lasting 13 minutes and containing 22 points, eight deuces, and seven set points for Sabalenka — all ending with Raducanu holding serve.

Then, Raducanu had a set point while leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, but Sabalenka saved it with a drop-shot winner and took the last three points of the set — ending it with a volley winner.

The fans provided extra energy for the British player, cheering wildly when Raducanu fired winners and exhaling “aww!” when she missed.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, said she pretended the cheers were for her.

“Guys wow — what an atmosphere. My ears are still hurting. It was super loud,” she said in an on-court interview.

In the second set, Raducanu broke to 3-1 and led 4-1 at the 1-hour, 35-minute mark, but Sabalenka reeled off the last five games.

Raducanu, ranked No. 40, had defeated 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the previous round.

“She pushed me really hard to get this win. I'm happy to see her healthy and back on track,” Sabalenka said. “I'm pretty sure that soon she's going to be back in the top 10.”

Sabalenka reached the final at each of the past three Grand Slam tournaments, winning the U.S. Open last September and finishing as the runner-up to Madison Keys at the Australian Open in January and to Coco Gauff at the French Open in June.

By HOWARD FENDRICHAP Tennis Writer

LONDON (AP) — As well as Jannik Sinner is playing at Wimbledon, he doesn't appear to need much in the way of help. Still, he got some Saturday when his opponent, Pedro Martinez, was dealing with a problematic shoulder and often put in first serves at so-so speeds.

The No. 1-ranked Sinner has dropped a record-tying total of only 17 games so far, made his way to the fourth round for the seventh consecutive Grand Slam tournament — he's collected three such trophies in that span — and never was truly in trouble during a 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory over No. 52 Martinez.

“We all saw that he was struggling,” Sinner said, then noted about his own form: “First week couldn't have gone better.”

Sinner is the second man in the Open era, which began in 1968, to cede just 17 games through three completed matches at the All England Club. The other player to do that, Jan Kodes, ended up losing in the semifinals in 1972.

For Sinner, there's been zero sign of any sort of inability to move past last month's French Open final, which he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets despite taking the first two and holding three championship points.

Against Martinez, Sinner — who returned in May from a three-month doping suspension — went up 5-0 after 20 minutes. During that stretch of 29 points, Martinez managed just one winner, while Sinner accumulated 10.

That's when Martinez took a medical timeout, and a trainer massaged the back of his right shoulder. The Spaniard was delivering first serves as slow as 76 mph, compared with Sinner's high of 133 mph.

That aspect of Martinez's game improved incrementally, but the only, ever-so-brief, moment of intrigue at Centre Court came in the second set, about 75 minutes in, with Sinner up a break and serving at 4-3. That's where Martinez managed to accrue his first four break points of the match.

Sinner stayed as calm as can be — “I don't think Sinner's changed expressions once in this match,” John McEnroe observed on BBC's telecast — and erased all four of those chances, held for 5-3, then broke to end the set.

Soon enough, Sinner — twice an Australian Open champion, once a U.S. Open champion and a 2023 semifinalist at Wimbledon — was headed into a contest Monday against No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov.

A ninth woman in the past nine editions of the tournament will leave the All England Club with the trophy. That's because defending champion Barbora Krejcikova was eliminated by No. 10 Emma Navarro of the United States 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, and 2022 champion Elena Rybakina lost to No. 23 Clara Tauson by a 7-6 (6), 6-3 score. Krejcikova had her blood pressure checked during a medical timeout in the last set. No. 7 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian, moved into Week 2 with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Hailey Baptiste of the United States, and five-time major title winner Iga Swiatek overwhelmed Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3. Another fourth-round matchup was set up when No. 19 Liudmila Samsonova and Jessica Bouzas Maneiro advanced. Men's winners included No. 11 Alex de Minaur and No. 22 Flavio Cobolli, with Novak Djokovic in action later.

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, coming off a riveting win against Emma Raducanu, returns to Centre Court to face No. 24 Elise Mertens as the fourth round begins. Sunday's last scheduled match in the main stadium features two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz against No. 14 Andrey Rublev. Over at No. 1 Court, 2024 U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz of the United States, the No. 5 seed, begins play at 1 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) against unseeded Jordan Thompson of Australia.

Billed as a battle of the US Open champions, between the world No.1 and the British No.1, Aryna Sabalenka versus Emma Raducanu had all the makings of a Wimbledon blockbuster.

The match-up did not disappoint. Sabalenka overcame Raducanu beneath the Centre Court roof and before an electric crowd to reach the fourth round at the All England Club.

It took two hours – including 74 minutes in the first set alone – for Sabalenka to subdue the homegrown star 7-6(6) 6-4.

Raducanu saved seven set points in the first set, and held one of her own, before the top seed snatched it with some exquisite net work. The Brit then built a 4-1 second-set lead, with a point for 5-1, before Sabalenka reeled her in.

On court, Sabalenka declared that “I'm pretty sure that soon she's going to be back in the top 10” – something she elaborated on during her subsequent press conference.

EXPERT PICKS: Who will be the Wimbledon champions in 2025?

“She really pushed me to the limit today. I'm super happy with the win,” said Sabalenka, who next faces 24th seed Elise Mertens.

“I cannot predict anything, but I'm definitely sure that, maybe not in a month, but maybe a bit longer period, she definitely going to get back in top.

“She's fighting. She's playing much better. She's more consistent. I can see that mentally she's healthy. I think that's really important. I'm pretty sure she's getting there.”

Raducanu, who famously won the 2021 US Open as a teenaged qualifier ranked 150th, peaked at world No.10 in July 2022.

RELATED: Top 10 Grand Slam surprises this century

She has since battled chronic injuries – forcing her to undergo multiple surgeries – and off-court tumult, making her return to form all the more impressive.



Currently ranked 40th, Raducanu has never before played this many tour-level matches (32) or won as many (18) through Wimbledon in a single season.

Yet this consistency falls short of the kind produced by Sabalenka, who by progressing to the fourth round at Wimbledon has now reached the second week in her past 11 Grand Slam tournaments – a feat no woman has achieved since Serena Williams.

She's been at her best in the tightest moments, too; after saving set point to snatch the opener against Raducanu, it marked Sabalenka's 13th straight tiebreak won.

“It definitely gives me a lot of energy and good feeling that I was under pressure, it was a great match, it was a great battle, and I was able to get the win,” Sabalenka reflected.

“That's why I love sport. It's all about challenging yourself. When you go through tough challenges and you get the win, it's the best feeling.

“Maybe earlier in my career I would just lose it and I would just go crazy and lose that set 7-5.

“But with the years, with the experience, I learned that this is not it.”

Indeed, Sabalenka has grown to a point that she has not exited before the quarterfinals of a major tournament since Roland Garros 2022.

Against Mertens – a player she has beaten nine straight times – she will target a place in her 11th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal.

Should she get there, she would face either lucky loser Solana Sierra or German Laura Siegemund – both ranked outside the top 100 – for a place in her third Wimbledon semifinal.

Beyond that is a shot at a fourth straight Slam final, where her last appearance at that stage provided invaluable lessons she's carried with her to the All England Club.

“I'm kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open,” said Sabalenka, bitterly disappointed after her three-set loss to Coco Gauff.

“I had chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realise a lot of things about myself.

“I kind of feel that I'm a different person. I learned from that difficult lesson. I was just keep telling myself: ‘No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting'.

“I was just reminding myself that I'm strong enough, and I can handle this pressure.”

Carlos Alcaraz battled past Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the Wimbledon last-16 on Friday before women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka dug deep to beat Emma Raducanu in a high-class match.

Both players avoided the fate of Australian Open champion and sixth seed Madison Keys, who joined the mass exodus of top seeds.

It is only day five of Wimbledon but just four of the top 10 women's seeds remain, with half of the men's top 10 also ousted.

Men's second seed Alcaraz eventually overcame German world number 125 Struff 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to stay on track for a third straight Wimbledon crown.

But the Spaniard will have to cut out his errors if he is to become just the fifth man in the Open era to perform that feat.

‘I knew it was going to be really difficult. I had to be really focused. His game suits the grass with the big serves,' said the 22-year-old.

‘It's stressful. To be honest, I was suffering in every service game today, 0-30, break points down.

‘I'm really pleased that I was fighting, running for every ball and making great shots.'

Alcaraz, watched by former England captain Gary Lineker and former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, made 28 unforced errors in an inconsistent display on Centre Court.

But he conjured enough moments of magic to eventually subdue his opponent and book his place in the fourth round, where he will meet Russia's Andrey Rublev.

Alcaraz is yet to show his best form after being pushed to the brink in a five-set win over 38-year-old Italian Fabio Fognini in the first round while he looked below his best again against British amateur Oliver Tarvet.

The women's draw is bereft of star names after the departure of a succession of top players.

Keys' 6-3, 6-3 defeat by Germany's Laura Siegemund means only world number one Sabalenka is still alive at the All England Club out of the top six women's seeds.

Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Zheng Qinwen have already fallen by the wayside.

Sabalenka, last on Centre Court, refused to be cowed by former US Open champion Raducanu, who fed off the energy of a partisan crowd to produce an electric performance under the roof.

But the powerful Belarusian won the big points, saving a set point in the first set and staying strong in the second to beat her 40th-ranked opponent 7-6 (8/6), 6-4.

Sabalenka is a three-time Grand Slam champion but has never been beyond the semi-finals at Wimbledon.

‘I had to fight for every point like crazy,' said Sabalenka, who was impressed by the volume of support for Raducanu.

‘What an atmosphere,' she said. ‘My ears are still hurting, honestly. It was super loud. Every time you were cheering her, I was trying to tell myself to just pretend that you were just cheering for me. I had goosebumps.'

Earlier at the All England Club, Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka lost in three sets to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Osaka has not reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam since she won the Australian Open in 2021 but is still hungry for success.

‘I feel like while I still have the opportunity to try to do it, I want to, even though I get very upset when I lose, but I think that's my competitive nature. That's also the younger sister syndrome,' she said.

There were also wins for Britain's Sonay Kartal, 13th seed Amanda Anisimova and Elise Mertens.

US men's fifth seed Taylor Fritz avoided a third straight five-setter, beating Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-1.

Britain's Cameron Norrie saw off Italian Mattia Bellucci in straight sets to qualify the quarter-finals for the first time since 2022, when he reached the last four.

Highly promising Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca was ousted by Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry.

It took US men's 10th seed Ben Shelton just 71 seconds to complete his second-round match, sealing a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Rinky Hijikata after the match was halted on Thursday due to failing light.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Thompson defies injury for Wimbledon breakthrough","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/thompson-feature-wimbledon-2025","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 10:22:42 GMT","

Battered but unbroken, Jordan Thompson won't soon forget the way he cracked the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.

After retiring from his Queen's Club opener two weeks ago due to a back injury, the 31-year-old Australian arrived at the All England Club with tempered expectations, unsure how far his body would carry him. Yet through sheer grit and determination, he has clawed his way through 14 punishing sets, defying both injury and odds to stand among the last 16.

“I think anyone that knows me knows that, if we're playing a game of marbles or cards or whatever, I'm competitive,” Thompson told reporters after his third-round victory. “I want to win no matter what. That certainly helps. I'm not anywhere near 100 per cent and I'm still fighting my ass off for every point.”

With the help of a thick back brace and the support of Australian Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt, the World No. 44 Thompson has been patching himself together and playing through the pain this week.

Yet Thompson's run has been far from straightforward, which adds a layer of intrigue into his story. He rallied from two sets down to a memorable first-round win against Vit Kopriva and then also survived Benjamin Bonzi in five before fending off Luciano Darderi in four to equal his best result at a Grand Slam tournament.

Hewitt — known to many as ‘Rusty' — remains the last Australian man to lift the Wimbledon singles trophy, and his experience has been invaluable alongside Thompson's primary coach, Marinko Matosevic. Earlier this week, Thompson conceded that post-Wimbledon, he'll “probably be on the sidelines”, a looming reality that's only fueling his current charge at SW19.

“I'm grateful that Rusty's there, because he's done everything in tennis,” Thompson said of Hewitt, the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “He knows how I'm feeling, so sometimes he's talking more than my coach, but I look at both of them. I'm with Marinko everyday but Rusty has been in this position so many times, so he knows how it feels.

“If I can't get to a ball I would normally get to, I'll just look over and go ‘This is shit', it's frustrating and it makes it very unenjoyable.”

However hard it may be, Thompson is wearing his heart on his sleeve and, while he's never gone this far at Wimbledon before, his grass-court pedigree is established. He twice reached the final at the ATP 250 in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, finishing runner-up in 2019 and 2023.

“Results have shown that grass is probably my best surface, and it hasn't shown at Wimbledon so that's pleasing to get my best result here,” said Thompson. “To do it under the circumstances at the moment is incredible.”



The war isn't over yet, however, and Thompson will on Sunday face his biggest test so far:  A fourth-round clash with World No. 5 Taylor Fritz, who arrives on a seven-matching winning streak after claiming his record-extending fourth Eastbourne crown.

Fritz, the only active player besides Novak Djokovic with five or more tour-level grass titles, thrives on the surface. But Thompson does not have to look far for confidence — he defeated Fritz at Queen's Club last year, levelling their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

“I'm not going on the court if I don't think I can win, that's a pathetic outlook if I go out there thinking I can't win,” said Thompson. “I won last time and it was on grass, but it was very different grass, different circumstances. Serve and return [will be] the two biggest compartments of the game, and then if it does come back I've got to make him feel uncomfortable.”

With Hewitt in his corner and his warrior spirit on full display, Thompson's Wimbledon fight is far from finished.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","De Minaur's British summer: Wimbledon goals, Boulter by his side","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/de-minaur-wimbledon-2025-feature","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 17:20:46 GMT","

For Alex de Minaur, the British grass-court season is about more than just tennis, it's about home away from home.

The Australian has become a familiar face on UK soil, not just for his dynamic grass-court game but also thanks to his relationship with fiancé and British No. 2 Katie Boulter. Their shared journey, on and off the court, has anchored De Minaur's growing connection to the country, turning this leg of the season into something more personal.

“I love the UK,” De Minaur told ATPTour.com ahead of the grass swing “I've spent a lot of time over here in recent years. I think it's a completely different style of living than in Spain. There's a lot more greenery, a lot more countryside, which I do enjoy. Being at Wimbledon is special and when it comes to the court and the tennis, I am ready to produce my best again this year.”



De Minaur's Wimbledon campaign came to an abrupt halt last year due to a hip injury, just before a highly anticipated quarter-final clash with Novak Djokovic. But the disappointment did little to dim his star among local fans. With his trademark speed, gritty baseline play and quiet charisma, he's been affectionately dubbed an ‘honourary Brit' at times in recent years.

That label fits for more reasons than one. His bond with Boulter has made the UK feel like a second home, complete with local hideaways and quiet park strolls.

“I've been quite fortunate that I've had a pretty good tour guide with Katie,” De Minaur said. “She's shown me around the best spots. The grass season has always been one of my favourite seasons in the year and it feels quite good to stay in the same place for the entirety of the season.

“We definitely do have some of our special areas that we like to keep quiet, because it does tend to get a little bit crazy during that Wimbledon timeline. But yeah, we've got enough special areas where we can get our alone time and really enjoy doing what we love.”

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

The couple's summer stretch in the UK provides an opportunity to carve out more time together on a global Tour, which can leave them on opposite sides of the globe.

“Whenever we are at the same tournaments, it just makes life a lot easier,” De Minaur said. “You get that sense of tranquillity, you've got each other. Our teams are almost like an extension of family… Even though we're away from home, or wherever we may be, it feels like we're all together and we're all at home.” 

On court, De Minaur has steadily built his resume on grass. A finalist at The Queen's Club and a former Eastbourne titlist, the 26-year-old's foot speed and flat groundstrokes have made him one of the most dangerous players on the surface.

And as he eyes another deep run at Wimbledon in 2025 following his 2024 quarter-final showing, the support he feels from the British crowd adds an extra layer of motivation.

“I definitely do feel the support, and it's a pretty cool feeling, especially in a place like Wimbledon, where there's such rich history, culturally and tennis-wise,” De Minaur said. “Everyone just loves the sport. And for them to have my back and show such great support, even though I'm not from that country, is pretty special.”

De Minaur is in third-round action on Saturday against August Holmgren.

Saturday's play on the outside courts at Wimbledon has resumed following a one-hour and 40-minute delay due to rain.

Flavio Cobolli led #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik by a set and a break on Court 12 before play was suspended at 11.50 a.m.



The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, opens Centre Court action against Pedro Martinez at 1.30 p.m., and Ben Shelton faces Marton Fucsovics in the third match on No. 1 Court.

Play on these courts is not affected due to their retractable roofs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner makes Italian history with Martinez win at Wimbledon","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-martinez-wimbledon-2025-saturday","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 14:40:14 GMT","

Jannik Sinner advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth consecutive year on Saturday by overcoming a physically hampered Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.

Having dropped just 17 games in his campaign so far, Sinner has equalled the Open Era record for fewest games dropped into the men's singles fourth round at Wimbledon, held by Jan Kodes in 1972. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has also yet to drop his serve this week. He has won all 37 service games he has played, fending off all eight break points he has faced.

Sinner led Martinez 5-0 in the first set before the Spaniard took a medical timeout to receive treatment on his right shoulder. Martinez struggled to serve at full capacity — often firing first serves at 80 mph – while the Italian remained typically dominant from the back of the court.

“I'm very happy to be in the second week, but I think we all saw he was struggling with the shoulder,” said Sinner. “He couldn't serve very well, and especially on this surface, if you can't serve well, it's not easy to play. But huge credit to him for coming out. From my side, I tried to stay solid from the back of the court.”

Martinez grew in confidence in a free-hitting display in the second set, carving out four break points in the eighth game. Yet Sinner saved all of them with a mix of bruising ballstriking and pinpoint serving to reassert his dominance on the encounter before racing to a one-hour, 55-minute victory.

Smooooth from Sinner 😮‍💨He strolls past Martinez in straight sets to advance…@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XB4ra0TKE5

By reaching the fourth round at a Grand Slam tournament for the 17th time, Sinner overtook Nicola Pietrangeli (16) to claim the all-time Italian record. It marks his fourth consecutive appearance in the last 16 at Wimbledon in just his fifth foray at the grass-court major.

After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Martinez, Sinner set a clash with Grigor Dimitrov, who moved past Sebastian Ofner 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(0). The 23-year-old Sinner is chasing his fourth major trophy and first at Wimbledon, where he reached the semi-finals in 2023 before falling to Novak Djokovic.

While Sinner cannot lose his World No. 1 spot during the tournament, he is still aiming to make ground in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which determines who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz currently leads second-placed Sinner by 2,240 points atop the Live Race.



In contrast to rivals Alcaraz and seven-time winner Djokovic, who have each squandered sets during their campaigns at SW19 thus far, Sinner has not faltered. He remains the only player in the men's singles draw not to have dropped a set, and is also yet to drop serve across his first three matches.

If Lorenzo Sonego can join Sinner and Flavio Cobolli, who earlier defeated Jakub Mensik, in the fourth round, it will mark the first time in history that three Italians reach that stage at WImbledon.

The opening Saturday at Wimbledon is a day the All England Club traditionally invites a range of sporting superstars into the Royal Box. Those watching Sinner score his 22nd win of the season included Tennis Hall of Famers Andy Roddick and Vijay Amritraj, among other sporting legends from across the board.

“I feel like I haven't won anything compared to you,” Sinner said to the Royal Box crowd. “For us athletes, it's very nice when we see new faces because we are not used to playing in front of such special guests, so thank you for watching.”

There were moments of magic for Martinez, who flicked an expertly-measured lob over Sinner in the sixth game of the second set. Yet these were few and far between as Sinner took control of the Centre Court occasion.

Three takeaways from a 4th of July Friday at Wimbledon.BySteve TignorPublished Jul 04, 2025 copy_link

Day 5 at Wimbledon—the July 4th holiday in the States—looked a lot like the tournament's first four days.The sun kept shining. At least one fan needed medical attention, and a helpful bottle of water from a player. A top-tier contender—in this case, No. 6 seed Madison Keys—was sent packing. And Taylor Fritz played tennis. The American's fourth straight day on court resulted in his third win, and the first that didn't require five sets.There was a lot more, of course; we're not halfway home yet, and singles matches are still strewn around the grounds. Here are three takeaways from the first Friday.

There was a lot more, of course; we're not halfway home yet, and singles matches are still strewn around the grounds. Here are three takeaways from the first Friday.

It's been a weird year for the WTA's No. 1 player.In some ways, it has been Sabalenka's best and most consistent season. She's 45-8, has won three titles, reached both Slam finals, and put herself 4,000 points ahead of everyone else.In other ways, it has been her most disappointing. Despite leaving everyone else in the rankings dust, she has lost the two matches that mattered most, in the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals, to opponents she was heavily favored to beat, Madison Keys and Coco Gauff, 6-4 in the third set each time.On Friday, Sabalenka was faced with another dangerous moment at a major, against another player she was favored to beat. The match wasn't a final, and the opponent, Emma Raducanu, was only ranked 40th. But it wasn't her ranking that struck fear into Sabalenka's heart. It was the fact that she was the home favorite.“Facing British at Wimbledon, I'm not sure I prefer that,” Sabalenka admitted, when she was asked about the prospect of playing Raducanu.

Sabalenka has had her issues with partisan crowds before, and she was right to worry about this one. Raducanu came out revved up and firing, and the Centre Court fans responded, their roars bouncing off the roof above. The Brit broke early, served for the first set, and reached set point in the tiebreaker. Sabalenka was again playing rattled, trying for too much, missing balls she would never miss in any other situation. As always, her exasperated facial expressions told the story of the match.So what did Sabalenka do then? She tried, and made, two difficult drop shots.Serving at 5-6 in the tiebreaker, she seemed to be reeling. She had just lost two points, and failed to capitalize on other easy chances. Was she going to let her surroundings unravel her again? At 5-6, when she went for a backhand drop, it looked like a panic move, and the ball seemed to be heading for the net. But when it cleared it by an inch, and bounced twice before a stunned Raducanu, Sabalenka looked like a genius.Two points later, up 7-6, with her own set point, Sabalenka repeated herself. Reaching high for a forehand volley at net, she dropped it jut over the net for another touch winner. The crowd was quieted at last.Sabalenka said she had found a way—possibly borrowed from Novak Djokovic—to use the audience to her advantage.“I was trying to trick my brain, and I was pretending that people were cheering for me,” she said. “Sometimes when they were screaming ‘Emma,' it sounded like ‘Aryna.'”“I think that's why I wasn't really getting, like, annoyed by that.”

Hall of Famer Analysis + Match Highlights: It's Wimbledon Primetime, on Tennis Channel.

The second set followed the same pattern. Again, Raducanu broke early. Again, the audience backed her. Again, she threatened to run away with it, this time earning a break point for 5-1. But again, Sabalenka found a way back.The shot that stuck out for me came with Raducanu serving at 4-2, down break point. Sabalenka had missed numerous returns on break points. This time she aimed her backhand down the line with pace, but also with plenty of margin, and finished the point from there. Unlike at Roland Garros, she found the balance of power and control when she needed to.Afterward, Sabalenka referenced her meltdown in Paris.“I was just keep telling myself, ‘No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm.'”“I'm super happy that I was able to be that focused.”This time she faced the fans, the moment, the crowd, and found her best.

Say hello to the second week 👋🤩Anisimova books her spot in the fourth round with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 win over Dalma Galfi.#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/rHUxY4RIax

Each time Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova set up to serve, she—along with everyone else inside Court 2—could hear a pair of loud smacks coming from the other side of the court. That was the sound of Naomi Osaka's left hand slapping her left thigh, hard. This would have been distracting to most players, but Pavlyuchenkova seemed too dialed in to let it bother her.At the same time over on Court 3, Amanda Anisimova was also making a noise that could have been bothersome to an opponent: After hitting a winning shot, she would emit a higher-pitched shriek than I'd ever heard from her; something in the ear-splitting range of the “Pojd!” that Petra Kvitova made famous. Anisimova's foe, Dalma Galfi, gestured across the net after a couple of these shrieks. It was hard to tell if she was annoyed by them, but it wouldn't have been a surprise.Anisimova and Osaka, as anyone could hear, were playing with a little bit of extra desperation. That's because both of them were in the second quarter of the women's draw, a section that had already lost its three highest seeds. That means there's a major opportunity for a surprise player to make the semifinals; before Friday, Anisimova and Osaka were the best-known of the bunch that remained.

But as their results showed, desperation will only get you so far.Anisimova and Osaka are both among the streakiest players in tennis. When they connect, it's a winner; when they don't, it's an error. And you never know which is going to happen from one match—or set, or game, or swing—to the next. Not surprisingly, each won one the first set and lost the second.In the end, their results may have come down to who they were playing.Anisimova's opponent, Dalma Galfi, has never been ranked higher than No. 79; Osaka's opponent, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, has been in the Top 10 and reached a major final.In the final set of Anisimova's match, Galfi's mid-pace shots were feeding into the American's more powerful strokes. Credit to Anisimova for finding her range at the right time.

Pavlyuchenkova, by contrast, was strong enough to create her own winning shots when she needed them. Serving at 4-4 in the second set, Pavlyuchenkova went down double break point—possibly one point from defeat. She responded with an ace and a service winner. At 3-3 in the third, Pavlyuchenkova faced another break point; Osaka had just won three straight games, and was threatening to pull ahead. This time, Pavlyuchenkova took a full swing at the first backhand she saw and fired it into the far corner for a winner. It was enough to make Osaka look across at her in disbelief and anguish.“I feel a little bit of pressure because obviously you feel like the opportunity is there,” said Anisimova, who will play Linda Noskova in the round of 16. “I keep reminding myself to just focus on the present, just take it one match at a time.”For Osaka, whose chance was gone, the emotions were obviously very different—or even non-existent.“I'm just going to be a negative human being today,” she said. “[After losing] in Paris I was very emotional. Now I don't feel anything, so I guess I'd prefer to feel nothing than everything.”

Tennis players have to deal with all sorts of injuries and ailments, from their knees to their backs to their hips to their minds. But their ears?You only have to ask Nicolas Jarry how brutal an ear issue can be. Last year he was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, an inner ear inflammation that causes vertigo and balance problems.“I had the issue which affected my perception, my balance, and I've been trying to come back and recover,"" an emotional Jarry said after his four-set win over Joao Fonseca. “It's been physically, emotionally and psychologically very tough.”

If his six wins at this year's Wimbledon—three in qualifying, three in the main draw—are any evidence, the ordeal has only made the 6-foot-7 Chilean tougher and hungrier at 29.He came from two sets down to beat No. 8 seed Holger Rune in the first round. He made quick work of a potentially tricky opponent in Learner Tien. And he held off a fierce comeback bid from Fonseca and his Brazilian faithful on Friday.In the fourth set, Jarry saved three break points in two different service games. In the tiebreaker, he went down 2-4, before blazing through the last five points with a string of brilliant shots, including a second serve ace.

The win puts Jarry, who is the grandson of former player Jaime Fillol, into the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.“I came here with him when I was 10 years old and 11,” he says of Fillol. “Since then, I'm in love with this tournament. Every match that I win here makes me stay a couple more days in the tournament, and that makes me very happy.”Jarry, with his strong serve and forehand, could be a tough out going forward. Next for him is Cam Norrie, and after that, possibly, Carlos Alcaraz.

Osaka fell in the third round of Wimbledon on Saturday.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 05, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 05, 2025

Naomi Osaka's seventh Grand Slam outing since returning from maternity leave ended in another disappointment, the Wimbledon Primetime panel breaking down her third-round loss to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Saturday.“She seems a little bit lost,” said Prakash Amritraj following the former world No. 1's 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat. “When she's playing great tennis, it's so beautiful to watch that she brings non-tennis eyeballs to the game. We're all such big fans of that. But she needs to start feeling a bit better about herself before it can translate into good tennis. That has to come first before the good striking. She said [in press], ‘I'm just going to be a negative person today, because that's how I feel' and I don't know how she gets through that, but she has to.”A four-time Grand Slam champion, Osaka is yet to reach the second week of a major tournament since giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023. Her comeback began the following year at the Australian Open, where she lost in the first round to Caroline Garcia. Though she avenged that defeat earlier this year, subsequent losses have made the 27-year-old question how much longer her career will last.

“Once that thought gets in your mind, it's hard to get it out of your mind,” said Lindsay Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 who mounted her own comeback from maternity leave back in 2007. “She's been back on tour for about 18 months now since her maternity break and she's been playing full time, no real injuries. Yes, it's hard to come back. I get it; I did it. But she's not even in a position to be seeded, hasn't really been able to break into that Top 30, which, if you've won four Grand Slams and been No. 1 in the world, that's what you're shooting for.“This is probably a really good time for her to take some time, figure out why she's playing and struggling in these close matches. Once you lose your confidence at 4-4 or 5-5 in sets, it's tough to get it back. She's just got to figure out if this is what she wants to be doing out here.”Amritraj argued Osaka was unlikely to step away and, despite disappointments at Grand Slam tournaments, has trended up in 2025 by winning her first title on clay in Saint-Malo.

Osaka made the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 but was unable to convert a one-set lead against Pavlyuchenkova on Saturday.

“The only puzzling thing for me is that, for someone who has had that much success, sometimes when I listen to her it's like she's never been there before. As cliché as it sounds, you've got to remember who you are here. When she was playing at her best, she was trouncing people on hard courts, winning Grand Slams back-to-back.“She's put the work in, clearly,” added former No. 1 Jim Courier. “She's fitter than I've seen her in a long, long time.”Both Courier and Davenport raised Osaka's current coaching partnership with Patrick Mouratoglou, who worked with Serena Williams through the final decade of her career. Following a Roland Garros defeat last month, Osaka opened up about feeling like she was disappointing Mouratoglou with her results.

Something has to give there, whether it's playing a little less or bringing her daughter on the road with her a bit more, maybe try a new coaching set-up...It just seems like something's got to change for her to have a little bit more success. Lindsay Davenport

“I was thinking this just now, but he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever to, like, ‘What the fuck this is?'” a frustrated Osaka said at the time.“That's not a thought that should be in a player's mind,” said Courier.“Something has to give there,” agreed Davenport, “whether it's playing a little less or bringing her daughter on the road with her a bit more, maybe try a new coaching set-up. Who knows? It just seems like something's got to change for her to have a little bit more success.”Osaka will likely play her next tournament on a hard court, the surface on which she has achieved her greatest successes with four Grand Slam victories (two US Open, two Australian Open).

'I'm very frustrated with myself' - Leclerc left reeling with P6 in qualifying

Red Bull boss Christian Horner has responded to the continued speculation surrounding Max Verstappen and a future move to Mercedes.

Christian Horner has stated that Max Verstappen “would like to finish his career in a Red Bull car” with the team boss insisting that the squad “know where we're at” amid continued rumours linking the Dutchman to Mercedes.

Verstappen had remained tight-lipped when asked about his future during Thursday's media day, the four-time World Champion responding to questions by answering: “I have nothing to add.”

Horner faced similar queries when speaking to the press on Friday and, when quizzed on what Verstappen had said to him about the situation, the Red Bull Team Principal said: “There's obviously an awful a lot of people talking about it, but what's most important is the relationship between the driver and the team, and obviously there's an agreement that defines that as well.

“Everybody's very clear on where we're at. Max has been with Red Bull since the very start of his career, all of his success has come in Red Bull Racing cars, and he's been a big part of our team and he has a great deal of faith in the team and the people around him.

“Whilst there's always going to be speculation and noise, I think we all sit fairly comfortable with where we're at and what the situation is. We can't control the narrative of others, but internally we know where we're at.”

Asked if there was a plan B in place should Verstappen choose to leave, Horner joked in response, with McLaren CEO Zak Brown next to him in the press conference: “Oscar Piastri! It's all as subjective as that. We're very focused on our current drivers and the relationship, Max has got a contract until 2028.

“He's made it quite clear that he would like to finish his career in a Red Bull car, from start to finish – I think that's quite special and unique for him. That's what we're focused on, just ignoring the noise and focusing on the areas where we know we need to improve and how to do that.”

Horner went on to suggest that the speculation has its roots in the fact that George Russell is yet to sign a new deal with Mercedes.

“The contracts between the drivers and the teams are always going to remain confidential, and with any driver's contract there is always an element of a performance mechanism and of course that exists within Max's contract,” the Briton said.

“His intention is that he will be there driving for us in 2026. It's inevitable that he's of huge interest to any other team in the pit lane, and I think actually George probably triggered all of this speculation, probably trying to leverage his own situation and force clarity, which you can understand because he's driven a very good season as well this year.

“But inevitably there will always be speculation about it. I think the most important thing is the clarity that exists between Max and the team, and that's very clear.”

And in terms of whether Russell would be a realistic candidate for Red Bull if Verstappen was to leave, Horner added: “It's remarkable that George is still on the market. We haven't engaged in any discussion with George, so he's obviously pretty confident that he's going to get to retain where he is.

“We've got strength and depth within our team; you can see the Racing Bulls drivers, you can see [Arvid] Lindblad that we're running today. And 2026 is going to be a transformational year, the biggest rule change in Formula 1 probably in the last 50 years with both chassis and power unit [changes] being introduced at the same time.

“Nobody with hand on heart can know what the pecking order is going to be – it could be either one of these gentleman [McLaren's Brown and Aston Martin's Andy Cowell] sat next to me, it could be Ferrari, it could be Mercedes, it could be anyone.

“I think there's an awful lot of subjectiveness to 2026, and it will only be this time next year that you'll have a clear indication of what that pecking order is. There are no guarantees that jumping into a Mercedes car would automatically be a better proposition.”

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton impressed at Silverstone on Friday, topping one of the sessions.

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton admits he ""can dream of having a strong weekend"" at the British Grand Prix after topping the first of Friday's practice sessions.

The seven-time World Champion enjoyed arguably his strongest Friday since joining the Scuderia at the start of 2025, having topped Free Practice 1 and finishing P3 in the afternoon session.

Hamilton, a nine-time F1 winner at Silverstone, believes Ferrari's pace was genuine and offers opportunities for Sunday's race.

""It was a really good day,"" he said. ""Great to see the crowd. Amazing to be out on track in a Ferrari here at Silverstone.

""It's pretty incredible and also with McLaren and Red Bull having upgrades, so for us to be in the mix still given they have had a step today, it's really positive.

""I definitely feel like we can dream of having a strong weekend for sure. Executing and putting it all together and extracting it is another thing but I'll prepare myself the best I can to make sure we get the best result.""

Hamilton secured his equal-best Grand Prix result for Ferrari last time out in Austria after finishing fourth and believes he is getting to grips with the SF-25 having been off the pace compared with team mate, Charles Leclerc.

""I'm progressing a lot now with the car and much more comfortable knowing where it needs to be,"" he added.

""I think by FP2 we still weren't where we needed to be, so definitely struggled a little bit more, but we know the changes that we need to make for the next session.""

Leclerc also enjoyed a strong showing on Friday, finishing fourth in the first session and P2 during Free Practice 2.

While missing some one-lap pace compared to pacesetter Lando Norris and McLaren, Leclerc believes Ferrari's race pace will cause problems for the opposition on Sunday.

""The day was good,"" he said. We've been pretty strong so far so it's positive. I think we still need to find some pace in Qualifying.

""McLaren is once again probably the car to beat at the moment but in race pace I was happy. I'm finding my way, I'm changing quite a lot the car in weekends recently to try and find some pace in Qualifying.

""For now, I don't think I find a way for that, but in the race I'm really happy with where we are. I think we are very strong in the race but we've got to do a step forward in Qualifying.""

Ferrari set the pace as cars returned to the track for final practice at Silverstone, with Charles Leclerc coming out on top.

Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the British Grand Prix, leading the way from McLaren rival Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen – as rookies Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman endured late crashes.

After a bright and warm first day at Silverstone, topped by home favourite Lando Norris, cloudy, cooler conditions greeted the drivers for FP3, which gave them one more chance to tweak their cars ahead of the mid-afternoon Qualifying hour.

When the session got under way at a slightly delayed time of 1135, drivers gradually trickled out on track to begin their programmes and assess the conditions – Pirelli's soft, medium and hard compound tyres all being used in the opening minutes.

Lewis Hamilton was one of the early movers when the action got under way, bolting on a set of soft tyres and clocking a 1m 26.529s to hold the provisional P1 spot, which prompted plenty of cheers from the packed grandstand and grass banks around the track.

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

As per Friday's running, there were some significant gusts of wind for Hamilton and the rest of the drivers to deal with – seemingly highlighted when Lance Stroll drifted his way out of the Luffield hairpin and just about prevented his Aston Martin from spinning.

Kimi Antonelli also reported a “massive moment” through the Maggotts and Becketts complex when he began to push, while there was drama for Alex Albon when he faced a slow-moving Aston Martin at the entry to Copse and swore over the radio to express his frustration.

As for lap times, Leclerc used the soft tyres to get down to a 1m 25.922s and take over from team mate Hamilton in P1, a couple of tenths clear of a more competitive looking Max Verstappen, who nonetheless complained of brake bias difficulties.

“A little bit of rain,” Leclerc then commented over the radio with around 20 minutes to go, but it was nowhere near enough to stop drivers from pumping in laps on slicks and making improvements – George Russell proving this when he slotted into second position.

With some 15 minutes remaining, Norris sent the home crowd wild again by going quickest on a 1m 25.606s, followed closely by Verstappen and team mate Piastri via similarly significant gains, before Leclerc fired in a 1m 25.498s to reclaim P1.

Hamilton was also on a rapid lap at this point, hitting the Sector 2 beam 0.074s clear of Leclerc, only for the red flag to be thrown for debris on track – meaning he had to abandon the effort. “We think the bodywork might be yours,” was the subsequent message to Haas driver Bearman.

The session resumed with a few minutes to go but was soon halted again when Gabriel Bortoleto lost control of his Kick Sauber through the aforementioned Maggotts/Becketts sweeps, bounced over the grass and ended in the gravel with suspension damage.

It meant Leclerc ended up fastest over Piastri, Verstappen and Norris, with Yuki Tsunoda an encouraging fifth for Red Bull, Bearman taking sixth despite another moment late on when he misjudged his entry to the pit lane, spun and damaged his front wing, and Albon putting Williams back into the top 10 positions.

Russell was the fastest of the Mercedes cars on a so far difficult weekend for the Silver Arrows, placing eighth over the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson, Hamilton, and the other Williams and Haas machines of Carlos Sainz and Esteban Ocon.

Next up was Antonelli in 14th, as the Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Bortoleto along with the Aston Martins and Alpines brought up the rear – Fernando Alonso placing in front of Franco Colapinto, Stroll and Pierre Gasly.

Ollie Bearman has been hit with a grid penalty following a red flag infringement during third and final practice at Silverstone.

Ollie Bearman has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix following a red flag infringement during the weekend's third and final practice hour.

The session had already proven eventful for Bearman, the Haas driver earlier sparking a red flag after losing a piece of bodywork from his car out on track which resulted in the marshals having to retrieve the part.

But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel.

As he headed into the pit lane, Bearman had a spin of his own and hit the barriers, losing the front wing from his VF-25 in the process.

With the incident happening under red flag conditions, it was subsequently investigated by the stewards who opted to hand the 20-year-old a grid drop of 10 places for Sunday's race.

A document released following the stewards' hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. He lost control of the car in the pit entry road and crashed into the barriers.

“Art. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane'.

“It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions.

“In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag.

“To make matters worse, he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers while at speed. The driver informed us that he misjudged the fact that his brakes were not warm because the lap was done slowly, due to the red flag.

“While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.”

As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight.

The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year's event at Silverstone being where the youngster's deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, as the top three drivers were covered by less than one-tenth of a second.

The Ferrari driver posted a 1m 25.498s in much cooler conditions than Friday, which left him just 0.068s clear of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen a further 0.019s back.

Drivers were unable to improve in the final moments at Silverstone following two red flags in quick succession, the first due to debris heading into Stowe that thwarted Lewis Hamilton's best effort as the Ferrari driver finished outside the top 10.

The second stoppage came at the very end of the one-hour session, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto losing control through Maggotts and Becketts and finishing in the gravel with suspension damage, while Haas' Ollie Bearman hit the barrier on the entry to the pits.

Lando Norris finished fastest in Free Practice 2 for the British Grand Prix.

Lando Norris finished fastest in Free Practice 2 for the British Grand Prix, the McLaren driver besting the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

The Briton, who won last time out in Austria, posted a 1m 25.816s that left him 0.222s clear of Leclerc, and three-tenths faster than Hamilton, who had topped FP1 earlier in the day.

With wind speed high and impacting aerodynamic performance through the high speed turns at Silverstone, teams battled to find the optimum set-up in the changeable conditions.

Hamilton immediately continued his impressive Friday form, moving to the top of the times with his first flying lap on Pirelli's medium tyre with a 1m 27.280s, as traffic became an issue for Norris and Liam Lawson.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, who earlier had a radio message about the ""gusty"" conditions, moved to the top of the leaderboard after the opening 10 minutes, only to be immediately usurped by Hamilton and Isack Hadjar.

While Ollie Bearman complained of oversteer in his Haas, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen was also left frustrated, proclaiming over the radio: ""Have you seen my front tyres in the high speed? They just don't respond.""

Carlos Sainz soon suffered a harmless spin coming out of Luffield, with Williams Team Principal James Vowles stating ""the gusts are definitely catching us out"" during the session.

The second Ferrari of Leclerc took over from his team mate at the top of the times briefly but Hamilton, who has a record nine F1 wins at Silverstone, stamped his authority to go 0.295s clear on a 1m 26.592s after 20 minutes.

George Russell became the first driver to use a set of Pirelli's soft tyre, the red-walled compound launching him up to first before Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli went 0.140s faster.

It left the benchmark at a 1m 26.383s, half a second faster than Hamilton's best from FP1, approaching the halfway point of the one-hour session.

Times began to tumble as drivers performed Qualifying simulations, with Leclerc and then Norris going fastest, the former complaining of something wrong with the front-left tyre, stating there was ""so much lap time in it"".

Hamilton abandoned his first flying lap on the softs, before moving up to P2 with his second effort, while Verstappen could only manage eighth, eight tenths in arrears on Norris' 1m 25.816s, improving to fifth on his next run.

The McLaren driver's time stood as the benchmark for the remainder of the session, making him the only driver to dip below the 1m 26s barrier as focus switched to long runs for teams.

As Leclerc and Hamilton completed the top three, Piastri sat in fourth, almost half a second behind his team mate but ahead of Verstappen and Antonelli.

The Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, Mercedes of Russell and the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Lawson completed the top 10.

Alex Albon (P11) was the highest-placed of the Williams drivers, from Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Gabriel Bortoleto, the Brazilian back in his Kick Sauber after the seat was taken by Paul Aron in FP1.

Esteban Ocon finished 14th, ahead of Yuki Tsunoda, who had also missed FP1 with Arvid Lindblad taking his seat, with Sainz 16th and under investigation following his rejoin after his earlier spin.

Nico Hulkenberg, who had to avoid Sainz's recovery, finished P17, as the Alpine's of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto finished either side of Bearman in P19.

Take a look at all of the odds for this weekend's British Grand Prix, from polesitters to race winners and everything in between.

Formula 1 moves on from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, with title challenger Lando Norris one of several home drivers targeting success. But what do the odds tell us about the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The McLaren drivers are back on top of the podium in this category. Norris redeemed himself after his mishap in Montreal to take the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring and close the gap on his team mate in the championship.

Norris is yet to stand on top of the podium at his home Grand Prix, but he has come close in the last two editions, with a runner-up and top-three return.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri finished fourth on his last visit to Silverstone, but has matured significantly over the past 12 months, registering nine podiums this campaign, including five victories.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen suffered his first DNF of the season in Austria, after being taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the opening lap, and is back at a venue where he has only taken the spoils on two occasions.

Mercedes' drivers are always worth considering at Silverstone, considering their impressive record of nine victories in the last 13 races in England. However, their top dog George Russell has faced some struggles at this venue, producing a best return of fifth, despite growing up only two hours from the track.

The top three drivers in the standings are heavily favoured to snatch a podium this weekend. These individuals have accumulated 23 podiums between them this campaign, but Verstappen lines up after registering his maiden DNF of 2025.

Charles Leclerc is spraying champagne regularly at the moment, entering the top three in three of his previous four starts. The Monegasque's recent consistency results in an average finish of 3.8, highlighting his threat to the rostrum.

Lewis Hamilton returns home with an astounding record of 12 consecutive podiums at this track. The seven-time World Champion is the defending champion in the United Kingdom, and despite his wobbly form this year, remains a contender.

Hamilton is still hunting his maiden Sunday podium with Ferrari, and he has a great chance to do it here.

The papaya duo boast the most top sixes in the championship, with 10 apiece. Piastri has been inside that threshold in every start since Shanghai, while a DNF in Montreal is Norris' only blemish.

Rookie Antonelli is a six-time top-six finisher this term, including a maiden F1 top three in Canada. However, he's proven erratic in recent rounds, failing to finish three of his last five starts on Sunday and ending 18th in Monaco.

Alex Albon blasted into 2025 with three top-six outings in his first seven starts, before his campaign was doused and brought back to reality. The Thai-British driver has earned a DNF next to his name in the previous three races, but he was only culpable in Spain, when he collided with Liam Lawson.

Albon's vehicle let him down in Montreal and Austria, and brought about a bigger discussion about what's going on at Williams. His team mate Carlos Sainz couldn't even start the showdown at Spielberg after his brakes overheated and burst into flames after the formation lap.

Besides the aforementioned event winner, podium, and top six favourites, we turn our focus to two veterans to lead the charge for a top 10.

Fernando Alonso is starting to develop consistency in his Aston Martin, with three consecutive top 10s, including back-to-back seventh places in Canada and Austria. The other seasoned campaigner is Nico Hulkenberg, who is also on a run of three races inside the top 10.

Haas' senior driver, Esteban Ocon, continues to compete for a spot in the first 10. The Frenchman has registered the feat five times in 2025, three in his previous four races.

Racing Bulls pilot Lawson appears to have set aside the drama from earlier in the season, claiming top 10s in 50% of his last four races. The New Zealander starts after a career-best sixth place at the Red Bull Ring.

Credit must also go to another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto, who fought hard for his maiden F1 top 10 in the last round.

The MCL39 continues to outclass its rivals over one lap this season. Norris recorded the team's seventh pole position in the previous round, taking his tally to three.

Norris has started at the front of the grid in two of his past four races, while his Aussie team mate has qualified fastest in four rounds this year.
Meanwhile, Verstappen is a three-time fastest qualifier after 11 rounds, but enters after lining up in seventh in the Styrian Alps.

The Dutchman's fierce rival, Russell, is the only other driver to start on pole this season, proving consistent by qualifying among the fastest three in five rounds. The Briton's starting grid average sits at 4.45 this year, slightly below Verstappen's at 3.18.

Leclerc started in second in Austria, the third such grid position for the Monegasque this season. The previous round also marked the best Qualifying for Ferrari this year, with both drivers ending inside the top five for the first time.

German drivers and cars have won nine of the last 13 British Grands Prix.

Hamilton was the latest victor for Mercedes, but will now defend his title in a red Italian car. Verstappen, Sainz, and Sebastian Vettel are the only non-Mercedes drivers to prevail in England since 2013. That leaves Red Bull and Ferrari with two triumphs apiece in the last 12 years.

McLaren last won the Silverstone showcase in 2008, when a young Hamilton was on their payroll. The Woking-based outfit may have struggled on home soil for 16 years, but they are the team to beat this time around. After 11 rounds, the papayas have won 72.73% of the Teams' trophies on offer, including three in their last four outings.

Lewis Hamilton has kicked off his home event by leading the way in Free Practice 1 at the British Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton has topped the timesheets during Friday's first practice session at the British Grand Prix, the seven-time World Champion leading the way from fellow Briton Lando Norris at his home event.

There were two new names joining the action for FP1 at Silverstone; 17-year-old Arvid Lindblad had stepped in to Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull for his F1 weekend debut, while Alpine Reserve Driver Paul Aron was at the wheel of Nico Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber, the rival teams having come to an agreement to share the 21-year-old's driving services.

Haas' Esteban Ocon led the pack out in a busy start to the session, the majority of the field running the medium tyres while the Aston Martin and Williams cars had bolted on the hard compound.

Liam Lawson, meanwhile, made an early complaint about traffic, the Racing Bulls man – whose car is running a special livery this weekend – saying “guy needs to check his mirrors” after encountering Lindblad on track.

The opening segment of FP1 saw several home favourites top the timesheets, with Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris each going fastest before George Russell set the quickest time to head the timesheets.

Pierre Gasly, meanwhile, completed a 360-degree spin at Copse corner. The Alpine driver managed to continue running, albeit with some significant flat spots on his tyres.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar had set the pace from Charles Leclerc as the session reached its halfway point, just as others started to switch to the soft tyres for some flying laps. Elsewhere there was trouble for Carlos Sainz, with the Williams up on the stands in the garage as the team seemingly checked the floor.

The order quickly started to evolve as most of the pack started to embark on their soft-shod runs, with the times rapidly tumbling, while traffic increasingly became an issue. Meanwhile Gabriel Bortoleto became the next driver to spin around at Copse, the Kick Sauber briefly triggering the yellow flags before continuing on.

As the session entered into its final 20 minutes, Norris had returned to the top of the order – only for Hamilton to surge through to displace his fellow Briton by two-hundredths, the Ferrari driver setting the pace on a 1m 26.892s.

While more laps went on the board – and Sainz rejoined the pack slightly out of sequence on the hard tyres before later switching to the soft rubber – Hamilton's benchmark ultimately remained unbeaten on a track where the 40-year-old has won a record nine times.

Norris remained in second, with the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri going third quickest while Leclerc placed in fourth. Russell followed in fifth for Mercedes ahead of Hadjar, Williams' Alex Albon, Lawson and the other Silver Arrows car of Kimi Antonelli.

Max Verstappen rounded out the top 10 on a weekend in which the Red Bull driver has continued to face speculation over his future. The Aston Martin duo of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll claimed P11 and P12 from Lindblad (P13), Sainz (P14) and Ocon (P15).

Meanwhile Alpine's Franco Colapinto, Aron, Haas' Ollie Bearman, Gasly and Bortoleto completed the order from 16th to 20th respectively.

With the first hour of running now complete, the drivers and teams will examine their data and prepare for Friday's second practice session, which is set to get underway at 1600 local time.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen will start from pole position for the British Grand Prix after a last-gasp effort beat the McLaren duo.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a last-gasp pole position for the British Grand Prix following a scintillating Qualifying session at Silverstone.

The four-time and reigning World Champion posted a 1m 24.892s with his final lap, leaving him just over one-tenth clear of McLaren pairing Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, with Mercedes' George Russell only fractions further back.

Briton Lewis Hamilton finished fifth, just two-tenths shy of Verstappen after losing time through the final sequence of corners but will start directly ahead of Ferrari team mate, Charles Leclerc.

The session was red-flagged during Q1 after Franco Colapinto's Alpine found the barrier at the final corner, with the Argentinean racer rejoining before coming to a halt at the start of the lap.

McLaren's Lando Norris set the pace during Friday practice for the British Grand Prix, but he expects a strong weekend challenge from rivals Ferrari.

Lando Norris made clear that there is “nothing to be too proud about just yet” following his table-topping performance during Friday practice for the British Grand Prix.

Norris produced a time of 1m 25.816s with Pirelli's soft compound tyre in FP2 at Silverstone, putting him 0.222s up on Charles Leclerc and 0.301s up on Lewis Hamilton in the two Ferraris, who caught the eye throughout the day.

While satisfied with his and McLaren's start to the weekend, Norris took notice of the pace displayed by Ferrari and expects a stern challenge from the Scuderia in the battle for pole position and victory.

Asked about his pace-setting effort, Norris said: “I mean, the soft was a very strong lap. But me being me, I think also just in general, the Ferraris have been very, very quick today – and they shall be tomorrow.

“I think we have a bit of work to do, to be honest. It looked maybe a bit too good today. Like always, Ferrari catch up into FP3, like they did last weekend [in Austria]. I would say pleased with today, but nothing to be too proud about just yet.”

Nonetheless, Norris' aim heading into Saturday is clear, as the home favourite looks to deliver pole position in front of his own bright yellow grandstand, saying: “That's my target! I'm working on it.

“I would look at it [the stand] every lap, every single lap. I mean, it's hard to miss! Every lap I'm forced to look at it, but it's also just a great thing to see. If it's distracting me, it's distracting others, so it's working perfectly!”

Meanwhile, championship leader Oscar Piastri finished the day 0.470s down on team mate Norris – the Australian also talking up Ferrari's speed and predicting “a lot of competition” for the big prizes.

“A good first day, I think,” Piastri reflected. “Ferrari have looked very competitive. I think we looked alright. In FP2, the soft tyre was a little bit messy for me. I think the potential's definitely there and the long runs looked pretty solid as well.”

Asked if he was surprised by Ferrari's showing, he said: “It was a bit of a surprise, yes. They looked good. Both in the Qualifying runs and the longer runs as well, so I think they're in the fight this weekend, which is interesting to see.”

He added: “I think if I can piece things together it'll be very competitive. [It was] just not a great lap and with these tyres around here you pretty much get one shot, so my second attempt was pretty decent considering the tyres. I'm pretty relaxed.”

ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins secured pole position on his final lap of the day at Silverstone.

ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins left it until his final lap of the day at Silverstone to seal the Aramco Pole Position Award at a tightly contested Qualifying session.

The Williams Driver Academy member's 1m 39.371s was good enough to beat Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne to pole by just 0.051s, and to give him his second Formula 2 pole position at the British venue, following his 2023 performance.

Dunne was forced to settle for second ahead of DAMS Lucas Oil's Jak Crawford in third, while Invicta Racing's Roman Stanek took P4.

PREMA Racing's Sebastián Montoya continued his fine form by qualifying fifth, with AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen in P6.

Championship leader Richard Verschoor had been in the top two after the first set of laps of the session, but the MP Motorsport driver wound up in seventh.

Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member Dino Beganovic was back in the top 10 for Hitech TGR in P8, with Kush Maini ninth for DAMS.

Leonardo Fornaroli's late lap saw him go to P10, relegating Campos Racing's Arvid Lindblad, fresh off his debut Free Practice 1 outing with Red Bull Racing, to 11th.

This means Fornaroli is set to start from reverse grid pole for Invicta Racing in the Sprint Race, which is set to get underway at 13:15 local time on Saturday.

Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak claimed Sprint Race victory at Silverstone to become the first driver from Thailand to win in F3.

Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak claimed his maiden victory in FIA Formula 3, becoming the first driver from Thailand to win in the Championship.

The Campos Racing driver started from reverse grid pole and fended off his rivals at lights out in the opening corners.

An early Safety Car gave Van Amersfoort Racing's Théophile Nael the chance to close back up, but an overtake outside of track limits meant the Frenchman eventually ceded the place back to the Campos driver.

From there, Inthraphuvasak established a comfortable gap over Martinius Stenshorne, who went from sixth on the grid up to P2 for Hitech TGR.

Mari Boya also climbed up the order onto the podium, going from P9 on the grid to third in an impressive display. It included a memorable pass by the Campos driver at the final corner on Nael and ART Grand Prix's Laurens van Hoepen.

Elsewhere, title contender Nikola Tsolov was involved in a Lap 1 collision with PREMA Racing's Brando Badoer and wound up 29th.

Championship leader Rafael Câmara extended his advantage in the Drivers' Championship by finishing in P8, with closest rival in the points Tim Tramnitz ending up outside the top 10 in 11th.

The video game studio is reuniting with animation studio Trigger on a stand-alone follow-up to the 2022 Netflix entry set in the universe of Cyberpunk 2077. 


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


	CD Projekt Red is returning to the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners universe with a new stand-alone entry, which the game developer announced alongside the anime series' showrunner during a panel at Anime Expo on Friday. 


	The video game developer will once again partner with the animation studio Trigger for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, which, like its predecessor, will stream on Netflix. An official logo and poster art were shared as part of CD PROJEKT RED's “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners — Behind the Scenes With its Creators,” with a promise that later in the day, Trigger would tease new footage for the series at the Peacock Theater as part of its own panel.

	The series will serve as a new 10-episode stand-alone story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077, and asks the question: in a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence and when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes will you go to in order to make your story matter? Described as a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge, Edgerunners 2 will, according to the series' story writer and producer Bartosz Sztybor, not only be a sadder and darker take, but “more bloody, and more raw.”

	“Night City has a lot of stories to tell. I have a dream that it won't end with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. There's more stories, more characters,” he added about his decision to pursue another series. “I wasn't satisfied with the sadness I received from the audience so I want you to be even more sad now.”

	











Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 will feature a new story and fresh characters, and while the series does not currently have a release date, it will be directed by Kai Ikarashi. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners director Hiroyuki Imaishi made a special appearance during the panel to pass the baton for Ikarashi's directorial debut on the series, after working together on the 2022 entry. Voice actors Emi Lo (Lucy Kushinada) and Zach Aguilar (David Martinez) also appeared on the panel, which saw cast and creatives take fans behind the scenes of the 2022 anime.  


	Sztybor and Ikarashi will be joined on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo and Masahiko Otsuka, who will be responsible for the screenplay adaptation. 


	“[Cyberpunk: Edgerunner's] David [Martinez's] story might be over, but there's plenty more to discover in Night City. And to again have the legendary animation studio Trigger along for the ride makes us at CD Projekt Red so excited to introduce a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we've done before,” Sztybor said in a statement.

Before screening the restored 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' the nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, producer of the film with Michael Douglas, said ""we shall overcome,"" lauding the ""movie about rebellion.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Producer Paul Zaentz, nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, who co-produced with Michael Douglas the Oscar-winning Miloš Forman drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump during an appearance at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic on Saturday.


	Appearing before a screening of a newly restored version of the 1975 classic, which became only the second movie to win all five major Academy Award categories – best picture (Douglas and Zaentz), best director (Forman), best actor (Jack Nicholson), best actress (Louise Fletcher), and best adapted screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), Zaentz called Cuckoo's Nest “a movie about rebellion” and bashed financial support for the poor and other Trump policies.

	“It's ironic that … Cuckoo's Nest has been honored here on its 50th anniversary, and I am afraid that Ken Kesey's brilliant book may be banned in the USA,” he said in comments made a few minutes before Douglas appeared on stage to a huge ovation.


	Zaentz continued: “Yesterday, July 4, the malignant narcissist, wannabe dictator that occupies the White House signed a bill that was passed by his cruel, heartless followers to make the rich richer and take food and health care away from the people who need it – a very sad July 4 for the USA.” The remark drew applause from the jam-packed auditorium at the Czech festival.

	











	The producer concluded by asking people outside the U.S. for patience. “Don't give up on America,” Zaentz said. “We shall overcome the totally corrupt, morally bankrupt, treasonous, evil thing and his cronies and minions. I am certain that Miloš would agree with me that Trump is a stain on my country, and his presidency will be looked upon as the greatest moral failure in the history of the United States.”

Alyssa Milano shared a moving remembrance to Julian McMahon following his death, writing in a lengthy tribute post that he was “more than my TV husband” and a “dear friend” who supported her professionally and personally throughout their time on The WB's long-running fantasy drama Charmed.


	“I'm heartbroken,” she began. “Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence. He walked into a room and lit it up—not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding.”


	Milano portrayed one of three powerful witchy Halliwell sisters alongside co-stars Holly Marie Combs and the late Shannen Doherty throughout the series' run from 1998-2006, and in Seasons 3 through 5, her character Phoebe has a turbulent relationship with McMahon's Cole Turner, a half-human and half-demon.

	“We spent years together on Charmed—years of scenes, stories, and so many in-between moments. He made me feel safe as an actor. Seen as a woman. He challenged me, teased me, supported me. We were so different, and yet somehow we always understood each other,” she wrote, alongside photos and selfies of the two throughout the years.


	“Julian was more than my TV husband. He was a dear friend. The kind who checks in. The kind who remembers. The kind who shares. The kind who tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable—but always with love,” Milano continued.


	The actress concluded that her thoughts are with McMahon's family.

	











	“My heart is with Kelly, with Madison, and with Iliana—his girls, his world. He adored them. You could feel it in every conversation, every story, every text. He was a family man above all, and he loved deeply. Losing him feels unreal. Too soon. Too unfair. Rest, my friend. I'll carry your laugh with me. Forever Cole. Forever Julian. 🕊️💔”


	Aside from Charmed, McMahon is known for his starring roles in Nip/Tuck, FBI: Most Wanted and the 2000s Fantastic Four movies. He died July 2 in Clearwater, Fla. from a private battle with cancer. Following the news of his death, tributes poured in from loved ones and co-stars, including fellow Charmed actors Marie Combs and Rose McGowan.

PREVIOUS, THURSDAY: Universal/Amblin Entertainment's Jurassic World Rebirth delivered a strong overseas start on Wednesday with $26M from 38 international box office markets, including some previews. Combined with domestic's $30.5M Wednesday, the global running total is $56.5M through Day One.


	In total, JWR will be out in 82 offshore markets this weekend with Japan joining in August. 


	International rollout began on Tuesday in Hong Kong to capitalize on the Special Administrative Region Establishment Day holiday, coming in with $600K — the single biggest day for a studio title since Deadpool & Wolverine‘s opening Saturday, and the biggest MPA opening of the year to-date. The Scarlett Johansson-starrer ranked as a clear No. 1 for the day, with a 44% market share.


	On Wednesday, China delivered the biggest launch day for a studio movie in the market this year at $9.9M. Opening on 65,000 screens in the market, including 760 Imax, the Gareth Edwards-directed adventure took a massive 64% share at No. 1. This is also the biggest studio opening day since Godzilla x Kong's Friday debut in March 2024 and the 2nd biggest MPA single-day gross of 2025, only behind Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning‘s first Sunday, which fell during the Dragon Boat Festival national holidays at release.


	On Thursday, China added a further $5.6M (not included in the offshore/global totals above), reaching $15.5M so far and continuing to dominate in a competitive market with a 50% market share at No. 1. 


	The Jurassic movies have been popular in China, with the recent titles grossing nearly $650M combined (unadjusted). The Rebirth team including Edwards, Johansson, Rupert Friend and Jonathan Bailey visited Shanghai for a premiere last Sunday – a promotional move that's become far less frequent since the pandemic. Jurassic also has a dedicated section at the Universal Beijing Resort.


	Meanwhile, Korea also opened yesterday, scoring the biggest Wednesday debut of the year at $1M and the 2nd biggest non-holiday opening day of 2025 after Bong Joon-ho's Mickey 17. The market grossed another $700K today (early estimate, not included in overall international and global totals above) and still a clear No. 1 with $1.7M through today.


	Other Wednesday debuts include the UK & Ireland with $2.7M, accounting for 56% of the market at No. 1. The performance is just off Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom‘s opening Wednesday, above Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and above Spider-Man: Homecoming. Relative to other 2025 tentpoles, this is more than double Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning and 72% above F1. 












Mexico debuted to $2.1M in wide Wednesday previews, taking a 67% market share for the day. Comparing to like-for-like wide Wednesday previews, this is above Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and aligned with Thor: Love and Thunder. 


Spain grossed $1.6M on Wednesday at a clear No. 1 with a 41% share. The launch is the second best opening day for any installment of the Jurassic World saga: above Fallen Kingdom and Dominion and just below Jurassic World, which opened on a standard Friday. This result was also the highest-grossing Wednesday of the year and the 3rd highest grossing day of 2025 (only behind Lilo & Stitch and Minecraft). 


Germany grossed $1.1M on Wednesday, taking a 52% market share at No.1, on what was the hottest day of the year so far. This is the biggest opening day of 2025, ahead of Lilo and Minecraft.


Italy is also off to a $1.1M start from Wednesday previews at a huge 60% market share for the day. Compared to standard Thursday openings for Jurassic titles, this is above Fallen Kingdom and in-line with Jurassic World.  


Thailand, the production home for the film, opened on Wednesday to $700K, dominating close to 75% market share in the key cities at No. 1 and delivering the biggest non-holiday opening day of the year in the market. 


Taiwan grossed $600K on Wednesday, marking the biggest opening day of 2025, and accounting for 50% of the market at No. 1.


Indonesia opened on Wednesday at No. 1 to $600K, best of the year so far in the market and the 2nd biggest opening day of the Jurassic franchise, coming in above Dominion and Jurassic World, and just below Fallen Kingdom. This is also Universal's second biggest opening of the last 5 years, only behind Fast X.


	As for other early Thursday results not included in the international and global totals above, Australia grossed $1.2M on opening day with JWR ranking as a clear No. 1 with a 54% share of the Top 10.  This is the biggest opening day of 2025, surpassing A Minecraft Movie.


Malaysia entered the fray with $400K, the biggest non-holiday opening day for an MPA title this year, more than double Lilo & Stitch and 48% above Minecraft.


	Other major Thursday openers include Brazil and Netherlands while France and India join on Friday.

Here comes Part 8.

At least JWR looks like it will be profitable worldwide.

Nobody will have to PRETEND it's a hit like some people are doing for F1(op)

It's fascinating that it's been over 30 years since the last great Jurassic Park movie, over 25 years since the last Spielberg-directed Jurassic Park movie, and yet audiences still flock to these unnecessary franchise-extension sequels, hoping that ‘maybe this one will be great.' 

So now we have one perfect Jurassic Park movie and six ‘it's like Jurassic Park but nowhere near as good' movies, each one more resigned-shrug than the last. Jurassic Park, as a franchise, is the perfect example of diminishing returns. The CGI gets better but everything else gets so much worse.

There have been dozens of original movies this year, but people like you just didn't go see them in theaters, so they flopped.

So why would studios even try originals anymore? 

Oh, that's right, because even the sequels, prequels and remakes are now flopping…hahaha

Time for something new. So many sequels, prequels and cinematic worlds. 

Gone are the days when filmmakers came up with something original like The Matrix. Wish Hollywood would return to pre-2008, before Marvel, and make something unique.

Was Matrix really that original or was it just a mismatch of previous stuff.

They all have tons of original stuff they want to do. Studios no longer want to make any of it. Financiers no longer want to back it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Rihanna Shares Rare Pics of Her Kids While on a Road Trip","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/rihanna-pics-kids-road-trip/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 14:18:04 GMT","

Rihanna shared a humorous series of images while with her children on a road trip.

The “Umbrella” singer took to Instagram on Thursday, July 3, to show her kids looking slightly unhappy while their famous mom snapped some pics of the two.

“[T]hey so over me on this lil road trip,” Rihanna captioned the images of the two in car seats. 

A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri)

Riot, almost 2, had a pacifier in his mouth and gave the camera a look of being slightly annoyed. Meanwhile, his brother RZA, 3, had his head in a French workbook.

By the last image, Riot pulled down the sun shade so his face would be hidden from the camera.

It was unclear if Rihanna's partner A$AP Rocky was with the Fenty beauty founder. However, he commented on his son's workbook. 

“RZA man learning French,” he wrote along with a trio of laughing emojis. 

The rapper joined Rihanna on the red carpet in Brussels on June 28 ahead of the release of the latest Smurf film. Rihanna voices the role of Smurfette.

Rocky possibly revealed to Entertainment Tonight the sex of baby No. 3.

“How many more? I mean, how big is this family going to get?” the host asked Rocky.

He responded, “We're going to be like the Wayans family, you know? I mean, love is beautiful, and it's just spreading it.”

The host managed to ask if the new baby will be a girl, as the couple already shares two boys.

“It is, man. It is,” Rocky laughed and held up a Smurfette doll. Fans quickly speculated that the new baby must be a girl.

Rocky added, “Right here, right here,” as he held the doll.

The 37-year-old previously told Harpers Bazaar in February that she loves seeing Rocky being a dad to their two children.

“His pureness. His charm. I'm annoyed because my sons sometimes just live for him more than they live for me,” she told the outlet. “And I'm like, ‘Did you know who cooked you? Do you know who pushed you out?' And they love him, but when I see it, oh, it's the best.”

She also previously discussed how difficult it is to have a work-life balance, according to PEOPLE.

“It's very different,” she said in February 2023. “The balance is almost impossible because no matter how you look at it, work is always something that's going to rob you of time with your child. That's the currency now, that's where it goes. The magnitude of how much it weighs.”

Hollywood is in mourning as it says goodbye to beloved actor Julian McMahon. 

Stars poured out their grief on social media, sharing heartfelt tributes to the late actor, many of them coming from co-stars who worked with him on some of his biggest hits.

McMahon succumbed to cancer on July 2, following years of quietly battling the disease. His wife, Kelly McMahon, confirmed the heartbreaking news in a statement to Deadline. The actor was just 56 years old at the time of his passing.

Among those honoring McMahon's legacy were his former “Charmed” co-stars. The actor played Cole Turner in a total of 47 episodes from 2000 to 2005.

Actor Brian Krause, 56, shared a photo of McMahon on his Instagram, remembering their time together on the series.

“Sad day for our ‘Charmed' family!” Krause wrote. “Julian was one of the funniest, devilishly handsome, and kindest souls! Prayers to his family and close friends! He will surely be missed!”

Rose McGowan, 51, shared an illustrated artwork of the actor on her Instagram Stories.

“Oh Julian, you force of brilliance, wild talent, and humor,” she captioned the post. “For you, your family, and loving fans all over the world, I pray comfort.”

Alyssa Milano, who portrayed McMahon's love interest Phoebe Halliwell, said she's “heartbroken” over the actor's untimely passing.

She wrote in part, “Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence. He walked into a room and lit it up—not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding.”

Holly Marie Combs, 51, remembered McMahon through a montage of their moments together on and off the camera.

“One of a kind is an understatement. Your unyielding zest for life and crazy making sense of humor will be sorely missed,” the actress wrote on Instagram. “The joy and laughter you were the direct cause of will always be remembered. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.”

A post shared by Ioan Gruffudd (@ioangruffudd)

Meanwhile, McMahon's “Fantastic Four” co-star, Ioan Gruffudd, also shared a heartwarming tribute for the actor.

“This is terribly sad news about Julian,” he captioned the post. “Even though we played each other's nemeses, there was always so much lightness and laughter working together. Every encounter with him was a joy. It was an honor to be Dr. Richards to his Dr. Doom. My heart goes out to his wife and family. God speed Julian.”

McMahon's “Nip/Tuck” co-star, Kelly Carlson, took to her Instagram and shared an emotional video reacting to the sad news.

“Oh my gosh, I'm completely shocked and saddened by it,” Carlson said. “I didn't know he wasn't well for a while.”

Most recently, McMahon worked with Nicolas Cage in “The Surfer.” Cage, 61, paid tribute to the actor in a statement shared with Deadline.

“Such deeply saddening news. I spent six weeks working with Julian, and he was the most talented of actors,” Cage added. “Our scenes together on ‘The Surfer' were amongst my favorites I have ever participated in, and Julian is one of my favorite people. He was a kind and intelligent man. My love to his family.”

Actor Julian McMahon, best known for his starring roles in “Nip/Tuck“, “Charmed”, “FBI: Most Wanted”, and as Marvel villain Doctor Doom, has died at 56 following a private battle with cancer.

As per Deadline, the Australian actor passed away on July 2 in Clearwater, Florida.

The Australian actor passed away on July 2 in Clearwater, Florida. His wife, Kelly McMahon, confirmed the heartbreaking news in a statement shared with Deadline.

“With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer,” Kelly wrote.

“Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible… We are grateful for the memories.”

McMahon is survived by his wife and daughter, Madison “Maddy” McMahon.

Born in Sydney on July 27, 1968, Julian was the son of Billy McMahon, who briefly served as Prime Minister of Australia from 1971 to 1972.

A post shared by stuck.in.1999 {Sarah} (@stuck.in.1999)

McMahon began his career in modeling before transitioning into acting with the 1989 Australian soap opera “The Power and the Passion”. 

A post shared by @retrodiaries80

He went on to star in “Home and Away” (1990–91) and made his film debut alongside Elliott Gould in “Wet and Wild Summer” in 1992.

Julian's Hollywood career launched with NBC's “Another World” in 1993, followed by a regular role in the crime drama Profiler. 

A post shared by Jane Clifton (@cliffotoo)

However, it was his chilling and charismatic portrayal as the demonic Cole Turner on “Charmed” that made him a fan favorite.

McMahon's breakthrough came when he played the slick, seductive plastic surgeon Dr. Christian Troy on “Nip/Tuck“. The FX hit, created by Ryan Murphy, ran for six seasons and earned McMahon a Golden Globe nomination.

“I'm stunned,” co-star Dylan Walsh told Deadline. “All those years you had my back, and my god, we laughed. My heart is with you. Rest in peace.” 

Julian brought Marvel's infamous villain Victor Von Doom to life in 2005's “Fantastic Four” and its 2007 sequel. He continued his string of major roles with “Premonition”, “RED”, and “Paranoia”.

On TV, he led “FBI: Most Wanted” as Jess LaCroix for three seasons before exiting the show in 2022.

“All of us at Wolf Entertainment are deeply saddened by Julian's passing,” FBI creator Dick Wolf said. “Our condolences go out to his entire family.”

A post shared by Julian Mcmahon (@julianmcmahonofficial)

In a poignant twist of fate, Julian McMahon's final acting credit brought him back to his roots—playing the Australian Prime Minister in Netflix's murder mystery series, “The Residence.”

He also recently starred opposite Nicolas Cage in “The Surfer”, which premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

“He was the most talented of actors,” Cage said. “Julian is one of my favorite people… My love to his family.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Julian McMahon's Legacy Is Anything But Ordinary: From ‘Charmed' to ‘FBI' (and More)","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/julian-mcmahon-iconic-roles-tribute/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 00:13:14 GMT","

Australian born actor, Julian McMahon never played it safe, no matter how big (or small) the screen. Whether he was casting spells, cutting into bodies, or chasing down fugitives, McMahon made a habit of picking bold, often unpredictable roles. And while he might've first hit American screens with soap opera good looks and a brooding charm, the Australian actor quickly proved he had staying power far beyond daytime TV.

McMahon passed away on July 2, 2025, at just 56 years old, according to statements released on July 4. 

“With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer. Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible. We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”

But what about his legacy? It's a genre-hopping, fan-favorite catalog of some of the most wildly entertaining TV of the last few decades. And those fans flocked to the internet (as one does in today's society) to share their thoughts on the tragic news. Here's how this legend will be remembered.

McMahon got his U.S. start as Ian Rain on “Another World,” but his big breakthrough came in 2000 as Cole Turner on “Charmed,” a half-demon, half-lawyer who fell hard for Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). Let's be real: that storyline should've been a disaster. But McMahon somehow turned Cole into a tortured icon; equal parts villain, romantic lead, and chaotic wildcard. Fans still argue about whether he was misunderstood or straight-up toxic (it's both), but either way, he made it memorable.

Then came “Nip/Tuck.” If “Charmed” made him a household name, “Nip/Tuck” made him a TV rebel. As Dr. Christian Troy, McMahon dove headfirst into the twisted, often unhinged world of plastic surgery, vanity, and identity. The FX drama was scandalous, no question; but McMahon grounded it with unexpected vulnerability beneath all that designer smugness. It earned him a Golden Globe nomination and cemented him as a risk-taker.

And let's not forget his run as the Marvel comic character Victor Von Doom in the Fox produced, “Fantastic Four” films (“Fantastic Four” and “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”). While the movies didn't exactly win over critics, McMahon leaned into the arrogance and menace of the iconic villain with just the right level of comic book flair. It's not easy going toe-to-toe with superheroes, but he made Doom deliciously watchable.

In the 2010s and beyond, McMahon shifted gears into more procedural fare. He joined “Runaways” as Jonah, a mysterious, powerful alien with deep ties to the show's family drama, before stepping into a G-man role for “FBI: Most Wanted.” As Jess LaCroix, he led the Fugitive Task Force with steely precision and quiet empathy… a surprisingly restrained performance that added depth to the franchise.

When he exited “FBI: Most Wanted” in 2022, McMahon told TheWrap it was time to “pursue additional creative pursuits.” And while we didn't know it then, that chapter would be one of his last big moments on screen.

McMahon remained a steady presence in entertainment for over three decades, lending his acting talents to over 40 projects (per IMDB), including films like “Premonition,” “Paranoia,” “Faces in the Crowd,” “Bait,” and more recently, “The Surfer.” His net worth was estimated at $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, but his real value came from his versatility; he was never just “the hot guy” or “the bad guy.” He was both, and more; always willing to explore the messy, human gray area in between.

The news broke on July 3rd that Caitlyn Jenner's friend and manager, Sophia Hutchins, had sadly passed away. Naturally, kind words have poured in from those who knew her as well as others online who wanted to express their sympathy. Now, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kathy Hilton has done the same. 

Regarding the death of Sophia Hutchins, TMZ reported that she was pronounced dead on July 2. This resulted from an ATV accident that occurred near Caitlyn Jenner's home in Malibu. She had been driving the ATV on a road and sadly crashed into the bumper of a car. 

Following the accident, the businesswoman tragically fell 350 feet into a ravine. There were no other injuries on the scene. 

Sophia Hutchins' tragic death has caused many to express their sympathy. This includes some who are leaving positive comments on her Instagram page. Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kathy Hilton is one of them. 

She commented on one of Sophia Hutchins' videos on the platform where she spoke about being under the weather. This was from January, and she captioned the video, “VOLUME UP! The people that know me are enjoying the peace and quiet since I never shut up. But I'm sooooo annoyed! LOL! No sore throat. Barely congested. What is going on!”

A post shared by Sophia Hutchins (@hutchins_sophia)

Regarding Kathy Hilton's comment, she said, “Rip Sophia.” Kathy also included four white hearts, a red one, and the praying hands emoji. Kathy doesn't seem to have any ties to Sophia Hutchins or Caitlyn Jenner. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sophia Hutchins and Caitlyn Jenner met in 2015. Notably, they met via Sophia's makeup artist at a photoshoot. Sophia said about their connection to the “Times,” “Having a similar sense of humor, we spent the entire time laughing and ended up meeting for brunch, and we've been great friends ever since.”

She also spoke about becoming Jenner's manager, saying, “I saw nobody was managing her, and there were all these people taking massive advantage. And I was saying, ‘Caitlyn, if I don't step in here and start managing you, you're going to go broke.'”

It's also important to note that Sophia Hutchins was a senior at Pepperdine at the time. She also moved into Caitlyn Jenner's home. Caitlyn spoke about Hutchins in 2019, saying she was her “best friend, family, and confidant.” 

Caitlyn added, “She is one of the top minds in her field. Her value in my life is undeniable. The sky is the limit with her entrepreneurial spirit.”

While fans around the world remember the late Julian McMahon for his iconic roles on screen, his family is mourning the man behind the fame.

McMahon, known for his roles in “Nip/Tuck,” “Charmed,” and “Fantastic Four,” passed away on July 2 following a private battle with cancer. He was 56.

In a statement shared with Deadline, the actor's wife, Kelly McMahon, offered fans a heartfelt glimpse into the man he was beyond the spotlight.

“Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans,” she added. “His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible.”

McMahon leaves behind a loving family, who are now asking for support to grieve their loss privately.

Prior to his current marriage, McMahon had been married twice. His first wife was Australian singer-actress Dannii Minogue, whom he married on January 2, 1994. They got divorced in August 1995.

Then, on December 22, 1999, he married actress Brooke Burns, but they eventually divorced in 2001. They share a daughter, Madison Elizabeth McMahon.

McMahon married his third wife, Kelly Paniagua, in June 2014 after more than a decade of dating. He proposed during a memorable trip to Melbourne in 2013, and a year later, the couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at Lake Tahoe, per Mamamia.

Kelly, who has kept their personal life largely out of the public eye, stayed by the actor's side throughout his final battle with cancer.

McMahon is also survived by his only daughter, Madison Elizabeth McMahon, whom he shared with his ex-wife, actress Brooke Burns.

Madison was born in 2000, a year before her parents finalized their divorce. The father and daughter rarely spoke about each other publicly, but they appeared to have a very loving relationship.

McMahon's daughter, who is now 25 years old, is a yoga enthusiast, teaching yoga classes at Ahanā Miami Yoga Studio. She also appeared to be a nature lover, as seen on her social media posts.

A post shared by Julian Mcmahon (@julianmcmahonofficial)

McMahon was the only son of Sir William McMahon and Lady Sonia McMahon. His father served as the 20th Prime Minister of Australia from March 1971 to December 1972.

Meanwhile, his mother was a celebrated socialite and philanthropist in Australia. Though the actor forged a life and career far from the political spotlight, he's known to be proud of his heritage and spoke highly of his parents' influence on his character.

Interestingly, McMahon played the role of an Australian prime minister in Netflix's “The Residence.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Drake Reflects on Kendrick Lamar Beef Fallout on New Song “What Did I Miss?”: Listen","https://pitchfork.com/news/drake-reflects-on-kendrick-lamar-beef-fallout-on-new-song-what-did-i-miss-listen/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 14:19:59 GMT","

Drake has released a new song called “What Did I Miss?” On the track—co-produced by DJ Lewis, Elyas, FNZ, Gyz, London Cyr, O Lil Angel, Oz, Patron, and Tay Keith—the Toronto musician reflects on his beef with Kendrick Lamar and the people who did and did not stand by him in the feud. Listen to the song below.

Drake opens “What Did I Miss?” by reflecting on the beef and the way it affected those around him: “Askin' me, ‘How did it feel?' Can't say it didn't surprise me/Last time I looked to my right, you n****s was standing beside me/How can some people I love hang around pussies who try me?” Later, in his first verse, Drake raps, “It's love for my brothers and death to a traitor, let's go.”

In his second verse, Drake references Kendrick Lamar's massive Drake-taunting Pop Out concert, in Inglewood, California, that featured performances and appearances from former Drake collaborators, such as YG, Mustard, and Ty Dolla $ign. “I saw bro went to Pop Out with them, but been dick-riding gang since ‘Headlines,'” he raps.

The beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was reignited when Lamar took some subtle shots at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin's “Like That.” Importantly, Future and Metro Boomin were both, at one point in time, prominent Drake collaborators, and their turn against the Canadian artist led to other former friends taking sides in the feud. The Weeknd, for example, appeared on Future and Metro Boomin's We Still Don't Trust You—a potential sign of where his loyalties lied—and Rick Ross shared his own diss track against Drake, “Champagne Moments.”

“What Did I Miss?” is a rare solo single from Drake, since he shared his suite of anti-Lamar tracks in 2024. The new song is released via Drake's OVO Sound. Like all of Drake's recent solo music, it is licensed to Republic Records, a label owned by Universal Music Group (UMG). Drake is federally suing UMG for defamation, claiming that the corporation “waged an unrelenting campaign” to promote “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar's mega-hit that Drake believes is filled with falsities.

	Throughout President Donald Trump's second term, he's used every means possible to promote himself and prop up his agenda in unprecedented ways — even as he pulls apart the government brick by brick.


	Now, it's happening at the embattled Social Security Administration, which manages America's core safety-net program. On Thursday, after Republicans passed Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — legislation that will slash taxes for the rich, rob millions of poor people of their health insurance, and turbocharge the president's militarized deportations — the Social Security Administration sent out an email to an untold number of Americans claiming the bill “reaffirms President Trump's promise to protect Social Security” while offering a range of misinformation about what the new law does. 


	For one thing, the Big Beautiful Bill does not protect Social Security. It will actually “hasten Social Security insolvency by a year,” according to Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. This is one of several claims in the Social Security Administration email that Romig flagged as “highly misleading” in a thread on Bluesky.

	











	However, the bizarre email is just one small part of a sprawling, government-wide project that is already costing American taxpayers well upwards of a billion dollars, as Trump officials prioritize the mass distribution of MAGA propaganda in ways that would likely make many veterans of Trump's first term blush. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	According to a current administration official and another Trump adviser, various offices at different federal departments and agencies spend inordinate amounts of time finding ways to sell even small developments as massive, earth-shaking Trump accomplishments. “Put his name on everything,” is how the administration official characterized the ongoing trend across the federal government, the national Republican Party, and elsewhere.

	The other Trump adviser, who has spoken to the president about this topic, tells Rolling Stone that Trump and his appointees' drive to do this — at the Social Security Administration and beyond — was influenced by the propaganda success that Trump saw during his first administration, when he demanded his name be printed on the Covid-19 stimulus checks sent out at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.


	Less than six months into his second term, we've already seen the Trump administration pour $200 million into ads, at the president's request, thanking him for his immigration crackdown; spend up to $45 million on a military parade that took place on Trump's birthday; and fly B-2 Bombers and other fighter jets over the White House during the signing ceremony for the Big Beautiful Bill on Friday. 


	The move to turn the Social Security Administration into yet another Trump propaganda organ comes as the agency's services degrade — thanks in large part to Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which gutted its workforce, moved to shutter local offices, and sought to implement major technical changes due to baseless concerns about fraud. As a result of DOGE's changes, Social Security recipients in need of assistance may now find themselves stuck on the phone for more than three hours, if their calls aren't disconnected without warning. 


	Amid that ongoing crisis, the Trump administration now has the Social Security Administration touting the Big Beautiful Bill as benefiting seniors in ways it does not.


	“The bill ensures that nearly 90 percent of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits, providing meaningful and immediate relief to seniors who have spent a lifetime contributing to our nation's economy,” the email claimed. It added, “The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”

	Trump put it more succinctly during the White House signing ceremony for the legislation, claiming that the bill achieves “no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.”


	Romig, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, wrote in a thread on Bluesky that the Big Beautiful Bill “did NOT repeal taxation of Social Security” benefits, and that its so-called “senior deduction” has literally “nothing to do with getting Social Security.”

	The AI band The Velvet Sundown, who currently have over 900,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, have officially admitted — in a new revision to their Spotify bio — what was obvious to experts and non-experts alike: their music is, in fact, AI-generated. 


	“The Velvet Sundown is a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence,” the band bio now reads. “This isn't a trick — it's a mirror. An ongoing artistic provocation designed to challenge the boundaries of authorship, identity, and the future of music itself in the age of AI.”The “band” went viral and attracted extensive media coverage after emerging out of nowhere in June and appearing on popular Spotify playlists. They also inspired an apparent hoaxer, using the name Andrew Frelon, who now says he impersonated the band on X and falsely claimed to be a spokesperson for the band in interactions with the media, including a phone interview with Rolling Stone. His elaborate, days-long hoax was aimed at testing the media, he claimed in a lengthy Medium post.

	The Spotify bio goes on to say, “All characters, stories, music, voices and lyrics are original creations generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools employed as creative instruments. Any resemblance to actual places, events or persons – living or deceased – is purely coincidental and unintentional. Not quite human. Not quite machine. The Velvet Sundown lives somewhere in between.”

	Glenn McDonald, a former “data alchemist” for Spotify, told Rolling Stone earlier this week that The Velvet Sundown's popularity there is likely because the streaming service now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, while also increasingly moving away from human-driven playlist selections toward algorithms that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.”

	Garret K. Woodward



	I have approximately the time it takes for I'm With Her to pile into a sprinter van backstage at Colorado's Telluride Bluegrass Festival and drive to their late-night show at the nearby Sheridan Opera House to conduct a fast-paced interview.


	But, in truth, three and a half minutes of listening to songs like “Ancient Light,” “Year After Year,” or “Mother Eagle (Sing Me Alive)” is all you need to grasp the appeal of the supergroup trio. Their innate gifts for harmony, melody, and songwriting make their songs, especially those on the new album Wild and Clear and Blue, all but irresistible.


	“We've just lived so much life together, much more life together than we had on our first record,” the band's Sarah Jarosz tells Rolling Stone. “This [album], we know what our sound is, and now what do we want to say?”


	At 11:30 p.m., the group emerged behind a lone microphone at the intimate 1913 opera house on North Oak Street. The gorgeous “Year After Year” hushed the audience, focusing them squarely on members Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan, and Sara Watkins.

	











	“Things will never be the same/as they were when we were young,” Watkins sang. “Let's welcome the change/no song unsung.”


	“I love singing with them so much,” Watkins says of her bandmates. “One of the main things I remember from that first meetup was just how easy it was to communicate.”


	The initial meetup occurred right around the corner from the opera house in nearby Elks Park. It was during the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival. The three musicians were each performing at the gathering with various projects and were asked to host a workshop in the park.

	











	“It just happened that the three of us were the ones who could work something up beforehand,” Jarosz recalls. “We met up behind the main stage earlier that day and that was the first time we sang together. That harmony was so magical.”


	“The thing I like most about our band is that it's not always the same blend. Who's singing high? Who's singing low? Who's singing harmony?” O'Donovan says. “So, you end up having all these color combinations. It's like we have this whole box of paints and we're constantly thinking of new colors to make.”

	The seamless blend of ancient tones and soaring voices is what elevates I'm With Her, and Wild and Clear and Blue, in the roots-music world. The members are well-aware of their chemistry.


	“There's this ease of working together,” Watkins says. “It's just a very natural working environment.”


	While I'm With Her may have some elements in common with other harmony-based bands, like Crosby, Stills & Nash, there's none of the rock & roll baggage and expectations that plagued some of the greats.


	“Once we decided to become a band, it's kind of what we always hoped it could be,” Jarosz says. “This band we could return to when we wanted to, and not something we had to do. I think that's why it's so enjoyable, because it's this bonus musical experience.”


	The day before the opera house gig, O'Donovan is sitting in the lobby of the Camel's Garden Hotel in downtown Telluride. Later that afternoon, the trio will hop onto the festival's large main stage, their melodies radiating out into the towering box canyon surrounding the town. But, for now, O'Donovan is reflecting on the origins of the group.

	“We'd all been friends for many years,” O'Donovan says. “We sang through a couple of songs and it was so cool. And right after the workshop, Chris Thile texted.”


	Thile, frontman for the Punch Brothers, asked the group if they wanted to open for him at the opera house that night. It was the Sunday evening sendoff for the festival, a tradition Thile and his bandmates have held for several years. (To note, Watkins is part of Nickel Creek with Thile, and O'Donovan and Jarosz were regular performers on Thile's radio variety show Live From Here.)


	“We didn't have any repertoire,” O'Donovan chuckles. “We got to the gig early. We went into the bathroom and worked up a bunch of songs.” Among them, Bill Monroe's “Blue Moon of Kentucky” and Watkin's “Long Hot Summer Days.”

	











	“It was electric,” O'Donovan says. “The next day, Sara Watkins texted, ‘I feel like this should be a thing.'”


	The group released their debut album, See You Around, in 2018. They won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song for “Call My Name” in 2020. All the while, they played strings of rapturous gigs.


	“I'm constantly surprised by how it still feels so creative,” O'Donovan says. “And we're still thinking of new ways to change up older songs, play with dynamics, add little sections, little fills here and there.”

	Back in the lobby, O'Donovan's cell phone vibrates. Jarosz and Watkins are in front of the hotel, ready to go for a quick hike together before their set. Exiting the hotel, the group disappears down San Juan Avenue toward the mountains cradling the community.


	“People have passed on. New lives have come into this world. Families have grown,” Jarosz says. “And we've all kind of experienced that together. That richness of life and grief and all of the above — all of that fed these songs.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Did the ‘Deep State' invent the UFO craze?","https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/did-the-deep-state-invent-the-ufo-craze/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 13:00:05 GMT","

The last few times I wrote about unidentified flying objects, in the spring and fall of 2023, there had been a series of curious happenings — reveals and leaks and would-be whistleblowing — that convinced me that some group of people inside our government wanted Americans to believe that the national security state had secret knowledge about UFOs. 

This was a deliberately circumspect take on an extremely weird situation, which had three notable features. First, the kinds of people coming forward with claims and the footage and accounts of mysterious flying objects being publicized (in The New York Times, among other places) were more serious-seeming, more difficult to eye-roll away, than what we'd seen in prior eras of UFO enthusiasm. 

Second, the sudden bipartisan interest from senators and congressmen — not just eccentrics in the House of Representatives but also figures such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, who was then the majority leader, and Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. — was real and substantial, suggesting that a bit more was visible behind the curtain than we knew. 

But third, at the same time, all the leaks and insider accounts fell consistently short of what UFO believers call, expectantly, “disclosure” — offering enough to feed speculation about secret government programs, but not nearly enough to overcome a basic skeptical default. 

At the time, I argued that all the high-level political and media interest was removing the impediment that many believers argue stands between us and the truth — the alleged fear, among those with secret knowledge, of being jailed or killed if they speak out. If would-be whistleblowers with national security backgrounds such as David Grusch and Luis Elizondo were hale and well (and in Elizondo's case, publishing a bestselling book), then surely there was no better time to deliver the supposedly world-altering truth. 

And if nobody stepped forward — well, you should be more inclined to assume that the truth was never really out there.

Eighteen months later, as you may have noticed, no Lockheed Martin employees have brought forward detailed plans of the alien spacecraft hidden in their corporate vault, and no former heads of the Department of Energy have confessed to keeping a great bureaucratic secret hidden since the dawn of the Atomic Age. Instead we've had more interviews and first-person accounts but no actual disclosure — even of the Jeffrey Epstein or JFK files variety — from a Trump administration that includes a few UFO-curious figures in its ranks. 

And now, in a pair of articles last month by two Wall Street Journal reporters, we've been given one of the more comprehensive attempts at a non-extraterrestrial explanation of where some of the weirdness originates. Relying heavily on interviews with Sean Kirkpatrick, who ran the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, a Pentagon task force investigating the UFO evidence, the reporters reveal several possible mythology-forging projects inside the military-industrial complex: a combination of deliberate psychological operations aimed at covering up top secret technologies, possible bureaucratic pranks and hazing rituals that accidentally made midlevel personnel into UFO believers, and top secret experiments that the government allowed its own personnel to interpret as possible close encounters. 

The Journal reporters also follow Kirkpatrick through investigations that did not pan out: A purported piece of extraterrestrial material turned out to have prosaic origins, a claim about Russia reverse-engineering alien technology probably originated in the Russian version of our own UFO disinformation, and a larger pattern emerged where “evidence to support the whistleblowers' theories appeared to vanish just as Kirkpatrick got close to it.” 

What's useful about the Journal stories is that they're more capacious than some prior debunking explanations. For instance, certain skeptics pinned the recent wave of UFO-related governmental signaling on true believers who were inserted into the national security loop by Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada (a UFO believer of some sort himself), and who then traded on those credentials to legitimate their theories. But as far as I could tell, this explanation didn't do justice to the apparent scale of UFO beliefs within the government. 

Whereas what the Journal reporters suggest is that UFO belief could have been seeded in multiple different ways over many decades — creating not just a small group of obsessives circulating the same wild theories but also a broader culture in which both deception and misapprehension are at work, the former feeding the latter and the latter encouraging the former, such that parts of the national security state are conditioned to use “aliens” as cover for their secret operations and other parts are conditioned to assume there must be something real there. 

This portrait of “deep state” deception and delusion hardly resolves the UFO question. It doesn't explain the weird aerial encounters that helped touch off the current age of interest — encounters which are, as far as I can tell from public and private information, still taken quite seriously as an unresolved problem by defense and intelligence officials. Nor does it tell us how to understand the phenomenon of personal paranormal encounters, the UFO-as-religious-experience zone where “aliens” seem to play angelic or demonic or faerie-adjacent parts. 

Nor should anyone assume that the debunking explanations filtered through Kirkpatrick and other sources to the Journal are themselves trustworthy. It's certainly interesting that military sources are now saying that famous UFO incidents at nuclear bases in the 1960s, where glowing orange orbs appeared and nuclear weapons were disabled, were actually top secret tests of the effects of electromagnetic pulses on America's nuclear arsenals. Should the people who actually experienced those incidents and spent years trying to figure out what happened take this new explanation as gospel? I would say probably not. 

But parsimony is important. It could be that sometimes the military-industrial complex uses UFOs as cover stories for secret projects, and sometimes uses secret projects as cover stories for actual encounters with nonhuman intelligence; it could be that the Journal's military sources intend to pile disinformation atop disinformation. But when you combine the evidence that UFO stories frequently have been used as disinformation with the failure of would-be whistleblowers to make good on their promise of proof, it's understandable if you assume that any given insider story of secret UFO knowledge probably originates in cover-ups and psy-ops. As opposed to the “X-Files” possibility that all the elements of the UFO question are intimately connected, that some group in the government knows what the strange aerial encounters represent and how they fit together with abduction narratives and, by the way, also has an alien spacecraft in a hidden hangar somewhere. 

But defaulting to the psy-op explanation doesn't just leave a set of weird UFO-related phenomena unexplained. It also leaves an obvious question open and unanswered. If many stories of insider UFO knowledge originate in deliberate disinformation projects and we have been living through a veritable golden age of strange leaks and tales of insider knowledge, then what, exactly, might this era's particular psy-op be intended to conceal?

In the past fifteen years, five missions have returned samples of extraterrestrial material to Earth for analysis. These included missions that rendezvoused with Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), like the Hayabusa 1 and 2 and the OSIRIS-REx missions, and the Chang'e-5 and 
-6 missions, which brought back samples from the far side of the Moon. In the coming years, 
China plans to return samples from 469219 Kamoʻoalewa with its Tianwen-2 mission. With all the extraterrestrial materials being returned to Earth for analysis, one could argue that we are entering a ""golden age of sample-return missions."" 

As a result, efforts are underway to create facilities where scientists can safely contain, curate, and analyze these samples. At the University of Leicester's Leicester Space Park, scientists are working on a Double-Walled Isolator (DWI) to store and analyze extraterrestrial materials safely. This could include future samples returned from Mars, which NASA and other space agencies are planning to do through crewed or robotic missions expected to happen during the late 2020s or early 2030s. 

The DWI is essentially a miniature version of a clean room and is designed to keep materials at a high level of containment and cleanliness. This is ensured by an inert gas environment and state-of-the-art robotics (an arm and other manipulator technologies) to move samples between containment, an optical microscope, and a Raman spectrometer. These measures minimize interactions between scientists, prevent cross-contamination, and preserve sample integrity so scientists can obtain accurate results when conducting analyses. 

As Andrew Cheney, DWI QM Project Manager at Space Park Leicester, said in a University of Leicester press release: 

The SRR is a major milestone for the project that shows that we've fully understood the customer need, and translated that into a set of requirements to proceed with confidence into the design phase. Generating a good set of requirements is arguably the hardest part of any project and takes a lot of research, analysis, and industry expertise. 

Now [that] we have that agreed baseline, we look forward to the design phase and the many, many challenges it will bring for this unique piece of equipment. We have a relatively compressed period now to push a concept through to detail design and manufacture. The dedicated qualification phase will involve simulating end-to-end curatorial and scientific processing of martian analogue samples at SPL.

This €5 million ($5.89 million) project was initially developed for the NASA/ESA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission and builds on previous work where the Leicester team created a design for a prototype DWI. In the new phase, the Leicester team will be collaborating with experts from several British universities and institutes, including the Open University, the Francis Crick Institute, Imperial College London, and the Natural History Museum. They've also partnered with Extract Technologies, a UK-based manufacturer of advanced isolator technologies, to provide a detailed design for the main isolator and manufacture it. Said John Holt, DWI QM Principal Investigator at Space Park Leicester:

Whether or not an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft brings samples back from Mars, the Double Walled Isolator (DWI) is a key UK technology that enables planetary scientists to scrutinise returned rocks to understand the Martian environment and if there is microscopic evidence for life on the red planet. The milestone review [SRR] we have just conducted carefully looked at the complex needs of scientists to ensure we design an ultra-clean system that allows them to handle the precious samples and use a wide range of analytical techniques to unlock the secrets within each piece of rock. 

The facility recently passed its System Requirements Review (SSR) with the European Space Agency (ESA) and is now proceeding to the Design and Qualification phase. Currently, there are four missions in the works to return samples from Mars, including NASA's proposed crewed missions to Mars, China's Tianwen-3, JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX), and Russia's Mars-Grunt mission.

Mark Sheppard brought Crowley to life on the show starting with the fifth season. He remained with it until Season 12, when he was written off with a dramatic death. 

The actor later revealed that he wasn't thrilled with the way that his character evolved. ""Once they decided they needed to do something different [with the direction of the show], they tried to get rid of me without telling me that they were going to get rid of me,"" he reflected, via Looper.

One of the world's most successful celebrity psychics has opened up about what it is really like to talk to dead people.

He's one of the most successful psychic mediums of all time. 

A man who — during a career spanning more than 30 years — has captivated audiences globally, thanks to his hit TV show Crossing Over, numerous best-selling books and a string of sellout stage shows around the world. 

During this time John Edward has brought a fresh, honest and thought provoking attitude to the world of psychic phenomena, as well as becoming the go-to psychic for some of Hollywood's biggest names, from Oprah to Kim Kardashian. And while he's the poster boy for psychics now, when he was first told that he had these otherworldly abilities, John was the ultimate cynic.

A reluctant teenage psychic

Raised on Long Island, New York, signs of John's abilities were apparent from an early age with family members often remarking on his uncanny knowledge of past events and family history.

“When I had the reading that put me on my path I thought the woman was crazy,” he tells news.com.au. 

“I didn't even have any interest in the subject, whatsoever.

“In fact, I was a cynic — the biggest! My dad was a military guy and this was not something that he was a fan of, so I adopted some of his condescending, sarcastic manner towards it.

“I was the one heckling and pulling apart the readings that I'd see at my grandma's house.”

However, after accepting his gift and honing it, John soon realised that — in addition to being psychic — he could also talk to the dead.

“That part kicked in two years later around the age of 17,” he says of his medium abilities. “I had a very vivid premonition about my uncle passing — he was only 52 at the time. I remember trying to stop it and I couldn't, which was my first experience of realising that I can't stop what I know is going to happen. 

“Right before he passed, I started to get many names during readings and I gradually realised that these names belonged to people who were all dead. I didn't understand what was happening, but it was like a switch had been flicked on.”

Working with the FBI

John published his first book in 1998 and then, three short years later, he was catapulted to stardom via his Crossing Over TV show, which was broadcast to millions. But away from the bright lights of the TV studio and the glossy magazines that interviewed him, the psychic had a secret sideline: he was helping FBI agent, Bob Hilland, solve cold cases.

“In 1998 this FBI guy came to me under the guise of a case,” he recalls. “In reality he had heard me on local radio, which I was on a lot. 

“And it used to anger him that they were giving me airtime because he felt that I wasn't legitimate and that I was taking advantage of people. So he took it upon himself to take me down.

“He came with a real case and, very quickly within that session, I was able to give him accurate information on the case that I couldn't have possibly have known. 

“I then I wound up reading for him and I gave him information that he didn't know about his own actual family.”

What followed was a working relationship that spanned more than 25 years and numerous cases.

“Bob would call me up and say something like: ‘I'm working on a case and there's a woman that's missing.'” he explains. “And that's all he would give me. And then my spirit guides would come in and they would give me information.”

Catching a killer

While the pair collaborated across many cases it was the infamous ‘John Smith' murders that would come to define their time together. 

Committed by John David Smith III — who was convicted in 2001 for the murder of his first wife whose dismembered remains were found in a box and later indicted for the murder of his second wife — he murders were unsolved for decades until John began to assist on the case. 

And it's this investigation that is being charted in a new book co-authored between John and Bob entitled, Chasing Evil.

“I'm only telling people now as enough time has passed that my life will no longer be threatened by some of the people connected to the cases,” says John. “Those people are behind bars now.”

Slated for release in September, the book reveals for the first time how a sceptical FBI agent reached out to a famous psychic for help on the baffling case. But, when it comes to his technique for psychic sleuthing, how does it work?

“When I'm in the zone I've already meditated, prayed and put myself in the position of protecting my energy psychically, then spirits will give me words, thoughts, images and feelings,” John explains of the process. 

“It's kind of like a psychic sign language — I have to put the pieces together and figure out what the message is.

“Bob would call me and say, for example: ‘okay, I'm going to be doing the polygraph on this case — give me the insights that's going to help break the guy,'” he says. 

“I am very clear: I didn't solve anything. Bob solved his cases. All I did was give him insights and how he worked with those insights helped him to successfully gain outcomes.

“I hope that this book gives people the window into possibilities so that if there are other psychics or mediums or people out there that can utilise their abilities to help law enforcement, it'll be taken with credibility and serious and seriously.”

The downsides of the gift

As you might expect, being immersed in the disturbing world of crime and killers can take its toll.

“When you're navigating a serial killer case and you're being taken on a journey of a timeline of what's happened you get a window into the mind of someone that can do something so pathologically dark,” he admits. 

“It shows you, or showed me, the malleability of the human personality when they're that twisted. I wouldn't say that it's a dark energy … I would say that it's more of a pathology. Like these are people that are broken. These are people that have psychologically or physiologically have something pathologically wrong with them to be able to do some of the things that they've done.”

As the original ‘celebrity psychic' John faced “stress, accusations and death threats” during his small screen heyday. 

But, despite decades having passed since calling time on Crossing Over, the psychic says that he's still guarded in his personal life.

“I'm still very guarded,” he admits. “My family circle is very tight knit, which tends to lead to anxiety about this book coming out because I don't want any retaliatory stuff coming at me. So that's exactly where the core anxiety is coming from.

You know, I've seen too much. I know too much.”

Gearing up for an Australian tour

Away from the limelight and fanfare, John's real life mission is helping grieving people across the world by bringing messages of comfort and hope from their departed loved ones through his global tours. And at the top of his list is Australia.

“My love of Australia is no secret,” he says. “It's my favourite destination and I can't wait to get back there. I almost felt like I'm cheating on my country,” he chuckles. “Because I have such a feeling of being connected here. The intersection with the audience is amazing in Australia — the energy here and the community vibe is so unique.”

His most terrifying encounter

As John's tour of Australia is in the midst of spooky season our chat turns to Halloween — and the related ghosts, ghouls and things that go bump in the night.

Turns out, despite the fact that the celebrity psychic has made a career out of talking to the dead, it doesn't mean that he isn't scared of spooks.

“In my 30 years of doing this, I've only had one experience where I truly believe the house as haunted,” he says. 

“In 1987, my cousin moved from the city to the same suburb as me. I remember the first time I went to his new house, I arrived needing the bathroom and my cousin told me to use one downstairs as there was construction going on elsewhere. 

“I went into the room and literally had performance anxiety — I couldn't pee! I felt like I had four people watching me, all of whom wanted me to leave.

“That was just the beginning. Weird stuff started to happen in the house: noises at night, glass breaking, things moving. You could write a book on our experiences.

During my last visit, I was alone and I remember sitting down near the fireplace and looking at a battery-operated musical clown ornament. I picked it up and saw that there were no batteries in it. Anyway, seconds after putting it down, the clown started to play music. I ran out of there and told my cousin that I wouldn't be coming back!”

A women's only nightclub is taking this Aussie city by storm – cheap drinks, packed dance floors, and not a man in sight.

From supermarkets, to pubs and sitting in traffic, these are the unwritten rules every local lives by – and breaking them could see you cop a death stare.

July 5 2025, Published 1:00 p.m. ET

Adult star Bonnie Blue has found herself at the center of a truly wild internet rumor claiming she is secretly a 26-year-old man who once went by the name ""Tom"". 

However, this sensational storyline isn't fazing the adult film icon, who boldly stated she ""will take anyone"" who questions her gender, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

Bonnie Blue has broken her silence on rumors she is a man.

The actress, born Tia Billinger, has been making headlines lately — not just for her adult film career but also for planning a public sex stunt in London.

Despite keeping a low profile initially, Bonnie has finally decided to address the odd rumor that has captured the interest of social media users far and wide. 

During an appearance on Stand Out TV, host PK Humble opened the conversation with the awkward inquiry, saying: ""I read somewhere that someone said you're a man."" 

Without missing a beat, Bonnie responded: ""I read that too; apparently, my name was Tom.""

When pressed about whether she'd be open to ""getting down and dirty"" with trans individuals, she shrugged off the controversy, joking: ""Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. There's nothing I can't handle; I will take anyone and everyone.""



A TikTok channel titled ""Celebquotesdaily"" claimed ""Bonnie Blue is definitely a man"" and shared a number of images in an attempt to back their allegation.

In the video, an AI voice claimed: ""It all started just a couple of months ago when photos began circulating in a private Discord group. Pictures that were never meant to be public. They showed Bonnie as a teenager with short hair wearing a high school sports jersey with a male name printed across the chest.

""At first, no one knew if the photos were real, but the internet did what it always does: dug deeper. Before long, someone unearthed old local newspaper clippings from 2011 about a boy from Alabama who won a statewide debate competition. The name didn't match, but the face did.

""Bonnie stayed silent; she kept posting as if nothing was happening, sharing videos of the old southern house she was restoring. A grand, creaky place passed down from her grandmother, full of pillars, peeling wallpaper and secrets, but the pressure kept building. The comments grew more aggressive, the speculation more relentless, and when the leak finally made it to major TikTok channels and Reddit threads, she knew there was no way to stay quiet.""

The adult star seemed unphased by the online speculation.

The comments on TikTok highlighted how the quick flashes of the images in the video appeared to be ""clearly AI-generated"".

One user commented: ""My fear is that I cannot become too funny or famous bc someone will find a picture of my brother and start this rumor.""

Another wrote: ""So we're just using Grok and OpenAI images to back our conspiracy theories now? We're cooked.""

A third person said: ""I do appreciate how this trans fearmongering TikTok theory video, which claims with complete certainty that Bonnie is a man, still opts to use her correct pronouns. She/Her.""

Bonnie Blue garnered almost a million followers on OnlyFans.

Blue, who had nearly 900,000 subscribers on OnlyFans, was banned from the X-rated platform after she promoted her ""petting zoo"" stunt.

The 26-year-old planned to sleep with 2,000 people while tied up in a glass box before the platform kicked her off their site.

Blue told news outlets that she thought her permanent ban was unwarranted, saying: ""It's clearly unfair, and it's frustrating because I've been singled out, and it's just because I get more press and more views.""

K-pop label YG Entertainment Inc.'s revival hopes are set for a boost as its biggest act, Blackpink, returns to the spotlight with a new song after a nearly two-year hiatus.

The girl band will kick off their long-anticipated comeback at a sold-out show at Goyang Stadium, near Seoul, on Saturday. The performance of their new single Jump marks a critical turning point — not just for the quartet, but for YG, which is looking to reignite growth after a year of declining revenue without its most valuable act.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Israel covered up Iranian hits on military sites","https://www.rt.com/news/621037-israel-covered-attacks-military-sites/","Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:19:00 GMT","

Israel concealed that Iranian missiles hit several key military sites across the country during the recent 12-day war, The Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing radar data.

The data, provided to the British paper by Oregon State University researchers who track bomb damage using satellite radar, indicates that six Iranian missiles hit five military facilities in the north, south, and center of Israel, including a major air base, an intelligence gathering center, and a logistics base. The extent of the reported damage is unclear.

However, the hits were not publicly reported due to heavy military censorship, according to the report. When pressed on the issue, the Israel Defense Forces, declined to comment, only saying that “all relevant units maintained functional continuity throughout the operation.”

Analysis cited by The Telegraph suggests that Israeli and US air defenses generally performed well, intercepting most of the incoming fire, although the share of missiles that penetrated through Israeli defenses rose to about 16% by the seventh day. The paper noted that this could have been linked with Israeli attempts to conserve ammunition, improved tactics by Iran, or the deployment of more advanced and harder-to-intercept weaponry.

The conflict began on June 13 when Israel launched airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear infrastructure, top Iranian commanders, and military sites, triggering retaliation by Tehran. Israeli officials reported 29 deaths and over 3,200 injuries, while Iran estimated over 900 deaths and 4,700 injuries.

The US eventually joined the conflict by deploying heavy bombers against key Iranian nuclear sites. After a ceasefire was reached, both sides proclaimed victory.

The hostilities started after Iran declined a US demand to abandon its enrichment capabilities, which Washington believes could enable Tehran to create nuclear weapons. Iran has denied plans to create an atomic weapon, insisting that its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

Former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of rape in the United Kingdom. The Ghanaian international denies any wrongdoing.

Ghanaian international soccer player Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual abuse, police in the United Kingdom said on Friday.

Partey, whose contract with Premier League club Arsenal expired on Monday, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on August 5.

The charges against the 32-year-old footballer have been brought by three women and refer to incidents which allegedly took place between 2021 and 2022.

British police said they had been investigating since February 2022.

""Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward,"" said Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy of London's Metropolitan Police. ""We would ask anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone who has information, to speak with our team.""

Partey's laywer, Jenny Wiltshire, said her client ""denies all charges against him"" and had ""cooperated fully"" with police.

""He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name,"" she added.

Defensive midfielder Partey was born and grew up in the town of Krobo Odumase, just outside Accra, the capital of Ghana.

He moved to Spain in 2012 where he went on to make 188 appearances for Atletico Madrid, scoring 16 goals and winning the Europa League in 2018. He received a La Liga winners medal in 2021 despite having moved to Arsenal earlier in the season for €50 million (around $59 million).

He made 167 appearances for the North London club, scoring nine goals as Arsenal finished second in the Premier League for the last three seasons.

Partey made his international debut for Ghana in June 2016 and has since played 53 times for the Black Stars, scoring 15 goals and being named Ghanaian player of the year in 2017 and 2018.
