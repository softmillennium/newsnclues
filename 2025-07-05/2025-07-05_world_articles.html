                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits. Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. At last week's NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and, at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen displays of shakedown politics in modern history. Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn the most in efforts to gain Trump's favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,” and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like a courtier at the Sun King's court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn't previously been seen in U.S. relations with its allies. Trump demanded that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security This would be manifested through massively increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers. The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds, and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K. shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise still further. This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could keep their heating on during the cold winter months. Much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems. Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. As a result, much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund” that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. While Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up. Caught between Putin's expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin — and Trump's transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe's leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he would encourage Putin's forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they aren't meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO's member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously destructive toward Europe and Canada's social compacts. Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense contractors; but given the U.S.'s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry, it's a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot of it will. All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. But it won't happen without resistance: Stamer's announcement immediately triggered opposition from anti-nuclear groups. But there are signs that European populaces won't uncritically rally around Trump's demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases — and while Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The best route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups. The best route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. In the last few months, we witnessed two violent attacks on pro-Israel events organized by American Jewish groups, by perpetrators who shouted “Free Palestine!” as they acted. The attacks — which killed two young Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., and severely burned participants in a “Run for Their Lives” event in Boulder, Colorado, in support of Israeli hostages — have been roundly condemned as antisemitic by politicians and Jewish groups, even though both attackers were vocal about targeting Zionists and seemingly motivated by anger at Israel's actions in Gaza, rather than hatred toward Jews. Yet, despite an understandable craving for security, does resorting to increased surveillance, policing, and more severe crackdowns on protests actually make Jews safer? Never miss the news and analysis you care about. After the murders of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky in D.C., the Zionist organization JewBelong put up billboards stating, “Make no mistake: if you screamed ‘Free Palestine' you helped pull the trigger” and “When will you learn? Zionists have long asserted that “antisemitism on the left” is under-reported and not taken seriously, along with claiming that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism” (another pithy JewBelong billboard). Yet over the past decade, this has morphed into the notion that progressivism itself, not just pro-Palestine activism, is inherently dangerous to Jews. We hear this in Anti-Defamation League (ADL) CEO Jonathan Greenblatt's June 6th speech to an assembly of Republican Attorneys General, quoted in the Jewish Forward, in which he claimed that “the radical left” harbored the “real death threat” to Jews. They are the same people; these are the same kind of nihilists.” Hughes is less doctrinaire, but insists that “the rise in antisemitic attacks in recent years comes from all forms of ideologies and extremism — far right, far left, single issue.” It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger. What should we on the left make of Hughes and Greenblatt's assertions? Antisemitism — along with anti-Blackness and Islamophobia — is definitively baked into right-wing ideology. Antisemitism, like anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, has deep roots in white Christian nationalism, an ideology that, by definition, considers nonwhite, non-Christians to be outsiders. Every major study of contemporary antisemitism, particularly antisemitic violence, ascribes it primarily to right-wing white nationalists. A 2022 survey, Antisemitic Attitudes Across the Ideological Spectrum, commissioned by Tufts University, concluded: Even when primed with information that most U.S. Jews have favorable views toward Israel – a country disfavored by the ideological left – respondents on the left rarely support statements such as that Jews have too much power or should be boycotted. Clearly there is a connection between the attacks and support for Palestine. There is deep frustration at the lack of attention to Palestinian suffering and continued U.S. backing for Israel's genocide in Gaza and apartheid policies. But who is trying to distinguish between Jews and Zionists: the left, which includes anti-Zionist Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace; or the right, and mainstream Jewish institutions which insist that there is no daylight between Judaism and Zionism, and call anti-Zionist Jews “fake” or “self-hating” Jews? It is this Zionist, right wing narrative conflating all Jews with the State of Israel, and thus with Israel's war crimes, that is placing Jews in danger. We hear it in Republican Nancy Mace's patronizing dismissal of CodePink's Medea Benjamin: “I love Jews! Yes, white nationalism is fully ingrained in American government and systems. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and House Speaker Mike Johnson all maintain connections to the movement, forming what the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism has called a triangle of influence. While these men are all ardent Zionists, they are also connected to deeply antisemitic institutions; their reasons for supporting Israel have less to do with Jewish welfare than millenarian prophecies that see the ingathering of the Jews in Israel as a necessary step towards the apocalypse. What is most sinister is how these two tragic attacks have been exploited by the right to criminalize and subdue not only Palestinians, but immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor. When Greenblatt identifies Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and “Islamist groups” as part of this leftwing cabal, he is telling Jews that to survive they must turn against people of color, progressive movements, and the poor. This blinkered view not only traps the Jewish community in a funhouse of paranoia and isolation, it also threatens other marginalized communities and deprives us all of desperately needed solidarity. Safety plans devised by groups like ADL and the Jewish Federations rely heavily on working with police. In its guide to protecting religious and communal institutions, the ADL suggests that congregations volunteer their sites to serve as locations for local SWAT teams to train, with no consideration for how this may affect Black, Latino, Muslim, or LGBTQ members or neighbors. Take the police “antisemitism” training for New York City officers provided by Combat Antisemitism and the Program on Extremism, which listed the keffiyeh and the watermelon as examples of images that “incite hatred, violence, or discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities.” Hughes's description of the Boulder and D.C. attackers as “self-radicalized” is disturbingly similar to the discredited Countering Violent Extremism programs, which focused on infiltrating mosques and Muslim community centers to identify “self-radicalized” Islamist terrorists, creating a broad net of surveillance and repression and fear in Muslim communities. A better route to Jewish community safety lies in building solidarity with all marginalized groups: people of color, Muslims, immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and those with disabilities. There are historical precedents: in the 1970s, Jews for Urban Justice released a manifesto titled “The Oppression and Liberation of the Jewish People in America,” outlining their ideology as an anti-racist, anti-war, Jewish socialist organization. This sounds very similar to the Jews For Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) community safety pledge, which suggests: Start or deepen conversations with your community about what safety can look like beyond the narrow confines of police and militarization. The Community Safety Campaign (CSC), a national project led by a multiracial, cross-class, multidenominational, and gender-diverse team of Jewish organizers, political educators, researchers, healers, and spiritual leaders, recently produced a 100 page guide for Jewish communities and partners seeking to transform their safety practices. CSC helps congregations build community safety plans and teams based on political education about antisemitism, antiracism, white & Christian nationalism, and transformative justice. These efforts have one thing in common: They do not look at antisemitism in isolation, but recognize its connections to all forms of racism and oppression. This is the approach taken by PARCEO's (Participatory Action Research Center for Education Organizing) “Antisemitism from a Framework of Collective Liberation” curriculum, which points to the historical commonalities and parallels between the oppression of Jews and that of other marginalized populations. Its leaders chanted, “Jews will not replace us,” insisting that Jews are an evil cabal infecting white America by supporting inferior races. Unlike “radical leftists,” these people are actually in power — and they are actually a threat to Jews, unlike keffiyeh-wearing students at Columbia University. We must give equal value to Black, Brown, queer, and Palestinian safety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hopes that pause to the killing may be agreed were boosted despite 24 Palestinians being killed including 10 seeking aid Israel has continued to launch waves of airstrikes in Gaza, hours after Hamas said it was ready to start talks “immediately” on a US-sponsored proposal for a 60-day ceasefire. Saturday was relatively “calmer” after days of intense bombardment, aid officials and residents in Gaza said, although 24 Palestinians were killed, including 10 people seeking humanitarian aid, according to hospital officials. Airstrikes struck tents in the Mawasi coastal area in southern Gaza, killing seven, including a Palestinian doctor and his three children, according to medics at a nearby hospital. Israel's security cabinet was due to meet after sundown on Saturday but officials in Jerusalem said there was “no guarantee” that ministers would make a decision on the Hamas response to the ceasefire deal. The GHF, a US-supported private organisation that began handing out food parcels in Gaza last month, has been mired in controversy, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying it was “inherently unsafe” and that it was “killing people”. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks in shooting or shelling by the IDF while travelling to GHF sites or gathering in large crowds to get aid from convoys brought into Gaza by the UN that are often stopped and looted. Aid workers in Gaza have called again for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that fuel stocks for NGOs are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, much of the health system and communications across the territory. Power supplies in Gaza rely primarily on large quantities of diesel for generators. “We are pretty much down to about half a day's worth. When that is gone, everything has to shut down,” said one humanitarian worker in Deir al-Balah. Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade on Gaza after the most recent ceasefire collapsed in March, which has only been partly lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. No fuel has been permitted to enter, and supplies that still exist in Gaza are often in Israeli-controlled areas or combat zones and so inaccessible. Israel wants to maintain a system of distribution independent from the UN or other countries. Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday, Trump said he was optimistic and suggested there “could be a Gaza deal” next week. Analysts said this could mean lengthy delays before an agreement is reached. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory's ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Dnipropetrovsk Oblast lies further west and has not seen significant Russian incursions, it is frequently targeted with missile, drone, and aerial bomb strikes. Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. "The situation around Dachne is pretty intense," DeepState wrote on Telegram, referring to the nearby front-line settlement in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have deployed reinforcements, but Russian units, relying on numerical advantage and constant infantry assaults, have breached some defenses in the area, DeepState said. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Novoukrainka was captured as early as June 29, though that assertion was not independently confirmed at the time. On July 2, Ukraine dismissed Russian claims of advancing into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, calling them disinformation. It said that a small Russian reconnaissance unit briefly entered the village of Dachne, took photos with a Russian flag, and was then "eliminated." Ukrainian military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said in mid-June that Russia was escalating attacks in the Novopavlivka sector — in the western part of Donetsk Oblast — and trying to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. DeepState analysts suggest Moscow views an incursion into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as symbolically significant and a propaganda opportunity, while for Ukraine, holding the administrative line is a strategic priority. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The facility develops and manufactures Kometa adaptive antenna arrays used in Shahed-type drones, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and guided aerial bomb modules, according to the Ukrainian military. Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not seen significant Russian incursions since 2022. At least 23 people have been injured, with 14 of the victims hospitalized. "Who is behind those attacks is clear to all of us here," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Some passengers reported waiting more than 10 hours, according to the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Shot. Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations, Ukraine's military intelligence said. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu hopes her pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) will retain its parliamentary majority in the September 28 elections. "At the same time, of course, we hope for the flexibility, we have to make sure also that Ukraine can move forward."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pedro Sánchez's efforts to reset Spain's ruling socialist party after damaging corruption allegations that threatened to topple his coalition government have suffered a severe setback after a party official resigned over accusations of sexual harassment. The prime minister had hoped this weekend's meeting of the federal committee of his Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) would help the party move past weeks of scandals that have undermined the ethical and anti-corruption pledges on which it came to power seven years ago. But such hopes were flattened late on Friday night after the online newspaper elDiario published allegations from various female PSOE workers who said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by Francisco Salazar, who oversaw institutional coordination at the Moncloa palace, the office and official residence of the prime minister. The accusations prompted Salazar to announce on Saturday that he was stepping down from that post and from his new role as a deputy in the PSOE's organisational secretariat. Sources at Moncloa, in Madrid, said an investigation had been launched, but added that no official complaints had so far been made against Salazar. On Saturday, Sánchez apologised again for what he called his misplaced confidence in those accused of wrongdoing, adding: “I was wrong to place my trust in people who didn't deserve it, but we won't fall short in a time of democratic regeneration.” The prime minister, who is under growing pressure to call a snap election, said he had no intention of stepping down. On Monday, Santos Cerdán – who served as the PSOE's organisational secretary and was Sánchez' right-hand man – was remanded in custody after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts. Sánchez, who became prime minister in 2018 after using a motion of no confidence to turf the corruption-mired conservative People's party (PP) out of government, is already contending with graft investigations relating to his wife and his brother, who deny any wrongdoing. A former PSOE member was also recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil unit investigating the corruption allegations. “He has no credibility and his supposed fight against corruption and sexism is mere posturing,” PP sources said on Saturday. Either there aren't many decent people in his party or he's not very good at choosing people who deserve to be in Spanish politics.” Calls for a fresh election are also beginning to bubble up within some sections of the socialist party. “I don't know if we'll win it,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But they needed wood, no small challenge in a largely treeless place where building supplies are limited. Within a few months, their prayers were answered. As if by divine intervention, construction on St. Peter's-by-the-Sea Church began soon after. The universe has long smiled on the people of these islands, called Madelinots, who have survived for centuries against all odds on this windswept, crescent-shaped archipelago of sand dunes, beaches and rugged cliffs. More than 500 ships have been wrecked on the dangerous shoals that surround the islands, providing important supplies to build homes, schooners and, yes, even churches. An old fishing boat rests near St. Peter's-­by-the-­Sea Church on GrosseÎle. We'd both grown up in the Maritimes and yet as anglophones, the Maggies – just a five-hour ferry ride north of Prince Edward Island – might as well have been a far-off foreign country. While it's long been a part of Quebec and a summer playground for francophones for decades, most of my English-speaking friends who I told about the trip had to Google where it was. It's wash day for this resident of La Grave on Havre-­Aubert. Once aboard the CTMA Traversier, no one is talking about Donald Trump, tariffs or war in the Middle East. Suddenly, in this environment, lobster poutine with Hollandaise sauce seems like a perfectly reasonable breakfast choice. “When you get on that boat, you leave your troubles back on the wharf,” said Frédéric Myrand, an islander who left for school but returned as an adult. They've lived through hurricanes, fishery collapses and isolation, things that have given islanders a determined sense of self-reliance. “It's all part of the deal with living here,” Michel Boudreau, manager of the Musée de la Mer, a local history museum in the quaint village of La Grave, told me. Outside of the busy months of July and August, it's easy to find a beach all to yourself, an empty table at great restaurants or breathtaking hiking and bicycle trails you don't need to share with anyone else. Home to more than 12,000 people, tourism has become a major industry. More than 63,500 visitors came to the islands in 2023, mostly by ferry. Because of self-imposed American travel boycotts this year, they're expecting a jump in Canadian visitors. We got by with our limited French, but unilingual English-speakers shouldn't be concerned about language here. When we sat down on the grass outside Café des Lupins, surrounded by dozens of tattooed twentysomething hipsters sipping lattes and natural wines, no one blinked at the sight of a pair of middle-aged anglos crashing the party. The café served up delicious sandwiches, along with cans of a local blonde ale made with sea water, brewed nearby at a converted crab processing factory. Everywhere, there were pleasant surprises when it was time to eat. Seal poutine at Café de la Grave in Havre-Aubert. Excellent lobster and salmon sushi from a food trailer by the beach. Today, there's only one smokehouse, Le Fumoir d'Antan, still preparing fish in the old artisanal style, a three-month process done inside wooden barns built in the 1940s. They have to ship their herring in from Newfoundland now, after decades of overfishing and climate change have upended this once-bustling fishery. “It's always evolving, but it's important to us to keep this alive,” said Éloi Arseneau, the fourth generation in his family to run the smokehouse, which gives daily tours and also sells a wide range of smoked seafood. Eloi Arseneau sets fires to smoke herring inside the smokehouse, Fumoir d'Antan. Almost every Madelinot has stories about how quickly the changing climate is altering their islands, where storms can reshape sandstone cliffs and make dunes disappear. “It can be stressful sometimes, but we have no choice. Entry Island, an English-speaking community accessible by pedestrian ferry, emerges from the sea like a beacon as you approach the archipelago. We stayed at the Château Madelinot, a newly renovated hotel that's a short drive from the ferry terminal in Cap-aux-Meules. It has clean rooms, ocean views and a good top-floor restaurant that overlooks the sea. Rooms start at $197 a night, more in July and August. Stop at Café de la Grave, housed inside a restored general store in Havre-Aubert, which has been serving up local seafood since 1980. The seal meat is slow-cooked, giving it a consistency like pulled pork, but with a mild gamey taste not unlike deer. The author travelled as a guest of Le Québec maritime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel has not disclosed information about Iran's successful strikes on five military targets, including a large airbase, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing an analysis of satellite data conducted by researchers at Oregon State University. According to the newspaper, six Iranian missiles hit five targets in northern, southern, and central Israel, including an intelligence gathering center and a logistics base. The Daily Telegraph noted that Iran had struck more than 40 Israeli infrastructure targets as a result of the 12-day conflict. In the early morning hours of June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran. Nine days later, on the morning of June 22, US jets attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, entering the conflict. According to the US authorities, there were no casualties or significant damage. On June 24, Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire. The Israeli authorities confirmed that they had accepted the US proposal and announced that they had completed all objectives in their operation against Iran. In turn, Tehran said that it had achieved a victory over Tel Aviv by forcing it to unilaterally halt its aggression. The ceasefire has been in effect since June 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is seeking to involve Laos in its war against Ukraine under the pretense of humanitarian cooperation, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed on July 5. According to the agency, Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations. Ukraine initially captured 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory during a cross-border offensive to Kursk Oblast but lost most of it during a Russian counteroffensive this year, which was supported by North Korean troops. "Russia, under the guise of humanitarian rhetoric, is trying to legalize the presence of foreign military contingents on its territory, effectively using them to wage war against Ukraine," HUR said. This comes amid broader efforts by the Kremlin to recruit foreign personnel. Ukraine has captured multiple foreigners fighting for Russian forces. an April investigation by Russian independent outlet Important Stories identified more than 1,500 foreign fighters from 48 countries who had joined Russia's war. Laos, a landlocked Southeast Asian country bordering China, Vietnam, and Thailand, has not commented on HUR's claim. The country maintains close ties with both Moscow and its ally Beijing. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The facility develops and manufactures Kometa adaptive antenna arrays used in Shahed-type drones, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and guided aerial bomb modules, according to the Ukrainian military. Russian troops have been escalating their assaults in the area and are attempting to breach into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not seen significant Russian incursions since 2022. At least 23 people have been injured, with 14 of the victims hospitalized. Some passengers reported waiting more than 10 hours, according to the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Shot. Moscow is organizing the deployment of a combined unit of military engineers from the Lao People's Armed Forces to Russia's Kursk Oblast, allegedly to help with demining operations, Ukraine's military intelligence said. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte presided over the handover, commending outgoing U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli for his contributions to modernizing NATO's collective defense and bolstering support for Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu hopes her pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) will retain its parliamentary majority in the September 28 elections. "At the same time, of course, we hope for the flexibility, we have to make sure also that Ukraine can move forward."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gloria Allred says MeToo movement should not be judged by criminal cases as lawsuits are settled behind closed doors The music mogul was this week acquitted on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering after two of his ex-girlfriends, including the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified he coerced them into having sex with male escorts. Combs, 55, was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation for prostitution. But Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Combs's alleged victims, including two who have filed civil lawsuits, said the outcome is symptomatic of a waning MeToo movement. In addition to that, we do many more confidential settlements without a lawsuit than even civil lawsuits, so it's [MeToo] alive and well.” During her famed career spanning more than 50 years Ms Allred has represented alleged victims of the rich and powerful, including Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, R Kelly and Mohamed Al-Fayed. Her clients include an unknown number of Weinstein's accusers, including Miriam Haley, who the disgraced film mogul was found guilty of sexually assaulting in his New York criminal retrial last month. When Mr Trump won the election in November, some feared electing a man who had been found liable for sexual abuse marked the end of the MeToo movement, which sprung up after more than 80 women came forward claiming they had been raped or sexual assaulted by Weinstein. Ms Allred insists victims are still contacting her firm Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, which she describes as the most prominent women's rights law firm in the country, every day. “We won over a billion dollars in the years that we've been in practice for victims, so I am not concerned that this is going to deter victims,” she said. Several of the witnesses who testified against Combs had pending civil lawsuits against the mogul, including Dawn Richard, who is represented by Ms Allred's daughter Lisa Bloom. Ventura, 38, settled her civil suit against Combs within 24 hours of filing. Last year, lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing dozens of Combs's alleged victims, claimed several high-profile celebrities had settled with victims quietly before to avoid being named in a public lawsuit. This week a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, accusing Mr Buzbee of trying to blackmail him with false claims of sexual misconduct. “We all saw the video, he beat her, he dragged her back, and if that's not force, if that's not coercion, I don't know what is,” she said. Discussing her recommended legislation, she said: “In the same way that if... a woman is under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, she could not, from a legal point of view, does not have the capacity to consent to a sex act.”She added: “I'm proposing that if a woman is beaten, a victim of domestic violence before or after the sexual assault, it should be considered that she couldn't consent to it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only two justices have written majority opinions involving transgender Americans – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch – and both avoided revealing their thoughts about the sports cases last month when, in a blockbuster ruling, the Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth. For the second time in as many years the high court will wrestle with a heated legal dispute involving young transgender Americans at a time when they are facing severe political backlash driven in part by President Donald Trump and conservative states. The court agreed to hear appeals in two related cases challenging laws in West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender girls and women from competing on women's sports teams – including one that was filed by a middle school student at the time. “Even though the court ruled against the transgender plaintiffs in Skrmetti, it did not decide the larger and more important question of whether discrimination based on transgender status triggers more searching judicial review,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. That opinion, written by Roberts, explicitly declined to decide if the law discriminated against transgender youth. Tennessee's policy, Roberts reasoned, instead drew boundaries based on age and medical procedures that were well within a state's power to regulate. That logic avoided thorny questions about whether the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause if it specifically targeted transgender minors for different treatment. “It is notable that the court seemed to go out of its way to avoid endorsing the idea that the law discriminated against transgender people and instead found that the Tennessee law had drawn lines based on age and medical diagnoses,” said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert on gender and sexuality law. “It's important,” she said, “not to lose sight of the fact that these cases involve kids trying to make their way through school and life like every other kid.” His silence was significant given that one of the key arguments at stake was how – or whether – to apply the landmark 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County that he authored. In that decision, the court ruled that transgender workers are covered by federal protections against discrimination based on sex  because discrimination against a transgender person is, by extension, necessarily also discrimination based on sex. The Biden administration and transgender teenagers fighting Tennessee's law asserted that the same logic should apply when it comes to gender identity care bans. John Bursch, a veteran Supreme Court litigator and senior counsel at the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, predicted that both Roberts and Gorsuch will ultimately back the state bans on transgender people participating in sports that align with their gender identity given their votes in the Tennessee dispute. “If they were in agreement that Tennessee's law did not discriminate based on gender identity, I would assume that both of them would come to the same conclusion here when it comes to sports,” Bursch said. “But you never know for sure, and anytime that we go to the court, we assume that all nine justices are in play.” Alliance Defending Freedom is a co-counsel in both sports cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear. “Our hope is that we would get a unanimous ruling to protect women's sports in favor of both West Virginia and Idaho in their laws,” Bursch added. Other members of the court's six-justice conservative wing – including two who are often decisive votes – have more clearly signaled their thoughts on anti-trans laws. “Beyond the treatment of gender dysphoria, transgender status implicates several other areas of legitimate regulatory policy – ranging from access to restrooms to eligibility for boys' and girls' sports teams,” Barrett wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. “If laws that classify based on transgender status necessarily trigger heightened scrutiny, then the courts will inevitably be in the business of ‘closely scrutiniz(ing) legislative choices' in all these domains.” Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence arguing against extending Bostock's reasoning to constitutional cases. During oral arguments over Tennessee's law in December, Justice Brett Kavanaugh – another justice who is sometimes seen as a swing vote – mentioned sports as he peppered the lawyer for the Biden administration with skeptical questions about her position. “If you prevail here,” asked Kavanaugh, who has frequently noted that he coached his daughters' basketball teams, “what would that mean for women's and girls' sports in particular?” “Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women's and girls' sports, basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, et cetera, notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?” Kavanaugh pressed. In response, then-Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar attempted to distinguish the sports cases from Tennessee's law. The court's three liberals dissented in the Tennessee case, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the majority had pulled back from “meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most” and instead “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.” Jim Justice, a Republican, signed the “Save Women's Sports Act” in 2021, banning transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. The Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that West Virginia's ban violated Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. Two years ago, the Supreme Court denied West Virginia's emergency docket request to let it fully enforce its ban. Lindsay Hecox, then a freshman at Boise State University, sued days later, saying that she intended to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams and alleging the law violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. A federal district court blocked the law's enforcement against Hecox months later and the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision last year. “Idaho was the first state to step out and ban boys and men from competing with girls and women in organized athletics,” Little said on Thursday, describing the law as a “common sense” policy intended to “protect the American way of life.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spectators gathered on the cobblestone streets of Madrid's Chueca neighborhood this week to watch one of Spain's most curious races: the “Carrera de Tacones,” or heel race. Held annually as part of the city's Pride celebrations, the race sees competitors — mostly men in towering heels — pound Calle de Pelayo, as racers have done each year for decades. Whoops, cheers, and gasps were heard throughout the crowd as racers tried to outpace each other on Thursday — some stumbling ungracefully in unruly heels towards the finish line. Despite the frenzy, an event of this scale and importance to Spain's LGBTQ+ community takes careful planning. In the back room of a neighboring sportswear shop, where runners check-in before the race,﻿ one staff member was found taping participants' shoes tightly to their ankles with black duct tape to reduce the chances of sprains and breaks. Runners face disqualification for any footwear under 10 cm high (about four inches). “I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to race,” the woman measuring told a visibly disappointed racer, Edson Escolar, who was cradling a pair of blue stilettoes. Escolar told CNN that he had travelled from Guatemala to join the race. “In Guatemala, we have Pride but it's nothing like this. “Maybe they'll let me race if I ask again nicely,” he said hopefully with a smile. But Escolar was nowhere to be found at the starting line. “We have a couple of rules to keep the race fair,” said Bonillo. There are few in Spain who know more about the race's humble beginnings than the drag queen known as Chumina Power. This year, she presented the race with a mix of singing, dancing and commentary from a small platform near the finish line. Power attended the event's first ever race and began working as a drag performer at LL Bar a few years later. “The high heel race has been going on for 30 years, but at first, it was a tiny event with just a few people,” she recalled. The first celebrations in this country took place across only two small streets here, and Calle de Pelayo was one of them.” “Most people didn't come to Pride to demonstrate because it was still frowned upon back then,” she said. In 2019 it became Europe's largest Pride celebration, drawing around two million visitors annually. As Power returned to the stage, racers began their final stretches. Brian Healy, originally from Ireland, has been living in Madrid for seven years. “I bought these shoes online from China, and something felt different when I put them on,” he continued, easing himself down to the ground to stretch. They were both the same, but I've kind of got used to it now,” he joked. For some like Pablo Lopez, who chose a long, loose pair of black leather boots, it was their first race. “I'm really scared,” Lopez said with a shy smile. “I practiced a little bit at home, walking and running slowly, but the ground is different here.” And before the final race, another problem emerged: shoe fatigue. At one point, a finalist lifted their leg to reveal their bloodied toes and the remains of a shredded shoe. The final race couldn't have been closer. “This was so much fun, and I'm so pleased to have won it,” said Raul Prieto, who had travelled to Madrid for the race from his hometown of Bilbao. Clutching a large check for €350 (about $412), he added: “I want to run this race every year for the rest of time!”</p>

A strong earthquake measuring upper 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7 hit Akusekijima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture on Saturday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Between June 21 and Saturday at 7 a.m., a total of 1,303 earthquakes measuring 1 or stronger on the Japanese seismic intensity scale have been recorded in the area. At a press conference on Saturday morning, an official of the agency urged people to be on alert for earthquakes of a similar scale as Saturday's. The agency also dismissed rumors about a possible major earthquake in July, stating that it is difficult to predict the date, location and scale of earthquakes under current scientific knowledge. “We want the public to be prepared for earthquakes at all times as they can occur any time in Japan,” the official said. Toshima Mayor Genichiro Kubo said Saturday he would conduct the second round of evacuation for island residents. The number of residents wishing to evacuate the island is increasing, and at least 20 people were expected to evacuate Sunday.
