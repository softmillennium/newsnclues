                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club World Cup quarter-final action concludes at MetLife Stadium where Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund meet later today. Madrid are the record winners of this tournament with five titles. The eggheads over at Opta give the Spanish side a 60 per cent likelihood of progressing today, leaving 40 per cent for Borussia Dortmund's chances. When considering the result inside 90 minutes, Opta assesses the likelihood of a Madrid win at 47 per cent, a Dortmund win at 27 per cent, and extra time at 26 per cent. They also met in the 2024 final of the UCL, with Madrid prevailing 2-0 thanks to goals from Dani Carvajal and Vini Jr as seen above. In fact, Madrid have won four straight matches against Dortmund. The Guirassy-Adeyemi duo has shown their potential, but Dortmund have also shown defensive weaknesses today that Los Blancos should know how to exploit. Niko Kovac makes two changes from Dortmund's starting line-up against Monterrey in the round of 16, one by choice and one by necessity. Starting XI: Kobel, Bensebaini, Anton, Sule, Sabitzer, Brandt, Gross, Svensson, Ryerson, Adeyemi, Guirassy Subs: Ostrzinski, Meyer, Couto, Reyna, Nmecha, Beier, Duranville, Chukwuemeka, Campbell, Mane, Inacio, Albert, Azhil, Benkara Kylian Mbappe on the bench again, despite making his tournament debut against Juventus last time out. This suggests that he is nowhere near 100% fitness and that Xabi Alonso's confidence in Gonzalo García is very high. And no wonder: the academy product has scored three goals and provided one assist in four games in the United States. Subs: Lunin, Carvajal, Militao, Mbappe, Modric, Rodrygo, Vazquez, Ceballos, Brahim, Youssef, Jacobo, Asencio, Chema, Victor Munoz, Mario Martin Borussia Dortmund have been on a strong run since the middle of April, going unbeaten over their past 11 matches in all competitions. We want to hear from you throughout our coverage today! And who are you backing to win the tournament? We'll pick out some of our favorite comments and share them right here in this blog, so don't be shy! In the end, this has proven a good deal for Dortmund. Despite Gittens' drop in form in the second half of last season, they have still managed to secure a big fee, at a time when they are looking to rebuild their squad and finance a new era. For context, only four times since the start of the 2019 season have BVB sold a player for a fee larger than €50m. They are losing an excellent player and the hope had been that Gittens would stay longer than he has and grow into a true Bundesliga. That has not happened, but this will be some consolation. Dortmund had been open to a sale of the former Manchester City youth player, who had moved to the German club in 2020, to help fund a summer rebuild of Niko Kovac's side, who sealed Champions League qualification on the final day of the Bundesliga season. Gittens recorded 12 goals and five assists in 48 matches during 2024-25. No one would have expected it a year ago, but this clash will be an interesting battle of the back threes. Niko Kovac has made Dortmund far more defensively solid since arriving in January, but the tactical tweak has meant that Karim Adeyemi is now playing a more central role alongside striker Serhou Guirassy. A back-three system is also an attacking ploy from Xabi Alonso, allowing him to keep his best players in advanced positions and create more combinations through the heart of the pitch. The early iterations have had some teething issues, but it will be interesting to see how Alonso continues to tweak his system. He chose to stay at the club despite interest elsewhere and has had a tournament full of excellent saves, especially his double-stop against Fluminense in the first game. He has three goals, including the winner in the last 16, and one assist, and has been compared by Xabi Alonso to club legend Raul. Dortmund were pilloried in Germany for their goalless draw with Fluminense in the opening match, but the Brazilians then showed what a good side they are. If there is a criticism, it's that slight carelessness which could yet cost them. Xabi Alonso has restored enthusiasm at all levels (staff, players and fans) after a year of internal tensions and a notable lack of trophies in Madrid. Beyond the three consecutive victories at the Club World Cup, with eight goals scored and two conceded at the tournament, Alonso is showing a real tactical richness and a flair for intervening successfully during matches. German Berterame headed Monterrey back into the game straight after half-time but they could not find an equaliser. Garcia's strike was his third of the tournament as he continued to impress in his deputy role while Kylian Mbappe recovered from acute gastroenteritis. Borussia Dortmund opened their Club World Cup campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Fluminense in New Jersey. Dortmund managed only seven shots on 0.24 expected goals. They improved on Matchday 2, offensively at least, with a 4-3 victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati. Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy, Jobe Bellingham and an own goal were responsible for Dortmund's tally. First place in Group F was up for grabs heading into the finale, and Dortmund benefitted from a goalless draw between Fluminense and Mamelodi Sundowns to take top spot after beating Ulsan 1-0 on Daniel Svensson's goal.</p>

Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso decides to keep Kylian Mbappe, who had a brief spell in hospital last week after suffering with gastroenteritis, again among the substitutes. Subs: Lunin, Carvajal, Militao, Vazquez, Lekhedim, Ramon, Asencio, Modric, Ceballos, Andres, Martin, Mbappe, Rodrygo, Diaz, Munoz.

Subs: Ostrinski, Meyer, Couto, Mane, Benkara, Reyna, Nmecha, Chukwuemeka, Azhil, Beier, Duranville, Campbell, Inacio. Real Madrid have won the Club World Cup on five occasions - in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022. They are still going well in the 2025 tournament but have a tough quarter-final as they take on German giants Borussia Dortmund in what should be a thrilling match.</p>

Plenty has changed for both sides since Real Madrid beat Dortmund 2-0 on June 1, 2024, in the Champions League final. French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid, while both feature new coaches. It will be the fifth match for Xabi Alonso as Real Madrid's coach, taking over during their Club World Cup run after leading Bayer Leverkusen in Germany. “It will be an intense game, and we need to perform at a high level. PSG VS. BAYERN: Champions League winners move onto Club World Cup semifinals Real Madrid has won four of the last six matches against Dortmund, heading into their quarterfinal at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. “We're expecting a lot of supporters, especially for Real Madrid,” Kovac told reporters. The match is also available to live stream for free on DAZN. He was not listed as a starter in Real Madrid's starting lineup for the match. No, Jobe Bellingham is not playing for Dortmund because of a yellow card accumulation in the Club World Cup. He won't play against his older brother, Jude for Real Madrid. Chelsea beat Palmeiras (Brazil) 2-1, while Fluminense topped Al-Hilal (Saudi Arabia) 2-0 on July 4. The Club World Cup final will be played on July 13 at 3 p.m.</p>

Real Madrid began their Club World Cup campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami. It was a performance that raised a few questions at the time, though Al Hilal went on to have an impressive tournament. Fede Valverde had the opportunity to steal a win for Madrid in the closing minutes, but his weak penalty attempt was saved. Madrid moved to Charlotte next and posted a comfortable 3-1 win over Pachuca, with Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler and Valverde the scorers. Heading into the group finale in first place but not assured of finishing there, Madrid put all doubts to rest with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Red Bull Salzburg. Vinicius Junior, Valverde and Gonzalo Garcia were the scorers in that one. And generally, the European team has come out on top. That is why CONMEBOL has more top-three finishes in total. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is a little different with 32 teams competing — when the previous 20 editions never brought together more than eight clubs each. Still, the legacy of those early years will continue and a host of famous names will be looking to add to their previous victories. Here are the most successful clubs in this competition's history: According to the Opta supercomputer, it is another English side that are now favourites. 💬 “Hopefully we will have another chance at some point in the future to play against each other. It would be a nice moment for our family.” And then he spoke more generally about Jobe following the same path as him to Germany. There was kind of big discussions for him about the decision he could made and I think, looking now from my perspective, I'm really happy with the decision he had. When everyone realised that there was a good chance Real Madrid and Dortmund would meet in the quarter-final, there was a lot of excitement for a potential Bellingham derby — Jude at Madrid and Jobe newly signed for Dortmund. But the prospect of that intriguing match-up went up in smoke midway through the first half of Dortmund's last-16 win against Monterrey. Jobe Bellingham had already been booked at the tournament so, when he picked up another yellow in that game, it meant he would be suspended for the potential showdown. AndI can't imagine it was a coincidence that he was put forward by Real Madrid to speak ahead of a game against his former team. Bellingham played 132 times for Dortmund between 2020 and 2023, helping them to DFB Pokal success in his first season before his big-money move to Real Madrid. And here is that thoughtful answer from Jude Bellingham when asked about the news regarding Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva. 💬 “As a player I think this comes at the back of my mind. “It's a reminder on how precious life is, how important is every time you have given the chance to wake up in the morning and that you shoul be greatful, and checking on your loved ones because you never know when it's going to be the last time you get to spend time with them. One of the first things I did was message my brother.” Jude Bellingham spoke to the media and after a thoughtful message of his own, more on that shortly, he was asked how Trent Alexander-Arnold was feeling. 💬 “It was a really tough day for him to process. As a team we were there to support him. While Trent Alexander-Arnold has moved to Real Madrid, he was at Liverpool for the entirety of Jota's time there. The England right-back put out a lovely message for his late friend on his social media accounts on Thursday — as you can see below. At the start, you hope it cannot be true, that it has all been a terrible misunderstanding and that something will pop up online to let us know that the internet is a wicked place when it comes to the distribution of fake news. But then the reports start to accelerate and, waking up to the news about Diogo Jota, you realise there has been nothing on his social media accounts since the wedding photographs that he posted, lovingly, heartbreakingly, just a few hours before his life was taken away. “A day we will never forget,” Jota had written alongside a video montage from the ceremony in Porto, the Portuguese city where he and his childhood sweetheart, Rute Cardoso, fell in love. The Liverpool forward and his brother Andre Silva, a professional player for Portuguese side Penafiel, died after being involved in a car crash in Spain. It all started at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida where Al Hilal — the conquerors of Manchester City in the last 16 — were eliminated by Fluminense. Cole Palmer's first-half opener was cancelled out by a brilliant finish from Estevao, who is joining Chelsea after the conclusion of this tournament, before a late own goal sealed the Premier League side's place in the semi-final.</p>

Chelsea will now go on to face yet another Brazilian side, Rio de Janeiro's Fluminense, on Tuesday at 3 p.m. Palmer said he expects another tough game against strong opposition. “I feel like they're more physical, more rough,” he said when asked how they compared to Chelsea's usual opposition in the English Premier League. “We know that they're good teams, so it's difficult to play against them.” The other semifinal still has to be decided, with the remaining quarterfinal matches playing out today between Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich at noon, followed by Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund at 4 p.m. The tournament semifinals and final will all be held at nearby Metlife Stadium.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — Tobin Heath might know something about what makes soccer resonate within the U.S. Her resume, in part: She won NCAA titles in college at North Carolina, then went on to win two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team and two World Cup titles as well, all of that coming after she was inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup. And so far, she thinks the Club World Cup could have a similar effect. Heath — who is working as part of FIFA's technical study group for the tournament, alongside the likes of former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, former German star and U.S. men's national coach Jurgen Klinsmann and others — said last weekend that a match she attended earlier this month between Bayern Munich and Boca Juniors, with a full and jammed stadium in South Florida playing host to that matchup, shows what could be possible in this country. “As an American, it was one of the coolest experiences of my life to witness that passion and energy,” Heath — during a FIFA briefing with the technical group — said. You could feel it, and the fans were absolutely incredible. So, I know the power of these home competitions. I know the power of these games in our country, to change the landscape of this game in our country.” With the tournament entering the knockout round and some strong matchups ahead — including Lionel Messi and Inter Miami taking on his former team, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday in Atlanta — there should be plenty of good crowds throughout the remainder of the event, as FIFA looks to build momentum toward the World Cup that's coming to North America next year. “This is a fantastic dress rehearsal for us,” Heath said. Only one U.S.-based team made the knockout stage: Messi's Inter Miami, though some wonder if that's a club that will have a true pronounced effect on soccer in this country. Messi is the biggest name in the sport and has an enormous following everywhere, one that obviously existed long before he came to Miami two years ago. “Messi has not the best data of this tournament, but he's certainly the most influential player of this tournament — because without him Inter Miami would never qualify,” Wenger said. FIFA is promising that fields for next year's World Cup will be in better condition than some used in this tournament. There have been comments — and in some cases, complaints — about conditions from European clubs, particularly fields in Charlotte and Orlando, Wenger said. In my opinion, the pitch was a little bit soft and not dry, but the ball was not traveling as fast as we are used to. This is my feeling,” Borussia Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said after his team played a scoreless draw there earlier in the tournament against Fluminense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It's offensive for any football fan to be prevented from participating in the World Cup, not just Iranians,” Ali Rezaei of Tehran's Borna news agency says. As things stand, while the national team will be able to enter the US next summer, fans – and perhaps media – will not. Residents of Tehran and other cities may have had enough to deal with of late, but still, being barred from entry stings, even if Iranians have long found it difficult to get into the US. “If someone hasn't committed any illegal activity, why should they be punished? “Refusing to play on US soil would be a dangerous precedent – any host country could start excluding teams it has issues with. There is a feeling that staying away would not make much difference anyway. “It would only deprive the national team of the opportunity to participate in a major tournament and would ultimately hurt Iran more,” Jafarzadeh says. Questions have been asked – including in Iran, whose supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long banned competing against Israeli athletes – about what the international reaction would have been if Qatar had banned citizens from certain nations from attending the 2022 World Cup. If strict entry rules remain, we should focus on protecting football. “Playing in Mexico or Canada is not a real solution – it just ignores the actual problem,” Rezaei says. “Canada has a large Iranian immigrant population, although some of them are opponents of the Iranian regime and the national team can't count on their support,” Jafarzadeh says. “Mexico is probably a more attractive and less controversial destination for the team.” The Iranian-American community is more than a million strong yet many of these headed west before, or in response to, the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Of course, the war with Israel has stirred feelings of patriotism among many Iranians, but I'm not sure if this will translate into support for the national team. We'll have to wait and see how things unfold in the coming months.” Iran is one of 19 countries subject to a full or partial US entry ban. “Considering that there is almost a year left until the 2026 World Cup, there is a possibility that the situation may stabilise,” says Isa Azimi, a columnist and translator, regarding Iran's situation, though he is not confident. “Despite claims of separating politics from football, Fifa has shown that it is not particularly independent when facing major political powers.” Especially when Infantino appears to prize his close relationship with President Trump. “If Fifa considers itself a global body independent of governments, it must stand up to such laws and not allow politics to contaminate the world of sports,” Pakdaman says. “Of course, we all know that, unfortunately, such contamination exists – especially when one side of the issue is a superpower that answers to no one. It is Fifa's duty to treat all member countries equally, but will that actually happen?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Malo Gusto's cross deflected past Palmeiras goalkeeper Their place in the last four of the Club World Cup in the bag and the prospect of a £97m windfall still up for grabs, Chelsea found themselves in an unusual position: relieved to have survived a taxing second half, hailing Malo Gusto's unlikely role as match-winner and able to delight in the opposition's goalscorer being named superior player of the match. For a while the story of this entertaining quarter-final looked like it was going to be about Enzo Maresca finding it within himself to forgive Estêvão. Everything had changed when the Brazilian sensation, who joins Chelsea after this tournament, cancelled out an early goal from Cole Palmer and hauled Palmeiras level at the start of the second half. Quiet during the first half, Estêvão threatened to take over and send his next team back to England. The consolation for Chelsea was likely to be seeing exactly why they have paid £52m to sign a talent tipped by many good judges to win the Ballon d'Or one day. Yet that uncomfortable conversation between Estêvão and Maresca was averted thanks to a horrendous error from Weverton seven minutes from time, a deflected cross from Gusto somehow deceiving the Palmeiras goalkeeper and bobbling in. Palmeiras, who have never won this competition, could not believe their misfortune. They lost late to Chelsea in the final three years ago; now they were out thanks to an own goal from their goalkeeper. Palmer and Estêvão working in tandem after this tournament? It is a delicious prospect and Chelsea's owners will have loved the symbolism of the duo embracing at half-time. Next up are Fluminese, who beat Al-Hilal in the day's other quarter-final, and that means a reunion with a Brazilian from a different era: the former Chelsea centre-back Thiago Silva. There was also rare positive PR for Fifa given that its dynamic pricing model pulled in a bigger crowd than expected and quelled any debate over scheduling this tie on Independence Day. This, after all, was far from the biggest show in town on Friday. Fourth of July festivities tend to be quite a big deal in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, and anyone looking for ways to mark the holiday could choose from Major League Baseball at nearby Citizens Bank Park, free concerts and a fireworks show in the city centre. But prices dropping as low as $11.15 (£8.17) ensured there was a decent attendance at Lincoln Financial Field, where attention was on the weirdness of Estêvão playing his future employers. In Marc Cucurella's case it was to stick tight to the teenager and kick him at every opportunity. It was as if the left-back was determined to show Estêvão what it will be like in the Premier League. The challenges were physical and there was even a blast of fury from Cucurella after Estêvão had a nibble at Levi Colwill midway through the first half. Enzo Fernández moved deeper but there was another rejig when Reece James suffered an injury during the warmup, forcing Maresca to hand a first start to Andrey Santos. In that context, perhaps it was not a surprise when Chelsea grew a little ragged in the second half. The 21-year-old Brazilian is still adjusting to Maresca's system after an impressive loan spell at Strasbourg, although this was still an encouraging first step. Playing in a deeper role, Santos asked for the ball, got stuck in and did not hide when the game got tough after half-time. Palmeiras, who were without key figures in defence, had struggled at first. Neto was excused from training on Thursday and it would not have been a surprise if the winger had accepted the offer of compassionate leave. Sixteen minutes in, he moved to the right, took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and turned. Palmer swerved on to his left foot, held off a couple of challenges and threaded a low shot into the bottom corner. They should have scored again, only for Christopher Nkunku to shoot over. Liam Delap ruled himself out of the semi-final after picking up a booking. The Brazilian teams are not to be underestimated. Maresca responded by removing Delap for the debutant João Pedro and bringing Noni Madueke on for the disappointing Nkunku. João Pedro, who has only had a couple of training sessions since joining from Brighton this week, looked bright. Chelsea kept working themselves into promising positions, although the nature of the winning goal owed more to luck than judgment, Gusto squeezing in a cross, the ball changing course and Weverton not reacting in time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has revealed that new signing Joao Pedro will get some game time during the FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal vs. Palmerias. PHILADELPHIA -- It's never easy to make sense of Chelsea, a club that doesn't do "normal," so why should it be any different when they seal a place in the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals with an own goal by a Palmeiras player and their new wonderkid Estêvão scoring against them? Chelsea's 2-1 win against Palmeiras, which earned them £15 million in prize money, also happened to come on the day that the Premier League team was hit with a £27 million fine by UEFA for breaching financial regulations. Chelsea will go into their last-four encounter as strong favorites even without center forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill, who both picked up yellow cards against Palmeiras that mean they will be suspended for the next game. Midfielder Moisés Caicedo will return from suspension, and new signing Joao Pedro, who made his debut in Philadelphia as a substitute just three days after completing a transfer from Brighton worth an initial £50 million, will replace Delap. They have so many players that no injury or suspension seems to make a difference, because the carousel just turns and another player steps off to fill the void. Estêvão will be the next one to join Maresca's ever-growing squad. The 18-year-old completed a £33.8 million transfer from Palmeiras in June 2024, but at age 17 at the time was too young to make the move directly to Stamford Bridge, so he remained in Brazil to continue his development with Palmeiras. Chelsea could have called Estêvão into their squad for this tournament this month but decided to allow the teenager to remain with Palmeiras and assess his readiness for Maresca's squad by monitoring his performances in the competition. There was always a chance the two clubs would meet and pose a difficult scenario for the player, but in what turned out to be his final game for the Sao Paulo team before heading to Chelsea, Estêvão dazzled and scored a stunning goal that will hugely excite his new club's supporters. It was a goal that showcased audacity, confidence and supreme skill, and it sparked Palmeiras into a period that could have, and maybe should have, delivered a second goal to put them in the lead. Craig Burley discusses Xabi Alonso's selection headache ahead of Real Madrid's quarterfinal clash vs. Borussia Dortmund. How Chelsea have made it this far is down to luck rather than good planning. Less than two months ago, Chelsea were facing a failure to qualify for the Champions League and the prospect of their £1 billion spending spree amounting to little more than a Conference League success. But all of a sudden, they are 90 minutes away from the Club World Cup final, having already bagged Champions League qualification and the Conference League. Just don't try to make sense of it all, because this is Chelsea, and chaos seems to be the driving force behind the club and Maresca's team.</p>
