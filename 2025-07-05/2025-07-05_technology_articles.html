Drug cartels have already been using this technique for several years now to smuggle drugs into the United States and other countries, but this is the first time that a vessel has been discovered that was plying the illicit route with no one inside. Nevertheless, the narco-sub was empty during the interdiction, meaning it was likely a test run for future smuggling operations. This isn't the first time that authorities have caught a remotely operated low-profile vessel. Drug cartels are becoming more sophisticated when it comes to shipping contraband. These boats were initially designed for routes between North and South America, but they've recently been spotted sailing across the Atlantic and the Pacific. Furthermore, the human factor introduces additional risk because individuals can be bribed and, if apprehended, may even turn against the organization as witnesses. On the other hand, international high-speed wireless internet allows these boats to be remotely operated, so even if the authorities intercept them, there would be no person onboard to interrogate. Starlink plans that allow for oceanic and global land use can get expensive, with prices ranging from $250 (50GB) to $2,150 (2TB) per month. However, you really don't need that much data to control a boat, and the value of the carried cargo — ranging between millions and billions of dollars — makes the cost of setting up satellite internet communications negligible. This new way of using Starlink will make it harder for governments to catch drug runners sailing the seas, mainly as a single crew can remotely operate multiple drone boats. But even though the removal of onboard crews on these narco-subs reduces the human factor risk, each Starlink dish is still tied to a specific account. So, if intelligence agencies can determine the entities that sign up for these accounts, and if SpaceX cooperates, they can track these user terminals on these narco-subs and then capture them as the land-side of the operation is unloading its drug cargo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No smoke without fire, or an unsubstantiated rumor? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. TSMC has responded to a report that it is delaying its Japan fab in favor of faster buildouts in the United States. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, TSMC is slowing its spending on chipmaking facilities in Japan to accelerate the buildout of its Fab 21 site in Arizona, in anticipation of potential tariffs imposed on chips made in Taiwan by the U.S. government. "TSMC's global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency, the level of government support and cost economic considerations. Earlier this week, we heard that TSMC was bringing its N3-capable Fab 21 Phase 2 online in 2027 (several quarters ahead of schedule), while slowing down its projects in Germany and Japan. While plans tend to change, these changes are not always interconnected, especially given the different stages of these projects, as well as TSMC's vast capital expenditure (CapEx) budget of $32 billion to $42 billion and its massive capacity buildout plans. Let's take a look at TSMC's most recent updates on its projects in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, starting with the U.S. TSMC had already confirmed earlier this year that it was speeding up the start of high-volume production at Fab 21 Phase 2 due to demand from its clients. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. TSMC has reached the 'topping milestone', currently outfitting the fab with various mechanical, electrical, plumbing, air filtration, air conditioning, and other systems. Equipment procurement and installation is the most capital-intensive (expensive) stage of every fab project. Wei, chief executive and chairman of TSMC, in the company's Q1 2025 conference call. The company also intended to start constructing shells for Fab 21 phase 3 and phase 4 later in 2025, with the aim of starting production there later this decade. "Our third and fourth fab will utilize N2 and A16 process technologies, and with the expectation of receiving all the necessary permits, is scheduled to begin construction later this year," said Wei. In fact, Bloomberg reported in late April that the company indeed began to build its 'third fab in Arizona,' though it is unclear whether it began to prep land, or actually broke ground (e.g., poured in the foundation), though considering that TSMC did not have all the necessary permits as of April 17, it looks like it only started prepping the land for the facility. The company intended to start construction of its Fab 23 phase 2 earlier this year, but the schedule slipped due to a lack of proper local infrastructure. Land preparation and shell construction are the least capital-intensive stages of building semiconductor production facilities, meaning this phase is comparatively low-cost. Therefore, it does not make sense to slow down any of this in a bid to speed up another project, unless a company lacks funds, which is not the case with TSMC. The same applies to TSMC's project in Germany — a joint project with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, called Fab 24, which is set to come online in late 2027. So far, the company has not officially begun building the shell, but constructing a fab building is less expensive than equipping it, so it is unlikely that TSMC would delay the construction start of Fab 24 due to its vast investment project in America. "We are on track with our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany," Wei said during the call. "[…] So again, I would emphasize, no, we are not going to slow down our plan in Japan or in Germany." TSMC itself declined to comment on rumors about changes to its buildout plans, the company stressed that its fabs come online based on customers' needs and that its expanded investment in the U.S.-based site would not impact its intentions in other countries.

The U.S. government is preparing a new set of export rules that would tighten control over the exports of advanced Nvidia AI GPUs to Malaysia and Thailand, in a bid to prevent the re-export of these components to China amid existing bans, according to Bloomberg. A preliminary version of the new export rule, reported by Bloomberg, states that the U.S. Commerce Department would require companies to obtain a U.S. government export license before sending AI GPUs to the two Southeast Asian nations. The plan has not been finalized and may change, yet it may represent another step towards limiting Chinese entities' access to high-performance Nvidia AI GPUs. Malaysia and Thailand are not major suspected hubs for the smuggling of Nvidia's GPUs, unlike Singapore, which is officially listed as one of Nvidia's primary sources of revenue, raising questions about whether the products sold to Singapore-based entities eventually end up in China. Indeed, Nvidia denies that its AI GPUs formally sold to Singapore-based entities could end up in China, arguing that they are sold to entities officially based in Singapore, but they are destined elsewhere. Nonetheless, it is widely believed that Singapore is a hub for smuggling high-end Nvidia GPUs to China and other sanctioned countries. However, Malaysia has emerged as a significant destination for computing equipment and components — including CPUs and GPUs essential for AI applications — sourced from Taiwan in recent quarters. Moreover, Malaysia is reportedly used to avoid U.S. import tariffs for China-made goods, which might be a concern for the U.S. Commerce Department. Thailand is among the countries suspected of being a hub for smuggling Nvidia's AI GPUs to China. However, without formal data, we can only wonder whether the suspicion has merit.

It's time to get serious—or should I say… Sirius. It's part of a long lineage of robot dogs punctuated by the likes of tech titans like Sony, Xiaomi, Fisher-Price, and, uh, Ideal Toy Company's impeccably named mechanical dog from 1960, Gaylord the Pup (you can't make this shit up, folks). But this isn't just another Gaylord. Using large language models (LLMs) like the ones that power ChatGPT, Sirius comes equipped with the ability to understand voice commands. In a demo with Sirius, I saw the dog take voice commands like “sit,” “shake,” and “pee,” though I wouldn't want to train your real dog to do that last one. Just blurt out, “Hey, Sirius,” and then talk away. The dog has to be connected to Wi-Fi to do all of this stuff, FYI—there's no onboard processing, but this ain't an iPhone after all. Speaking of iPhones, be careful when yelling “Hey, Sirius” because “Sirius” sounds an awful lot like another voice assistant, who's had a bit of trouble with AI lately. I don't know what happens when you ask your iPhone to pee, but frankly, I'd rather not find out. I wasn't able to test the voice commands with my review unit of Sirius because I had trouble connecting it to Wi-Fi, but I did get to see them in a live demo, and Sirius's voice assistant looks about as good as Apple's, which is to say… pretty mid. It recognized some commands right away, and others not so much. However mid Sirius is at processing and understanding voice commands, it's much worse at (sigh) walking. This thing falls kind of a lot, and unlike a dog made of flesh and blood, it cannot figure out how to get up after taking said spill. Lots of my time testing Sirius was spent extricating it from the insufferable foibles of its own clumsiness. I have my own foibles to suffer, thank you very much. My unit was a demo version and didn't have the same OTA update as the ones shipping after. We'll be updating this post if and when I can get Sirus online.) Using a game controller provided with my review unit, I tried parading Sirius around the Gizmodo office for shits and giggles but found that (especially when it's in autonomous mode) it would often get tripped up when I sent in an input to walk forward or move side-to-side and then flop to the ground harder than Cristiano Ronaldo when his team is down 2-1. Say what you will about dogs, but they're pretty good at locomotion most of the time. When Sirius isn't falling over, you can use a game controller to do some fun stuff manually, like directing it to jump in four directions (left, right, forward, or back) and also activate some silly commands like making it sit and meow like a cat. I think if I'm going to give Sirius any credit, it's that the actuators used to move the dog around are pretty cool and can actually simulate the movements of a real dog fairly well. I suppose, depending on your feelings toward robots, that could also be a point against it, too. There's something vaguely uncanny valley about Sirius, and the weird, single robot eye on the dog's face probably doesn't help. Despite the fact that Sirius, with its onboard camera, can actually track your face, it cannot follow you around like other robot dogs like Xiaomi's Cyberdog. I think going for a walk is probably high on the list of things people would want to do with their new $1,200 pet, or toy, or AI companion, or… wait a second, what is this thing, actually? If you're reading these words (and I'm sorry if you are), please send me your coordinates so I can tell the police to save you from the evil villain Clockwork Oranging robot dog reviews into your eyeballs—then you may also be curious who Sirius is meant for. The short answer is I have no freaking clue. Is it a toy for serious adults who want an AI-programmable companion? Like, I don't know, Furby cute? I'm not positive, but if it's the latter, then I would venture to say that it's not really hitting the mark. Superficially, it looks like a cross between Boston Dynamics' Spot and a DJI drone, and functionally, it can do a little bit more than the robot dogs of yore, I guess. But in practice, it's just not very, I don't know… fun. There's a sort of binary that exists in gadgets, robot dogs included. As it stands, I don't think Sirius is hitting either of those marks, but in the end, the stakes are kind of low. I don't know who this robot dog is for, but some dogs have no master, right?

Using a game controller provided with my review unit, I tried parading Sirius around the Gizmodo office for shits and giggles but found that (especially when it's in autonomous mode) it would often get tripped up when I sent in an input to walk forward or move side-to-side and then flop to the ground harder than Cristiano Ronaldo when his team is down 2-1. Say what you will about dogs, but they're pretty good at locomotion most of the time. When Sirius isn't falling over, you can use a game controller to do some fun stuff manually, like directing it to jump in four directions (left, right, forward, or back) and also activate some silly commands like making it sit and meow like a cat. I think if I'm going to give Sirius any credit, it's that the actuators used to move the dog around are pretty cool and can actually simulate the movements of a real dog fairly well. I suppose, depending on your feelings toward robots, that could also be a point against it, too. There's something vaguely uncanny valley about Sirius, and the weird, single robot eye on the dog's face probably doesn't help. Despite the fact that Sirius, with its onboard camera, can actually track your face, it cannot follow you around like other robot dogs like Xiaomi's Cyberdog. I think going for a walk is probably high on the list of things people would want to do with their new $1,200 pet, or toy, or AI companion, or… wait a second, what is this thing, actually? If you're reading these words (and I'm sorry if you are), please send me your coordinates so I can tell the police to save you from the evil villain Clockwork Oranging robot dog reviews into your eyeballs—then you may also be curious who Sirius is meant for. The short answer is I have no freaking clue. Is it a toy for serious adults who want an AI-programmable companion? Like, I don't know, Furby cute? I'm not positive, but if it's the latter, then I would venture to say that it's not really hitting the mark. Superficially, it looks like a cross between Boston Dynamics' Spot and a DJI drone, and functionally, it can do a little bit more than the robot dogs of yore, I guess. But in practice, it's just not very, I don't know… fun. There's a sort of binary that exists in gadgets, robot dogs included. As it stands, I don't think Sirius is hitting either of those marks, but in the end, the stakes are kind of low. I don't know who this robot dog is for, but some dogs have no master, right? Then again, those dogs, sooner or later, often get sent to the pound… Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. With so many Bluetooth speakers out there, and more arriving almost daily, it can be easy to underestimate one that dwells in the middle ground. Sandwiched between the packable Soundlink Flex and the beefy Soundlink Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends), Bose's new midsize Soundlink Plus (no, these aren't streaming services) carves out its own niche thanks largely to winning sound with equal parts nuance and bravado. Medium build notwithstanding, this is still a hefty package, but if you're after a good compromise between boombox might and breezy portability, the Soundlink Plus abides. There's style in the Sound Plus's minimalism, with a sleek yet strong powder-coated steel grille, supple touch keys along its rubberized topside, and a hearty checkered nylon handle at the side that makes it easier to haul (or hang). At the back are vents for its four bass radiators and an open USB-C port. That said, it didn't take long for the orange-and-white flashing LED to return to solid white following a bath in my laundry sink, signaling a clear and ready port. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Measuring 9.1 x 3.94 x 3.4 inches (WxHxD) and weighing over 3 pounds, this is not the most packable speaker, but it's still game for the open road. It took me a while to get used to its heft, but it fared well on its first task after unboxing, a camping trip in the Columbia River Gorge. If it seems risky taking a shiny new lemon-meringue speaker into the dusty woods, you're not wrong, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the speaker cleans up. I'd still prefer either of those speakers for a hard fall—not because the Bose wouldn't survive, it's just more likely to get nicks or dents. The Charge 6's IP68 rating theoretically gives it bragging rights for water resistance, but all three are dunkable, like most speakers we test. Soundlink Plus features seem a little austere at first glance, but there's enough here to keep away feature envy. The unified Bose app's compact interface will be familiar to anyone with Bose headphones, with options like the ability to connect to two devices over Bluetooth multipoint, a three-band EQ and presets, and monitoring for battery and volume. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. A single point of customization lets you swap one of the Plus' topside control keys from linking with other Bose speakers like the Flex and Max to become a Spotify quick key. You can stereo pair two Soundlink Plus speakers, and Android users will get handy extras like Google Fast Pair and aptX Adaptive support for high-quality Bluetooth streaming. It falls to around 15 hours (or less) if you crank it above that, so it would have been nice to get a full 24 hours like you'll get with some cheaper competitors, including the Charge 6 and Beats' latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends), especially since it's designed to charge other devices via the USB port. Options you don't get include a speaker phone, an Aux input/USB-C playback, or future-proofing features like Auracast audio sharing, something JBL's latest speakers already employ. Admittedly, Aurcast isn't very useful yet since most source devices don't support it, but it would be nice as an option at this price. That said, it could be something Bose plans to add later. I spent multiple weeks with the Soundlink Plus accompanying me to backyard barbecues and events. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Multiple times during my review, I was struck by the delicacy and touch with which it handles instruments, delighting in crisp acoustic guitars, rich vocals, crunchy woodwinds, and pillowy brass across registers. At one point, I swapped it for the SVS Prime Wireless Pro currently in my living room, and was surprised how well it filled the room in relief with clear, full sound. In general, the Plus offers better detail and can still let things loose at high volume. Occasionally, the little tweeter feels like it's trying to do too much, adding some extra sizzle and brashness and/or distortion if you really punch it. It would have been nice to get two tweeters for some stereo separation. There's certainly an abundance of choice for portable Bluetooth speakers, but the Soundlink Plus stakes its ground with a premium build and impressive sound. If you can handle its price (and Bose fans are pretty used to doing so), the Plus is a worthy sonic companion. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But no matter how much proof he posts online, people keep calling him fake. Saeed has been raising money online to feed his family. But many people on social media have been convinced that he isn't real at all. They believe he's an AI-generated creation, used by scammers to get donations through crowdfunding platforms from well-meaning people. And in a world where AI videos and images have flooded our digital spaces, it's easy to understand why some people are so skeptical. The controversy started with a photo posted in May that features Saeed asking for help. Howard Arson led the charges against Saeed, pointing out his blanket had some odd words woven within it. Arson pointed to two words on the blanket: “pealistic” and “spfcation,” which seemed to be misspellings of “realistic” and “specification.” Arson suspected that it was evidence the image was made with AI, a result of someone asking an artificial intelligence tool to make a realistic blanket and spitting this out: Saeed posted several photos and a video showing the blanket to prove it was real, but that didn't put the accusations to rest. People were convinced that AI video has become advanced enough that Saeed could be a completely artificial being—an AI agent, as Arson told Gizmodo over direct messages. Arson, who has over 20,000 followers on Bluesky, was getting a lot of attention for his claims, helping them spread across the relatively niche social network. “He's seen as a trustworthy figure by many, while unfortunately, I don't have the same following or credibility.” Saeed told Gizmodo he previously raiseed money on PayPal but now fundraises on GoFundMe through a campaign run by a person he trusts in France who sends him the money. After it gets to France, the money is sent through wire transfers into Gaza, which he says is “reliable and secure,” explaining, “We rely on these channels because we simply have no other options available.” It has a tutorial on its website for how to do that safely. The GoFundMe team collects documentation like IDs, receipts for expenses, and other proof to make sure funds are delivered to the beneficiary. A spokesperson from GoFundMe told Gizmodo it has verified Saeed's campaign. “When a GoFundMe fundraiser is created, we prioritize distributing funds while also helping ensure compliance with relevant international laws, global regulations, and requirements dictated by our payment processors,” the spokesperson continued. “We're working around the clock to help ensure humanitarian relief funds are delivered safely and quickly to those in need, helping families access essentials, rebuild, and recover through the generosity of their communities.” “Unfortunately i don't want a claim i can't prove connected to my name, which is why—even though i'm very skeptical still—i took down the actual claim and any references directly to the guy in question,” Arson told Gizmodo over Bluesky. Arson told Gizmodo he's an American and recognized his country was helping Israel flatten Gaza and kill tens of thousands of people. But he remained unconvinced that Saeed was a real person and seemed frustrated that AI had become so advanced he wasn't sure what to believe. “I have no idea whatsoever what it is like to be there. on one end you have people with money and on the other you have people paying $300 for a bag of lentils in a manufactured and intentional famine.” Arson acknowledged that his perspective could be warped by seeing so many fake images created with AI. “The way people get this stuff wrong, and the way I possibly have, is that they end up in a world where half the stuff they look at is synthetic and half of it is real, and presume that 50/50 is the distriubtion [sic] everywhere they look,” Arson told Gizmodo. Arson pointed to another example of a photo that he previously thought was fake but is actually real. All three people are wearing sandals, though the boy's left leg has a white plaster cast. But it was the woman's sandal that raised suspicions. The sandal has a panda head logo, along with an odd mix of words: “HAPPY LUCKY rlorE DNUI.” It's the kind of thing that would immediately raise red flags for anyone on the lookout for AI images being circulated online. Gizmodo spoke with the woman in the photo, Sahar AlAjrami, over video call to verify she was a real person in Gaza. GoFundMe told Gizmodo that the fundraising campaigns for both Sahar, who's trying to raise money to feed her children, and Ahmed have been verified as authentic. It's not clear who designed the sandals bearing such mangled English, but they are absolutely real. And it's perhaps notable that June 2022 predates the first widely available AI image generators, which didn't really open up to the public until late 2022. Sahar is most concerned for her 10-year-old son Odai, who was shot in the foot by an Israeli quadcopter drone. While amateur sleuths on the internet were fixated on her sandals, it was her son's foot in that photo that should've been drawing the attention. Sahar says painkillers and other medicines aren't being allowed into Gaza and she hopes she can get him to Egypt for treatment. Gazans like Sahar and Saeed are far from the only people having a hard time proving their identities in a skeptical social media environment. Bluesky has received criticism from activists in recent months as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive but are getting banned left and right for allegedly being scammers or bots. Hany Abu Hilal is an English teacher in Gaza with three young kids that Gizmodo also verified as a real person through his Palestinian ID and a video call. “My flat was completely burnt and then completely destroyed,” he told Gizmodo, explaining that he lives in a tent in Khan Younis which can't shield them properly from the heat or the cold. Can't even bring a loaf of bread for my three kids because I am jobless and I do not have money,” Hany told Gizmodo. At least 549 people in Gaza have been killed in recent weeks near aid sites, according to the CBC, and more than 4,000 have been injured trying to access food from the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-based group registered to an empty office in Delaware. Reporting from the Associated Press suggests it's not just the Israeli military but U.S. contractors who have fired on crowds of Palestinians trying to get aid. Hany says he's had to evacuate 12 times since the start of the war, a common story for people who have been internally displaced by Israel's invasion of Gaza. While we've verified Hany is a real person, we were unable to reach Chuffed, a fundraising site based in Australia, to get more information about their processes for verifying campaigns. And perhaps no English-language account on Bluesky has done more to raise awareness of the Palestinian plight on the platform than Molly Shah, a 45-year-old American activist based in Berlin. Shah is originally from Kentucky, and she tells Gizmodo that she moved to Germany in 2017 and has previously worked as a lawyer fighting eviction cases. Molly says the people she talks to in Gaza struggle with social media users calling them fake. “I talk to people every single day who have seen and faced some of the worst things you can possibly imagine, and the most distressing conversations I have are often around losing their accounts or being called scammers,” Molly said. “I think that is because people in Gaza have lost almost everything, but the one thing they do have left is their identities, and being banned or called fake attacks even that.” Molly has spotted fakes on Bluesky and acknowledges that there are scammers trying to take advantage of the situation. But they are the minority, and she's shared things to look out for, including people who only use news photos for their fundraising campaigns. Bluesky told Gizmodo that it understands people in Gaza need platforms to share their experiences and seek support, saying the company is “committed to ensuring they can be heard on Bluesky.” But the platform said that its moderation teams have to “distinguish between genuine advocacy and coordinated inauthentic behavior.” “In some cases, our investigations have revealed networks where single individuals operate hundreds of accounts engaging in bulk messaging, identical replies across unrelated conversations, and mass following—behaviors that disrupt the platform experience for all users regardless of the underlying cause,” Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky's Head of Trust & Safety, told Gizmodo over email. In other cases, malicious actors create bulk networks of accounts to target users on Bluesky and exploit goodwill towards crises,” Rodericks continued. The social media company told Gizmodo that its moderation decisions “aren't always perfect, which is why we maintain an appeals process,” but said users need to focus on operating a single account that follows community guidelines. Rodericks said it would be “publishing more guidance in the near-term to help advocacy accounts stay within our rules while sharing their messages,” but didn't respond to Gizmodo's follow-up questions about when that guidance would be coming. Even if Americans do find a fundraising campaign they trust, some folks are worried about what the U.S. government will do to them if they donate to people in Gaza, given the authoritarian and anti-Muslim tendencies of the Trump administration. And that has translated to terrifying actions in the U.S. domestically. Trump has been enacting racist and often illegal policies targeting foreign students, with a special emphasis on attacking people protesting against Israel's war on Gaza. Google's latest AI video creation tool, Veo 3, has been a game-changer that further muddies the waters. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by Israel and the U.S., has been accused of running an unsafe and ineffective aid organization that's getting hundreds of people killed. But it's also been accused of making fake videos. One video created by the GHF and distributed to right-wing news outlets like the Daily Wire was understandably called fake when it was published on social media in late May. A source at one of the Gaza distribution sites tells me that Hamas set up a roadblock to prevent Gazans from getting aid. They broke through it and were shouting “thank you America” upon reaching the site. Reached for comment over email, an unnamed spokesperson for GHF told Gizmodo the video is real, sending along a screenshot of metadata from an iPhone 15 Pro showing where it was taken in Gaza. GHF initially offered to let Gizmodo speak with the cameraman but didn't send us the raw video file we asked for and never connected us with the cameraman who was “on a plane back to America.” GHF has given contradictory statements publicly about its activities, with the head of the organization Johnnie Moore recently telling the BBC that no one had died near their aid distribution sites before saying he wasn't contesting that people had died just a few minutes later. How does anyone know what's real in that kind of environment? Gizmodo has been debunking viral photos for over a decade, and many viral fakes even predate the invention of Photoshop by decades. But AI has changed the game in so many ways. So people are forced to either figure out their own ways of determining what's real or just throwing up their hands and deciding it's too hard to authenticate. The toll has been immense, with children getting hit particularly hard. Over 50,000 kids have been killed or injured since October 2023, according to figures from UNICEF. There are entire accounts on X, which became an extremist far-right platform after it was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022, that are dedicated to so-called “Pallywood,” a play on the name Hollywood, which allege the people of Gaza are faking the war crimes being committed against them.
