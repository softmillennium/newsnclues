                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Humanity Protocol (H) experienced a meteoric rise of nearly 380%, driven by major listings and institutional backing. Hashflow (HFT) followed closely, with a surge of over 80% in 24 hours, thanks to its Solana integrations and the regulatory tailwinds provided by the GENIUS Act. Even meme coins like MOODENG and BONK posted solid gains, indicating a rising risk appetite in the market. Sui (SUI) continues to attract institutional inflows and developer interest, while Arbitrum (ARB) made headlines with its Timeboost upgrade and Robinhood's tokenization push. The protocol leverages zkProofs to solve real-world identity issues, boasting millions of users across its testnet and mobile app. Backed by major VCs like Pantera Capital and Jump, it recently acquired on-chain ticketing giant Moongate and partnered with Prenetics, a NASDAQ-listed firm, which will hold H in its treasury, fueling further confidence. Hashflow (HFT) has stolen the spotlight this week after soaring over 80% in 24 hours, thanks to Solana ecosystem integrations and renewed investor interest. Its unique RFQ model and cross-chain smart routing differentiate it in the crowded DEX space. With $25B in RFQ volume processed, over $500M in liquidity offered, and exposure via Binance Launchpool, it's seeing increased attention ahead of its next token unlock on July 7. The GENIUS Act's passage may also provide regulatory tailwinds for DeFi projects like HFT. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surged nearly 90% this week as the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish. Analysts suggest a breakout above $0.018 could propel the token toward $0.028. It's now testing the 200-day moving average around $0.00001881, considered a key breakout zone. If it clears this, the next upside targets lie at $0.00002580 and eventually $0.000039. MOODENG exploded 60% this week following its listing on Upbit (KRW, BTC, USDT pairs). Arbitrum (ARB) is back in the spotlight with the success of its Timeboost feature, a transaction ordering mechanism that has already generated $2 million in fees. This technical edge is now being enhanced by Robinhood's rollout of tokenized stocks on Arbitrum Orbit, with plans for a full Layer-2 deployment. As Ethereum's leading L2, ARB is now poised to benefit from both DeFi and TradFi convergence. With Grayscale adding SUI to its high-growth watchlist and TVL touching $1.8B, institutional sentiment remains strong. Despite fears around a $123M token unlock, no major sell-offs were observed. Meanwhile, its parallel execution model and over 140 live dApps continue reinforcing developer interest. Ripple is now pursuing a U.S. banking license while exploring custody options for RLUSD. Mercado Bitcoin's $200M tokenization initiative on XRPL and growing institutional interest in tokenized assets are building a solid case for XRP's use in real-world asset liquidity. The court's reaffirmation of XRP's non-security status is cementing its institutional appeal. Bitcoin had a quieter week in terms of price action but not fundamentals. Spot ETF inflows exceeded $600M, while long-dormant whales moved over $4.3B worth of BTC after 14 years. BlackRock's ETF alone now holds $76B, and Fannie Mae's consideration of BTC as mortgage collateral marks a pivotal TradFi shift. Regulatory clarity from the SEC and global reserve interest like Trump's BITCOIN Act are strengthening BTC's macro legitimacy, positioning it as the top digital asset for long-term institutional holding. The coins showing the most momentum, H, HFT, SUI, MOODENG, are not just riding hype cycles; they're backed by infrastructure upgrades, cross-chain integrations, or mainstream adoption plays. The memecoin segment is also attracting renewed interest, particularly on Solana, where BONK and MOODENG continue to outperform—indicating that retail is slowly creeping back into the market. DeFi infrastructure tokens like ARB and HFT are gaining both from technical upgrades and regulatory support, suggesting early accumulation by traders betting on Q3 upside.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine logging into your Amazon account or walking into a Walmart, and instead of paying with a credit card or cash, you use digital dollars issued by Amazon or Walmart themselves. This isn't sci-fi - it's the very real possibility of Amazon and Walmart launching their own stablecoins (digital currencies pegged to real money like the US dollar). Such a move could shake up the way we shop, bank, and pay, in ways that both disrupt the financial system and improve everyday customer experiences. In this blog, we'll break down what's going on in simple terms and why it matters, even if you're not into crypto or tech. What on Earth Is a Stablecoin, Anyway? Think of it like a digital dollar bill stored in an app on your phone. Unlike Bitcoin, a stablecoin's price doesn't swing wildly; it's stable (hence the name) because it's backed by real assets or currency reserves. In other words, it's the digital lovechild of crypto and cash: it lives on a blockchain (a fancy public ledger on the internet) but behaves a lot like the money in your bank account. Why would you care about a digital dollar? Because it can make money super easy to move around. You could send a stablecoin to anyone in the world in seconds, 24/7, like sending an email - no bank scheduling needed. For example, a farmer in India could sell goods to a buyer in Brazil and get paid within minutes using stablecoins, without either of them worrying about exchange rates or a payment getting held up. Stablecoins take away the “Will $100 today be $90 tomorrow?” anxiety - $100 in a stablecoin is designed to stay $100 tomorrow. This reliability has made stablecoins hugely popular in the crypto world: by 2024, people were transacting trillions of dollars in stablecoins each year, even surpassing some major credit card networks in volume! In short, stablecoins are digital cash that's fast, global, and doesn't fluctuate in value - perfect for everyday money matters. Retail Giants Jumping In: What's the Big Deal? Amazon and Walmart, the two retail behemoths, have reportedly been exploring launching their own stablecoins (imagine something like “Amazon Coin” or “Wal-Coin”). When companies of this size and reach delve into crypto, it sends a strong signal across industries. If Amazon or Walmart creates a stablecoin, it could suddenly bring this digital money into the mainstream in a massive way. Why would they bother creating their own currency? The short answer: to save money and improve your shopping experience. Today, when you buy something on Amazon or swipe your card at Walmart, banks and credit card networks (like Visa or Mastercard) take a cut (via processing fees, interchange fees, etc.). Those fees might be invisible to you, but they cost retailers billions. Reports suggest Walmart and Amazon want to use stablecoins to cut out the middlemen - no bank or card network needed - which could save them billions in credit card fees over time. In fact, the news alone of these retailers considering stablecoins sent credit card company stocks tumbling, because it's a direct threat to their fee-based business. But it's not just about fattening Walmart's or Amazon's profit margins. Crucially, some of those savings could trickle down to shoppers. With their own stablecoin, Amazon could reduce prices or offer discounts when you pay with “Amazon Coins” - essentially rewarding you for using their currency. (They already do something similar with their store credit cards; a stablecoin could amplify that.) Likewise, Walmart might give cash-back in Wal-Coins or special deals to loyal customers who adopt its coin. The appeal for these companies lies in locking in customer loyalty and keeping you within their shopping ecosystem. A Walmart Coin, for instance, might work like a super-charged store credit: you'd be more inclined to spend it at Walmart, and in return you might get better prices or perks - a win-win for loyalty. Let's break down the potential benefits these retail stablecoins could offer, both to the companies and to everyday people: If they pull it off, paying for your groceries or gadgets might never be the same. Shaking Up Banks and Credit Cards (Financial System Disruption) It's not just about tech giants playing banker - this trend could rattle the traditional financial system. If millions of customers start holding and spending Amazon Coins or Walmart Coins, that money isn't sitting in bank accounts anymore. So if Amazon and Walmart convince everyone to load up their apps with stablecoins, banks might have to scramble. One finance writer warned that this stablecoin shift could force banks to reevaluate their whole model, as they risk losing a key source of funding. Then there are the credit card networks. For decades, Visa, Mastercard, and AmEx have sat in the middle of our transactions, quietly taking a cut every time you swipe or tap. Retailer stablecoins could cut these middlemen out of many transactions. If you pay Amazon directly with Amazon Coin, Visa doesn't earn a cent from that sale. Multiply that by millions of sales and you see why this is a huge threat to the card companies. In fact, accepting stablecoins could help retailers sidestep those hefty interchange fees (the fees merchants pay to card issuers) entirely. Less reliance on credit cards also means consumers might not need to run up balances on high-interest cards for everyday purchases - you could use a stablecoin that represents actual money you have, not borrow on credit. It's telling that when the news broke about Amazon and Walmart's stablecoin explorations, Visa's stock price dropped ~5% and Mastercard's ~4% - investors know this could shake up the status quo. From a customer's perspective, these changes could be positive, but they come with new considerations. On the plus side, as we noted, shoppers could enjoy simpler and cheaper payments. Who wouldn't want a payment method that's as quick as a text message and doesn't ding you with hidden fees? Consumers are always chasing anything that saves time or money, and stablecoins promise both. You might get the same $50 value to spend, but because it's in an Amazon/Walmart coin, you skip extra charges and maybe even earn perks. If Amazon or Walmart holds some of your funds in their coin, they'll need to provide customer service and security on par with banks. People will expect that their Amazon Dollars are safe, insured, and easily refundable if something goes wrong - otherwise they won't trust it for their paycheck or savings. This is new territory for retailers: dealing with fraud claims, lost passwords, or technical glitches that affect money. As one Nasdaq analysis put it, traditional players and new stablecoin systems will be in a “collision course,” and customer trust and service will be tested in new ways as we all adjust to this hybrid of retail and finance. In other words, Amazon might need to staff up its customer support not just for late packages, but for issues like “I sent $100 in Amazon Coin to the wrong person, help!” It's a big responsibility. Banks won't go down without a fight, either. We might see them respond by offering their own digital currencies or better deals to keep customers onboard. Some are already lobbying for clearer regulations to ensure a level playing field. Ultimately, the entry of retail giants into currency creation is blurring the lines between tech companies and financial institutions. The challenge is ensuring stability and fairness - regulators will be watching closely to make sure these new coins are safe and don't destabilize the wider economy. But make no mistake, the financial system is poised for a shake-up. As one expert noted, money might shift from bank accounts to digital wallets managed by retailers, and that changes decades-old financial norms. It's akin to a power shift: some power moving away from Wall Street and the banking sector, into the hands of Silicon Valley and Main Street retail companies. A New Era for Everyday Shoppers (Customer Experience 2.0) Beyond the big finance implications, what would your day-to-day experience look like in an Amazon/Walmart stablecoin world? Both Amazon and Walmart built their empires by obsessing over customers. Amazon, in particular, has set gold standards for convenience - remember how they made two-day shipping the norm? So, imagine the same kind of focus being applied to how you pay and manage your money as a customer. For one, payments could become almost invisible. If you're using an Amazon stablecoin, it might be integrated right into your Amazon app or browser. This removes a lot of the minor friction that we've just accepted up until now. Think about Uber: you get out of the car and the payment happens without you doing anything. Stablecoin payments could bring that kind of effortlessness to many more transactions. You might simply scan a code in the Walmart app at a store, and your Walmart Coin balance instantly transfers to the store for your purchase. No counting cash or waiting for chip readers; it's as fast as handing over a dollar, but digitally. Customer service around finances might improve in some ways. For instance, refunds and returns could be processed quicker. If you return an item, rather than waiting 5-7 business days for your bank to reflect the refund, the retailer could just release your stablecoins back to you on the spot. Also, consider loyalty programs: instead of juggling gift cards, coupons, and rewards points, a stablecoin could unify these. Your rewards might be in the coin itself. Starbucks had a huge success with its Starbucks card/digital app - effectively customers pre-load money and are rewarded for it. Amazon and Walmart stablecoins could work similarly but on a larger scale. It's simpler and more tangible than points that you later convert. Data from stablecoin transactions can give retailers insights into customer habits. (Amazon already excels at using data to recommend products and streamline your experience.) Now, that does raise privacy questions, but it could also mean Amazon/Walmart tailor deals very closely to your needs. For example, if Walmart's data sees you often transfer money to family abroad using Walmart Coin, maybe they offer a new low-cost remittance service just for that. Or Amazon notices you spend a lot on electronics, so paying with Amazon Coin gives you an extra warranty or support plan automatically. The possibilities for innovative customer perks are wide open. However, we should note: using a retailer's currency means you're somewhat tied to their ecosystem. Amazon might make it easy to pay other merchants with Amazon Coin via its payment gateway, but if it doesn't, you're incentivized to keep shopping on Amazon to use your balance. Some critics might say this gives companies even more control over our spending. On the other hand, if it comes with enough benefits (savings, speed, inclusion), people may be fine with that trade-off. Security and trust will be paramount for a good experience. These stablecoins would need to be ultra-secure (Amazon and Walmart will likely implement strong security to prevent hacks or fraud). They know that one high-profile hacking incident could sour consumers on the whole idea. And because not everyone is crypto-savvy, expect Amazon and Walmart to hide the blockchain complexity under a very user-friendly interface. You might never have to think about private keys or crypto wallets - it'll just be your Amazon account balance. This “hiding of the tech” is key for mass adoption; people will use what's convenient and trustworthy, not what's technically cool. So, a big part of the customer experience change is that using digital currency could become as easy as using a gift card or a Starbucks app, without needing to know how the underlying system works. Lastly, think about those who have limited access to banking today. A Walmart stablecoin could be loaded at the store with cash and then used online or in-store, bridging a gap for people who don't have credit cards. It effectively can turn cash into a versatile digital payment. That's a significant service improvement for many customers - no bank account needed, no prepaid card fees; just convert cash to Walmart Coin and you're set to shop or even send money to others at low cost. In a way, Amazon and Walmart might compete with banks by offering a quasi-bank account experience (minus lending, for now) that lives on your phone. To sum up, the change in customer experience could be dramatic: faster and cheaper payments, more rewards, simpler global transactions, and greater inclusion for those left out by the current banking system. If executed well, you as a shopper might say: “Wow, paying for stuff is easier and more rewarding than it used to be!” The key will be whether Amazon and Walmart can build enough trust and demonstrate clear benefits to get everyday people on board. Given their track record of shifting consumer expectations (Amazon made free two-day shipping an expectation, Walmart made one-stop discount shopping a norm), there's a good chance they could make stablecoins the next big thing without most shoppers even batting an eye. You might wonder, why are we hearing about this now? Two big reasons: regulatory green lights and crypto going mainstream. For years, crypto was like the wild west - exciting but unregulated, which made big companies wary. This law sets strict rules (like requiring stablecoin issuers to fully back coins with real reserves and be transparent), which is exactly the clarity companies like Amazon and Walmart were waiting for. As one commentator noted, with clear guidelines now in place, “what's to stop an Amazon or a Walmart from rolling out a ‘Wal-Coin' for easy shopping payments?”. Regulatory green lights tend to bring innovation out of the shadows. Suddenly, using crypto for everyday things doesn't feel like tiptoeing through a legal gray area - it can be as normal as swiping a debit card. In short, Uncle Sam gave a cautious nod to stablecoins, and that opened the floodgates for serious corporate interest. At the same time, public perception of crypto has evolved. It's not just seen as Monopoly money or speculation anymore. Over the last five years, major cryptocurrencies proved their staying power with massive growth (from 2020 to 2025, Bitcoin and friends vastly outperformed stocks, real estate, and gold), and more importantly, the underlying technology proved useful. A recent survey found nearly 30% of Fortune 500 companies were using or exploring stablecoins in 2025, up from only 8% the year before. Companies realized they can't ignore this trend without risking being left behind. It's not just the finance geeks anymore - household-name companies are dabbling in digital dollars for things like faster payments, loyalty programs, and global commerce. So Amazon and Walmart's moves are part of a bigger momentum. Even state governments got in on the action: crypto-friendly states like Wyoming are experimenting with issuing their own stablecoins to modernize local finance. In other words, everyone from policymakers to corporations seems to be converging on the idea that digitally-native money has a place in our future. It's the same reason we're seeing other non-bank players (even companies like Uber or Starbucks) looking into financial services - technology is enabling new contenders to enter what used to be a bank-only arena. If they succeed, Amazon and Walmart could not only make shopping more convenient for customers, but also insert themselves into the financial lives of those customers in a way that increases each customer's lifetime value to the company. How will they handle refunds, fraud, or mistaken transactions? Regulators globally are scrutinizing stablecoins more than ever - companies will need to navigate rules carefully, comply with anti-money-laundering checks, and make sure they have solid cybersecurity. The good news is that giants like Amazon and Walmart have the resources to address these issues seriously. If they do launch coins, you can bet they'll roll them out slowly and with a lot of safety nets (perhaps starting in a pilot program or for limited uses). In summary, Amazon and Walmart creating stablecoins is a big deal because it marks the moment where futuristic finance meets everyday shopping. It's like two worlds colliding - techy crypto and your weekly grocery run - with potentially transformative results. It could reshape who we trust with our money, how we earn rewards and pay for things, and even who gets to participate in the financial system. And importantly, it's happening in a climate that's finally ready for it: governments are giving thumbs-ups, technology is proven, and people are open to new digital conveniences. We are looking at the early days of a retail-finance revolution that might just make your life easier (and render that leather wallet a lot less important). Buckle up - the way we think about money and shopping might be about to change in a very big way. Superficially, they sound similar - all represent value you can spend at the store - but a stablecoin is more powerful. Gift cards are usually only usable at the issuing store and often can't be transferred easily or used for other purposes. An Amazon/Walmart stablecoin would be a digital token typically pegged 1:1 to the dollar, meaning 1 coin equals $1 in value. Unlike a gift card, it could potentially be used beyond just the issuer's platform (for example, to pay other merchants who accept it, or even person-to-person payments). It lives on a blockchain, so you could send it to someone else instantly as payment, which you definitely can't do with a gift card. Also, stablecoins can be reconverted to cash (depending on how they design it), whereas gift cards are usually a one-way exchange (cash → card). Importantly, Amazon/Walmart stablecoins would likely integrate with loyalty programs and possibly earn rewards or discounts, functioning as both a payment method and a rewards system in one. What's in it for Amazon and Walmart? Why would they give customers discounts to use the stablecoin? Currently, they pay billions in fees to banks and credit card companies for processing payments. If they get you to use their coin, they avoid those fees and keep the money in-house. That gives them room to incentivize you - for example, giving a small discount or cash-back in stablecoin for paying with it - while still coming out ahead because they've cut out the card middleman. Also, when customers use the stablecoin, they tend to stay within that ecosystem (you're likely to spend Amazon Coins on Amazon, for instance), which boosts customer loyalty and lifetime value. They also gain valuable data on spending habits across their platform. So, offering you a 2% discount for using Amazon Coin could be totally worth it if it means they avoid a 3% card fee and lock in more of your purchases. It's similar to how credit card reward points work, but here the retailer can potentially offer even better rewards since they're gaining more efficiency on the back end. Will the value of my Amazon Coin go up and down? No - in fact, the whole point of a stablecoin is that it doesn't swing in value like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies do. One Amazon Coin would almost certainly be pegged to one US dollar (Amazon hasn't confirmed specifics, but that's the typical model). So it's designed to be stable in price. If you have $50 worth of Walmart Coin today, it should be $50 worth tomorrow, next week, next year, etc. Bitcoin, by contrast, can be $50 one day and $60 or $40 the next day - great for investors or traders, not so great for buying your groceries. Amazon/Walmart's stablecoins would be more like digital dollars that live in a special wallet. They will likely be fully backed by actual dollars or dollar-equivalents in a bank to maintain that peg (some stablecoins do this with reserves). So you shouldn't expect any profit or loss from just holding the retail stablecoin; it's meant for spending, not investing. In everyday use, using Amazon Coin would feel a lot like using USD, just within Amazon's system. On one hand, Amazon and Walmart are huge, reputable companies that people generally trust for commerce. They would likely ensure their stablecoin is fully redeemable (you can get your dollars out) and secure. They'd also have to comply with financial regulations, which adds safeguards. However, there are a few risks to keep in mind: Overall, if implemented carefully, using a stablecoin from these companies could be safe and convenient, but it's wise to start slow. Treat it like you would any new financial app: maybe you don't move your whole paycheck into it on day one. Try small transactions, see how it works, and get comfortable. These firms will be heavily scrutinized by both regulators and the public, so they have a strong incentive to get it right and not betray customer trust. How would I actually use an Amazon or Walmart stablecoin? Do I need to learn about crypto wallets? Chances are, Amazon and Walmart will make it super simple. If they launch these stablecoins, expect an update to the Amazon app or Walmart app that introduces a built-in digital wallet. You might see a balance in “Amazon Coins” alongside your usual account info. To get coins, you might convert cash or credit to stablecoin within the app (for example, spend $20 from your bank to buy 20 Amazon Coins) or simply receive them as change/rewards. For usage, at checkout there'd be a new option like “Pay with Amazon Coin” or it might even default to it. In-store at Walmart, it could be as easy as scanning your phone at the register; the app would deduct your Walmart Coin balance to pay. They will hide the blockchain stuff under the hood - you won't need to manage private keys or deal with complicated crypto addresses. It will feel like using PayPal or Apple Pay, but branded to the retailer. In fact, some experts say it might be as seamless as swiping your debit card - crypto without the crypto headache is the goal. For advanced users, there might be an option to withdraw your coins to an external crypto wallet (if it's on a public blockchain), but average users probably won't ever need to. So, no, you likely won't have to become a crypto guru. *"Crypto's Great Government Booster: How New Laws Are Turbocharging Web3 Adoption. *"From Piggy Banks to Blockchains: How Web3 Is Transforming Traditional Finance. *"What Is DeFi and Why It Matters for Everyday People. *"Move Over, Wall Street: Injective Is Building the Future of Finance. *"Digital Assets Are Humbling Wall Street's Best. *"The Rise of Digital Solutions in Traditional Industries. *"Flying Fancy: Why Upgrading to First Class Is a Power Move. *"Stop Patching, Start Building: Tech's Future Runs on LLMs. *"Not Just Cars and Rockets: The Power of a Big Mission Statement. *"The Growth Trifecta: Governments' Smartest Long-Term Bets. *"When Public Spending Backfires: Governments' Most Counterproductive Investments. *"Ripple Is Reshaping Payments for the Real World. *"The Builder Economy Is Transforming UI Development. *"What Is Generative UI and Why Does It Matter? *"Ready for Rosie: AI and Computer Vision Are Fueling a Home Robotics Revolution. *"The Agentic Revolution: How AI Tools Are Empowering Everyday People. *"LLMs Are Replacing Search: SEO vs GEO. *"Starlink: Internet Beamed from Space (And It's Freaking Cool). *"United Airlines Upgrade Hack: Snag First or Business Class for Less. *"Amazon and Walmart Stablecoins Challenge Traditional Banking. *"Why Walmart and Amazon Are Reportedly Considering Their Own Crypto Stablecoins. *"Walmart & Amazon Explore Stablecoins: Retail Payments Revolution?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. The numbers don't lie: Ethereum's blockchain just processed more transactions in a single day than ever before, hitting a staggering 24.45 million transactions according to OnchainHQ analyst for on-chain, Leon Waidmann. For context, this represents a massive leap from Ethereum's historical averages. The new record of 24.45 million daily transactions represents a 24x increase from those 2021 levels. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: The growth of Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism has dramatically reduced transaction costs while maintaining security through Ethereum's main chain. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly building on Ethereum, bringing enterprise-level transaction volumes that dwarf retail activity. While this still lags behind traditional payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V), which can handle 65,000 TPS, it represents a quantum leap for blockchain technology. Ethereum hit 17.4 million weekly active addresses, up 16.95% in May, indicating that the transaction surge isn't just about existing users being more active—new participants are joining the ecosystem at an accelerating pace. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. Network Effects in Action: Higher transaction volume typically correlates with increased demand for ETH, which is required to pay gas fees. With 24.45 million daily transactions, that's substantial consistent demand for the native token. Competitive Positioning: While other blockchains tout higher theoretical throughput, Ethereum's actual usage demonstrates real-world demand and developer preference. Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain development space, with 1,695 active developers as of last month. EIP-9698 proposes increasing gas limits by 100x, but such upgrades require careful implementation to maintain network security. Market Volatility: The price of Ethereum is $2,416 today, still well below its previous all-time highs, showing that transaction volume doesn't immediately translate to price appreciation. See Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase. Ethereum's transaction record represents more than just a technical milestone—it signals the network's evolution from experimental technology to critical financial infrastructure. However, sustainable growth requires continued innovation in scaling solutions and gas fee optimization. The real test isn't whether Ethereum can handle 24.45 million transactions once, but whether it can consistently process this volume while maintaining security and reasonable costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although FLOKI is often categorized as a meme coin, its ecosystem has long featured gaming-related functionality, including NFT-based characters, play-to-earn mechanics, and token integration for in-game rewards. On June 30, 2025, FLOKI officially launched Valhalla, a blockchain-based game inspired by Norse mythology. The game runs on opBNB, a Layer-2 network designed to enable fast and inexpensive transactions. Players take control of Veras — customizable NFT characters — in a browser-based, turn-based tactical MMORPG that blends combat, exploration, and questing with blockchain-backed rewards. The play-to-earn economy is built around FLOKI tokens, which players earn by completing in-game tasks and winning battles. To support the game's rollout, the FLOKI team has committed millions of dollars from its treasury to fund development, marketing campaigns, and in-game incentives. That long-term investment signals the project's intention to build a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem rather than a short-term promotional play. Method will serve as a strategic content partner, producing onboarding materials, game guides, and live coverage to help Valhalla appeal to both traditional gamers and crypto-native audiences. These developments represent a pivotal moment in FLOKI's evolution, as the project attempts to move beyond its meme origins and establish itself at the intersection of Web3 technology, entertainment, and digital asset ownership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum price is currently locked in a narrow trading range of around $2,500, with momentum stalling despite the market's bullish expectations. In light of this, a leading crypto analyst warns that current price action lacks the strength needed for a powerful upward move, urging traders to remain cautious. The analyst notes that without a clear breakout signal, entering the market now could expose investors to potential downside risks. A new analysis released on the X social media platform by market expert Daan Crypto Trades reveals that the Ethereum price has continued to trade within a well-defined price channel, currently holding above the $2,500 level at $2,527. The market expert shared a chart highlighting that ETH remains confined between a “range low” of $2,313 and a high of $2,736, with multiple failed attempts to break out of this tight structure. Daan Crypto Trades explains that the reason for Ethereum's sluggish performance is its continued struggle to establish a solid footing in the $2,500 price region. Given the unstable market environment, Daan Crypto Trades suggests that until Ethereum breaks and holds above the $2,800 mark, traders are likely to face more sideways action and unpredictable price swings. A clean breakout above $2,800 could be the key to the start of a bullish trend, improving conditions for ETH and pushing it out of its present downtrend. Market expert Mister Crypto has also shared insights on the current Ethereum price action. The analyst declared in a recent X post that ETH is on the verge of exiting a prolonged multi-year consolidation phase. His chart, which visualizes the cryptocurrency's historical price movements, marks two key periods—a powerful 48x rally from 2018 through 2021, followed by a four-year horizontal consolidation range that spans from the 2021 top to the present day. The analysis suggests that this extended period of range-bound movement could be a prelude to a potentially explosive bull trend, similar to the breakout seen in the past. In line with this, Mister Crypto marks a large open-ended “?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) could disappear within the next few years, according to Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan's Kinexys. Speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025, Zaltsman said JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging onchain assets, signaling what could be a tipping point for mainstream blockchain adoption. The banking giant recently piloted synchronized settlement technology with Chainlink, allowing JPMorgan's blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across different blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone a “very early sign” of how major banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets. Related: TradFi will keep its distance until DeFi becomes a manageable risk Zaltsman predicted that the artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance would dissolve faster than many expected, driven by improved infrastructure and growing industry willingness to work together. “It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support,” she added. “I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries,” Zaltsmann said. Unlike stablecoins, these deposit tokens stay within the bank's deposit system while offering clients direct access to blockchain-based markets, effectively bridging onchain liquidity with institutional cash management. Related: TradFi could move onchain due to ‘horrible banking experiences' “What JPMorgan does is that it can drive a lot of the other banking institutions in the world to take notice,” he said. Nazarov also pointed out that cryptographic proofs and smart contracts can now give smaller counterparties the same reliability as top-tier banks, unlocking new opportunities in capital markets. “They can prove that solvency, you know, by cryptographic means. They can prove through smart contracts or oracle networks, through compliance engines verifying things,” he said, adding that this dynamic could boost competition and product innovation across financial services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robinhood‘s plan to tokenize stocks and offer around-the-clock trading is raising alarms for traditional exchanges like the NYSE. Robinhood is taking a bold leap into the future of equity trading with its new blockchain-powered tokenization platform. This move enables users to trade tokenized versions of stocks at any time, challenging the dominance of traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. The initiative could reshape how financial markets operate, offering faster settlements, expanded hours, and programmable financial assets but not without serious implications for market stability and regulatory oversight. This new chain will allow users to trade tokenized derivatives of stocks, initially on a 24/5 basis with plans for full 24/7 access. The tokens represent wrappers of real-world stocks held by a US broker-dealer, enabling onchain activity without detaching from actual equity ownership. This could offer near-instant settlement, direct self-custody of assets, and decentralized application integration. According to a detailed analysis by Galaxy Digital, Robinhood's blockchain model could erode the NYSE's competitive advantage, which is built on concentrated liquidity and market data revenue. Galaxy stated, “This directly challenges the deep concentration of liquidity and activity that gives major TradFi exchanges (e.g., NYSE) their competitive advantage.” By capturing both trading fees and downstream blockchain use cases, Robinhood is positioning itself to profit from every stage of the trading lifecycle. A 2023 Journal of Financial Economics study found that tokenized securities can reduce trading costs by 30 percent compared to traditional methods. While 24/7 trading increases accessibility, it also brings the risk of significant overnight price swings. Retail investors, in particular, may face heightened exposure without proper safeguards or education. Galaxy Digital cautions that unless legacy exchanges adapt to this evolving landscape, they could be relegated to managing less versatile versions of the same assets now made dynamic on blockchain networks. Robinhood's blockchain-based trading model represents a disruptive shift in how assets are bought and sold. However, this innovation also introduces serious volatility and regulatory risks that must be managed. The success of this approach hinges on whether Robinhood can balance innovation with investor protection and whether regulators will support or stifle this emerging model.</p>

Last month, Arthur Britto, the mysterious cofounder of Ripple's XRP Ledger who created it along with Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz in 2012, posted to X for the first time since creating his account in August 2011—a message consisting of just an emoji of a face without a mouth. Britto's reappearance after over a decade of obscurity was seized on by holders of Ripple's XRP, who speculated about what the timing of his return might mean just as the XRP price has soared to levels not seen since 2017 over the last year. The 80,000 bitcoin are now in new wallets using a modern address format, something that could have been done to prevent against future quantum computing attacks. "Sure would be interesting if someone like Arthur Britto happened to control Satoshi's BTC wallet," another X user posted, while others also fanned the flames of the theory that included speculation David Schwartz might be Satoshi Nakamoto. Schwartz has previously denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, posting to X that theories suggesting he developed bitcoin with former Ripple executive and engineer Nik Bougalis are, "not true, but it's plausible." Satoshi Nakamoto has been linked to dozens of different people over the the years by internet sleuths, researchers and reporters, from an obscure, now deceased computer scientist called Hal Finney all the way through to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey (one crypto exchange executive has claimed Satoshi Nakamoto's identity might already be known by some). Just last year, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, though he failed to produce proof. Almost all of the most likely names associated with the Satoshi Nakamoto name have denied they are Satoshi Nakamoto, except for Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who fought a multi-year legal campaign to be recognised as bitcoin's creator despite being unable to produce evidence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A renowned cryptocurrency tycoon has unveiled a list of five little-known altcoins that form the backbone of his multimillion-dollar investment plan. With a surprising focus on popular meme-based tokens, this revelation is set to shake up the digital currency market. Readers are eager to discover which coins could potentially offer significant returns. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it's a growing community built around passion for the game. vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! With a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto principles, Avalanche aims to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. It's used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. Compared to other coins, Avalanche's eco-friendly approach and rapid processing capabilities may appeal to those looking for scalable and sustainable blockchain solutions. Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts talk to the real world. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they usually can't access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this problem using oracles, which bring data from external sources to the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to use real-world data, like prices or events. Chainlink ensures this data is accurate by checking it through multiple sources and using a reputation system. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it makes smart contracts much more useful. This is important for industries like finance, insurance, and supply chains. In the current market, LINK stands out because it offers real utility. With growing interest in decentralized finance, Chainlink's technology could be very attractive to investors. By staking POL, token holders support the network's security and participate in consensus processes. This involvement not only strengthens the system but also rewards participants with additional tokens. POL also gives holders a voice in the network's governance. POL's diverse uses make it stand out in today's market. It provides access to exclusive services within Polygon, offering benefits beyond trading. While the crypto market can be volatile, tokens linked to active and expanding networks like Polygon are gaining attention. POL's potential is tied to the growth and success of its ecosystem, positioning it as an interesting token in the current market cycle. Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as DOT. It enables secure communication between different blockchains, allowing data and value to be shared across platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin without middlemen. Using parachains, Polkadot boosts speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum. It promises a future where blockchains are more interconnected and efficient. Polkadot's technology holds significant potential in the evolving blockchain landscape. Its unique ability to connect multiple blockchains positions it well in a market that values interoperability. The current market cycle has seen increased interest in blockchain technologies that can handle more transactions at lower costs. While market conditions can be unpredictable, Polkadot's innovative framework makes it a project worth watching as the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow. While AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,200 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to push to the $118,000 price level – a new all-time high – if it can finish with a daily close above $109,000. BTC is trading for $109,644 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day. Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH), Martinez says he expects more choppiness until the top altcoin closes outside the $2,227-$3,385 range. “Heard a company added an inflationary asset like ETH to its balance sheet, and suddenly everyone's bullish again. But let's be real: I expect more chop until we get a sustained close outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.” “Dogecoin bounced from the lower boundary of this channel. Now targeting $0.19, with potential upside to the upper boundary near $0.26.” SOL is trading for $151 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.
