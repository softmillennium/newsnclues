                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bonnie Blue is accused of secretly being a man. Adult star Bonnie Blue has found herself at the center of a truly wild internet rumor claiming she is secretly a 26-year-old man who once went by the name "Tom". However, this sensational storyline isn't fazing the adult film icon, who boldly stated she "will take anyone" who questions her gender, RadarOnline.com can reveal. Bonnie Blue has broken her silence on rumors she is a man. The actress, born Tia Billinger, has been making headlines lately — not just for her adult film career but also for planning a public sex stunt in London. Despite keeping a low profile initially, Bonnie has finally decided to address the odd rumor that has captured the interest of social media users far and wide. During an appearance on Stand Out TV, host PK Humble opened the conversation with the awkward inquiry, saying: "I read somewhere that someone said you're a man." Without missing a beat, Bonnie responded: "I read that too; apparently, my name was Tom." When pressed about whether she'd be open to "getting down and dirty" with trans individuals, she shrugged off the controversy, joking: "Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. In the video, an AI voice claimed: "It all started just a couple of months ago when photos began circulating in a private Discord group. Before long, someone unearthed old local newspaper clippings from 2011 about a boy from Alabama who won a statewide debate competition. "Bonnie stayed silent; she kept posting as if nothing was happening, sharing videos of the old southern house she was restoring. A grand, creaky place passed down from her grandmother, full of pillars, peeling wallpaper and secrets, but the pressure kept building. One user commented: "My fear is that I cannot become too funny or famous bc someone will find a picture of my brother and start this rumor." Another wrote: "So we're just using Grok and OpenAI images to back our conspiracy theories now? A third person said: "I do appreciate how this trans fearmongering TikTok theory video, which claims with complete certainty that Bonnie is a man, still opts to use her correct pronouns.

Blue, who had nearly 900,000 subscribers on OnlyFans, was banned from the X-rated platform after she promoted her "petting zoo" stunt. The 26-year-old planned to sleep with 2,000 people while tied up in a glass box before the platform kicked her off their site. Blue told news outlets that she thought her permanent ban was unwarranted, saying: "It's clearly unfair, and it's frustrating because I've been singled out, and it's just because I get more press and more views." On May 14, just one day before news broke that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are allegedly headed toward a divorce, the singer was spotted house-hunting on her own in Beverly Hills, RadarOnline.com revealed. Clint Eastwood has hit his “frankly, I don't give a damn” moment in life! Tom Cruise is living up to his Top Gun image by splashing a fortune choppering his new female “best pal” around Britain – after he “fell in love” with the way she's overcome her disability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past fifteen years, five missions have returned samples of extraterrestrial material to Earth for analysis. In the coming years, China plans to return samples from 469219 Kamoʻoalewa with its Tianwen-2 mission. With all the extraterrestrial materials being returned to Earth for analysis, one could argue that we are entering a "golden age of sample-return missions." As a result, efforts are underway to create facilities where scientists can safely contain, curate, and analyze these samples. At the University of Leicester's Leicester Space Park, scientists are working on a Double-Walled Isolator (DWI) to store and analyze extraterrestrial materials safely. This could include future samples returned from Mars, which NASA and other space agencies are planning to do through crewed or robotic missions expected to happen during the late 2020s or early 2030s. These measures minimize interactions between scientists, prevent cross-contamination, and preserve sample integrity so scientists can obtain accurate results when conducting analyses. Now [that] we have that agreed baseline, we look forward to the design phase and the many, many challenges it will bring for this unique piece of equipment. The dedicated qualification phase will involve simulating end-to-end curatorial and scientific processing of martian analogue samples at SPL. This €5 million ($5.89 million) project was initially developed for the NASA/ESA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission and builds on previous work where the Leicester team created a design for a prototype DWI. They've also partnered with Extract Technologies, a UK-based manufacturer of advanced isolator technologies, to provide a detailed design for the main isolator and manufacture it. Said John Holt, DWI QM Principal Investigator at Space Park Leicester: Whether or not an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft brings samples back from Mars, the Double Walled Isolator (DWI) is a key UK technology that enables planetary scientists to scrutinise returned rocks to understand the Martian environment and if there is microscopic evidence for life on the red planet. The milestone review [SRR] we have just conducted carefully looked at the complex needs of scientists to ensure we design an ultra-clean system that allows them to handle the precious samples and use a wide range of analytical techniques to unlock the secrets within each piece of rock. Currently, there are four missions in the works to return samples from Mars, including NASA's proposed crewed missions to Mars, China's Tianwen-3, JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX), and Russia's Mars-Grunt mission.
