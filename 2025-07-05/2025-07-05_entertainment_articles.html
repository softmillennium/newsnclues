                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's administration deported eight immigrants to South Sudan, a dangerous country where most of the men have no ties, the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday. “These sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Thursday, calling it a “win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people.” The men had been held in a shipping container at a military base in Djibouti since May as they awaited court decisions. He previously deported hundreds of Venezuelan men to a notorious prison in El Salvador without due process, and illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia there as well. Abrego Garcia recently described experiencing severe beatings and psychological torture, including sleep deprivation, while he was incarcerated in El Salvador. The State Department tells Americans not to visit South Sudan “due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.” It adds: “Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.” On Friday, Murphy denied an emergency appeal from the men's lawyers to block their deportations. They argued the deportations were “impermissibly punitive” and their clients are likely to face torture. ‘Put His Name on Everything': Why the Social Security Admin Shared Trump Propaganda Trump Signs Bill to Kick Millions Off Health Care Into Law Ben Folds Releases New Live Album with National Symphony Orchestra on Fourth of July Murphy wrote that the Supreme Court's second ruling on this topic tied his hands. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C. had ordered the deportation to be temporarily paused earlier on Friday afternoon while transferring the case to Murphy.

He comes to Jax with a dilemma that quickly becomes messy. Reasonable Doubt centers on Los Angeles-based high-powered criminal defense attorney Jacqueline “Jax” Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi) as she deals with past traumas, a struggling marriage, motherhood and a murder case while trying to keep her life together.

So, when Ozzie (Bary), a former child star, finds himself in a heap of trouble, Jax seizes the opportunity to spice up her daily routine. But when Ozzie's personal life turns out to have all the drama and danger of a Hollywood movie and Jax's professional future comes under threat from a charismatic associate at her firm, can she clear her client's name without losing the personal and professional successes she's worked so hard for?

An ongoing artistic provocation designed to challenge the boundaries of authorship, identity, and the future of music itself in the age of AI.”The “band” went viral and attracted extensive media coverage after emerging out of nowhere in June and appearing on popular Spotify playlists. They also inspired an apparent hoaxer, using the name Andrew Frelon, who now says he impersonated the band on X and falsely claimed to be a spokesperson for the band in interactions with the media, including a phone interview with Rolling Stone. His elaborate, days-long hoax was aimed at testing the media, he claimed in a lengthy Medium post.

Glenn McDonald, a former “data alchemist” for Spotify, told Rolling Stone earlier this week that The Velvet Sundown's popularity there is likely because the streaming service now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, while also increasingly moving away from human-driven playlist selections toward algorithms that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alyssa Milano shared a moving remembrance to Julian McMahon following his death, writing in a lengthy tribute post that he was “more than my TV husband” and a “dear friend” who supported her professionally and personally throughout their time on The WB's long-running fantasy drama Charmed. Milano portrayed one of three powerful witchy Halliwell sisters alongside co-stars Holly Marie Combs and the late Shannen Doherty throughout the series' run from 1998-2006, and in Seasons 3 through 5, her character Phoebe has a turbulent relationship with McMahon's Cole Turner, a half-human and half-demon. Julian McMahon Tributes: 'Charmed', 'Nip/Tuck' & 'Fantastic Four' Co-Stars Remember "Force Of Brilliance, Wild Talent And Humor" Julian McMahon Dies: 'Nip/Tuck', 'Fantastic Four', 'FBI: Most Wanted' Star Was 56 “We spent years together on Charmed—years of scenes, stories, and so many in-between moments. He made me feel safe as an actor. We were so different, and yet somehow we always understood each other,” she wrote, alongside photos and selfies of the two throughout the years. “Julian was more than my TV husband. The kind who tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable—but always with love,” Milano continued. The actress concluded that her thoughts are with McMahon's family. I'll carry your laugh with me. Aside from Charmed, McMahon is known for his starring roles in Nip/Tuck, FBI: Most Wanted and the 2000s Fantastic Four movies. He died July 2 in Clearwater, Fla. from a private battle with cancer. Following the news of his death, tributes poured in from loved ones and co-stars, including fellow Charmed actors Marie Combs and Rose McGowan.

Following the death of journeyman actor Julian McMahon — known for his roles in “Nip/Tuck,” “Charmed,” and “Fantastic Four” — tributes poured in from co-stars, colleagues, and fans, including Rosie O'Donnell, Rose McGowan, Kelly Carlson, and Dick Wolf. His death was announced on July 4 by his wife, Kelly, who told Deadline, “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer.” McMahon had most recently appeared in “FBI: Most Wanted,” which he left suddenly in 2022, saying in a statement to Deadline, “I'm extremely proud of the work we have done together and put the development of this show, and my character Jess, at the top of my professional experience list.

All of us at Wolf Entertainment are deeply saddened by Julian's passing and our condolences go out to his entire family.” Rose McGowan, who appeared with McMahon on “Charmed,” posted an Instagram story reading, “Oh Julian you force of brilliance, wild talent and humour. For you, your family and loving fans all over the world, I pray comfort.” Her on-screen sister Holly Marie Combs posted, “One of a kind is an understatement. Your unyielding zest for life and crazy-making sense of humor will be sorely missed. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.” That presence,” fellow “Charmed” co-star Alyssa Milano wrote in a lengthy post. Her tribute concluded with, “Losing him feels unreal. “Sad day for our ‘Charmed' family!” Brian Krause wrote. “Julian was one of the funniest, devilishly handsome and kind souls! “This is terribly sad news about Julian,” Ioan Gruffudd wrote, who starred alongside McMahon in a pair of “Fantastic Four” films. “Even though we played each other's nemeses, there was always so much lightness and laughter working together. Rosie O'Donnell, who guest-starred on “Nip/Tuck,” also posted on Instagram, writing that she was “heartbroken over the death of Julian McMahon — what a beautiful man — so kind loving funny and gifted — i loved working with him on nip/tuck — my love to his wife n children.” Ruth Williamson, who played the eccentric Hedda Grubman on “Nip/Tuck,” described to IndieWire the infectious spirit of McMahon, including doing “his best Elvis” in the makeup trailer, lip-syncing to “A Little Less Conversation.” That's why he was such a good actor. When I worked with him on ‘Nip/Tuck' we had instant chemistry. I will miss seeing his beautiful face on screen.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drake has released a new song called “What Did I Miss?” On the track—co-produced by DJ Lewis, Elyas, FNZ, Gyz, London Cyr, O Lil Angel, Oz, Patron, and Tay Keith—the Toronto musician reflects on his beef with Kendrick Lamar and the people who did and did not stand by him in the feud. Drake opens “What Did I Miss?” by reflecting on the beef and the way it affected those around him: “Askin' me, ‘How did it feel?' Can't say it didn't surprise me/Last time I looked to my right, you n****s was standing beside me/How can some people I love hang around pussies who try me?” Later, in his first verse, Drake raps, “It's love for my brothers and death to a traitor, let's go.” In his second verse, Drake references Kendrick Lamar's massive Drake-taunting Pop Out concert, in Inglewood, California, that featured performances and appearances from former Drake collaborators, such as YG, Mustard, and Ty Dolla $ign. “I saw bro went to Pop Out with them, but been dick-riding gang since ‘Headlines,'” he raps. The beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was reignited when Lamar took some subtle shots at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin's “Like That.” Importantly, Future and Metro Boomin were both, at one point in time, prominent Drake collaborators, and their turn against the Canadian artist led to other former friends taking sides in the feud. The Weeknd, for example, appeared on Future and Metro Boomin's We Still Don't Trust You—a potential sign of where his loyalties lied—and Rick Ross shared his own diss track against Drake, “Champagne Moments.” “What Did I Miss?” is a rare solo single from Drake, since he shared his suite of anti-Lamar tracks in 2024. Drake is federally suing UMG for defamation, claiming that the corporation “waged an unrelenting campaign” to promote “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar's mega-hit that Drake believes is filled with falsities.

Before screening the restored 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' the nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, producer of the film with Michael Douglas, said "we shall overcome," lauding the "movie about rebellion."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Producer Paul Zaentz, nephew of the late Saul Zaentz, who co-produced with Michael Douglas the Oscar-winning Miloš Forman drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump during an appearance at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic on Saturday.


	Appearing before a screening of a newly restored version of the 1975 classic, which became only the second movie to win all five major Academy Award categories – best picture (Douglas and Zaentz), best director (Forman), best actor (Jack Nicholson), best actress (Louise Fletcher), and best adapted screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), Zaentz called Cuckoo's Nest “a movie about rebellion” and bashed financial support for the poor and other Trump policies.

	“It's ironic that … Cuckoo's Nest has been honored here on its 50th anniversary, and I am afraid that Ken Kesey's brilliant book may be banned in the USA,” he said in comments made a few minutes before Douglas appeared on stage to a huge ovation.


	Zaentz continued: “Yesterday, July 4, the malignant narcissist, wannabe dictator that occupies the White House signed a bill that was passed by his cruel, heartless followers to make the rich richer and take food and health care away from the people who need it – a very sad July 4 for the USA.” The remark drew applause from the jam-packed auditorium at the Czech festival.

	











	The producer concluded by asking people outside the U.S. for patience. “Don't give up on America,” Zaentz said. “We shall overcome the totally corrupt, morally bankrupt, treasonous, evil thing and his cronies and minions. I am certain that Miloš would agree with me that Trump is a stain on my country, and his presidency will be looked upon as the greatest moral failure in the history of the United States.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news broke on July 3rd that Caitlyn Jenner's friend and manager, Sophia Hutchins, had sadly passed away. Naturally, kind words have poured in from those who knew her as well as others online who wanted to express their sympathy. Now, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kathy Hilton has done the same. Regarding the death of Sophia Hutchins, TMZ reported that she was pronounced dead on July 2. This resulted from an ATV accident that occurred near Caitlyn Jenner's home in Malibu. There were no other injuries on the scene. Sophia Hutchins' tragic death has caused many to express their sympathy. This includes some who are leaving positive comments on her Instagram page. She commented on one of Sophia Hutchins' videos on the platform where she spoke about being under the weather. This was from January, and she captioned the video, “VOLUME UP! Regarding Kathy Hilton's comment, she said, “Rip Sophia.” Kathy also included four white hearts, a red one, and the praying hands emoji. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sophia Hutchins and Caitlyn Jenner met in 2015. Notably, they met via Sophia's makeup artist at a photoshoot. Sophia said about their connection to the “Times,” “Having a similar sense of humor, we spent the entire time laughing and ended up meeting for brunch, and we've been great friends ever since.” She also spoke about becoming Jenner's manager, saying, “I saw nobody was managing her, and there were all these people taking massive advantage. And I was saying, ‘Caitlyn, if I don't step in here and start managing you, you're going to go broke. Caitlyn spoke about Hutchins in 2019, saying she was her “best friend, family, and confidant.” Caitlyn added, “She is one of the top minds in her field.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian born actor, Julian McMahon never played it safe, no matter how big (or small) the screen. Whether he was casting spells, cutting into bodies, or chasing down fugitives, McMahon made a habit of picking bold, often unpredictable roles. And while he might've first hit American screens with soap opera good looks and a brooding charm, the Australian actor quickly proved he had staying power far beyond daytime TV. McMahon passed away on July 2, 2025, at just 56 years old, according to statements released on July 4. “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer. And those fans flocked to the internet (as one does in today's society) to share their thoughts on the tragic news. Here's how this legend will be remembered. McMahon got his U.S. start as Ian Rain on “Another World,” but his big breakthrough came in 2000 as Cole Turner on “Charmed,” a half-demon, half-lawyer who fell hard for Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). Let's be real: that storyline should've been a disaster. But McMahon somehow turned Cole into a tortured icon; equal parts villain, romantic lead, and chaotic wildcard. Fans still argue about whether he was misunderstood or straight-up toxic (it's both), but either way, he made it memorable. Then came “Nip/Tuck.” If “Charmed” made him a household name, “Nip/Tuck” made him a TV rebel. As Dr. Christian Troy, McMahon dove headfirst into the twisted, often unhinged world of plastic surgery, vanity, and identity. The FX drama was scandalous, no question; but McMahon grounded it with unexpected vulnerability beneath all that designer smugness. And let's not forget his run as the Marvel comic character Victor Von Doom in the Fox produced, “Fantastic Four” films (“Fantastic Four” and “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”). It's not easy going toe-to-toe with superheroes, but he made Doom deliciously watchable. In the 2010s and beyond, McMahon shifted gears into more procedural fare. He joined “Runaways” as Jonah, a mysterious, powerful alien with deep ties to the show's family drama, before stepping into a G-man role for “FBI: Most Wanted.” As Jess LaCroix, he led the Fugitive Task Force with steely precision and quiet empathy… a surprisingly restrained performance that added depth to the franchise. When he exited “FBI: Most Wanted” in 2022, McMahon told TheWrap it was time to “pursue additional creative pursuits.” And while we didn't know it then, that chapter would be one of his last big moments on screen. McMahon remained a steady presence in entertainment for over three decades, lending his acting talents to over 40 projects (per IMDB), including films like “Premonition,” “Paranoia,” “Faces in the Crowd,” “Bait,” and more recently, “The Surfer.” His net worth was estimated at $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, but his real value came from his versatility; he was never just “the hot guy” or “the bad guy.” He was both, and more; always willing to explore the messy, human gray area in between.</p>
