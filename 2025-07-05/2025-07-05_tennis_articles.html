                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kamil Majchrzak is enjoying the week of his life at Wimbledon, where he is into the fourth round at a major for the first time. Cheering him on courtside in south west London is Marta Majchrzak, who is not only the World No. 109's wife but also his physiotherapist and fitness trainer. “We do physiotherapy together sometimes, she helps me with fitness programs, monitors me when I need her. She can feed balls for me on the court. She's able to sacrifice herself 100 per cent for me.” A post shared by Kamil Majchrzak (@kamilmajchrzakk) Their story began more than a decade ago when they began dating and the couple married in November 2022. Marta, a former junior tennis player herself, has transitioned into a vital role supporting Kamil on and off the court. When not traveling, she works with the Polish Tennis Association in their home country. “She can't travel with me all the year with her physio work at home but when she is with me, like this week, those weeks are fantastic. Regardless of results, she helps me be on Tour and be happy on Tour," Majchrzak said. I like having her next to me. Anytime she can come, I take her with me because I know it'll be a great time. I am proud of achieving the results I do for the both of us. “She gives me advice for on court, helps me physically, pushes me and I can practise with her as she can feed and hit. We have spent a lot of time together during the years, so it is nice to have her by my side.” Photo Credit: KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Majchrzak's Wimbledon campaign started on a challenging note. Facing former finalist Matteo Berrettini in the first round, and coming off three straight losses on grass, expectations were low. I came on court with no expectation, just to show some good tennis and be competitive,” Majchrzak said. “Then we started and I was in a good position and my game grew during the match. Believing more and then I did it.” The last time Majchrzak had reached the third round at a major prior to this week came at the US Open in 2019. However, the Pole backed up his big win against Berrettini with straight-set victories against Ethan Quinn and Arthur Rinderknech to advance to the fourth round at a major for the first time. I'm super happy to be here,” Majchrzak said on his run. I managed to do it and here I am now, being in the fourth round. I look forward to competing in the best tournament in the world.” You May Also Like: Thompson defies injury for Wimbledon breakthrough Away from the grass courts, Majchrzak enjoys watching Manchester United and going for walks with his dog. On Tour, Majchrzak is part of a tight-knit Polish group, sharing a special bond with countryman Hubert Hurkacz and former WTA World No. Majchrzak is a year older than 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist Hurkacz and has known the former Top 10 star since childhood. “I have a very good relationship with Hurkacz,” Majchrzak said. Hubi is such a nice guy, the most professional person I know. I was and am very happy about his success.” About Swiatek, he added: “Iga has an amazing personality. From my perspective, she's won everything, even if not literally. It's inspiring to have both of them from my country. 79, four spots off his career high, the 29-year-old will next face Karen Khachanov for a place in the quarter-finals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner is into the fourth round at Wimbledon for a fourth straight year, and has done so at a canter. The 23-year-old returned to the All-England Club shrouded in a veil of pity, as many expected the three-time Grand Slam champion to be reeling after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. Everyone knows the story now of how he squandered three championship points and a two-set lead to eventually lose the match and the title. However, there has been no indication that he has let this impact him, despite what some reporters might try to infer. Asked if he felt negative coming into Wimbledon after his crushing French Open final, the Italian was left a little surprised by the nature of this question. After all, he has looked flawless at the All-England Club thus far, showing no signs of dwelling on such a defeat. His response was one of bewilderment, as Jannik Sinner began: ‘Why negative feelings? I'm not concerned that one loss can influence you for such a long time. ‘I believe that here is a new chance that I can do something good from my side. Maybe I lose the next round. ‘I'm honestly very happy to be here. I'm happy I have the chance to play on such special courts here at Wimbledon. There is no better place to play tennis at this moment. ‘I had a good preparation to prepare for this tournament. As noted earlier, failing to drop a set on his way into the fourth round of Wimbledon hardly suggests a mental deficiency. In fact, he's arguably never looked so assured and secure on the grass, poised to stroll into the final, especially with how the draw has opened up. Sinner spoke about how it felt to face Djokovic for the first time recently, but he has come a long way since then. However, to win these elite titles, there are going to be some huge obstacles in your path, both of whom Sinner has beaten in the past. There is no suggestion that he's suffering after his French Open final loss; if anything, it's fuelling him onto record-breaking greatness.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis Fans Want Wimbledon Reporter Banned For 'Unprofessional' Question originally appeared on The Spun. Following a straight-sets victory over Matteo Bellucci on Friday, Cam Norrie spoke to the media about his performance. He seems fairly comfortable on the grass, which isn't a surprise considering he made the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2022. Unfortunately for Norrie, his press conference was overshadowed by a ridiculous question from an unidentified reporter. "Apart from everyone here loving tennis, some of the gossip has been about who Emma Raducanu is dating," a reporter asked Norrie. Can we get to the bottom of this please?" "I'm trying to find out who's dating Emma Raducanu," the reporter continued. "It seems to be going around all the men's singles. Tennis fans were understandably disturbed by this reporter's question. Some fans are calling for this reporter to receive a lifetime ban from Wimbledon. "This is so absurd that not even 'Tennis Centel' could come up with it," one fan said. "Embarrassing that this is what an actual journalist would think of let alone come up with for a question in a press conference." "That reporter needs to be banned," a second fan declared. Why do sports journalists continue to humiliate themselves," a third fan wrote. "Whoever asked that question should be banned for life from the Tournament," another fan commented. Just a week ago, Raducanu was basically asked if she's dating two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz. "There's been lots of chatter online about your friendship with Carlos," a reporter asked. While we understand there's plenty of hype surrounding Raducanu, reporters shouldn't be asking about her personal life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me. Of course, he was also only 11 years old. In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states. Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere. I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was. I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport. So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated. Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career. Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July. When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder. This is a guy who was No. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here. But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points. These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points. “Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit. Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium. But I hope that's not the case. It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barbora Krejcikova's Wimbledon title defence ended in distressing scenes as she broke down in tears and required a medical timeout during her third-round defeat by Emma Navarro. Officials were seen taking her blood pressure and checking her vitals as concerns grew among the crowd, with Krejcikova appearing emotional and hunched over between points as she struggled to continue. Despite bravely playing on, Krejcikova was unable to rediscover her rhythm, with Navarro sealing a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory to reach the last 16 at SW19 for the first time. Krejcikova received a warm ovation as she left the court in tears, cutting a dejected figure after her hopes of defending the title she won last year came to an end in difficult circumstances. Heart-breaking scenes 💔Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova is in tears at the back of the court in her match against Emma Navarro. Navarro, who will now face teenage talent Mirra Andreeva for a place in the quarter-finals, showed composure in the closing stages, breaking Krejcikova five times and winning 68 per cent of points behind her first serve. Krejcikova's struggles echoed similar scenes earlier in the tournament when Ons Jabeur had her blood pressure and vitals checked on court before retiring in tears from her opening match. All of Krejcikova's matches at Wimbledon this summer had gone to three sets. Krejcikova then overcame American Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 before losing to Navarro. Struggling with her serve, Krejcikova faced 18 break points against Navarro, although she saved 13 of them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — As well as Jannik Sinner is playing at Wimbledon, he doesn't appear to need much in the way of help. Still, he got some Saturday when his opponent, Pedro Martinez, was dealing with a problematic shoulder and often put in first serves at so-so speeds. 1-ranked Sinner has dropped a record-tying total of only 17 games so far, made his way to the fourth round for the seventh consecutive Grand Slam tournament — he's collected three such trophies in that span — and never was truly in trouble during a 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory over No. “We all saw that he was struggling,” Sinner said, then noted about his own form: “First week couldn't have gone better.” For Sinner, there's been zero sign of any sort of inability to move past last month's French Open final, which he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets despite taking the first two and holding three championship points. Against Martinez, Sinner — who returned in May from a three-month doping suspension — went up 5-0 after 20 minutes. During that stretch of 29 points, Martinez managed just one winner, while Sinner accumulated 10. That's when Martinez took a medical timeout, and a trainer massaged the back of his right shoulder. The Spaniard was delivering first serves as slow as 76 mph, compared with Sinner's high of 133 mph. That aspect of Martinez's game improved incrementally, but the only, ever-so-brief, moment of intrigue at Centre Court came in the second set, about 75 minutes in, with Sinner up a break and serving at 4-3. That's where Martinez managed to accrue his first four break points of the match. Sinner stayed as calm as can be — “I don't think Sinner's changed expressions once in this match,” John McEnroe observed on BBC's telecast — and erased all four of those chances, held for 5-3, then broke to end the set. Soon enough, Sinner — twice an Australian Open champion, once a U.S. Open champion and a 2023 semifinalist at Wimbledon — was headed into a contest Monday against No. That's because defending champion Barbora Krejcikova was eliminated by No. 10 Emma Navarro of the United States 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, and 2022 champion Elena Rybakina lost to No. Krejcikova had her blood pressure checked during a medical timeout in the last set. 7 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian, moved into Week 2 with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Hailey Baptiste of the United States, and five-time major title winner Iga Swiatek overwhelmed Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3. Another fourth-round matchup was set up when No. 19 Liudmila Samsonova and Jessica Bouzas Maneiro advanced. 22 Flavio Cobolli, with Novak Djokovic in action later. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, coming off a riveting win against Emma Raducanu, returns to Centre Court to face No. 24 Elise Mertens as the fourth round begins. Sunday's last scheduled match in the main stadium features two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz against No. ET) against unseeded Jordan Thompson of Australia.

That has to come first before the good striking. She said [in press], ‘I'm just going to be a negative person today, because that's how I feel' and I don't know how she gets through that, but she has to.”A four-time Grand Slam champion, Osaka is yet to reach the second week of a major tournament since giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023. Though she avenged that defeat earlier this year, subsequent losses have made the 27-year-old question how much longer her career will last. “She seems a little bit lost,” said Prakash Amritraj following the former world No. But she needs to start feeling a bit better about herself before it can translate into good tennis.

Though she avenged that defeat earlier this year, subsequent losses have made the 27-year-old question how much longer her career will last. “Once that thought gets in your mind, it's hard to get it out of your mind,” said Lindsay Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 who mounted her own comeback from maternity leave back in 2007. “She's been back on tour for about 18 months now since her maternity break and she's been playing full time, no real injuries. But she's not even in a position to be seeded, hasn't really been able to break into that Top 30, which, if you've won four Grand Slams and been No. 1 in the world, that's what you're shooting for.“This is probably a really good time for her to take some time, figure out why she's playing and struggling in these close matches. She's just got to figure out if this is what she wants to be doing out here.”Amritraj argued Osaka was unlikely to step away and, despite disappointments at Grand Slam tournaments, has trended up in 2025 by winning her first title on clay in Saint-Malo. “This is probably a really good time for her to take some time, figure out why she's playing and struggling in these close matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 at Wimbledon 2025. At its center is a player that much of the field is trying to figure out, as she too tries to figure out who she is on this grass. It's not a surprise qualifier, or a player who has directly benefited from so many seeds making an early exit. 8 seed at Wimbledon, but she's actually the world No. That version of Świątek can appear on the Wimbledon grass, but to make it happen, she will have to win a battle between her two tennis selves that she has been conducting since late last year. Two years later, she won her first Grand Slam at the French Open. Two years after that, she won the 2022 U.S. Open, as well as the first of three consecutive French Opens. But she also hasn't won a tournament since she won the last of those three, 13 months ago. She has only been to the second week of Wimbledon twice in five tries. But going off her first two matches here so far and her run to the finals at a warm-up event in Bad Homburg, Germany, Świątek has shown signs that she might be getting inside the tennis time machine she has been building the past few months. That player floated up and down and all across court with a preternatural ease that veterans long for. She played with variety and spin, and happily worked her way through points instead of taking the biggest swing she could at first chance. She won points with cute angles and deft stop volleys. And when swinging hard wasn't working, her fallback plan was something other than swinging even harder. That became eminently clear Thursday, after Świątek dropped the opening set to Caty McNally, an American qualifier and the world No. She didn't do that by landing more first-strike bullets an inch in rather than a foot wide. When she was returning, she focused more on putting the ball back in play, often with a chip, rather than trying to crush it across the the court. During the first set she won just 12 of 25 points that stretched longer than four shots. During the next two sets she won 25 of 40. The same pattern occurred in her first match against Polina Kudermetova, when she won just five of 18 points longer than four shots during a tight first set, and seven of eight in the second. Her first serve slowed down slightly but became more effective in that match, too. Perhaps more importantly, she had played that way to go 4-1 up against McNally in the set that she lost. Then she did what she has done in her worst losses in recent times: she reverted to the all-out aggressiveness that became ingrained in her tennis between 2022 and 2024. It also stayed some of her development, largely hid the finesse that had helped to carry her to the top of the sport, and created a psychological problem. When things get tight, players do what they know. Against McNally, she found that often elusive balance between raising her intensity while playing more methodical and patient tennis, as diametrically opposite as those two goals might appear at first glance. “You can still raise your intensity and be patient and make smart decisions,” Świątek said after she prevailed. “It just means that you're going to play these shots really 100 percent. But it doesn't mean that they need to be like crazy.” Then, it appeared that Wimbledon would get real for Świątek. In Danielle Collins, Świątek faced the player who took her apart in Rome on the red clay, her best surface, just two months ago. She pushed Świątek to the edge of her emotional danger zone, a place where she has spent a lot of time the past few months. Collins hits a big ball, the kind that can send Świątek backpedaling, rushing her forehand. Collins, seemingly unjustifiably, ripped into Świątek for what she referred to as phoney sincerity when Collins had to retire during the third set of their quarterfinal at the Paris Olympics last summer. “For a landscaper's daughter, you know, and coming from humble beginnings, I cherish it,” Collins said after her 6-4, 6-1 win over Veronika Erjavec, the Slovenian qualifier. And you can see it when I'm out on court. I'm so excited to get in the car each morning and come here.” She jammed Collins with fast body serves and started sliding second serves to her forehand, after the American pounced on a couple that didn't jump high enough. “I had some practices where the ball was listening to me … It's a new experience on grass,” she said in her on-court interview. Świątek has never looked comfortable on the grass. Low sliding shots do make it hard for her to get her racket under the ball on her topspin-heavy forehand — just as Coco Gauff found out when she went out in the first round. Last year, Świątek's first match on grass following her Roland Garros title was also her first match at Wimbledon. Out went Tomasz Wiktorowski, who preached aggression from the baseline for three years. He has steadily helped her to add more shape and patience to her tennis, which has in turn, at least at this tournament, started to reverse the notion that she is fundamentally not good on grass. Her defeats as a seasoned tour player have come to a grass master of the upset (Alizé Cornet) a player playing the tournament of their life (Elina Svitolina) and Putintseva, who at one point hit one unforced error in 13 games. But resisting a reversion to the baseline aggression when matches get stressful has remained a big challenge for Świątek. Its effect also gets magnified on grass, where sets can disappear in minutes and errors rack up more easily and quickly. It's early days at Wimbledon and there are hard matches ahead even if she beats Collins. It's still clear Świątek is thinking differently on the grass this time round, especially after her success in Germany, where she beat Jasmine Paolini, last year's Wimbledon finalist, and Ekaterina Alexandrova, a big hitter capable of causing problems, on her way to the final. “You just have to get through some situations on the court, and it gives you the extra experience and kind of the momentum to go forward,” She said ahead of Wimbledon. Each year, she learns a few things through experience. But she is one of the best players in the world, an all-time great already, playing at a tournament where the all-time greats usually figure out a way to win. It's the tournament where historically the best players generally do the best, because they figure out how to play aggressively, but with control, because often controlling points can be more important than trying to win them at the first chance. “You really have to trust your shots on grass. Any shot that will give your opponent more time to go in is probably the shot that will make you lose the rally.” He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu may have sidestepped drama at last year's Wimbledon if the new U.S. Open rule had been in effect there. The young British sensation faced criticism on the iconic grass courts for choosing to concentrate on her singles matches rather than team up with Andy Murray, the three-time Grand Slam champ, in what could have been his final shot at major success in the mixed doubles. Murray was ousted from the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in round two and was beaten in the men's doubles with his brother Jamie, thanks to Australian pair Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. With Murray suggesting that it would be his last Wimbledon appearance, the mixed doubles with Raducanu represented his last hope of competing and winning. Yet Raducanu, not fully fit, opted to focus solely on her singles campaign, bowing out from the partnership with Murray. "Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him. Obviously he was disappointed because it's his last match. I think that hopefully he'll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there." Raducanu, who reached the fourth round of the tournament last year only to be defeated by Lulu Sun, has since extended an apology to Murray for any unintended tension, seeking to avoid any "bad blood." "He's someone that I've grown up looking up to and I don't want any bad blood or harsh feelings with him. Yet, had the new mixed doubles format introduced at this year's U.S. Open been available in London last summer, the entire situation may have been avoided. Had a similar timetable been implemented at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray might have teamed up. Murray ultimately bowed out at last year's Wimbledon following his doubles departure with Jamie, before competing in the Paris Olympics and officially retiring from the sport. Meanwhile, Raducanu returned to the courts at SW19 this summer, defeating Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before falling to WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the third round on Friday. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, with whom the British player shares a close friendship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu and Aryna Sabalenka put on a tennis clinic on Friday night as they battled it out for a place in the Wimbledon fourth round. With the roof closed on Centre Court, Raducanu and Sabalenka provided two hours of relentless entertainment. It wasn't to be, however, as the experience of Sabalenka prevailed, breaking twice late on to secure the win 7-6, 6-4. Raducanu and Sabalenka's Wimbledon thriller arguably proved the French Open organisers wrong, as there's no doubt everyone departing Centre Court will have said they got their money's worth on Friday night. However, while Wimbledon deserves credit for scheduling the women's match last, that's not to say there's been an even split at this year's Championships. Just two women's matches (both featuring Raducanu) have been scheduled as the last match of the day on Centre Court in 2025. There is no doubt, however, that Wimbledon has done a better job than Roland Garros at sharing the spotlight. Roland Garros is unique in how they format their day and night sessions, compared to the other three Grand Slams. Not only does their night session start later than the others, but it also features just one match, whereas the Australian Open, for example, often hosts two. Therefore, the big worry for Roland Garros organisers is that if they schedule a women's match for the night session on Chatrier, it could finish quickly, leaving fans without a full evening's entertainment. That isn't always the case, of course, as there have been several occasions where three-set women's matches outlast men's three-set matches. If the French Open were to simply add another match to the night session, surely their problems would be solved, as they could rotate between scheduling a men's match one night and two women's matches the next. However, it doesn't look like they'll be making a change anytime soon, as the men continue to get the nod at Roland Garros.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu could have potentially avoided controversy after ditching Andy Murray in last year's mixed doubles at Wimbledon had a new US Open ruling have been in place at the time. The 22-year-old Briton found herself under fire on the courts of SW19 last year, when she opted to focus on the singles game rather than pairing up with three-time Grand Slam winner Murray in what was his final chance at major glory. Murray had been knocked out of the men's singles by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, and was omitted from the men's doubles alongside his brother, Jamie Murray, by Australian duo Rinky Hijikata and John Peers. Given that Murray had announced ahead of play that it would be his final outing at Wimbledon, the mixed doubles alongside Raducanu came as his last hope of redemption. However, Raducanu – whose fitness wasn't at 100 per cent – decided that she would rather put all of her attention into her own singles tournament than use energy elsewhere, withdrawing from participation alongside Murray. Speaking about her choice at the time, Raducanu said: "It was a very difficult decision. Of course, I didn't want to take his last match away from him. I still stand by making the right call. "Obviously he was disappointed because it's his last match. I think that hopefully he'll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there." Raducanu made it through to the fourth round of the tournament last year, where she was bested by Lulu Sun, and she has since apologised to Murray for her decision to avoid any "bad blood." "He's someone that I've grown up looking up to and I don't want any bad blood or harsh feelings with him. However, controversy could have been avoided completely had a new format for the mixed doubles game at this year's US Open been in place in London last summer. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. And should a similar schedule have taken place at Wimbledon 2024, Raducanu and Murray may well have played alongside one another. Murray ultimately bowed out of last year's Wimbledon after his doubles exit alongside Jamie, playing at the Paris Olympics before officially retiring from the sport. Raducanu, meanwhile, was back in action at SW19 this summer, dispatching of Mingge Xu and Marketa Vondrousova before she was bested by WTA No. Saturday, 5th July 2025See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.
