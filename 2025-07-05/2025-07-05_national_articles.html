                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Desperate search: Authorities say more than 25 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday. • Death toll rises: At least 27 people, including nine children, have died in the flooding, according to local officials. A 9-year-old camper is among the victims, her mother told CNN. • Massive effort: Rescue and recovery operations continue today after first responders worked through the night, with authorities saying more than 850 people have been brought to safety. Hunt, a town near Kerrville, received about 6.5 inches in just three hours early Friday, which is considered a one-in-100-years rainfall event for the area. Daric and Heidi Easton, restaurant owners in downtown Kerrville, Texas, have pivoted to providing food for first responders and individuals affected by catastrophic flooding in the area. “I think hospitality and service is uniquely equipped to handle situations like this,” Daric Easton told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. The couple have utilized the restaurant's connections and resources, including a customer's helicopter, to transport food and supplies to hard-to-reach areas. “We directly loaded food onto the helicopters, that were then flown to Camp Mystic,” Easton said. “So this did come full circle and accomplish the goal of feeding those kids.” I just need to make sandwiches,” he told CNN “If I keep making sandwiches, people can still be fed. If responders are fed, then they can save lives,” Easton said. The Trump administration is working with state and local officials in Texas following the devastating flooding there, President Donald Trump wrote on social media today. Trump said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will be “there shortly.” “Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. “I got a call and an update this morning, my kids' school. That little girl has since been reunited with her mother. About 1,000 local, state and federal personnel are involved in the search effort, which has seen hundreds of rescues, including more than 160 by air, according to Roy. At least one girl is confirmed dead and 27 are reported missing at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls located near the Guadalupe River — which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours. The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away. Shortly after midday, they were able to enter the camp and start rescuing children. Camp Mystic, founded in 1926, prides itself as a “wholesome Christian atmosphere” and a haven where girls “develop outstanding personal qualities and self-esteem,” according to its website. There are 27 children reported to be missing from Camp Mystic, the girls summer camp in Kerr County, Texas, according to Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice. “We do not have an accurate count, and we don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” he said. The San Gabriel River at Georgetown South Fork, located about 30 miles north of Austin, is expected to crest near 30 feet this afternoon, which is major flood stage. This would result in flooding for many streets and roads, as well as threatening the lowest homes above Georgetown to Granger Lake, National Weather Service meteorologists warned this morning. Additional heavy rain is expected in those areas today. This could lead to additional rounds of flash flooding. The Guadalupe River near Spring Branch rapidly rose overnight by around 27 feet, but levels are expected to begin to fall this morning. A moist airmass remains over the region of Texas where devastating flooding occurred Friday, with little movement and ample moisture. This combination means that the area should remain on alert for more flash flooding, as repeated rounds of heavy rain could fall over areas already affected. Northwest of Austin: Early Saturday, 6.5 inches (a 1-in-100-year rainfall rate) to 7.5 inches (a 1-in-200-year rainfall rate) of rain fell in just 3 hours in Burnet, Texas — which amounts to a 1% chance or less of this happening in any given year. Rainfall totals for this area have already reached 5 to 10 inches. The high rainfall rates led to water inundating homes overnight near Allen Branch Creek in Burnet, according to the emergency management office of Cedar Park. Showers and thunderstorms are possible through this weekend, but the heaviest rainfall is expected to be farther east than the worst-hit areas so far. A flood watch remains in effect through Saturday evening, with 2 to 4 inches of additional rainfall possible. Kerrville, Texas, Mayor Joe Herring Jr. warned of a tough day ahead and expressed gratitude for the response from city crews, county personnel and state agencies to devastating flooding in the region. “People need to know, today will be a hard day,” Herring said, his voice wavering as he made his opening remarks at a news conference. Herring also thanked people around the country for an outpouring of offers to help. Search teams are making rescues in “a very harsh environment,” recovering some people from trees and other high-ground locations, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said. Search and rescue operations continued through the evening Friday and overnight into Saturday, with specialized equipment, including helicopters, trying to identify any heat sources in the flooded area, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said. If water does get under the road, we are seeing a lot of debris, a lot of asphalt that is washing up, so there could be some other damaged areas,” he warned. “These folks will be traveling very difficult terrain, up through Ingram, and we're going to start getting information.” Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha said first responders will continue to search for “every single person” who is missing in the floods. Officials in Texas have recovered the bodies of at least 27 people, including nine children, after catastrophic flooding impacted parts of the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry L. Leitha. Leitha said officials have evacuated or rescued over 850 people, including eight with injuries. Both totals were current as of Saturday morning local time, the sheriff said at a news conference. The previous death toll provided by authorities Friday night was 24. “We're unable to release any further information on deceased at this time as our thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones,” Leitha said Saturday. He said locals can contact a call center in the region to report missing people, or email relief teams. This post has been updated with additional comments from the sheriff. A Kerrville city councilmember is mourning devastation from the flooding and asked people across the country to keep his community in their prayers. “When we have an event, a catastrophic event like this, it hits hard and it hurts,” councilmember Jeff Harris told CNN affiliate KABB this morning. Harris said friends from accross the country have reached out to ask how they can help. “And the answer to that question, right now, is pray. Crider's was set to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its annual Fourth of July rodeo, dance and barbecue on Friday, according to its website. It's just really sad for the community,” Adams told CNN, holding back tears. The mother of missing Camp Mystic camper Janie Hunt, 9, told CNN in a message this morning that her daughter has passed away. Dan Patrick said yesterday that more than 20 children were unaccounted for at the private Christian summer camp for girls, which hosts about 750 kids overall. After the catastrophic flooding hit Kerr County in central Texas, Anne Hunt told CNN on Friday that she and her family had not heard anything about Janie's whereabouts and were praying for her return. “Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy,” Vance said Saturday in a statement on X. “My heart goes out to the parents in Texas during this difficult time,” she wrote. Around two dozen girls from a private Christian summer camp were still unaccounted for Friday night. Camp Mystic is in Hunt, Texas, near the Guadalupe River, which has swelled to its second-highest level on record, according to the National Weather Service. Everyone at about 18 other camps along the river is accounted for, officials said. “We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,” the camp wrote about its director. Flash floods are the second-deadliest weather hazard after extreme heat. They can occur when a dam or levee is breached – or when intense rain outpaces the ground's ability to absorb it, as was the case in Texas' Kerr County this week. Pinpointing exactly where flash flooding will occur is a major challenge because geography and topography can vary widely, even over small regions. There's not as much surface area for rain to soak into soil before steep inclines send it rushing down, where it can overwhelm streams and rivers and funnel into valleys and rise quickly with little warning. Kerrville, Texas was hit especially hard by flash flooding after heavy rain swelled two forks of the Guadalupe River before they converge and flow “through the city,” City Manager Dalton Rice said at a news conference Friday. Storms late Thursday into Friday “dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,” Rice said, describing how the river swelled from 7 feet to 29 feet in a short amount of time during the night. Rice also noted not all areas along the river have alarms to flag flooding.</p>

A group of everyday New York City subway riders delivered some street justice to a crazed man who randomly grabbed a screaming woman on a platform and ushered her forward, dramatic viral video shows. The group sprang into action on Sunday morning atop a Brooklyn subway platform when they heard the young woman screech for help as the heavy-set man bear hugged her from behind and propelled her forward. "Stop, stop, help," the 20-year-old woman can be heard yelling as a group of onlookers quickly surrounds him and demands that he let her go. She eventually broke free of the man, identified by police as 42-year-old Fredrick Marshall, who was dressed in a white suit with a white baseball cap and sunglasses. Police said he was armed with a knife and a blackjack, and the woman did not know Marshall. But after the woman caught her breath, Marshall made a second lunge for the woman but was stopped in his tracks by a stranger who tripped him up -- sending him flying headfirst onto the ground. The group then pounced on Marshall, delivering him a beatdown with an onslaught of kicks while another person appeared to strike him repeatedly with a stick. The distraught woman can be seen sprinting away from the scene in distress, with one of her sneakers appearing to have fallen off during the terrifying ordeal. After catching her breath, Marshall made a second lunge for the woman but was stopped in his tracks by a stranger who tripped him up. EMS responded and treated her at the scene. Marshall was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, as well as third-degree assault and second-degree harassment. The TikTok video has racked up nearly 7 million views in three days. Marshall on the ground after he was roughed up by bystanders. "Boy moms, make sure you are raising men like this who protect our daughters from depraved," wrote one woman. "My heart hurts hearing her call for her mom at the end, thinking that could be any of our daughters." "This is how our men are supposed to respond," was the most popular response with 170,000 likes. Police said Marshall, of Queens, has no priors in New York City. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kerrville's city manager says the extreme weather event happened in a span of less than two hours early on Friday, as the Guadalupe River rose rapidly. Months worth of heavy rain fell over just a few hours overnight in central Kerr County, Texas, causing deadly flash flooding of the Guadalupe River. Hurricane season can be stressful for millions of Americans living in coastal areas, as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage.lives. Forecasters are expecting another unusually busy season for the Atlantic, with predictions calling for six to 10 hurricanes, with up to half reaching major status.

Deputies walk along a road near the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Ingram. KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Rescuers were searching Saturday for more than two dozen children from a girls' camp and many others still missing after a wall of water rushed down a river in the Texas Hill Country during a powerful storm that killed at least 27 people, officials said. The destructive fast-moving waters along the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as torrential rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas. Some 27 people remained missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, said Dalton Rice, Kerrville's city manager. An unknown number of people at other locations were still unaccounted for, he said Saturday. “People need to know today will be a hard day,” said Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. “Please pray for our community.” The total number of missing was not known, according to the city manager, who said he didn't want to give an estimate. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. A raging storm woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday, and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with floodwaters whipping around their legs, she said. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said 27 were confirmed dead, including nine children. The Texas Hill Country, which sits northwest of San Antonio, is a popular destination for camping and swimming, especially around the summertime holiday. “These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather said in a statement that called the Texas Hill County one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings. Officials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area. One National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to six inches (152 millimeters) of rain, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said. Search crews were facing harsh conditions while scouring the waterlogged rivers, culverts and rocks. “They are looking in every possible location,” Rice said. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were flying in to assist. One reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet Saturday after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before. “We still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. We've had a little success, but not much,” said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District. President Donald Trump said Saturday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was traveling to Texas and his administration was working with officials on the ground. “Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Trump said in a statement on his social media network. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home from the river, she said. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said. Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone. At a reunification center in Ingram, families cried and cheered Friday as loved ones got off rescue vehicles. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not get down a ladder. “I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death,” he said. Authorities were coming under increasing scrutiny over whether the camp and others in the area received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area. “Everything was done to give them a heads up that you could have heavy rain, and we're not exactly sure where it's going to land,” Patrick said. When pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly said no one knew this kind of flood was coming. The slow-moving storm stuck over central Texas is bringing more rain Saturday, with the potential for pockets of heavy downpours and more flooding, said Jason Runyen, of the National Weather Service. The threat could linger overnight and into Sunday morning, he said. “When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,” Dickson said. River tourism industry is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said. “It's generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations,” Dickson said.</p>

New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie argued on Wednesday that President Donald Trump is much more of a "normie Republican" than both his supporters and critics may lead one to believe. Trump Is a Normie Republican," contended that Trump has governed as a "mostly orthodox Republican" over the duration of his second term, and compared his first term to a hypothetical third George W. Bush presidency. "Perhaps the most underappreciated fact about President Trump is that he is a Republican," Bouie stated, noting that "nearly every commentator under the sun" has considered Trump to be unique "in ways that defy traditional categorization." Bouie argued that Trump's policies and actions while in office show that he is more of an "orthodox" Republican than his rhetoric may suggest. "We saw this in his first term, with his signature legislative accomplishment, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. "No, it was a massive upper-income tax cut designed to pay huge benefits to the wealthiest Americans, including the president, his family and their friends." Bouie continued, listing off actions taken by Trump during his first term, summarizing that, in short, "Trump governed like a Republican." "And it is not a stretch to say that much of his first term was, on the domestic front, more or less indistinguishable from a hypothetical third term for the previous Republican president, George W. Bush. Trump even ended his term, as Bush did, with a rolling set of crises and disasters, each exacerbated by his mismanagement," he added. The columnist compared Trump's foreign and domestic policy to former President George W. Bush. The columnist claimed that Trump's "big, beautiful, bill" lines up with "what any Republican president would do," but has been cloaked in "the rhetoric of populism" by the president. As far as Trump's foreign policy goes, Bouie argued that the president's recent strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was reminiscent of the foreign policy of two former Republicans. "With one decision, Trump fulfilled the dreams of a generation of Republican hawks who have been clamoring for war with — and regime change in — Iran since President Bush proclaimed that it was a member of the ‘axis of evil' in 2002. You could, if you were so inclined, draw a straight line from that speech to John McCain's ‘bomb Iran' quips in 2007 to Trump's appointment of Mike Pompeo, a noted Iran antagonist, as secretary of state in 2018 to his airstrike last month," he claimed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People climb over debris on a bridge atop the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Ingram, Texas. Among those missing are more than 20 girls attending a summer camp. Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, including some by helicopter. According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood is flooding that begins within six hours, and often in as little as three hours, of heavy rainfall. Waters rise so quickly that people are caught off guard, according to the weather service. If at home or work, the water can rise so quickly people are trapped before they have time to think about escape. Fast-moving waters along the river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday and flash flood warnings and flood watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas. On Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch, estimating rising water of up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) in spots. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for a flood and people should be prepared, but hazardous conditions might not develop. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area and “everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain.” However, when asked about how people were notified in Kerr County so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.” When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly responded: “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.” Last year, 145 people died in flash floods, according to the weather service. On average over the past 30 years, floods have claimed 127 lives annually. Nearly half of all flood-related fatalities involve vehicles. Many people don't realize that a car becomes difficult to control in just 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water and can be swept away in as little as 18 inches (46 centimeters). So instead of finding a detour, too often people try to drive through water at underpasses or other low-lying areas. It can happen anywhere, according to the weather service, which says that “the normally tranquil streams and creeks in your neighborhood can become raging torrents if heavy rain falls overhead.” An area can be flooded even without rain — if it's downstream of a torrential rainstorm and a swollen stream heads its way. Hurricanes, tropical storms, non-cyclonic weather systems carrying heavy rain and dam failures are some weather events that can cause flash flooding.</p>

Dan Patrick joins ‘Fox News Live' to provide an update on the deadly Texas floods, which have killed at least 27 people and left dozens, including children, still missing. Three young girls were found dead after a devastating flood swept through Camp Mystic, an all-girls private Christian camp in Hunt, Texas. Anne Hunt confirmed to Fox News Digital that her daughter, Janie, was one of the campers killed in the flood. A third camper has been confirmed to be deceased, however her family has asked that her name not be released. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said on Friday night that between 23 and 25 campers were missing. First responders scan the banks of the Guadalupe River for individuals swept away by flooding in Ingram, Texas, Friday, July 4, 2025.

The outlet noted that Lester was housed on higher ground at the camp, known as Senior Hill. The National Guard was deployed in Texas to respond after heavy rain on Friday morning caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 30 feet in 45 minutes. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem later said that members of the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist in evacuations. Helicopters and military vehicles were used for evacuations. As of Friday night, 237 people had been evacuated, including 167 by helicopter.

Families are reunited at a reunification center after flash flooding hit the area, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Ingram, Texas. President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that the floods were "shocking" and "a terrible thing." He also said the state would receive federal aid and that his administration was working with Abbott. "Our nation's heart breaks for the victims in Texas and their families. Just an incomprehensible tragedy," Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.

Multiple people were arrested in Los Angeles on Friday as anti-ICE demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and the U.S. military after weeks of protests against deportations and ICE raids, police said. Los Angeles police said there were "multiple arrests today during several different demonstrations" downtown. "Most were peaceful, but once again, as the evening approached, outside agitators began to cause issues," the department wrote on X. U.S. Marines protect U.S. Customs and Border Protector cars while they leave the Edward R. Roybal Federal and Detention Center building on July 4, 2025, in Los Angeles, California.

"Less Lethal munitions have been deployed by Federal authorities," police wrote, adding that they may cause pain and discomfort. In response to the anti-ICE protests that began last month, the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, despite opposition from Gov. U.S. Marines after pushing demonstrators into the street at the Metropolitan Detention Center during protests against immigration raids in downtown Los Angeles, California, on July 4, 2025. Demonstrators met up for the protest on Friday at around 9:30 a.m. outside City Hall on Spring Street and took a 1.5-mile route through downtown, according to local outlet KCAL. Police said the group dispersed shortly after the incident commander authorized a dispersal order for the area on Friday night, according to a post at 7:17 p.m. local time.

Entertainment Nation, a permanent exhibit established in 2022 and housed in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, is under review by the Trump White House for so-called 'divisive' narratives. White House official Lindsey Halligan blasted content currently on display at the National Museum of American History's Entertainment Nation exhibit in an exclusive email to Fox News Digital.The exhibit, which explores American pop culture, has drawn internal and external criticism for what some see as a politically loaded interpretation of cultural milestones. "American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives," Halligan said. "DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI C-3PO and R2-D2 costumes are shown at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History with a panel crediting Star Wars for inspiring America during post-Vietnam uncertainty and the Nixon-era scandal. Another, describing early American entertainment, declares: "One of the earliest defining traits of entertainment in the United States was extraordinary violence." The exhibit reframes iconic American characters through a critical, politically-charged lens. Mickey Mouse, a beloved American cultural icon, is not spared either. A display for the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie states, "Mickey challenged authority, but not everyone was in on the joke." It continues: "Mickey Mouse debuted as the deckhand ‘Steamboat Willie' in 1928, amidst a rising anxiety felt by many that modern living and city life were eroding family and community ties and loosening moral codes… But the new character's outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy." In reference to the Indiana Jones film series, another panel reads: "His character embodied a confident righteousness that, in many ways, captured the essence of the 1980s" above another subhead referencing President Ronald Reagan's famous speech, asking, "Are you better off? "KENT STATE STUDENT'S VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP ART DISPLAY SPURS OUTRAGE a challenge to the "popular perceptions of Vietnam veterans as damaged misfits." A section on Jon Stewart's Daily Show refers to it as "the go-to for viewers who mistrusted politicians and the reporting process." Another panel highlights the late pop star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez and frames her cultural impact through identity politics. "Selena got us talking about identity," with a quote from the late singer reading, "I feel very proud to be Mexican." The text goes on to say her work "cast a light on the longstanding cultural and growing political influence of Mexican American and Latinx communities within the United States." "Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress." A display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History explores changing gender norms, featuring Mae West, Judy Garland, and Olympic swimmer Gertrude Ederle. Halligan confirmed that a top-to-bottom content review is already underway, with input from senior Smithsonian leaders and the Board of Regents. "We are working with leadership at the Smithsonian to audit and review all content at the museums," she said, "and we are committed to ensuring that such content honors our country's founding principles, tells the stories of American heroes, and does not promote fringe or activist ideologies masquerading as history." She added, "We will provide updates on this audit as our progress unfolds." As such, and as previously announced, we are assessing content in Smithsonian museums and will make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards." The Institution did not answer specific questions regarding who authored the Entertainment Nation exhibit, whether outside academic consultants or activist organizations were involved, or who made the decision to present all exhibit text bilingually in English and Spanish. The controversy comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump to reshape cultural institutions he says have veered too far left. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History is seen from the Washington Monument on June 3, 2025 in Washington, DC. In March, Trump issued an executive order directing the Board of Regents to eliminate "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from Smithsonian museums. He accused the institution of embracing what he called "a revisionist movement" aimed at "undermining the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light." Vance and Congressman Carlos Giménez, both recent appointees, have advocated for an expedited review of Smithsonian content. Giménez, in a prior interview with The Wall Street Journal, confirmed tensions at the board's June meeting over how quickly to proceed, though ultimately a compromise was reached. The Smithsonian receives approximately two-thirds of its $1 billion annual budget from federal appropriations. The Entertainment Nation exhibit opened in December 2022 and was billed as a permanent exhibition to "celebrate the power of popular culture to shape and reflect history." While the museum's stated goal is to explore how entertainment intersects with American identity, the Trump administration argues that it instead uses culture to smuggle in ideology often at odds with the values most Americans hold. "Americans deserve a Smithsonian that inspires national pride, tells the truth, and reflects the greatness of this country," Halligan said. "Not one that serves as an agent for social change and cultural subversion." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot that went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night for a spot in the Club World Cup semifinals. Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute but Estêvão, an 18-year-old who will transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd. Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy. FIFA credited Weverton with an own goal. Chelsea won't travel far for its next match, facing Fluminense on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Hércules came off the bench and scored in the 70th minute to lift Fluminense past Al Hilal 2-1 in Friday's earlier quarterfinal. With Chelsea's win, three of the four semifinal teams will be from Europe, with one from Brazil. Fans made it to Lincoln Financial Field on a holiday weekend that included a strike by nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia, competition from an earlier Phillies game, and a concert and fireworks show near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. There was a pregame pregame tribute for Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, who were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway. Chelsea forward Liam Delap and defender Levi Colwill each got their second yellow cards of the tournament and will be suspended for the semifinal. Chelsea also played without captain Reece James, who was removed from the starting lineup due to injury. Estêvão agreed to a deal with Chelsea last summer that moved him to Chelsea after he turned 18. Estêvão huddled up with his future teammates — including Palmer — and received some friendly postgame encouragement. There was a lot of fans tonight. “Tonight will be a very difficult night to sleep because we'll feel like we could've done something different.” — Weverton.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Republicans have propelled President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final congressional passage. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., left, speaks in the House chamber prior to the final vote for President Donald Trump's signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, at the Capitol, Thursday, July 3, 2025, in Washington. Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit. A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. President Donald Trump gestures as he boards Air Force One, Thursday, July 3, 2025, at Joint Base Andrews, Md. Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year. To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security. To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line. Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse. The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements. There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits. Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs. Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America's wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.” Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities. The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.” There's a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing. Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills. The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals. The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China. Or not, depending on how one does the math. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”</p>

Players of the two teams observe a minute of silence in memory of Portugal international and Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva, before the Club World Cup quarterfinal soccer match between Fluminense and Al Hilal in Orlando, Fla., Friday, July 4, 2025. Chelsea's Liam Delap heads the ball with Palmeiras' Richard Rios and Palmeiras' Bruno Fuchs during the Club World Cup quarterfinal soccer match between Palmeiras and Chelsea in Philadelphia, Friday, July 4, 2025. FIFA paid tribute to Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, before kickoff at the Club World Cup quarterfinal games in Orlando, Florida, and Philadelphia on Friday. The 28-year-old Jota and 25-year-old Silva were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed and burst into flames on an isolated stretch of highway just after midnight Thursday. At the match between Al Hilal and Fluminense at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, players formed a circle at midfield as the video board displayed a photo of the Portuguese soccer players. The crowd participated in a moment of silence. At Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia where Brazil's Palmeiras faced Chelsea, a black-and-white photo of the brothers was displayed and a moment of silence was observed as players on both teams wore a black band on their sleeves. Chelsea's Pedro Neto, a friend and Portugal national teammate of Diogo Jota, made the sign of the cross as he entered the pitch with a jersey on his shoulder that had Jota's and André Silva's first names. Spanish police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve another vehicle, they said. They said they believe it could have been caused by a blown tire. Jota's death occurred two weeks after he married longtime partner Rute Cardoso while on vacation following a long season when he helped Liverpool win the Premier League.</p>
