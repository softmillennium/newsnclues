                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When archaeologists poured the liquid out of two European-manufactured bottles found under a brick floor at George Washington's Mount Vernon mansion, they enjoyed the scent of cherry blossoms. As part of a privately funded revitalization project at the Virginia mansion, a brick floor originally laid in the 1770s was torn up, revealing a small pit and the two side-by-side dark green glass bottles, both upright and sealed. “Not only did we recover intact, sealed bottles, but they contained organic material that can provide us with valuable insight and perspective into 18th-century lives at Mount Vernon,” Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist, says in a statement. Full cherries, including stems and pits, were part of the liquid content, giving off the signature scent of the region, a “blockbuster find of two fully intact glass bottles containing liquid that have not been seen since before the war for American independence,” Doug Bradburn, Mount Vernon president and CEO, says in a statement. That makes the cherries likely pre-Revolutionary War fruit. “There are 18th century accounts that talk about proper ways of preserving fruits and vegetables,” Boroughs tells the newspaper. “One of the most common, especially for berries, is to dry them as much as possible … put them in a dry bottle, cork it … and then bury them.” That advice may still hold true today, as the cherries held their shape and scent 250 years later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from the USC Caruso Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, part of Keck Medicine of USC, published today in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, is the first to link hearing aids and cochlear implants, surgically implanted devices that help those with profound hearing loss perceive sound, to improved social lives among adults with hearing loss. "We found that adults with hearing loss who used hearing aids or cochlear implants were more socially engaged and felt less isolated compared to those who didn't use them," said Janet Choi, MD, MPH, an otolaryngologist with Keck Medicine and lead researcher of the study. Hearing loss affects an estimated 40 million American adults, yet many go untreated. Previous research has shown that over time, social withdrawal can reduce mental stimulation and increase the risk of loneliness, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline and dementia. "Until this study, it has been unclear whether hearing devices could help reverse the isolation." The researchers found that adults using hearing devices feel more socially connected and less limited in social situations. Participants also reported feeling less socially handicapped by their hearing loss, with fewer barriers and frustrations during interactions and an improved ability to stay engaged without feeling excluded. This increased confidence can help users connect more easily with family, friends and colleagues, leading to stronger feelings of belonging and reduced social anxiety. The study also suggested hearing devices may reduce loneliness, although further research is needed in this area, according to Choi. Those with cochlear implants reported the most improvement in their social quality of life. As a result, they may experience more noticeable improvements in social engagement once their hearing is restored. While it was outside the scope of the study to measure how better social lives relate to improved cognitive outcomes, Choi believes there may be a connection, as previous research has found managing hearing loss may be key to reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. "While our study didn't directly measure cognitive outcomes, the improvements we saw in communication and social engagement suggest that by restoring clearer communication, hearing devices may help preserve cognitive health by keeping the brain more actively involved and people more connected," Choi said. This research follows a January 2024 study by Choi showing that adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids have an almost 25% lower risk of mortality, suggesting that treating hearing loss can improve lifespan as well as social quality of life. "We hope this encourages more people to seek treatment and helps clinicians start conversations with patients about how hearing devices can improve their quality of life."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, scientists have debated whether a giant thick ice shelf once covered the entire Arctic Ocean during the coldest ice ages. Now a new study published in Science Advances, challenges this idea as the research team found no evidence for the presence of a massive ~1km ice shelf. These cores hold tiny chemical fingerprints from algae that lived in the ocean long ago. Some of these algae only grow in open water, while others thrive under seasonal sea ice that forms and melts each year. "That tells us there must have been light and open water at the surface. You wouldn't see that if the entire Arctic was locked under a kilometre-thick slab of ice." One of the key indicators the team looked for was a molecule called IP25, which is produced by algae that live in seasonal sea ice. Its regular appearance in the sediments shows that sea ice came and went with the seasons, rather than staying frozen solid all year round. "Even during these extreme glaciations, warm Atlantic water still flowed into the Arctic gateway. This helped keep some parts of the ocean from freezing over completely." This research not only reshapes our view of past Arctic climates but also has implications for future climate predictions. Understanding how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate extremes can improve models that project future changes in a warming world. Some scientists have argued that features on the Arctic seafloor suggest that a huge, grounded ice shelf once covered the entire ocean. "There may have been short-lived ice shelves in some parts of the Arctic during especially severe cold phases," said Knies. One possible exception could have occurred about 650,000 years ago, when biological activity in the sediment record dropped sharply. This matters because the Arctic is changing rapidly today. Knowing how sea ice and ocean circulation responded to past climate shifts helps scientists understand what might lie ahead. "These past patterns help us understand what's possible in future scenarios," said Knies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cold and beautiful these are, for the structural biologist Kirill Kovalev, they are more importantly home to unusual molecules that could control brain cells' activity. Kovalev, EIPOD Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL Hamburg's Schneider Group and EMBL-EBI's Bateman Group, is a physicist passionate about solving biological problems. He is particularly hooked by rhodopsins, a group of colorful proteins that enable aquatic microorganisms to harness sunlight for energy. "In my work, I search for unusual rhodopsins and try to understand what they do," said Kovalev. Some rhodopsins have already been modified to serve as light-operated switches for electrical activity in cells. This technique, called optogenetics, is used by neuroscientists to selectively control neuronal activity during experiments. While browsing online protein databases, Kovalev spotted an unusual feature common to microbial rhodopsins found exclusively in very cold environments, such as glaciers and high mountains. After all, rhodopsins are something you typically find in seas and lakes. These cold-climate rhodopsins were almost identical to each other, even though they evolved thousands of kilometres apart. They must be essential for surviving in the cold, concluded Kovalev, and to acknowledge this, he named them 'cryorhodopsins'. Scientists strive to create a palette of different colored rhodopsins, so they could control neuronal activity with more precision. Blue rhodopsins have been especially sought-after because they are activated by red light, which penetrates tissues more deeply and non-invasively. To Kovalev's amazement, the cryorhodopsins he examined in the lab revealed an unexpected diversity of colors, and, most importantly, some were blue. The color of each rhodopsin is determined by its molecular structure, which dictates the wavelengths of light it absorbs and reflects. Any changes in this structure can alter the color. "I can actually tell what's going on with cryorhodopsin simply by looking at its color," laughed Kovalev. Next, Kovalev's collaborators examined cryorhodopsins in cultured brain cells. When cells expressing cryorhodopsins were exposed to UV light, it induced electric currents inside them. "New optogenetic tools to efficiently switch the cell's electric activity both 'on' and 'off' would be incredibly useful in research, biotechnology and medicine," said Tobias Moser, Group Leader at the University Medical Center Göttingen who participated in the study. "For example, in my group, we develop new optical cochlear implants for patients that can optogenetically restore hearing in patients. "Our cryorhodopsins aren't ready to be used as tools yet, but they're an excellent prototype. They have all the key features that, based on our findings, could be engineered to become more effective for optogenetics," said Kovalev. When exposed to sunlight even on a rainy winter day in Hamburg, cryorhodopsins can sense UV light, as shown using advanced spectroscopy by Kovalev's collaborators from Goethe University Frankfurt led by Josef Wachtveitl. This made the scientists suspect that those cryorhodopsins might act like photosensors letting the microbes 'see' UV light - a property unheard of among other cryorhodopsins. A typical sensor protein teams up with a messenger molecule that passes information from the cell membrane to the cell's inside. Kovalev grew more convinced, when together with his collaborators from Alicante, Spain, and his EIPOD co-supervisor, Alex Bateman from EMBL-EBI, they noticed that the cryorhodopsin gene is always accompanied by a gene encoding a tiny protein of unknown function - likely inherited together, and possibly functionally linked. Kovalev wondered if this might be the missing messenger. "It was fascinating to uncover a new mechanism via which the light-sensitive signal from cryorhodopsins could be passed on to other parts of the cell. It is always a thrill to learn what the functions are for uncharacterised proteins. In fact, we find these proteins also in organisms that do not contain cryorhodopsin, perhaps hinting at a much wider range of jobs for these proteins." "We suspect that cryorhodopsins evolved their unique features not because of the cold, but rather to let microbes sense UV light, which can be harmful to them," said Kovalev. "In cold environments, such as the top of a mountain, bacteria face intense UV radiation. Cryorhodopsins might help them sense it, so they could protect themselves. "Discovering extraordinary molecules like these wouldn't be possible without scientific expeditions to often remote locations, to study the adaptations of the organisms living there," added Kovalev. Studying molecules at this level of detail requires going beyond standard experimental methods. Kovalev applied a 4D structural biology approach, combining X-ray crystallography at EMBL Hamburg beamline P14 and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the group of Albert Guskov in Groningen, Netherlands, with protein activation by light. "I actually chose to do my postdoc at EMBL Hamburg, because of the unique beamline setup that made my project possible," said Kovalev. Another challenge was that cryorhodopsins are extremely sensitive to light. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 6115 (2025) Cite this article C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination represents a promising approach for synthesizing various amines, facilitating applications from late-stage scaffold hopping to the degradation of polymers and biomass. However, it remains challenging due to the inertness of the C-C bond and difficulties in controlling regio- and chemo-selectivity. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) amination reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons using nitriles, amides, and sulfonamides as nucleophiles. This process occurs under mild conditions with hydrogen evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. Mechanism involves successive anodic oxidative cleavage of the benzylic C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond to generate two carbocation fragments, which are subsequently captured by nucleophiles to form two C-N bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that HFIP is critical as additive in adjusting the oxidation potentials of alkylbenzene substrates and amine products, effectively preventing overoxidation of products. Aliphatic C–H and C–C bonds are most fundamental chemical bonds that are widely present in organic compounds1,2. Direct functionalization of these inert aliphatic bonds represents a cornerstone in modern organicchemistry. In particular, the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)–H bonds to construct new carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds has been extensively studied3. In contrast, the functionalization of ubiquitous benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds has been much less explored4, despite their prevalence and significant potential for enabling late-stage scaffold hopping and facilitating the degradation of persistent polymers and biomass (Fig. To date, several primary strategies have been developed for C(sp³)–C(sp³) bond cleavage. The first involves ring strain-releasing in a strained system via oxidative addition of low-valent transition metals into C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond5,6, or single-electron transfer (SET) processes to generate cationic or anionic radicals that drive C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage and enable difunctionalization7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Another strategy relies on SET or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-mediated activation of redox-active groups, generating transient oxygen or nitrogen radicals that undergo rapid β-scission16,17,18,19,20,21. Nevertheless, employing such strategies to cleave and functionalize C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds in acyclic, ubiquitous aromatic hydrocarbons, such as ethane derivatives, still remains a challenging and highly desirable goal due to inherent thermodynamic stability of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond and low polarization of such substrates. An early example by Alnibi's group demonstrated C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond cleavage of multi-aryl ethanes via arene radical cation intermediates to form C-O bond under photooxidation conditions22. Recently, Huang and Chen's group described the elegant photooxidative cleavage of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons to form new C–C bond23. More recently, Yu's group made significant breakthroughs in the electro-reductive carboxylation of acyclic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2, enabling reductive C–C bond cleavage through radical anion intervention24. These advancements have significantly expanded the toolbox for C–C and C-O bond formation. Despite this progress, the direct benzylic (sp3)–C(sp3) amination in aromatic hydrocarbons to form C–N bonds remains elusive for several challenges (Fig. Firstly, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds are among the most abundant yet the most difficult to cleavage. Secondly, achieving high selectivity is complicated by the coexistence of similar surrounding C–H and C–C bonds. Finally, the risk of overoxidation presents a major challenge in C–C amination chemistry, particularly when the introduced nitrogen lacks sufficient deactivation (e.g., through tosyl protection). Addressing these challenges would open new avenues in C–N bond-forming methodologies and significantly expand the scope of amination chemistry. a Functionalization of benzylic C–H/C–C bonds. b Recent functionalization of benzylic C–C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons. c This work: Electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C–C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons via HFIP-mediated oxidation potential sorting. Recently, electrochemical25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 amination of benzylic C(sp3)–H have been established44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53, providing green approaches for C–N bond formation. For example, Xu's group developed a site-selective electrochemical amination reaction that efficiently converts benzylic C–H bonds into C–N linkages52. Lambert's group described a method for benzylic C–H bond amination via an electrophotocatalytic Ritter-type reaction53. In both cases, the electrochemical single-electron oxidation of the arene substrate to generate an arene radical cation was identified as the key initial step. Building on these previous reports, and given the prevalence and biological significance of amines, we hypothesized that an electro-oxidative method could be developed to induce the amination of widely available benzylic C–C bonds via arene radical cation induced C–C bond cleavage. Herein, we report an electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons via HFIP-mediated oxidation potential sorting (Fig. Notable features of this strategy include: (a) amination of both carbon fragments, dual C–N bond formation from a single C–C cleavage with 200% atom utilization, both resulting carbocationic fragments are efficiently captured via nucleophilic amination, maximizing molecular efficiency and avoiding wasteful byproducts; (b) oxidants free, with hydrogen evolution as the byproduct; (c) highly selective cleavage of benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds; (d) broad substrate scope, robustness, air tolerance, insensitivity to water, large-scale synthesis; and (e) highly valuable products were formed. Initially, butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) was selected as the model substrate, and various reaction conditions were tested under a constant voltage for the electro-oxidative amination of benzylic C–C bonds. After thorough optimization, the Ritter-type amination product 1 was obtained in 26% 1H NMR yield under constant voltage (2.4 V) in MeCN, using Et4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte, carbon cloth as the anode, and a Pt plate as the cathode (Table 1, entry 1). Several electrolytes were tested (entries 2 and 3), with LiClO4 and Et4NOTs yielding only trace amounts of product. We attribute this observation to the critical role played by the electrolyte anion in stabilizing key ionic intermediates and modulating the overall reaction environment. Control experiments revealed that the cell voltage played a critical role, as higher voltages (2.6 V and 2.8 V) resulted in lower yields due to overoxidation of the amide product (entries 4 and 5). The presence of an acid was essential for the transformation, as the yield improved to 33% and 53% with HOTf and MsOH, respectively (entries 6 and 7). This enhancement is likely due to the stabilizing effect of the strong acid on the benzylic cation intermediates. Notably, the yield increased to 79% when HFIP was added as an additive (entry 8), possibly due to its ability to prevent product overoxidation. For comparison, the use of other alcohol additives, such as TFE and EtOH, led to a significant decrease in yield (see Table S2). When the reaction time was shortened to 11 h, the yield further increased to 83%, with a total charge consumption of approximately 260 C (entry 9, Eanode = 1.8 V vs SCE, 4.36 mA.cm−2 current density). A control reaction conducted in the absence of electricity produced no product (entry 10), confirming that the transformation proceeds via electrochemical oxidation rather than aerobic oxidation. Regarding the electrode materials, several commonly used combinations were evaluated (entries 11–13). Stainless steel (SS) and nickel (Ni) as cathodes gave inferior results, with lower conversions and diminished selectivity, likely due to inefficient electron transfer and/or competing surface reactions. Among carbon-based anodes, carbon cloth consistently outperformed carbon felt (GF020), affording higher yields under otherwise identical conditions. The relatively poor performance of carbon felt may stem from its higher surface resistance and less uniform current distribution, which can impair reaction efficiency. In addition, conducting the reaction under constant current (10 mA, 6.6 mA/cm² current density) condition resulted in lower yields (entry 14), potentially due to uncontrolled fluctuations in electrode potential that promote undesired oxidative side processes. Finally, we demonstrated that MeCN could function as a reagent (40 equiv.) rather than the reaction solvent, although this modification led to a slight decrease in yield (entry 15). See Table S1 and Table S2 for further details on condition optimization. After establishing the optimized reaction conditions, we proceeded to investigate the scope and general applicability of the reaction, as illustrated in Fig. Initially, symmetric butane-2,3-diyldibenzene substrates were tested. Both butane-2,3-diyldibenzene and 4,4'-dihalogenated butane-2,3-diyldibenzene gave rise to the corresponding benzylacetamides (1–4) in good yields. A range of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene derivatives with various electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene rings were also found to be suitable, yielding the corresponding amination products in moderate yields (2–6, 12–17). Notably, the aldehyde functional group, despite its well-known sensitivity to oxidative conditions, was well tolerated under our electrochemical protocol (14), although a significant amount of starting material was recovered, likely due to its limited reactivity under the current conditions. When examining substrates designed to probe the competition between benzylic C–H and benzylic C–C bonds, we observed that the C–C amination products (7, 8, and 11) were preferentially formed, rather than the alternative benzylic methyl or ethyl-functionalized sites. However, the linear para-n-butyl substrate afforded product 10 in 29% yield, along with 9% competing C–H amination byproduct. Notably, no benzylic C–H amination products were observed at the same benzylic position in branched substrates where C–C bond amination occurred. This strongly supports our hypothesis that C–C cleavage is the kinetically and thermodynamically favored pathway at the benzylic position under the reaction conditions. The main reason for the moderate yields observed with electron-rich substrates is product overoxidation and decomposition. In addition, the competitive formation of ketone side products via C–C bond oxidation (for 9, 40% yield of ketone formed), promoted by trace amounts of water in the system, also contributes to the reduced efficiency (See Section 2.6 ‘Side product analysis' in the Supplementary Information.). We propose that for electron-rich substrates, the high reactivity facilitates rapid C–C bond cleavage, generating highly reactive radical or carbocation intermediates. While these intermediates can undergo competitive side reactions with trace amounts of water present in the system, resulting in the formation of ketone byproducts. For a substrate bearing more electron-donating methoxy groups S18 underwent selective amination to provide the corresponding products in 62% yields (18). The influence of alkyl chain length was also assessed, and all substrates proceeded smoothly under the standard conditions, producing the corresponding amination products in moderate to good yields (19 to 26). For asymmetric substrates with different substituents on the benzene ring or various alkyl groups, two distinct benzylic amination products were obtained (27–29, 31). Unfortunately, the thiophene-substituted amide (30) was not observed due to the degradation of the desired product, as well as substrates bearing a furan moiety (see Fig. S7), likely caused by the low oxidative potential of the thiophene and furan groups. Similarly, substrate 31 underwent smooth carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford the ketone 32 in 27% yield instead of C–C amination product, suggesting that the electron-rich nature of thiophene may render the intermediate species more susceptible to overoxidation. Finally, the average Faradaic efficiency under the optimized conditions is approximately 30%, calculated based on the total charge passed and the amount of product formed (see Fig. aReaction conditions: substrates (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.1 M), MeCN (3.0 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), carbon cloth anode, Pt plate cathode, rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.4 V), under air atmosphere. Isolated yields are calculated based on a theoretical maximum of 200% based on the fact that the starting material contains two equivalents. bEt4NBF4 (0.2 M), graphite felt anode. cGraphite felt anode. gMeSO3H (0.10 mL) for 10 h, an extra MeSO3H (0.10 mL) was added for another 5 h. h0.1 mmol scale. Unsuccessful examples are provided in the Supplementary Information. The total consumed charge and Faradaic efficiency for representative substrates were included in the Supplementary information. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, Me methyl, Et ethyl, Ac acetyl, tBu tert-butyl, nBu n-butyl, nPr n-propyl, nAm n-amyl. In addition to dibenzyl-substituted substrates, inert, unactivated substrates with bulky alkyl groups can also successfully yield two target products (Fig. Such bulky groups can decrease the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–C bond by stabilizing the formed fragments, thus exerting a thermodynamic and steric effect54,55,56. We examined a series of homobenzylic and neopentylic substrates featuring inert, unactivated aliphatic C(sp³)–C(sp³) bonds. For instance, α-methyl neopentylbenzene (compound 33) underwent efficient cleavage and amination, affording two products in moderate yields. Furthermore, various α-branched neopentylbenzenes (compounds 35–38) bearing chains of differing lengths were well tolerated, consistently affording cleaved and aminated products in moderate to good yields. Importantly, increasing steric bulk (e.g., products 1, 41) did not impede the reaction, suggesting that steric hindrance does not critically limit the method's applicability. Notably, the cleavage selectively occurred at the more hindered tertiary center (tert-butyl), while another benzylic C–C bond remained intact, highlighting the excellent regioselectivity of the transformation. In terms of functional group compatibility, our method tolerated a range of oxidatively sensitive groups, including primary alcohols (43), methyl ethers (45), alkyl chlorides (47), and bromides (49). These examples further support the mildness and chemoselectivity of the electrochemical conditions. Mildly electron-deficient alkylbenzenes underwent successful oxidation. Notably, neopentylbenzene bearing a para-tert-butyl substituent afforded the aminated product 34 in 61% yield. In contrast, product 9 was obtained in only a 22% yield, likely due to competing oxidative side reactions leading to ketone formation. aReaction conditions: substrates (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.1 M), MeCN (3.0 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), TFA (0.5 mL), graphite felt anode, Pt plate cathode, rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.2 V), under air atmosphere. bSubstrates (0.6 mmol). cConstant voltage (2.1 V). dCarbon cloth anode. eConstant voltage (2.4 V), carbon cloth anode, w/o TFA. gConstant voltage (2.4 V). The total consumed charge and Faradaic efficiency for representative substrates were included in the Supplementary Information. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, Me methyl, Et ethyl, Ac acetyl, tBu tert-butyl, nBu n-butyl, nPr n-propyl, nHex n-hexyl. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesized cycloheptylacetamide 52 and cyclooctylacetamide 54 (Fig. Due to the stability of the dibenzyl radical, the cleavage of such substrates demonstrates excellent regioselectivity. However, it is important to note that the low yield is attributed to the formation of benzophenone ( ~ 20% yield), likely due to trace amounts of water present during the reaction. For unbranched substrate 55, the benzylic C–H amination was the predominant pathway and only 8% C–C cleavage product was detected. Beyond simple hydrocarbons, substrates containing heteroatom substitutions were also tested under standard conditions. For instance, epoxy-containing substrate 58 underwent C–C bond cleavage to generate amide 1 and C–O bond cleaved product 59. It is well known that oxygen and nitrogen atom can initiate β–C–C bond cleavage (61–63) by through-bond delocalization and electron apportionment to the fragments (via cation and radical-stabilizing effects)16,17,18,19,20,21. Under standard reaction conditions, these substrates underwent β–C–C bond cleavage to form the corresponding amides, although the yield was lower for the unbranched substrate 64. We hypothesize that the cleavage of these substrates involves two contributions: (1) the formation of nitrogen or oxygen radicals via electrochemical oxidation, leading to β–C–C bond cleavage; and (2) β–C–C cleavage initiated by aryl cation radicals. For comparison, when using 1,2-diphenylethane 55 as a substrate, only an 8% yield was obtained, suggesting that the formation of oxygen radicals may be involved for the cleavage of primary (1°) alcohol substrates. Lastly, strained ring substrate 64 smoothly underwent ring-opening 1, 3-difunctionalization to yield β-amino ketones 65. Additionally, further investigation of various nitriles revealed a wide compatibility with Cl (66, 68), Br (67), Pr (69), and Ph (70) (Fig. Other suitable nitrogen nucleophiles included methanesulfonamide (71), ethanesulfonamide (72), oxazolidin-2-one (73), and carbamate (74). Of particular interest is the functionalization of the benzylic C–C bond with oxygen nucleophiles, including acetates (75–80). Notably, a strong electron-withdrawing group, nitro, proved compatible, affording products 78 in 34% yields. aReaction conditions: For 66–70 and 75–80: S1 (0.3 mmol), Et4NBF4 (0.2 M), corresponding nitrile solvent (3 mL) or acid solvent (3 mL), HFIP (1.0 mL), MeSO3H (0.1 mL), graphite felt (2 mm) anode, Pt cathode at rt, in an undivided cell with constant voltage (2.4 V), under air atmosphere. bReactions performed with 3.6 mmol nucleophile (71: MsNH2, 72: EtSO2NH2, 73: 2-oxazolidone, 74: urethane) in 3 mL DCM. c0.8 mL TFA was used. dGraphite felt (6.5 mm) was used as anode. e0.1 mmol of substrate. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, TFA trifluoroacetic acid, DCM dichloromethane, Ac acetyl, Ms methanesulfonyl, nPr n-propyl. The electrochemical C–C amination reaction was successfully carried out on a gram scale, as illustrated by the synthesis of 1 (Fig. 5), where larger electrodes were used over an extended reaction time. Note that DCM was added as a co-solvent to improve the solubility of the starting material thereby ensuring a homogeneous reaction mixture and maintaining efficient mass and electron transfer throughout the electrolysis process. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, DCM dichloromethane, Me methyl, Ac acetyl. Several mechanistic experiments were carried out to gain insight into the mechanism. Firstly, control experiments were performed to investigate the influence of water and oxygen in the air on the reaction. Under a strictly nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction yield remained stable at around 80%, while no significant promotional effect was observed under oxygen conditions, suggesting that the reaction likely does not involve dioxygen-induced C–C bond cleavage. Furthermore, the impact of varying the amount of water additive was carefully examined, with equivalents ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. The results showed little effect on the yield, indicating that the presence of water does not significantly promote the formation of the target product (Fig. Additionally, no benzylic alcohol intermediate was detected during the reaction. Besides, when the synthesized benzylic alcohol substrate 81 was subjected to the standard conditions, no product was formed. On the contrary, the substrate almost completely degraded under these conditions (Fig. These experiments suggest that benzylic tertiary (3°) alcohol is likely not a key intermediate in the reaction, despite numerous reports on C–C bond cleavage initiated by benzylic alcohol-derived oxygen radicals16,17,18,19,20,21. a Control reaction with S1. b Control reaction with benzylic alcohol. c Anode and cathode potential during the reaction. d Investigation of the role of HFIP. e Proposed mechanism. HFIP 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, Me methyl, Ac acetyl, Nu Nucleophile. Furthermore, the electrode voltage was continuously recorded throughout the electrolysis of the model reaction. Anodic oxidation was maintained at approximately 2.16 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. These results are consistent with the oxidative potential of substrates. Furthermore, cyclic voltammograms of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and it's aminated product (1) were recorded in MeCN (Fig. The results revealed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 2.30 V vs SCE) was oxidized at higher potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.15 V vs SCE), indicating that the aminated product exhibits a greater tendency for over-oxidation in MeCN. In contrast, cyclic voltammograms of S1 and 1 in a MeCN/HFIP (3/1) solvent mixture showed that butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (Ep/2 = 1.97 V vs SCE) was oxidized at a bit lower potential than product 1 (Ep/2 = 2.00 V vs SCE) (Fig. Although the oxidation potentials of butane-2,3-diyldibenzene (S1) and product (1) differ only slightly, they were effectively distinguished during the preparative electrolysis performed in MeCN/HFIP. The significance of HFIP lies in its ability to stabilize radical cation intermediates, facilitating substrate oxidation while preventing overoxidation of the product52. Based on these experiments, a plausible mechanism was proposed (Fig. During the anode phase, single-electron oxidation of the aromatic hydrocarbons A generates the radical cation B, which undergoes homolytic β–C–C bond cleavage to form a benzylic cation C and a radical species E at another position or heterolytic mode of cleavage to generate benzylic radical C′ and species E′, depending on the relative oxidation potentials of the two fragments formed23,57,58. For example, heterolytic cleavage to generate tBu cation is preferred due to the lower oxidation potential of tBu radical (Eox 1/2(tBu·) = 0.41 V vs SCE, Eox 1/2(MeCH2·Ph) = 0.82 V vs SCE, ΔΔG = −23.06 × (0.82–0.41) = −9.5 kcal/mol)59. The process may be reversible, and due to the small intrinsic barrier (0.1–0.2 eV), fragment diffusion from the solvent cage could be the rate-limiting step in endergonic cleavages60,61. The lower intrinsic barrier for C–C bond cleavage compared to deprotonation may account for the observation that C–C bond cleavage effectively competes with C–H bond cleavage. It is worth noting that the oxidation potentials of the generated benzyl and alkyl radical intermediates are typically below 1.0 V vs SCE57. As a result, under the present electrooxidation conditions (Eanode = 2.1 V vs Ag/AgCl), their lifetimes are extremely short, making them difficult to capture and prone to direct oxidation at the anode. Regardless of β–C–C bond cleavage model, above radical intermediates C′ and E undergoes a second, rapid oxidation event directly at the anode, resulting in the formation of final carbocations C and E′. Both carbocations subsequently proceed through the classic Ritter reaction steps to yield the amide product D and F. When nucleophiles such as sulfonamides, amides, or carboxylic acids were employed, the corresponding cross-coupling products were formed. Meanwhile, the redox reaction is balanced by cathodic proton reduction, leading to the production of hydrogen. Notably, due to the extensive use of bulky alkyl substituents and biaryl substrates in this work, in most cases, benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) cleavage competes effectively with C–H bond cleavage. Thus, the formation of benzyl tertiary (3°) alcohols or benzyl hydroperoxide species is unfavorable under these conditions. In summary, we have developed an electro-oxidative benzylic C(sp3)–C(sp3) amination reaction that operates under mild conditions with H2 evolution, eliminating the need for external oxidants or transition metal catalysts. This method is not only suitable for the efficient and scalable synthesis of benzylic amines but also demonstrates excellent compatibility with various nucleophiles, demonstrating significant potential for advancing sustainable C–C functionalization reactions using simple materials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In physics, there are two great pillars of thought that don't quite fit together. Meanwhile, Einstein's general relativity describes gravity and the fabric of spacetime. However, these frameworks are fundamentally incompatible in many ways, says Jonathan Heckman, a theoretical physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. The Standard Model treats forces as dynamic fields of particles, while general relativity treats gravity as the smooth geometry of spacetime, so gravity "doesn't fit into physics' Standard Model," he explains. In a recent paper, Heckman; Rebecca Hicks, a Ph.D. student at Penn's School of Arts & Sciences; and their collaborators turn that critique on its head. Their answer points to a single exotic particle that could show up at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For decades, physicists have sought a unified theory that can reconcile quantum mechanics,and, by extension, the behavior of subatomic particles, with gravity -- which is described as a dynamic force in general relativity but is not fully understood within quantum contexts, Heckman says. A good contender for marrying gravity and quantum phenomena is string theory, which posits that all particles, including a hypothetical one representing gravity, are tiny vibrating strings and which promises a single framework encompassing all forces and matter. "But one of the drawbacks of string theory is that it operates in high-dimensional math and a vast 'landscape' of possible universes, making it fiendishly difficult to test experimentally," Heckman says, pointing to how string theory necessitates more than the familiar four dimensions -- x, y, z, and time -- to be mathematically consistent. To make matters even trickier, string theory's distinctive behaviors only clearly reveal themselves at enormous energies, "those far beyond what we typically encounter or even generate in current colliders," Heckman says. "But when you crank the energy way up, you start seeing the interactions as they truly are -- strings vibrating and colliding," she explains. That's why physicists hunting for signatures of string theory must push their colliders -- like the LHC -- to ever-higher energies, hoping to catch glimpses of fundamental strings rather than just their lower-energy disguises as ordinary particles. Why serve string theory a particle it likely won't be able to return? Testing a theory often means searching for predictions that confirm its validity. Because string theory's predictions are vast and varied, the researchers instead asked if there's a simple particle scenario that string theory just can't accommodate. They zeroed in on how string theory deals with particle "families," groups of related particles bound together by the rules of the weak nuclear force, responsible for radioactive decay. String theory handles these modest particle families fairly well, without issue. Heckman likens this to trying to order a Whopper meal from McDonald's, "no matter how creatively you search the menu, it never materializes." The particle itself is called a Majorana fermion, meaning it acts as its own antiparticle, akin to a coin that has heads on both sides. Identifying such a particle would directly contradict what current string theory models predict is possible, making the detection of this specific particle family at the LHC a high-stakes test, one that could potentially snap string theory. Why a 5-plet hasn't been spotted and the vanishing-Track clue Hicks cites two major hurdles for spotting these 5-plet structures: "production and subtlety." "The heavier states decay into a soft pion and an invisible neutral particle, zero (X0)," Hicks says. "The pion is so low-energy it's basically invisible, and X0 passes straight through. The result is a track that vanishes mid-detector, like footprints in snow suddenly stopping." Those signature tracks get picked up by LHC's ATLAS (short for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), house-sized "digital cameras" wrapped around the collision center. They sit at opposite collision points and operate independently, giving the physics community two sets of eyes on every big discovery. Penn physicists like Hicks are part of the ATLAS Collaboration, helping perform the searches that look for quirky signals like disappearing tracks. "If the 5-plet weighs around 10 TeV -- about 10,000 proton masses -- it neatly fits theories about dark matter's formation after the Big Bang," Hicks says. "We'd have disproven key predictions of string theory and simultaneously uncovered new clues about dark matter." Using existing ATLAS data from collider runs, the team searched specifically for 5-plet signals. "We reinterpreted searches originally designed for 'charginos' -- hypothetical charged particles predicted by supersymmetry -- and looked for 5-plet signatures," Hicks says of the team's search through the repurposed ATLAS disappearing-track data. "We found no evidence yet, which means any 5-plet particle must weigh at least 650-700 GeV, five times heavier than the Higgs boson." For context, Heckman says, "this early result is already a strong statement; it means lighter 5-plets don't exist. But heavier ones are still very much on the table." Future searches with upgraded LHC experiments promise even sharper tests. "We're not rooting for string theory to fail," Hicks says. "If it snaps, we'll learn something profound about nature."
