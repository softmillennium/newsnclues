                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron has had her share of romantic relationships. Among the most famous were her relationships with Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins and actor Sean Penn. But these days, the mother of two is choosing to be single, she recently told Alex Cooper on podcast "Call Her Daddy." For her, building her family was about "being honest with who I am and what I can give right now," she said, adding that she realized she "was not somebody who should be having kids with another person." "There was a lot of alcoholism in my family," she said, "on both sides." And she grew up seeing the repercussions of that painful dynamic and wanted to avoid repeating what she saw at home. "I used to be someone in relationships that would lose herself," she said. Ultimately, it was about "being very honest with myself and understanding that I did not have the capability of being healthy in a relationship," she said. Sara Nasserzadeh, sexuality and relationship expert and author of "Love by Design: 6 Ingredients to Build a Lifetime of Love," lauds Theron's decision. "I hear a woman choosing alignment," she says. "She is not turning away from love, she is choosing not to recreate cycles that would compromise her ability to live and love truthfully." She also sees Theron's choice as one made by an awareness of her surroundings. Psychotherapist and author of "13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do" Amy Morin has seen many women make a similar choice. "Some were moms who didn't want to expose their children to their dating lives," she says, adding that, "others had done a lot of work on themselves but didn't want to practice their new relationship skills while the kids were around." Others, still, simply felt their lives were full. "Some have experienced backlash as others question if they're truly happy or make jokes that there must be something wrong with them," says Morin. "But choosing to stay single can certainly be a sign of strength, not weakness." Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 27 people have died after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in parts of central Texas on Friday. More than 25 children are also missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River, which Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said rose 26 feet in 45 minutes as torrential rain battered the region. The Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based along the river, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods. "We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it," the camp said in a statement posted to its website. "We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful." It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that "most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground." The National Weather Service said the Guadalupe River reached the second-highest height on record on Friday. The agency said it was also monitoring potential flooding around Lake Travis, and warned of "dangerous and life-threatening flooding and heavy rain" across multiple counties. Here are some images showing the impact of the flooding and ongoing search and rescue efforts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google searches for "how to reduce stress" are high, and 77% of U.S. adults report that the country's future is a major source of stress, according to a survey done by the American Psychological Association. So, it's no surprise that people are looking for ways to better manage their stress. The drink often seen prepared in a wine glass, is actually alcohol-free and combines these ingredients: Social media users, especially on TikTok, post videos of themselves making the beverage at home. Cortisol is a stress hormone in the body that maintains blood pressure and electrolytes, says Dr. Marilyn Tan, endocrinologist and clinical associate professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. Cortisol rises during times of emotional or physical stress. And levels of cortisol are highest early in the morning, right after people wake up, and wane throughout the day, which makes them pretty difficult to track. We almost actually never do that because it's something that's actually hard to track," says Dr. Jessica R. Lee, assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "It's more about managing stress and other things that we think can contribute to the cortisol changes." Only when someone has consistent and severely high levels of cortisol, or Cushing's Syndrome, would doctors recommend medication for lowering levels of the hormone, Tan says. "I'm not aware of any studies that looked at the effects of these individual ingredients on cortisol levels," Tan says. And Lee agrees: "There's not great studies out about any of this." "It's quick, easy, viral clicks, is my guess," Lee says. "I think a lot of people do notice feeling better, but there's a number of reasons why they feel better." One reason may be that the combination of ingredients in the cortisol cocktail can make you feel more hydrated, which most people could benefit from, Tan says. "There aren't any large randomized, controlled trials on the effects of magnesium and sleep quality or stress levels, per se. But if it helps people sleep better, that can also help with overall well-being and health." "None of [the ingredients], separately, are actually known to reduce stress, except maybe magnesium," Lee says. While the cortisol cocktail is harmless for most and can be great for hydration, both experts caution people with certain conditions to avoid drinking it, and advise that you speak with your doctor before you do. The magnesium and potassium intake can be harmful for people with chronic kidney disease, and the sugar can be troublesome for people who have diabetes. If you've been feeling stressed often, Tan and Lee have suggestions for improving your mental health. "Once somebody figures out what works for them, it's important to try to keep it up as a part of your overall wellness routine," Tan says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mo Gawdat's son, Ali, was 21 years old when he died due to medical negligence during a routine appendix surgery in 2014. Gawdat was devastated, confused and in a palpable state of shock. Then, 17 days later, he started writing a book on how to be happy, in his son's honor. Gawdat has researched the science of happiness for over 20 years from a logical and philosophical prospective, using flow charts and formulas to get to the root of unhappiness. When something angering or nerve-wracking happens in your life, give yourself a minute and 30 seconds to feel upset. The habit is based on insight Gawdat learned from Harvard-trained neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, who found that it takes only 90 seconds for stress and anger hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline, to be flushed out of the body. "But then what happens is, you run the thought in your head again, and you renew your 90 seconds," said Gawdat, who served as chief business officer at Google X, the company's innovation lab, from 2015 to 2018. While in reality, what you get after those 90 seconds is a buffer ... [which] allows you to say, 'Now, what am I going to do?'" Getting cut off while driving, for example, can be really agitating. You might yell or curse from behind the wheel, or even roll your window down to give the other driver a piece of your mind. So, what if you took a deep breath, turned your favorite song on, and sang along instead? To recover more quickly from life's upsets, Gawdat asks himself three questions, he said: "Ninety percent of the things that make us unhappy are not even true. Like your [partner] says something hurtful ... your brain is telling you [they] don't love you anymore," said Gawdat "That isn't true." If it's "yes," move on to question No. If not, go into "committed acceptance" – meaning, acknowledge what's happened and accept it as your new normal. Building new habits can be difficult, especially when you're feeling emotional. In a 2009 study, psychology researcher Phillippa Lally found that it can take anywhere between 18 to 254 days to form a habit, depending on the person and their circumstances. But being cognizant of how you respond to tough moments in life is the first step to being happier and more fulfilled, says Gawdat. "It's your choice, how you react to every one of them ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On what should have been a festive Fourth of July, disaster struck in Central Texas. Extreme flooding left at least 27 dead in Kerr County, and as many as 25 children are missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River. On Truth Social, Trump said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem would arrive in Texas "shortly." "Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy," Trump wrote on Saturday. "Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a press conference on Saturday morning that there were 27 confirmed fatalities in Kerr County after torrential rains early Friday morning, but that he expected that numbers to rise. As much as 12 inches of rain fell in the county on Friday, with additional rainfall anticipated this evening, officials said. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 4 a.m. As rain continues to fall, a desperate search is underway for those who may have been swept away by the floodwaters. Officials said Saturday during a press conference that there were more than two dozen people still missing, at least. Camp Mystic, located in Hunt, Texas, has about 750 campers. At least 25 girls remained unaccounted for on Saturday, officials said. Dan Patrick said at an earlier press conference Friday afternoon. We're praying for all those missing to be found alive." "We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful." It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that "most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground." During the Friday night news conference, which was live-streamed on Facebook, Texas Gov. "It needs God, but also needs a robust response by the state and local governments, and by people who live in these communities impacted," he said. "We had a meeting with officials at the state and local level, and there is extraordinary collaboration to make sure that we are going to address everybody's concern as quickly as we possibly can." Camp Mystic welcomes girls once they've completed second grade. In the Guadalupe River camp group, girls can enroll in one of three sessions, each lasting either two or four weeks. On Facebook, parents and community members have circulated flyers with contact numbers, urging the public to help locate the missing children. Her mother told WFAA News on Friday evening that she was traveling to reach the camp. Kerr County has an estimated population of about 53,900, according to a 2024 counting by the US Census Bureau.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As some consumers pull back on spending amid economic uncertainty, fast-casual restaurant chains are leaning on rewards programs to pull them back in. Loyalty programs, which offer discounts or added perks for returning customers, have transitioned from being a nice bonus for restaurants to a must-have. As cost-cautious diners prioritize value, brands like Chipotle, Starbucks, Cava and others are utilizing rewards to keep customers coming back and building habits that go beyond the occasional coupon. "In tough times, loyalty programs become more essential," said Peter Fader, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They become a required ingredient to building and maintaining relationships." Only 43% of restaurant brands tracked by Black Box reported same-store sales growth in May. Consumers who join loyalty programs visit restaurants more frequently, making 22% more visits per year to eateries, according to Circana data. Coffee giant Starbucks reported 34.2 million active rewards members in its second quarter and said more than 59% of its U.S. company-owned transactions came from those members. Potbelly has seen similar success: In the first quarter of 2025, over 42% of its total shop sales came from digital business, which includes the loyalty program users. It's loyalty program makes up approximately 30% of sales on average each day and helped the burrito chain to avoid major price hikes, according to the company. "We have really strong brand loyalty among our members," Nicole West, Chipotle's vice president of digital experiences, told CNBC. Driving loyalty is critical for the likes of Chipotle and Starbucks. In the first quarter, Chipotle posted a same-store sales decline for the first time since 2020 and said it saw a "slowdown" in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Starbucks' same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters. Cava is bucking industry trends with strong sales growth, but faces Wall Street pressure to maintain its rapid expansion. As rewards programs pick up steam, more brands are getting creative and moving beyond the value meal. Members can earn points each visit and redeem them for specific items like pita chips or full entrees. The program also includes limited-time offers and in-app challenges. In late March, the company celebrated National Pita Day by rolling out a mascot named "Peter Chip" and offering members complimentary pita chips. "Guests like to see periodic surprises and delight moments where we can reward them with pita chips or other brand offerings," Andrew Rebhun, Cava's chief marketing officer, said The Cava Rewards program now has more than 7 million members. Chipotle this year launched a seasonal campaign called "Summer of Extras." The campaign is giving away over $1 million in free burritos, encouraging customers to rack up visits and compete to become the top Chipotle visitor in their state. "We continue to see activations in this program build and excitement and positive reaction across social media from our fans," West said. Salad chain Sweetgreen also retooled its loyalty program this spring, moving away from its tiered subscription program that many consumers found confusing. "In a challenging industry environment where consumers are making more intentional choices with every dollar, SG Rewards is designed to meet the moment by delivering a meaningful value," Sweetgreen co-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said on the company's quarterly conference call in May. Even Starbucks, an established leader in rewards programs, has made changes. Restaurant chains hope those freebies drive longer-term loyalty and spending on full-price items. Potbelly revamped its loyalty system in early 2024, moving to a coin-based structure that allows customers to redeem rewards faster and across more items. Customers now have access to over 14 menu items through the rewards program. This flexibility has led to more frequent visits, Potbelly's chief marketing officer, David Daniels, said. "We saw a lift almost immediately in terms of engagement," Daniels said. It tracks how often a customer visits and awards badges as they go. "It gives flexibility to change how the program is deployed," Garrett Kern, Portillo's vice president of strategy and culinary, said to CNBC. "It doesn't require a redesign and relaunch to an application. — CNBC's Amelia Lucas and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.

The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout. 

But here, in the boomtown of Buckeye, less than an hour away from Phoenix, the 214-acre lot sits empty. Work on the site had started, said Shelby Lizarraga, who manages the gas station next door, “but then it went all quiet.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tech industry is reeling after a software engineer was exposed as working at several Silicon Valley startups at the same time — and experts say it's a lesson on hustle culture gone too far. Soham Parekh, a software engineer from Mumbai, went viral on social media after being accused by Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi on X of working at a number of startups simultaneously. He's been preying on YC [Y Combinator] companies and more. I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. The post racked up 25,000 likes with more founders coming forward about hiring Parekh, including AI startup Lindy, which fired him after seeing Doshi's post. Doshi confirmed to CNBC Make It via email that Parekh worked at the company. "We realized he was working multiple jobs shortly after he joined, based on constant large fluctuations in his availability and the quality of his output. He also attended an off-site, where it became pretty clear," Doshi said. Soham Parekh did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for an interview. "We realized pretty quickly that he was working at multiple companies and let him go," Parkhurst said on X. Other founders like Haz Hubble, the co-founder of social media scheduler Pally, also came forward about offering Parekh a founding engineer role. "Around one week ago we offered him a role as founding engineer, with a total package worth $250k per year, but withdrew after he wouldn't live with us in San Francisco — now we know why!" "To me it seems he must be addicted to the game of getting job offers, rather than actually making money, given he never lasts more than a few weeks and rarely gets paid. Lindy and Antimetal did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. "No one really likes to work 140 hours a week, but I had to do this out of necessity," Parekh said in the show. The tech community on social media is divided, however, with some questioning the ethics of secretly working multiple jobs, while others wonder how Parekh pulled it off. The tale of Parekh is not unique within the tech industry, with many tech workers covertly working multiple jobs in recent years in an effort to shield themselves from mass layoffs and job market uncertainty. A subreddit called "r/overemployed" was created in 2021, with users sharing advice on how they manage to balance multiple jobs without being detected. "During the peak of Covid, there was this rush from tech companies to fire talent, and there was this intense competition for talent," Alexandru Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at AI company Synthesia, told CNBC Make It in an interview. Voica noted that the rise of remote work was instrumental in enabling this behavior amongst tech workers. "That led to obviously incredible benefits for hard-working people, but also allowed people who have maybe this type of attitude to, all of a sudden, get jobs that they wouldn't have before." Having at least two jobs is also common within India's IT sector. There was a 25-30% increase in moonlighting seen between 2020 and 2023, according to Randstad India, with workers citing factors such as low pay and remote work. While Parekh's grueling work hours are unusual — even in tech — it's a reminder of how deeply hustle culture is entrenched within the industry. "Silicon Valley's obsession with productivity metrics and fast hiring has created conditions where a person can juggle five roles — and not because it's efficient, but because no one is truly looking," Dmitry Zaytsev, founder of talent management company Dandelion Civilization, said to CNBC Make It. Zaytsev explained that Parekh essentially passed multiple rounds of technical interviews because soft skills aren't as valued in tech. Qualities like commitment, reliability and team presence "are often overlooked until there's a crisis," he said. It comes as European tech startups face pressure from some VCs to adopt a more rigorous work schedule — such as China's "996" or Silicon Valley's 24/7, always-on culture — to better compete on a global tech stage. This has been met with backlash, with founders telling CNBC Make It that overwork can lead to a crisis of productivity, burnout, and even resentment. Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, said this debate came about due to "a fetishization of overwork" and a glorification of hustle culture in the tech and startup scene in Silicon Valley. Synthesia's Voica warned that workers who take advantage of flexible working policies risk painting other engineers in a bad light, and could have these benefits taken away. "Most of the engineers that I know are very hard working, very dedicated, very passionate, and then when you have this type of more cavalier behavior, it sets this tone that this is normal behavior in the community," Voica explained. This might cause employers to second-guess whether they should keep hybrid working policies in place, he said. It's going to impact people with disabilities [and] the more vulnerable, who actually benefited from this [flexible] work arrangement, and now they're going to be impacted by this type of behavior," he added.

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas parents frantically posted photos of their young daughters on social media with pleas for information as at least 23 campers from an all-girls summer camp were unaccounted for Friday after floods tore through the state's south-central region overnight.

At least 24 people were dead and many missing after a storm unleashed nearly a foot of rain just before dawn Friday and sent floodwaters gushing out of the Guadalupe River, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha told reporters Friday evening. The flood-prone region known as Hill Country is dotted with century-old summer camps that draw thousands of kids annually from across the Lone Star State.</p>
